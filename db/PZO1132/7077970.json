    "text": "This protective ward is fashioned from a thin, supple piece of wood bound in a circle, and then woven with sinew to create a weblike pattern. Dreamcatchers are often decorated with beads and feathers. More elaborate dreamcatchers might be made of gold or silver instead, and decorated with dangling jewels and metal figurines.\nA dreamcatcher protects its sleeping owner from malicious influences. The owner gains a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws while asleep. Further, any ability damage or ability drain he takes during this time is reduced by 1 point (to a minimum of 0 points)."
