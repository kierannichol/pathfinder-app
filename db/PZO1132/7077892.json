    "text": "This telescopic horn is constructed of thin sheets of tin rolled into concentric cones, and measures about 3 feet long when fully extended. Primarily used by fraudulent mediums to disguise the true source of mysterious voices in darkened seance chambers, these trumpets add 1 to the DCs of saving throws to disbelieve the effects of the ghost sound and ventriloquism spells. When used to channel a haunt capable of communication (see page 230), a spirit trumpet doubles the rate of communication with the haunt, and grants the user a +4 circumstance bonus on Linguistics checks to decipher the cryptic messages."
