If the target is a medium with a spirit inhabiting its body or a spiritualist with a phantom inhabiting its consciousness (or a member of another class using the spirit or phantom class features), a failed save renders that spirit or phantom powerless, suppressing any benefits the spirit or phantom normally provides to its host, including bonus feats and spells known."
