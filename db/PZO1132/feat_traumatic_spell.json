When a creature fails a saving throw against a traumatic spell, the next time it sleeps it must succeed at a Will save with a DC equal to the original spell\u0027s DC or be affected as if by nightmare. Each time the target fails its save, it must save again the following night or be affected by another nightmare, though the save DC decreases by 2 each night after the first."
