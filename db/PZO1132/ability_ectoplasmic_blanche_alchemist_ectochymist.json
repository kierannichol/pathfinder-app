    "text": "An ectochymist can alchemically treat a melee weapon so that it deals full damage to incorporeal creatures. The process requires a full-round action and lasts until the next time that weapon is used to make an attack. An ectochymist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier."
