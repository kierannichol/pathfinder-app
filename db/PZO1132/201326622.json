    "text": "Made from elaborately carved wood in the shape of a mythical creature, this mask covers the face of its wearer, leaving only two holes for eyes. A mesmerist wearing this mask increases the range of his hypnotic stare ability by 10 feet as the mask allows him to better focus on his targets. Creatures under the effects of the wearer\u0027s hypnotic stare take a â€“2 penalty on all attack rolls against the wearer.\nOnce per day, if the wearer possesses the mesmerist trick class feature, he can implant a trick without expending a use of his mesmerist trick ability. This trick also does not count against his limit of total tricks active at the same time."
