    "text": "A mindblade casts spells from the magus spell list as psychic spells. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mindblade must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell\u0027s level. The saving throw DC to resist a mindblade\u0027s spell is equal to 10 + the spell\u0027s level + the mindblade\u0027s Intelligence modifier.\nLike other spellcasters, a mindblade can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. She knows the same number of spells and receives the same number of spells slots per day as a bard of her magus level, and knows and uses 0-level knacks as a bard uses cantrips. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1â€“3 on page 17 of the Core Rulebook).\nAt 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mindblade can learn a new spell in place of one she already knows, using the same rules as a bard. In effect, the mindblade loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell\u0027s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and the new spell must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the mindblade can cast.\nA mindblade need not prepare her spells in advance.\nShe can cast any magus spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell\u0027s level."
