    "text": "This item looks like and functions as a lucky horseshoe. In addition, if the horseshoe is placed prominently over the entrance of a building and left there for a period of at least 8 hours, it provides good luck to all those who spend time within that building. In order to gain this benefit, a character must spend at least 8 consecutive hours within the building; the benefit lasts for 24 hours. A single communal lucky horseshoe can provide its benefit to any number of creatures per day, but each creature can gain the benefits of only one lucky horseshoe at a time. Once a creature invokes the lucky horseshoe\u0027s ability, she can\u0027t benefit from another lucky horseshoe for 24 hours, though time she spends inside the building during that interval counts toward the 8 consecutive hours required to gain the communal lucky horseshoe\u0027s benefit for the next day."
