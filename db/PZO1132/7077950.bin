ŒIts origin lost in the infinite expanse of time, a primordial symbol is a polished stone bearing a mystic sign that resembles a lopsided, twobarred cross. When held forth and invoked by a bearer who is able to cast psychic spells or has the Psychic Sensitivity feat, a primordial symbol flares with an invisible flash in a 100-foot-radius burst, which has the following effects on those in range.é
DestructionÙThough seemingly destroyed by activation, the eldritch potential bound into a primordial symbol persists and recreates the symbol elsewhere in the multiverse. To permanently destroy the artifact, the primordial symbol must be brought to a realm of pure chaos at the unformed edges of the Outer Planes and melted in the primal energy of creation.
