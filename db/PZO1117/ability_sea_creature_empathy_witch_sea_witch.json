The sea witch uses her witch level as her druid level for this ability. If the sea witch has wild empathy from another class, her witch levels stack with the other class\u0027s levels to determine her wild empathy bonus for these kinds of creatures.\nThis ability replaces the witch\u0027s 1st-level hex.\nHexes: The following witch hexes complement the sea witch archetype: charm, flight, water lung.\nMajor Hexes: The following major hexes complement the sea witch archetype: hag eye, hidden home, weather control."
