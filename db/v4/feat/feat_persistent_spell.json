      "Benefit": "Whenever a creature targeted by a persistent spell or within its area succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, it must make another saving throw against the effect. If a creature fails this second saving throw, it suffers the full effects of the spell, as if it had failed its first saving throw. A persistent spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell\u0027s actual level. Spells that do not require a saving throw to resist or lessen the spell\u0027s effect do not benefit from this feat."
