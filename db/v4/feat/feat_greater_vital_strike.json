      "Benefit": "When you use the attack action, you can make one attack at your highest base attack bonus that deals additional damage. Roll the weapon\u0027s damage dice for the attack four times and add the results together before adding bonuses from Strength, weapon abilities (such as flaming), precision-based damage (such as sneak attack), and other damage bonuses. These extra weapon damage dice are not multiplied on a critical hit, but are added to the total."
