.You are ferocious at hewing smaller opponents.Û
BenefitÏWhen using Cleave or Great Cleave, if your initial attack hits, you may take a single 5-foot step as a free action before making your additional attacks. If doing so places a creature within your threatened area, that creature becomes a legal target for your additional Cleave attack(s) as long as it meets all the other prerequisites.|
NormalrYou may only make additional attacks with Cleave against creatures you threaten when you make your initial attack.ª
