Your thorough understanding of acoustics in artificial surroundings allows you to improve the power of your bardic performance.ó
BenefitçWhile inside an artif icial structure, you can spend a free action to make a DC 15 Knowledge (engineering) check when you begin your bardic performance. Success on this check allows you to do one of the following. Self-Harmonize: By performing over the acoustic reverberations of your performance, you increase the DC of your bardic performance effects +1. Reverberation: You can choose to have the effect of your current bardic performance continue for 1 round after you cease maintaining it, regardless of why you cease maintaining it. You can still have no more than one bardic performance in effect at one time.E
Normal;A bardic performance lasts only as long as you maintain it.ª
