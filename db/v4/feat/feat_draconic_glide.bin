@You possess draconic defenses and wings that allow you to glide.…
BenefitùYou gain a +2 bonus against sleep and paralysis effects. You grow a pair of wings that you can use to fall and glide at a safe pace. You can make a DC 15 Fly check to fall safely from any height without taking falling damage, as if using feather fall. When falling safely, you may make an additional DC 15 Fly check to glide, moving 5 feet laterally for every 20 feet you fall.|
SpecialqIf you have the gliding wings racial trait, instead of the above abilities, your base speed increases to 30 feet.ª
