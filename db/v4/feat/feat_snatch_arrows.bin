TInstead of knocking an arrow or ranged attack aside, you can catch it in mid-flight.Ì
BenefitÀWhen using the Def lect Arrows feat you may choose to catch the weapon instead of just def lecting it. Thrown weapons can immediately be thrown back as an attack against the original attacker (even though it isn't your turn) or kept for later use. You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat.ª
