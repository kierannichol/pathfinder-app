      "Benefit": "The frost of your cold spell clings to the target, impeding it for a short time. A rime spell causes creatures that takes cold damage from the spell to become entangled for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. This feat only affects spells with the cold descriptor. A rime spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell\u0027s actual level."
