      "Benefit": "Once per day, when confronted with a situation that calls for a particular mundane item of equipment, you may make a Sleight of Hand check with a DC of 10 plus the item\u0027s cost in gold pieces to \"happen\" to have such an item on your person. For example, having a crowbar would be DC 12, whereas a flask of acid would be DC 20. The item must be something you can easily carry-if you are on foot and have only a backpack, for example, you could not have a large iron cauldron. You cannot have magical items using this feat, nor can you have specif ic items, such as the key to a particular door. If you are stripped of your equipment or possessions, you lose the benef its of this feat until you have at least a day to resupply and \"acquire\" new items. You must pay for these items normally.",
      "Special": "At the GM\u0027s option, a character can substitute the Survival skill for Sleight of Hand with this feat. Such a choice is permanent."
