      "Benefit": "Choose one of the creature\u0027s spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions below. The creature can use that ability as an empowered spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). When a creature uses an empowered spell-like ability, all variable, numeric effects of the spell-like ability are increased by half (+50%). Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected. Spell-like abilities without random variables are not affected. The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 its caster level (round down) - 2. For a summary, see the table in the description of the Quicken Spell-Like Ability feat on page 316.",
      "Special": "This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different spell-like ability."
