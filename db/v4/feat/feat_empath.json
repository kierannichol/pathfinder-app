      "Benefit": "You can use either Perception or Sense Motive when reading an emotion aura with the read aura occult skill unlock. Reading a creature\u0027s emotion aura takes you only a full-round action instead of 10 minutes, and if you succeed at your check, you also determine whether that creature is currently affected by a fear or mind-affecting effect and the relative strength of that effect (minor, moderate, strong, as defined in detect magic). You don\u0027t learn the source of the effect or the actual effect."
