œYour knowledge of the secrets of the burning wind and blazing sun allows you to collect flames into your hands and unleash them in a gout of elemental fire.Ì
BenefitÀWhile using Efreeti Style, as a standard action, you can spend two Elemental Fist (Advanced Player's Guide 158) attempts to unleash a 15-foot coneshaped burst of flame. Creatures caught in the cone take your unarmed strike damage plus the fire damage from your Elemental Fist and catch on fire. A successful Ref lex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modif ier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from catching on fire.ª
