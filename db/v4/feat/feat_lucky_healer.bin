QYour luck allows you to draw from magical healing far more efficiently than most.ö
BenefitêWhen a magical healing effect (such as a spell with â€œcure" in the title or channel energy) cures you, you can spend one use of your adaptable luck racial trait to reroll the amount of damage cured. You regain a number of hit points equal to the new roll or the original roll, whichever is greater. Other creatures healed by the effect do not gain this benefit.ª
