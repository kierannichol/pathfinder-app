QYour luck allows you to draw from magical healing far more efficiently than most.Ý
BenefitÑSpend a use of your adaptive luck racial trait to reroll the damage healed from a single magical healing effect (such as a spell with "cure" in the title or channel energy). You regain a number of hit points equal to the new roll or the original roll, whichever is greater. Other creatures healed by the effect do not gain this benef it.ª
