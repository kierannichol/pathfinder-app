Creatures caught in the line take your unarmed strike damage plus the cold damage from your Elemental Fist attack and are entangled in ice as per the Marid Spirit feat. A successful Ref lex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from becoming entangled."
