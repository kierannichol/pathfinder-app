¨You know the principles of arcane dueling, and when fighting other spellcasters, you have learned to hide the true nature of your spells until the last possible moment.ð
BenefitäIf another spellcaster tries to counterspell your casting, she adds +4 to her Spellcraft DC when trying to determine your spell. Because you have studied how to mask the recognizable elements of your spellcasting, you gain a +2 bonus on your Spellcraft checks to identify and counter an opponent's spell if it is a spell you know or have in your spellbook.ª
