This bloodline cannot be a bloodline you already have. You gain the first-level bloodline power for the selected bloodline. For purposes of using that power, treat your sorcerer level as equal to your character level - 2, even if you have levels in sorcerer. You do not gain any of the other bloodline abilities."
