      "Benefit": "Once per day as a standard action, you may attempt a new saving throw against a harmful condition requiring a Will save that is affecting you. If you are dominated, controlled, or cannot take an action because of the effect against which you are trying to make a new saving throw, you can make this saving throw at the start of the turn as no action, but on a success, your turn ends. You cannot use this feat to remove instantaneous effects, effects that do not require a Will save, or effects that do not allow a saving throw."
