0You learn how to create one kind of ranger trap. 
Benefit”Select one ranger trap (see page 64). You may use this trap a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom bonus (minimum 1). The DC for your trap is equal to 10 + 1/2 your character's level + your Wisdom bonus, and it lasts 1 day per two character levels. If you are not a ranger, you can only set extraordinary traps with this feat; like all extraordinary ranger traps, this decreases the trap DC by 2.«
