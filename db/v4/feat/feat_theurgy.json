When casting a divine spell, you may sacrifice an arcane spell slot or arcane prepared spell of that spell\u0027s level or higher as a swift action. The caster level for that divine spell increases by +1. When casting an arcane spell, you may sacrifice a divine spell slot or prepared divine spell of the same or higher level as a swift action. Half the damage dealt by the arcane spell becomes holy (if you channel positive energy) or unholy (if you channel negative energy)."
