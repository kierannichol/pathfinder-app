ÛAt 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.ª0
