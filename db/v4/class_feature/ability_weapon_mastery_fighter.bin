¿At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (Ã—2 becomes Ã—3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.ª%
