    "text": "A bloodrager\u0027s land speed is faster than is normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the bloodrager\u0027s speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the bloodrager\u0027s land speed."
