    "text": "A barbarian\u0027s base speed is faster than the norm for her race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian\u0027s speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian\u0027s base speed."
