çThe barbarian can make an attack of opportunity against a creature within her reach who damages an ally of the barbarian with a melee attack. Only the enemy, not the barbarianâ€™s ally, needs to be within the barbarianâ€™s melee reach in order for the barbarian to make this attack of opportunity. Once the barbarian makes an attack of opportunity against a creature with this ability, she canâ€™t use this ability to make an attack of opportunity against the same creature for 24 hours.ª
