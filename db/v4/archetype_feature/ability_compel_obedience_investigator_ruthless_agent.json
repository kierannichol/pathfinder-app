    "text": "At 11th level, a ruthless agent can issue a binding command to a creature as a full-round action once per day. This command acts like geas/quest with the creature as the target, using the ruthless agent\u0027s investigator level as the caster level. The ruthless agent can compel obedience from only one creature at a time (as soon as the geas/quest is fulfilled, however, the ruthless agent can use this ability again, as long as she has a use of this ability available).\nAt 17th level, the ruthless agent can compel obedience from two creatures at once, and she is always aware of the targets as if they were under the effects of a status spell (caster level \u003d the ruthless agent\u0027s investigator level)."
