¤	A tree soul oracle must take the following revelations at the listed levels.
Transform Wood (Su) At 1st level, as a standard action you can temporarily transform a number of 5-foot cubes of wood each day equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. The wood takes on the quality of darkwood for 1 minute per oracle level. At 11th level, you can have it instead take on the quality of living steel for the same duration. Living Steel Dolls (Ex) At 11th level, you add animate objects to your list of spells known. When you cast this spell on wooden objects, the objects' wooden parts immediately transform into living steel. If the objects are destroyed or the duration ends, the wooden parts revert back to their original material. Tree Soul Revelation (Su) At 20th level, your skin takes on the appearance and properties of a tree trunk. This bark-like skin grants you a +4 natural armor bonus to your Armor Class and DR 10/slashing. You also regrow any severed limbs except your head within 24 hours as per regenerate. Finally, once a day as a standard action, you can assume the form of a treant, as per plant shape III, for a number of minutes equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).ª+
