·At 3rd level, a Tekritanin arbiter learns to speak one language with the skill of a native speaker. He chooses one language he knows and gains a +1 bonus on Disguise checks to appear as an individual native to any region where the language is primarily spoken. In addition, he gains a +1 bonus on both Diplomacy checks to change initial attitudes and Sense Motive checks to detect falsehoods when dealing with individuals with the selected language as their native language. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 and the Tekritanin arbiter can select one additional language that his bonuses apply to, up to a maximum of +6 each for six languages at 18th level.ª=
