…At 10th level, a master of disguise gains the master of disguise advanced rogue talent and can use it an unlimited number of times per day. Because she must still don a physical disguise to gain this bonus, it doesn't stack with the bonuses from spells like alter self and disguise self, but since it is completely non-magical, it is more reliable when scrutinized under magical detection.ª?
