    "text": "At 20th level, as a standard action, a crystal tender can transform her body into a living gemstone as per iron body with a duration of 12 hours. Instead of being vulnerable to effects that can harm an iron golem while in this form, she is vulnerable to effects that can harm a crystalline creature (such as shatter). She can use this ability once per day."
