    "text": "At 3rd level, an esquire acquires the services of a loyal aide-de-camp. This NPC functions similarly to a cohort, though the aide-de-camp must advance in a class that grants proficiency with all martial weapons and cannot multiclass until the esquire reaches 7th level (though the aide-de-camp can select an archetype).\nIf the aide-de-camp is a cavalier, he must follow the same order as the esquire.\nThe aide-de-camp gains Swift Aid as a bonus feat, and provides a +2 (rather than +1) bonus when using this feat to aid the esquire. As a move action, the aide-de-camp can retrieve a stored item or an item on the ground and hand it to the esquire. The esquire does not have to take an action to receive the item, though he must be conscious and have a free hand. This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity for the aide-de-camp or esquire.\nIf the aide-de-camp dies performing an act that directly supports the edicts of the esquire\u0027s order (GM\u0027s discretion), the esquire does not take a penalty to his Leadership score. If an aide-de-camp dies, or is released from the esquire\u0027s service, the esquire may gain a new aide-de-camp by scouting for potential candidates in a city or large town. This requires 1 day per 5 levels of the aide-de-camp to be recruited."
