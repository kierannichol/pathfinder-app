    "text": "At 1st level, a ley line guardian is adept at channeling energy from ley lines to enhance her own spells. As a swift action, she can increase her effective caster level for the next spell she casts in that round by 1d4â€“1 levels. After performing a conduit surge, the ley line guardian must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC \u003d 10 + level of spell cast + number of additional caster levels granted) or become staggered for a number of minutes equal to the level of the spell cast. At 8th level, the caster level increase becomes 1d4. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier."
