àAt 4th level, a gingerbread witch learns a unique hex that lets her create a piece of candy or a similar sweet as a full-round action. If eaten by the witch or a single creature she designates when she creates it, the sweet functions as goodberry or a polypurpose panacea (as determined at creation).
Anyone else that eats the sweet becomes nauseated (Fort negates); a creature nauseated by the sweet can attempt a new saving throw each round at the end of its turn to end this effect.
A creature that fails its initial save is also affected as per the scar hex for a number of days equal to the witch's witch level, except that at extended range, the witch can use only harmful hexes on the creature.
She can create a number of sweets each day equal to her Intelligence modifier + her level. These sweets retain their potency for 24 hours and then turn to crumbs.ª8
