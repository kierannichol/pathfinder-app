    "text": "At 5th level, a mad dog\u0027s war beast gains Improved Drag as a bonus feat. As a swift action, a mad dog can command her war beast to move toward an opponent within 30 feet and attempt a drag combat maneuver to pull the target back toward the mad dog. The war beast can move before and after performing the maneuver, but this movement counts toward the war beast\u0027s total movement during its turn."
