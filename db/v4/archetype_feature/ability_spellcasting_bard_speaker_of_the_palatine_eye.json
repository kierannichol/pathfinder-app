    "text": "A speaker of the Palatine Eye draws his powers from the mysterious rites of the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye. He casts psychic spells from the mesmerist list instead of arcane spells from the bard spell list. He otherwise casts spells, learns spells, and determines his spell allotment and spell DCs as a bard."
