Cinderwalkarchetype_featureclass_feature¢Ê
ÇAt 7th level, a cinderwalker can move through any sort of solid volcanic terrain (such as ash, cooled lava, or volcanic rock) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.
The cinderwalker ignores fire damage from being near heat sources and touching heated surfaces (but not from immersion).ª-
