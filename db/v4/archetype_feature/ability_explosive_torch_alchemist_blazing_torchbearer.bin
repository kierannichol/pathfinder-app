ÌAt 4th level, as a standard action, a blazing torchbearer can drop a special blend of explosive powders onto his torch before using it as a weapon. His next successful melee attack with the torch deals an additional 2d6 points of fire damage and sets the target on fire. This attack must be made within 1d4 rounds or the torch prematurely explodes at the end of the blazing torchbearer's turn, dealing damage to the blazing torchbearer and setting him on fire.ª<
