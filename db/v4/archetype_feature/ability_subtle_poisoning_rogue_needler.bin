äAt 4th level, a needler can apply a contact or ingested poison to her weapon and deliver it as if it were an injury poison. The poison must be delivered within 1 minute of this application, or it is wasted. The DC of the saving throw to resist the poison decreases by 1 when the needler uses this ability to deliver a contact or ingested poison via injury.ª-
