    "text": "An undead master gains Command Undead as a bonus feat, treating his wizard level as his cleric level. If he lacks the ability to channel negative energy for the purpose of Command Undead, he can expend 3 uses of any 1st-level arcane school ability that normally has a number of uses per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier, rather than a use of channel energy. If he\u0027s a necromancer with the power over undead ability, he instead gains Improved Channel."
