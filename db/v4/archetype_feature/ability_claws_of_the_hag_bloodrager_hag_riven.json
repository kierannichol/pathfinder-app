    "text": "A hag-riven grows a pair of vicious claws that are treated as natural weapons. These claws are primary attacks and deal 1d4 points of damage each (1d3 for a Small creature) plus the hag-riven\u0027s Strength modifier. At 2nd level, these claws are considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 5th level, the damage increases to 1d6 points (1d4 for a Small creature).\nAt 13th level, the hag-riven\u0027s claws threaten a critical hit on a natural roll of 19â€“20. At 16th level, the damage increases again to 1d8 points (1d6 for a Small creature)."
