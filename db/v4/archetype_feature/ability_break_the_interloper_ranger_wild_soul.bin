´At 11th level, when a wild soul hits an arcane spellcaster, a creature with extract slots, or a creature with grit (but not grit-like pools such as panache) with a weapon attack, the target either loses its highest-level available spell or extract slot or loses 1 point of grit, and the wild soul gains 5 temporary hit points. A target of this ability can negate this effect with a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the ranger's level + his Wisdom modifier). Regardless of the outcome of the saving throw, the target is immune to this ability for 24 hours.ª4
