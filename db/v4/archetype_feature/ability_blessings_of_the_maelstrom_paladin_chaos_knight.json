    "text": "At 3rd level, a chaos knight can harness the unpredictable essence of the Maelstrom to bless a creature. When he uses his entropic touch ability, the chaos knight can grant the touched creature a blessing from the table below that lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1 + the chaos knight\u0027s Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round). Only one creature can have this blessing at a time. If another creature gains the blessing, the previous blessing ends. The creature rolls 1d4 and compares the result to the table below to determine the blessing. If the chaos knight targets himself with the blessing, he can roll twice and choose his preferred result.\nAt 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the chaos knight can grant a blessing to one additional creature at a time."
