    "text": "A profiler gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his class level (minimum +1) on Sense Motive checks. At 2nd level, he can use inspiration on any Sense Motive check without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill.\nAt 3rd level, he can attempt to predict a creature\u0027s movements using his knowledge of the creature\u0027s psychology. He can use this ability only on a creature familiar to him (for example, a serial killer whose crimes the profiler has studied will suffice, even if the profiler hasn\u0027t yet identified the serial killer\u0027s true identity). To do so, he starts from a place where he knows that the creature has been and why (most often the scene of a crime) and attempts a Sense Motive check against a DC equal to 40 or to 20 + the creature\u0027s Bluff modifier, whichever is higher, which the GM rolls in secret. On a failure, the profiler\u0027s guess about the creatures movements is inaccurate. On a success, the profiler is able to track the creature\u0027s general movements as if using Survival to track (though the usual modifiers on Survival checks to track don\u0027t apply, and this ability allows her to track a creature using pass without trace or otherwise leaving no trail). After at most 1 hour (or sooner if there are many possible options for the creature to take, at the GM\u0027s discretion), if the profiler has not yet found further evidence of the creature\u0027s passing (such as footprints, fingerprints, or any other indication that the creature came this way), he loses track of the creature\u0027s movements; if he does, he can try to guess where the creature went next by attempting another check."
