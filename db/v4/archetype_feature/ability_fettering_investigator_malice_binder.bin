¿A malice binder forgoes alchemy for the study of sympathetic magic that allows him to hinder foes.
Fetters rely on the magical resonance of creatures capable of casting spells (spellcasters and creatures with spell-like abilities) which saturates even their hair and clothing.
Fetters cannot target a creature with no magical ability. The malice binder knows one fetter at 1st level and gains another at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter.
Every fetter requires a token taken from his desired target: a few hairs, a lost tooth, nail clippings, a scrap of clothing, or a small treasured possession with some significance.
An investigator can obtain a single token in any of the following ways: a successful Sleight of Hand check against an unsuspecting target, a successful steal combat maneuver, or a successful Perception check (DC = 15 + the creature's CR) to search an area his target occupied for at least 2 hours.
Malice binders can search such a location for additional tokens, but each subsequent Perception check increases the DC by 5, regardless of success or failure. Tokens rely on the magic that clings to spellcasters and creatures with spell-like abilities; they must be carefully preserved as soon as they are recovered and before they can be used. Preparing a token requires a move action, and a malice binder can maintain one prepared token per class level. Each token can be used only to power a fetter targeting the creature it came from, and it is consumed in the process. At 7th level, the malice binder can instead prepare a token as a swift action.
The DC to resist a fetter is equal to 10 + half the investigator's class level + the investigator's Charisma bonus. Activating a fetter is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and unless otherwise stated the target must be within 30 feet, plus 5 feet per 2 levels. Once a creature has been the target of a specific fetter, it is immune to that effect for 24 hours.
This replaces alchemy.ª3
