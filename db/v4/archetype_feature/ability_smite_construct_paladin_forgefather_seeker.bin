¢This ability functions as the paladin's smite evil ability, but it functions only against constructs. Smiting a construct automatically bypasses any DR or hardness a construct might have. A Forgefather seeker can still smite evil, but she adds only half her Charisma bonus on attack rolls, adds only half of her level on damage rolls, and doesn't increase her bonus damage against outsiders with the evil subtype, evil-aligned dragons, or undead. This otherwise functions as smite evil for the purposes of feats, prerequisites, and other effects.ª9
