The bloody-knuckled rowdy treats his bloodrager levels as monk levels when qualifying for and calculating the effects of style feats and feats that have style feats as prerequisites.\nAt 5th level, the bloody-knuckled rowdy gains the Combat Style Master feat. He doesn\u0027t need to meet the prerequisites for this feat."
