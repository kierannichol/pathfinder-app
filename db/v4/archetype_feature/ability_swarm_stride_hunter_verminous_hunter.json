    "text": "At 5th level, a verminous hunter learns to move through vermin without danger. He can safely pass through swarms of vermin and does not take swarm damage while within a vermin swarm\u0027s space. In addition, he is immune to a swarm\u0027s distraction ability. If the hunter or his animal companion attacks a swarm, they lose this protection against only that swarm."
