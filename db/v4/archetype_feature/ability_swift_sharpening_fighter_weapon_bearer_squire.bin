·At 2nd level, a weapon bearer squire can quickly hone her lord's weapons to make them more effective in combat. As a full-round action, a weapon bearer squire can use a whetstone to sharpen a weapon she is holding, granting whoever wields the weapon a +1 circumstance bonus on his next attack roll with that weapon. In addition, she can apply a weapon blanch to a weapon she is holding as a standard action, instead of a full-round action.ª<
