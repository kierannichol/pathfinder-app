At 3rd level, a buckler duelist can catch his opponent's weapon between his buckler and his forearm, effectively wedging the hafts of polearms and hammers or the flats of blades. This functions as a disarm combat maneuver, and the buckler duelist gains a +4 bonus on the roll. If the buckler duelist's attack fails by 10 or more, he suffers a â€“2 penalty to his AC until the start of his next turn.ª4
