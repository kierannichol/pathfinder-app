    "text": "At 11th level, when the castellan readies an action to make a melee attack against a creature that is not yet adjacent to him, he doubles the threat range of any melee weapons wielded during the attack. This increase doesn\u0027t stack with other effects that increase the threat range of his weapons. In addition, the cavalier can attempt a free dirty trick, disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver if his readied attack is successful.\nThis free combat maneuver doesn\u0027t provoke an attack of opportunity."
