    "text": "At 5th level, a serpent herald gains the ability to use wild shape to take the form of a reptile or an aquatic animal once per day, as the druid class feature. His effective druid level for this ability is equal to his serpent herald level – 1. This doesn\u0027t allow him to assume other forms, such as elementals or other kinds of animals. When in animal form, the serpent herald is treated as able to speak normally for the purpose of using raging song, but not for using other abilities that require speech (such as spellcasting).\nAt 11th level, a serpent herald can use this ability twice per day and gains the benefits of the Wild Speech feat while using this ability, treating his druid level as his serpent herald level – 1.\nAt 17th level, a serpent herald can use this ability three times per day. In addition, he gains the supernatural resiliency of a linnorm, gaining the effects of freedom of movement while using this ability.\nThis ability replaces spell kenning."
