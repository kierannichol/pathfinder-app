ÝAt 5th level, a strong-side boxer can spend 1 minute to wrap one of her legs in a chain, and can thereafter use the chain-wrapped leg both defensively and offensively. While her leg is wrapped, she is considered to be wearing a chain shirt, gaining all the appropriate bonuses and penalties. The chain can be enchanted as armor and is treated as masterwork. Once per round while wearing the chain, she can apply a +4 circumstance bonus to a trip attempt as an immediate action.ªC
