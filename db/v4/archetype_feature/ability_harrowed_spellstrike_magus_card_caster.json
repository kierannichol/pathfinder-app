    "text": "Beginning at 2nd level, a card caster can invest a single thrown weapon with a single touch or ranged spell as part of the spell\u0027s normal casting time. The spell must target a single creature, and the spell\u0027s range changes to match the thrown weapon\u0027s range increment. This ability otherwise functions identically to spellstrike, except it can only be applied to thrown ranged weapons instead of melee attacks."
