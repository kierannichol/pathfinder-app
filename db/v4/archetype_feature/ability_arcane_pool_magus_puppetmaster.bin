ÄA puppetmaster cannot expend points from his arcane pool to grant enhancement bonuses or weapon special abilities to a weapon he is holding. As a swift action whenever the puppetmaster casts a spell of the enchantment or illusion school, he can expend 1 point from his arcane pool to increase the spell's save DC or caster level by 1. At 7th level, the increase to the spell's save DC or caster level changes to 2, at 13th level to 3, and at 19th to 4.ª-
