    "text": "At 4th level, a storm caller and his eidolon can temporarily form an electrical current between them. The storm caller can expend a use of his summon storm\u0027s fury ability as a standard action to create an instantaneous line of lightning between him and his eidolon, provided that the eidolon is within 60 feet of him.\nThe lightning arc deals the same amount of damage to all creatures in the line and has the same save DC as a bolt of lightning from the summon storm\u0027s fury ability (unlike call lightning, this damage is dealt only once). The storm caller and his eidolon are not affected by this lightning.\nAt 12th level, the storm caller gains the benefit of his eidolon\u0027s resistance (electricity) or immunity (electricity) evolution whenever he is within 30 feet of the eidolon."
