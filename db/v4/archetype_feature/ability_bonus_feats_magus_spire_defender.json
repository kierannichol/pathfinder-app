    "text": "At 1st level, the spire defender gains Combat Expertise and Dodge as bonus feats, even if he doesn\u0027t meet the prerequisites. The spire defender is not proficient in any kind of armor or shield. The spire defender does not have the magus\u0027 ability to ignore arcane spell failure from armor; however, if the spire defender becomes proficient in light armor, he automatically gains the magus\u0027s ability to ignore the arcane spell failure chance of light armor. If he becomes proficient in medium armor, at 7th level he ignores medium armor\u0027s chance of arcane spell failure. If he becomes proficient in heavy armor, at 13th level he ignores heavy armor\u0027s chance of arcane spell failure."
