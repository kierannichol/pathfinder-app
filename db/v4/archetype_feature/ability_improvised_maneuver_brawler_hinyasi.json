    "text": "At 4th level, a hinyasi learns to confound and befuddle her opponents with improvised weapons. She chooses one of the following combat maneuvers: bull rush, drag, disarm, sunder, reposition, or trip. When she hits an opponent with an improvised weapon, the hinyasi can perform her chosen combat maneuver against the same target as a free action. She takes a â€“4 penalty on the combat maneuver check, and she can\u0027t attempt an improvised maneuver check more than once per round. This combat maneuver still provokes attacks of opportunity unless the hinyasi has a feat or ability that allows her to perform it without provoking attacks of opportunity.\nAt 10th level, she chooses a second combat maneuver that she can use with this ability, though she can still perform only one improvised maneuver per round. At 16th level, she chooses a third, though she can still perform only one improvised maneuver per round."
