    "text": "As a standard action, a hallowed necromancer can sacrifice a prepared spell of the necromancy school to spontaneously cast a cure spell of the same level or lower, counting the spell as a necromancy spell rather than a conjuration spell. This cure spell harms only undead; it doesn\u0027t heal the living. If the spell requires an attack roll, it as has a critical threat range of 19â€“20. A number of times per day equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier, when she spontaneously casts a cure spell, she can either turn the effect into a ray and increase the range to close or remove the Will save for half damage[faq]."
