    "text": "At 12th level, a monk of the lotus makes a foe into a friend with a single show of mercy. As an immediate action, when one of his melee attacks would reduce a creature to 0 or fewer hit points, the monk can spend 6 ki points to make the target of that attack surrender. When the target surrenders, it is reduced to 0 hit points, becomes disabled, and is charmed, as if the monk had cast charm monster with a caster level equal to the monk\u0027s level. The target does not get a saving throw against this effect. This charm lasts until its duration expires, until the monk dismisses it or uses it on another creature, or until the target is again reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, whichever happens first. The monk can only have one creature charmed with touch of surrender at a time. This is a mind-affecting charm effect.\nThis ability replaces abundant step."
