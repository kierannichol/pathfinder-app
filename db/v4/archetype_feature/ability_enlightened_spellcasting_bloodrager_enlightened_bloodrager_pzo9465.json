    "text": "An enlightened bloodrager\u0027s sophisticated outlook allows him to cast an expanded array of spells. Instead of his normal spells per day and spells known for his bloodrager level, an enlightened bloodrager uses the spells per day from the medium class. This grants him the ability to learn a number of 0-level spells, which are cast like any other spells, but don\u0027t consume spell slots and can be used again.\nThe enlightened bloodrager adds all 0-level spells from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to his bloodrager spell list. He also adds all druid spells of 4th level and lower (including 0-level spells). If a spell appears on both the bloodrager spell list and the druid spell list, the enlightened bloodrager uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. The bloodrager treats any druid spells he takes with this ability as bloodrager spells for the purposes of other abilities (such as greater bloodrage).\nAt 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the enlightened bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, he loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell\u0027s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the enlightened bloodrager can cast. The enlightened bloodrager can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level."
