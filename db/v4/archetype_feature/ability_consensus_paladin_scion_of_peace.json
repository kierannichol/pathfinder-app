    "text": "At 8th level, twice per day as a swift action during the first full round of Combat, a Scion of Peace can take a vote from a number of allies equal to or less than 3 + the scion\u0027s Charisma modifier, all of whom must be within 30 feet of the scion of peace. In initiative order, each ally can vote for Freedom, Justice, or Responsibility. Allies who vote receive a +2 sacred bonus either on attack rolls (if Justice wins), on saving throws (if Freedom wins), or to Armor Class (if Responsibility wins) until the end of Combat. The Scion of Peace votes last, and in the case of a tie, her vote breaks the tie."
