    "text": "A twilight sage\u0027s arcane barrier differs from those of other arcanists, as it draws upon both negative and positive energy to protect the sage. At 1st level, a twilight sage must choose the arcane barrier exploit as her first arcanist exploit. Whenever an attack removes the last temporary hit point from the twilight sage\u0027s arcane barrier, the barrier\u0027s negative energy lashes back at the attacker, dealing an amount of negative energy damage equal to the barrier\u0027s maximum temporary hit point capacity."
