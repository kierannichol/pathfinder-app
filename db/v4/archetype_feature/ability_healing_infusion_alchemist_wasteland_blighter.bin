‹At 2nd level, the blighter can prepare extracts of the healing subschool as if he had the infusion discovery and can choose to render any such extracts inert and prepare other extracts to replace them (unlike infusions, which continue to occupy the alchemist's daily extract slots until consumed or used). If the blighter has the infusion discovery, or if he is also a chirurgeon, he can use touch injection as a spell-like ability once per day as a standard action, but only to absorb an infusion of the healing subschool.ª<
