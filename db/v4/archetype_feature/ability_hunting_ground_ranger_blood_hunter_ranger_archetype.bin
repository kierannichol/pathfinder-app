öA blood hunter selects only one type of terrain as his favored terrain. The bonuses he gains while in this terrain increase by 2 at 8th level and every 5 levels thereafter.
Starting at 4th level, a blood hunter can declare a new terrain as his favored terrain. This requires studying the terrain in a process that requires 1> hour of time within the terrain. Once the new terrain is declared as his favored terrain, it remains his favored terrain until the blood hunter declares a new favored terrain.
At 7th level, a blood hunter gains Blessed Hunter as a bonus feat. The territory he chooses with the Blessed Hunter feat must always be a location that matches his favored terrain. When the blood hunter chooses a new favored terrain, he can also choose a new territory with the Blessed Hunter feat. At 10th level, he gains Blessed Hunter's Stride as a bonus feat. At 13th level, he gains Blessed Hunter's Focus as a bonus feat, except he treats his ranger level as his hunter level for the purposes of that feat.ªB
