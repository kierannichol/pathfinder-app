ùAt 5th level, an aquanaut chooses bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing melee weapons. If he chooses piercing melee weapons, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with those weapons when attacking underwater. If he chooses bludgeoning or slashing melee weapons, he can ignore the usual underwater penalties for attacking with those weapons. At 9th and 13th levels, he can choose another type of melee weapon, applying this ability's initial benefit to his new choice and gaining an additional +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls to his previously chosen weapon types. At 17th level, he gains an additional +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with all three types.™3
