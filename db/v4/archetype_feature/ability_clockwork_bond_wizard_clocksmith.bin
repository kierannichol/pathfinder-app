¾A clocksmith forms a bond with one of his clockwork creations and begins play with a constructed familiar. He must select this familiar as his arcane bond. The constructed familiar functions as a typical familiar of its type except as noted here.
The construct familiar is always a construct with the clockwork subtype. A construct familiar grants only half of its typical bonus (minimum +1 bonus) from its special familiar ability to its master.ª/
