ÄAt 2nd level, a silver balladeer treats silver weapons as if they were also cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Also, alchemical silver weapons do not impose a penalty on damage rolls when wielded by a silver balladeer, and a silver balladeer gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls made with mithral weapons.ª3
