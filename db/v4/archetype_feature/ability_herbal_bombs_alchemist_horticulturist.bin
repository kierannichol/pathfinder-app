ÈA horticulturist's bombs lack the power of a traditional alchemist's but can be fine-tuned in ways normal alchemist explosives cannot. The horticulturist's bombs deal 1d4 points of damage (instead of 1d6), plus 1d4 points of damage for every 2 alchemist levels beyond 1st. When the horticulturist creates a bomb, he can formulate it to affect plants and other creatures normally, affect only plant creatures, or affect only creatures not of the plant type.ª4
