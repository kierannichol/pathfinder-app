šAt 6th level, a blight scout and her animal companion gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks and on Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when she's in the Abyss or Abyss-tainted terrain.
When she travels through this terrain, she leaves no trail and can't be tracked (though she can leave a trail if she so chooses). This bonus increases to +4 at 11th level and +6 at 16th level.ª5
