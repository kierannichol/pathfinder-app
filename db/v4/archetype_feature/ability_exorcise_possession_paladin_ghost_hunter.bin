‘At 6th level, a ghost hunter can try to end any possession spells or effects, or effects that directly exercise mental control over a creature.
She must touch the affected creature (this requires a melee touch attack if the target is neither willing nor helpless) and expend a use of her lay on hands ability.
The target can immediately attempt a Will save against the original save DC of the controlling effect. If the save is successful, the effect immediately ends, as if the target had succeeded at its original saving throw.ª7
