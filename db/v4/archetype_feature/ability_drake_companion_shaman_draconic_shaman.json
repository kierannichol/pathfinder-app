    "text": "A draconic shaman gains a drake companion instead of a spirit animal, and she communes with the drake to prepare her spells just as other shamans commune with their spirit animals. She doesn\u0027t gain a primary spirit, but she still gains wandering spirit at 4th level. She must select all her hexes (other than her wandering hexes) from the list of shaman hexes, and she can\u0027t select the witch hex shaman hex. She doesn\u0027t gain spirit magic slots until 4th level when she gains her wandering spirit. Any ability granted by a wandering spirit that would normally affect a spirit animal (such as nature\u0027s true spirit ability) has no effect for a draconic shaman."
