    "text": "At 3rd level, a sacrament alchemist\u0027s faith inspires him with ideas for novel alchemical achievements, although the mental strain means that he can\u0027t reliably repeat them. Once per day while preparing extracts, for a period of 24 hours, a sacrament alchemist can gain an alchemist discovery for which he qualifies. He treats his alchemist level as 2 lower for the purpose of this discovery.\nThis ability replaces swift alchemy."
