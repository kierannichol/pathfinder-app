    "text": "At 5th level, an outrider\u0027s innate telepathy develops into a mindlink, allowing contact between himself and his allies and companions. As long as the outrider is conscious, all allies within range of his limited telepathy racial ability (30 feet for most outriders) receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and compulsion effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made while flanking. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1."
