¢	Starting at first level, a dragon drinker gains the ability to drink dragon blood to alter or augment her spellcasting abilities. For the purposes of harvesting dragon's blood, treat the dragon drinker as though she has Dragoncrafting feat.
At 5th level, drinking a vial of dragon's blood is a standard action that provides the dragon drinker with the normal benefits of the item, as well as a +1 bonus to her caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell effects on a single spell cast within 1 minute.
At 7th level, a consumed vial of dragon blood also heals 1d8 points of damage instead of the standard 1d4.
At 11th level, the alchemical bonus on Fortitude and Reflex saves granted by the blood increases to +2.
In the absence of true dragon's blood, the dragon drinker may tap into the draconic blood flowing through her veins to gain the temporary effects of having consumed dragon's blood. As a free action, she can activate this ability, healing 1d4 points of damage and gaining a +1 resistance bonus on Will and Fortitude saves for 1 round. This action may only be performed once per round, and can be performed a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.ª5
