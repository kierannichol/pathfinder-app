    "text": "Malice binders hunt and kill those who would plague the world with supernatural power. A malice binder can use inspiration on Knowledge (arcana), Spellcraft, Sleight of Hand, and Survival checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill, rather than on any Knowledge and Linguistics checks.\nHe can later spend an investigator talent to gain the ability to use inspiration on any Knowledge and Linguistics checks."
