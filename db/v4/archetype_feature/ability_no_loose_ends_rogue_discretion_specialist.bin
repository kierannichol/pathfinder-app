ÅAt 4th level, the discretion specialist can prevent opponents from escaping. Opponents damaged by the discretion specialist's sneak attack are unable to take the withdraw action for 1 round, though they can still move as normal.
At 8th level, a creature damaged by the discretion specialist's sneak attack is hampered in casting spells of the teleportation subschool (such as dimension door) as well as using methods of magical transport such as shadow walk. A target attempting to cast such a spell before the end of the discretion specialist's next turn must succeed at a concentration check (in addition to any concentration checks required for casting while threatened or other circumstances) or lose the spell. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + half the discretion specialist's rogue level + her Intelligence modifier.
This replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.
