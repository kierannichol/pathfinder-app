    "text": "At 4th level, a code runner gains a bonus equal to half his ranger level on saving throws against divination effects. At 11th level, if he succeeds at a saving throw against a divination effect that would grant its caster knowledge or information, the caster is not aware that the saving throw was successful, and the code runner can attempt a Bluff check opposed by the caster\u0027s Sense Motive check in order to send false information to the caster."
