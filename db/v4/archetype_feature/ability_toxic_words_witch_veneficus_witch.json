    "text": "At 2nd level, whenever a veneficus witch targets a single creature with a hex, she can imbue her hex with a dose of injury or contact poison she is holding. The DCs of her hex and the poison are each reduced by 2; if the creature fails its save against the hex, the poison is expended and the creature must succeed at a Fortitude save against the poison or become poisoned. At 10th level, the DC of the witch\u0027s hex and poison are each reduced by only 1 and the witch can imbue her hexes with inhaled and ingested poisons as well.\nThis ability replaces the witch\u0027s 2nd- and 10th-level hexes.\nHexes: The following witch hexes complement the veneficus witch archetype: blight, cauldron, disguise, poison steep.\nMajor Hexes: The following major hexes complement the veneficus witch archetype: cook people, witch\u0027s brew."
