    "text": "At 8th level, if a god caller\u0027s eidolon would grant him a bonus with the aid another action on a Diplomacy or Intimidate check, the god caller can instead choose to roll twice and take the better result. He makes the choice before rolling. Once per day while his eidolon uses the aid another action to assist him in such a check, if the god caller would improve a target\u0027s attitude toward him, or gain a success if using the individual influence rules, he instead improves that target\u0027s attitude by 2 steps or it counts as 2 successes."
