ÁAt 6th level, the argent voice learns to sing at frequencies capable of shattering magical effects. As a full-round action, an argent voice can use 2 rounds of bardic performance to attempt to dispel a single evil spell or enchantment spell cast by an evil creature. This functions as per dispel magic, using the bard's level as his caster level. At 18th level, this ability can be used on effects that can be removed by the spell break enchantment.ª5
