    "text": "At 10th level, when a lifting hand succeeds at a combat maneuver check to maintain a grapple, instead of choosing to damage, move, pin, or tie up the opponent, she can instead force one of the target\u0027s limbs into an agonizing position. The target becomes sickened as long as the lifting hand maintains the grapple. When the grapple is released or broken, the target is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to the lifting hand\u0027s level. This is a pain effect."
