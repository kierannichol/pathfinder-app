At 3rd level, a living avalanche must choose overrun as her first combat maneuver for maneuver training. At 7th level, she must choose bull rush as her second combat maneuver for maneuver training. She doesn't gain training in any new combat maneuvers at later levels, but her bonuses on combat maneuver checks and to CMD for bull rush and overrun combat maneuvers increase as normal. She gains the following benefits at the listed levels. At 11th level, if she succeeds at an overrun combat maneuver as part of a charge, she automatically knocks her target prone (no matter the result of her check). In addition, if the living avalanche succeeds at a bull rush combat maneuver as part of a charge, she reduces the penalty combat maneuver checks to bull rush each creature beyond the first by 2. At 15th level, the living avalanche can attempt bull rush and overrun combat maneuvers against creatures two sizes larger than herself, but only as part of a charge. At 19th level, if the living avalanche succeeds at a bull rush combat maneuver as part of a charge, she reduces the penalty on combat maneuver checks to bull rush each creature beyond the first by an additional 2. When attempting an overrun combat maneuver as part of a charge, she also ignores any increase to a creature's CMD from having more than two legs.ª1
