µA Tekritanin arbiter learns to forge lasting harmony between enemies. At 2nd level, whenever the arbiter uses the Diplomacy skill to improve the starting attitude of a creature, that attitude shift lasts for 24 hours instead of 1d4 hours, barring any circumstance or event that causes it to be decreased. If the arbiter spends 1 minute continuously interacting with a creature, he can attempt a Sense Motive check (DC = 10 + the creature's Bluff skill bonus) to identify the creature's starting attitude (per the Diplomacy skill) in regard to all other creatures present (including himself ). With this understanding, the arbiter can use the Diplomacy skill to improve a target's attitude toward any other creature present. This functions as if using the Diplomacy skill to improve the target's attitude toward the arbiter, but instead uses the Diplomacy DC determined by the target's starting attitude toward the creature of the arbiter's choosing.ª>
