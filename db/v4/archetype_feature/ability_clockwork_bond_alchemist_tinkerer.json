    "text": "At 1st level, a tinkerer forms a bond with one of her creations, and begins play with it at no cost. This functions as the familiar option of the wizard\u0027s arcane bond class feature, with the tinkerer\u0027s effective wizard level equal to her alchemist level. If a tinkerer would gain a familiar through another class, those levels stack for purposes of determining the familiar\u0027s abilities.\nA tinkerer\u0027s familiar can take any shape the tinkerer wishes, but its statistics and abilities are identical to a clockwork spy with the normal adjustments and abilities for a familiar applied, and it is a construct with the clockwork subtype. At 3rd level, if the tinkerer has the infusion discovery, a clockwork spy familiar can deliver the tinkerer\u0027s extracts with a range of touch for her. At 7th level, a clockwork spy can communicate with constructs with the clockwork subtype. Unlike most familiars, a clockwork spy does not grant special abilities to its master.\nWith 1 minute of work and a successful DC 15 Heal check, a tinkerer can restore 1d4 hit points to her clockwork spy familiar. At 4th level, a tinkerer can restore 1d6 hit points to her familiar in this same way. This amount increases to an additional 1d6 hit points every 4 levels thereafter (2d6 at 8th level, 3d6 at 12th level, 4d6 at 16th level, and 5d6 at 20th level)."
