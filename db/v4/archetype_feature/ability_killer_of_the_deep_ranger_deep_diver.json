    "text": "At 20th level, a deep diver is peerless at detecting prey underwater and delivering killing blows. He can notice other creatures by scent in a 180-foot radius underwater and can detect blood in the water up to a mile away. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus while underwater. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + half the ranger\u0027s level + the ranger\u0027s Wisdom modifier. A deep diver can instead deal an additional amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature\u0027s current hit points. A successful save negates this damage.\nA deep diver can use this ability once per day against each of his favored enemy types but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period."
