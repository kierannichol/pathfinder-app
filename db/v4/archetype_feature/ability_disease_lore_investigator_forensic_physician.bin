¡At 3rd level, a forensic physician can use Heal to identify a disease after only 1 minute of examining the symptoms (DC = the disease's saving throw DC), and he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Heal check at the same DC to disinfect an infected object or corpse. At 3rd level, he receives a +2 bonus on saving throws against diseases. This bonus increases by 2 at 6th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter.ª;
