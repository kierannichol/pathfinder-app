    "text": "At 2nd level, a ringleader can use her Intimidate bonus in place of her Perform bonus when using her bardic performance class ability. When the ringleader uses Intimidate to improve a creature\u0027s attitude, the creature\u0027s attitude remains friendly for 10 additional minutes per point by which the ringleader exceeded the check\u0027s DC. At 6th level, the ringleader gains Dazzling Display as a bonus feat and does not need a weapon in her hand to use the feat. At 10th level, the ringleader can activate Dazzling Display as a standard action. At 14th level, she can affect all enemies within 60 feet with Dazzling Display. At 18th level, the range increases to 120 feet."
