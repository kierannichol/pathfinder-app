    "text": "Once per day, a Tarot student can perform a harrow reading as a 5-minute ritual. She decides which suit most closely aligns with her task at hand and deals a nine-card spread. Each time that suit appears in her spread, she adds 1 point to her arcane reservoir, to a maximum of 1 point per 2 arcanist levels.\nPoints gained in excess of her reservoir\u0027s maximum are lost.\nThe Tarot student can perform this reading one additional time per day at 8th level and at 16th level."
