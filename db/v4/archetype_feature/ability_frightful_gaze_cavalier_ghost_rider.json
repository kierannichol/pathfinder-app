    "text": "At 1st level, a ghost rider can use this ability on opponents within 30 feet as a standard action, which acts as a gaze attack until the ghost rider\u0027s next turn. Creatures within range that meet the ghost rider\u0027s gaze must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 the ghost rider\u0027s class level + the ghost rider\u0027s Charisma modifier) or stand paralyzed in fear for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Creatures that successfully save against that ghost rider\u0027s frightful gaze are immune to it for 24 hours. At 9th level, this ability can affect creatures that are mindless or immune to mind-affecting effects, though it still counts as a fear effect. The ghost rider can use this ability a number of times each day equal to her Charisma modifier."
