    "text": "At 12th level, a sin monk can spend a swift action and one daily use of Stunning Fist to draw his sinful nature to the fore of his consciousness.\nThe next person he hits with a melee attack before the end of his next turn must succeed at a Will save (DC \u003d 10 + half the sin monk\u0027s class level + his Wisdom modifier) or suffer the burden of the sin monk\u0027s sins. The target is treated as if she were carrying a load one step heavier (from a light load to a medium load, and so on) and must succeed at a caster level check to use any form of teleportation (DC \u003d 10 + the monk\u0027s class level). This is a curse effect that lasts a number of rounds equal to the sin monk\u0027s Wisdom modifier unless it is removed through remove curse or a similar effect."
