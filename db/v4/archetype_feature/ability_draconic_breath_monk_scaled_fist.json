    "text": "At 15th level, a scaled fist can spend 3 points from her ki pool to make a breath weapon attack as a standard action. This breath weapon deals 1d6 points of damage of her energy type per monk level in a 30-foot cone. Those caught in the area of the breath can attempt a Reflex save (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 the scaled fist\u0027s monk level + her Charisma modifier) to halve the normal damage."
