    "text": "At 20th level, whenever a disciple of the pike makes a charge attack with a polearm or spear, he deals double the normal amount of damage. In addition, if he confirms a critical hit on a deadly charge, the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. If the target succeeds at a Will save (DC \u003d 10 + the cavalier\u0027s base attack bonus), it is instead staggered for 1d4 rounds."
