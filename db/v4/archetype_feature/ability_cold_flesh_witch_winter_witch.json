    "text": "At 1st level, a winter witch gains endure elements as a constant spell-like ability, but only against cold temperatures. At 4th level, she gains cold resistance 5, making her comfortable in near-freezing temperatures. At 9th-level, this increases to cold resistance 10, and at 14th level, it becomes immunity to cold.\nThis replaces the witch\u0027s 4th-level hex.\nHexes: The following hexes complement the winter witch archetype: beast eye, blight, cook people, evil eye, feral speech, hag\u0027s eye, hoarfrost, ice tomb, witch\u0027s hut.\nA winter witch can select the following hexes:\nFrostfoot (Su) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the witch climbs must be icy. The witch can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice. She can move across regular snow without penalty, and heavy snow only costs her 2 squares of movement instead of 4. Frozen Caress (Su) Whenever the winter witch casts a touch spell, she can infuse the magic with cold as a swift action. This grants the spell the cold descriptor, and adds 1d4 points of cold damage to the spell\u0027s effect. If the touch spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates this additional cold damage."
