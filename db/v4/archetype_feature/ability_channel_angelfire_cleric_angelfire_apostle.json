    "text": "An angelfire apostle must be of good or neutral alignment and must choose to channel positive energy, even if his deity is neutral or if he is not devoted to a particular deity. When an angelfire apostle channels positive energy, affected nongood creatures are dazzled for 1 round, with no saving throw for this effect, in addition to experiencing the normal effects of channel energy."
