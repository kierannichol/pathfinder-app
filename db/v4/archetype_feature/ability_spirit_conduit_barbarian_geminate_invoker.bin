öAt 4th level, a geminate invoker can invite a spirit into his body each time he enters a trance, gaining a lesser totem rage power for the duration of his trance. He can select a new totem each time he enters his trance, though the GM might rule that certain totem spirits are simply not available in certain locations (such as channeling a celestial totem in an evil god's temple). Invoking a totem counter to his alignment (such as a neutral good character invoking a fiend totem) requires the geminate invoker to succeed at a DC 12 Charisma check each round to dominate the spirit. Failure indicates the spirit escapes, immediately ending the trance.
At 8th level, the geminate invoker gains a second totem rage power, though it must use the previously granted lesser totem rage power as a prerequisite. At 12th level, he also gains the greater totem rage power that uses the previously granted powers as prerequisites.™8
