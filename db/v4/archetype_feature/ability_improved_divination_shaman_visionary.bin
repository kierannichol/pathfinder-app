ßAt 6th level, the visionary becomes more adept at divination magic. When she casts the augury spell, her chance for an accurate answer is automatically the maximum of 90%. Likewise, when she casts divination, she has the maximum 90% chance of an accurate answer.
Finally, the visionary can prepare scrying as a 4th-level spell, and it requires only 1 minute to cast. The visionary also has a 10% chance per caster level to cast the spells listed in the scrying spell description, instead of 5% per caster level (to a maximum of 100%).
The visionary must still prepare these spells to receive these benefits.ª3
