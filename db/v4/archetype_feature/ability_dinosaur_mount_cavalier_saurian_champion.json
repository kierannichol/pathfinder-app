    "text": "A saurian champion bonds with a dinosaur companion that willingly serves as his mount. This mount functions as a cavalier\u0027s normal mount with the following adjustments: The saurian champion\u0027s mount must be a dinosaur. The saurian champion can ride mounts of his size category and larger, rather than only those of a larger size. Increase the mount\u0027s Strength score by 8 for the purpose of determining its carrying capacity. Whenever an ability or feat allows the saurian champion\u0027s mount to make a hoof attack, the mount can make a claw or bite attack instead."
