¢At 17th level, a horselord and his mount can make a tactical rush through enemy ranks as a full-round action. His mount can move up to twice its normal speed in a straight line. The horselord can make a single attack against each creature he threatens during his mount's movement, up to his normal number of attacks per round. These attacks use his full base attack bonus and take a -2 penalty; this is not a charge, and these attacks deal normal damage. The horselord provokes attacks of opportunity during this movement, but his mount does not.ª.
