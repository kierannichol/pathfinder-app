    "text": "At 2nd level, as a full-round action, a gunner squire can temporarily ensure the safety of a firearm she is holding, reducing its misfire chance by 1 (to a minimum of 0) on the next attack roll made with that firearm.\nThis reduction does not stack with itself.\nThis reduction occurs after any increases are calculated for firing with the broken condition, or for any other effect that might increase the misfire value of a firearm."
