ÈA 3rd-level arbiter can use his performance to treat his allies as if they possessed the same teamwork feats as the bard for the purpose of determining whether the bard receives a bonus from his teamwork feats. His allies do not receive any bonuses from these feats unless they actually possess the feats themselves. The allies' positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat for the bard to receive the listed bonus.ª,
