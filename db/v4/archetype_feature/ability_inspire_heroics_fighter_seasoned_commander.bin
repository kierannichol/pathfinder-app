ÑAt 15th level, a seasoned commander gains an additional daily use of his inspiring speech, and he can also choose to use his inspiring speech to grant the effects of inspire heroics to one ally (instead of inspire courage or inspire greatness). For every 2 levels a seasoned commander attains beyond 15th, he can target one additional ally while using this ability. This ability functions in all other respects like the seasoned commander's inspire courage ability.ª9
