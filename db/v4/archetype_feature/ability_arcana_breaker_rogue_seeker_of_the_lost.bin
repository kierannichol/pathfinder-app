•Typically, only magical traps survive for long periods underwater, so a seeker of the lost specializes in noticing and disarming such traps. At 3rd level, a seeker of the lost gains a +1 competence bonus on Perception checks to notice magical traps and on Disable Device checks to disarm magical traps. This bonus increases by an additional +1 every 3 levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).ª6
