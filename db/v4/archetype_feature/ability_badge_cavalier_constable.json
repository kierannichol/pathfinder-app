As long as he wears his badge, allies within 30 feet who can see him gain a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm, compulsion, and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against targets the constable has challenged.\nAt 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the bonuses increase by 1."
