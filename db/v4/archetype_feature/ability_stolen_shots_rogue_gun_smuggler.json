    "text": "At 3rd level, a gun smuggler can access small quantities of cutting-edge firearm technology through clandestine dealers. She gains the benefits of the black market connections rogue talent, though only for the purpose of securing firearms and related equipment.\nAt the beginning of each day, the gun smuggler gains a number of bullets (with accompanying black powder) or paper cartridges--referred to as shots--in any combination equal to her rogue level, representing ammunition smuggled to her by contacts. Her contacts provide only enough shots to replenish this small supply, so she can\u0027t accumulate ammunition indefinitely, and these shots have a market price of 0 gp.\nAt 6th level, the gun smuggler can elect to gain one or more pieces of magic ammunition, though each one replaces a number of her daily shots equal to the ammunition\u0027s enhancement bonus (maximum enhancement bonus of +2 for any one piece of ammunition).\nShe can choose to add any of the following weapon special abilities to the shot, though the shot must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus, and these special abilities use an amount of bonus equal to the ability\u0027s normal price:\nDistance, flaming, flaming burst, merciful, seeking, or thundering.\nAt 9th level and every 3 rogue levels thereafter, the maximum enhancement bonus of a gun smuggler\u0027s shots increases by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level)."
