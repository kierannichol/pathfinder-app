    "text": "A cruorchymist has created a homunculus from basic materials and his own blood. The homunculus takes the shape of a Tiny humanoid. It functions in all ways as a familiar, treating the cruorchymist\u0027s alchemist level as his effective wizard level. If a cruorchymist wishes to replace his blood familiar, he can reduce the cost of the replacement ritual by taking 2 points of Constitution drain for every 100 gp he wishes to forgo.\nAt 3rd level, if the cruorchymist has the infusion discovery, a blood familiar can deliver extracts that have a range of touch for its cruorchymist master."
