›At 3rd level, a river druid takes no penalty to speed or on Acrobatics or Stealth checks in shallow water up to 2 feet deep (1 foot deep for Small characters) such as shallow bogs, shorelines, streams, and partially flooded areas. A river druid (and any vehicle she pilots) isn't moved by flowing water unless she allows it. Water that has been magically manipulated to impede or boost motion still affects her.ª/
