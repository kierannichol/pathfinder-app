éAt 1st level, a mark appears somewhere on the divine paragon's body. The mark's location varies by individual and faith, but takes the form of the deity's holy symbol and generally appears in a location easy to display, such as on the hand, forearm, chest, or face. An uncovered divine brand functions as a holy (or unholy) symbol and as a divine focus for spellcasting. The divine paragon's aura is even more powerful than a typical cleric's as a result of her devotion, and her cleric level is treated as 1 higher for the purpose of determining the strength of her aura when it is viewed by spells like detect good.ª1
