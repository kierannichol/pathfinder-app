òAt 6th level, a bloody jake gains Learn Ranger Trap as a bonus feat, benefiting from it as if he were a ranger. He can expend two uses of his traps ability to add his sneak attack damage to the trap's damage; any slayer talents or rogue talents he has that modify sneak attack damage, such as bleeding attack, also apply to sneak attack damage dealt by his ranger traps.ª0
