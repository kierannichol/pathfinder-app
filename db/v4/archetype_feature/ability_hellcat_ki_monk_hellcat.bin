Hellcat Kiarchetype_featureclass_feature¢†	
ù	At 4th level, a hellcat gains a pool of ki points that he can use as per the monk class feature but with the following changes. In addition to spending ki to gain an additional attack, increased speed, or improved AC, a hellcat can spend 1 ki point as a swift action to enhance his sight (gaining 60-foot darkvision) or his sense of smell (gaining the scent ability) for 1 minute per level.
At 7th level, a hellcat can spend 1 point of ki as a swift action to gain fire resistance 5 for 1 round per level. At 10th level, this fire resistance increases to 10, and at 14th level, it increases to 15.
At 11th level, a hellcat can spend 1 point of ki as a swift action to become silhouetted with a ghostly flame, which makes him harder to see in light but easier to see in darkness for 1 round per level. He becomes invisible in bright light, gains concealment (20% miss chance) in normal light, gains no benefit in dim light, and gives off light like a candle in darkness, allowing other creatures to see him even without darkvision. If he takes any action that would break invisibility while in bright light, his invisibility is reduced to concealment until the end of his next turn.™&
