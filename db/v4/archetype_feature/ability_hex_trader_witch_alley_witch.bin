Hex Traderarchetype_featureclass_feature¢Û
ØAt 6th level, once per day as a full-round action, an alley witch can bind a hex she knows into a feather, bead, or other small token. Any creature holding this token can use that hex once as if using a potion, targeting itself or a creature it touches. While a hex is sealed into a token, the alley witch loses her ability to use that hex until the token is used or she can recover the token. If a hex can be used in increments (like the disguise hex), the alley witch decides how many increments the token contains when making it. If a hex has no set duration, it lasts for 1 minute once activated.ª+
