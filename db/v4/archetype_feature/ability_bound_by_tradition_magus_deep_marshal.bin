ÛA deep marshal is limited in how she can use her arcane powers. Her arcane pool has a number of points equal to 1/3 her magus level (minimum 1) + her Intelligence modifier. Furthermore, she cannot use her arcane pool to grant an enhancement bonus or weapon special ability to a weapon she is holding unless it is a battleaxe, heavy pick, warhammer, or weapon with the word â€œdwarven" in its name. She can use her spell combat or spellstrike abilities only with such weapons.ª4
