¹As a free action as part of a melee attack, a wasteland meditant can draw the moisture out of a living creature damaged by his unarmed strike. Unless the creature succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the monk's level + his Wisdom modifier), the creature is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to half the wasteland meditant's level (minimum 1). At 5th level, the creature struck is also staggered for 1 round if it fails its save. At 10th level, a creature that fails its save is exhausted instead of fatigued.
When used against a plant creature or a creature with the water subtype, dehydrating strike inflicts the above conditions (as applicable) on a failed save and also deals 1d6 points of damage, plus 1d6 additional points of damage at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter. This damage is in addition to the wasteland meditant's normal unarmed strike damage. A wasteland meditant can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Wisdom modifier but only once per round.
Creatures immune to critical hits or precision damage are immune to this ability.ª9
