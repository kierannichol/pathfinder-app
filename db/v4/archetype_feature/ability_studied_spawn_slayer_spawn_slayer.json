    "text": "A spawn slayer specializes in fighting against larger, single targets. At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks against a studied target increase by 1, as do the DCs of slayer abilities against a studied target. He can also ignore size restrictions against a studied target when attempting combat maneuvers against larger foes. At 5th level, if the target is Large or larger, these bonuses increase by an additional 1. At 10th level, if the target is Huge or larger, the bonuses increase by an additional 2. At 15th level, if the target is Gargantuan or larger, the bonuses increase by an additional 3. At 20th level, if the target is Colossal in size, the bonuses increase by an additional 4. A spawn slayer cannot maintain these bonuses against more than one target at a time. He does not gain the ability to study an opponent as a swift action at 7th level."
