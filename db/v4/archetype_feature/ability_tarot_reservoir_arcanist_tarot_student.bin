×Once per day, a Tarot student can perform a harrow reading as a 5-minute ritual. She decides which suit most closely aligns with her task at hand and deals a nine-card spread. Each time that suit appears in her spread, she adds 1 point to her arcane reservoir, to a maximum of 1 point per 2 arcanist levels.
Points gained in excess of her reservoir's maximum are lost.
The Tarot student can perform this reading one additional time per day at 8th level and at 16th level.ª5
