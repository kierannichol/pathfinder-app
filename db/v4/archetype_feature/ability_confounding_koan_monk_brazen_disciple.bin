ÔAt 12th level, a brazen disciple can spend 2 ki points as a standard action to confuse a target within 30 feet with a riddle or paradox. This ability functions as per confusion, except that it is language-dependent. The DC is equal to 10 + half the monk's class level + his Wisdom modifier, and the caster level is equal to his class level.ª4
