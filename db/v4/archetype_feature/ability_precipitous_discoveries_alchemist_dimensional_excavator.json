    "text": "At 6th level, a dimensional excavator can choose to learn an additional pit spell in place of learning a new discovery. The alchemist must be able to use an extract of the appropriate level to select a pit spell as an extract. He can add the following spells to his extracts known, and use them as per the extradimensional extract ability: spiked pit (3rd-level extract), acid pit (4th-level extract), hungry pit (5th-level extract). This alters the discovery ability."
