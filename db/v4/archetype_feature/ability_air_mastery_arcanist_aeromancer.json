    "text": "Aeromancers specialize in magic that manipulates the wind and sky. Whenever an aeromancer expends a point from her arcane reservoir to increase the caster level of a spell with the air, cold, electricity, or sonic descriptor, she increases that bonus by an additional 1. At 5th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the amount by which she increases the caster level of such spells further increases by an additional 1 (to a maximum additional caster level increase from this ability of 5 at 20th level).\nAlternatively, if the aeromancer expends a point from her arcane reservoir to increase the saving throw DC of a spell with the air, cold, electricity, or sonic descriptor, she increases it by an additional 1. At 10th level, she increases it by an additional 2 instead."
