    "text": "At 8th level, a sly saboteur can use Disable Device to rig a magic item to fail as if it were an extremely complex device. If the item\u0027s effect is instantaneous, the effect is countered the next time the item is activated, but the activation still consumes a charge or use. If the item\u0027s effect is continuous or has a duration, the effect fails after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use (sly saboteur\u0027s choice). This ends the duration or suppresses a continuous effect for 1d4 rounds (as the spell dispel magic). This ability cannot be used on artifacts.\nIf this ability is combined with the catastrophic failure ability, the resulting damage is untyped magic and is not reduced by damage reduction or energy resistance.\nThis replaces improved uncanny dodge.\nRogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement the sly saboteur archetype: cunning trigger, fast stealth, getaway artist, quick disable, quick trapsmith, rogue crawl, trap spotter, wall scramble."
