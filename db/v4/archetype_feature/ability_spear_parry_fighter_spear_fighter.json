    "text": "At 3rd level, a spear fighter learns to parry his opponents\u0027 attacks with his spear. This functions as a swashbuckler\u0027s opportune parry and riposte deed except as noted below. The spear fighter must use a weapon from the spears weapon group to perform the parry. He doesn\u0027t need panache to parry an attack or to make an attack against a creature whose attack he has parried; instead, he takes a cumulative â€“4 penalty on all attacks (including further parry attempts) until the end of his next turn. At 7th, 11th, and 15th levels, the penalty decreases by 1. At 19th level, a spear fighter can use spear parry without penalty."
