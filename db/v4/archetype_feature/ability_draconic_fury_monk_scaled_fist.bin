ÉAt 3rd level, the scaled fist has gained some control over the draconic energies she studies. She must select one type of energy: acid, cold, electricity, or fire.
Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. The scaled fist can expend 1 point from her ki pool as a swift action to imbue her natural attacks with this energy, causing them to deal an extra 1d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 her monk level.ª-
