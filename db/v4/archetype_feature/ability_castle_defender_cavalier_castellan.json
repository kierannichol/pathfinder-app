    "text": "At 1st level, a castellan gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class and an additional +1 bonus on attack rolls when he is on higher ground. He also gains an additional +1 bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves when he has cover other than soft cover from other creatures. At 6th level, a castellan gains evasion (as a rogue) when he has cover (but not soft cover) against the source of the attack.\nAt 11th level, these bonuses increase by 1. At 16th level, he gains improved evasion instead of evasion. Both the evasion and improved evasion abilities work even when the castellan wears medium or heavy armor."
