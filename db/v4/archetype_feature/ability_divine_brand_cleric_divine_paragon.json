    "text": "At 1st level, a mark appears somewhere on the divine paragon\u0027s body. The mark\u0027s location varies by individual and faith, but takes the form of the deity\u0027s holy symbol and generally appears in a location easy to display, such as on the hand, forearm, chest, or face. An uncovered divine brand functions as a holy (or unholy) symbol and as a divine focus for spellcasting. The divine paragon\u0027s aura is even more powerful than a typical cleric\u0027s as a result of her devotion, and her cleric level is treated as 1 higher for the purpose of determining the strength of her aura when it is viewed by spells like detect good."
