ŒAt 20th level, whenever an aerial assaulter threatens a critical hit with an attack made from higher ground, he automatically confirms the critical hit, and the weapon's damage multiplier is increased by 1. In addition, all bull rush, dirty trick, drag, grapple, reposition, and trip combat maneuver checks against the aerial assaulter fail when attempted by opponents on lower ground than he is.ª;
