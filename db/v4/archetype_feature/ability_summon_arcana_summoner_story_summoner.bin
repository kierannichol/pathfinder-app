çAt 2nd level, a story summoner can use a complete harrow deck he owns as an additional focus component for his summon monster spell-like ability. When he does so, the summoner draws a random card from the deck and applies a simple template to the summoned monster based on the card's alignment: celestial (any good), fiendish (any evil), resolute (any lawful), or entropic (any chaotic). If a card has more than one alignment--such as a lawful evil or chaotic good card--the summoner can choose which template to apply to the summoned creature. This ability allows a story summoner to summon and command creatures normally prohibited by their alignment.™4
