’An eldritch scion casts arcane spells drawn from the magus spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an eldritch scion must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The DC for a saving throw against an eldritch scion's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the eldritch scion's Charisma modifier. An eldritch scion can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as a bard of the same level. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score.
An eldritch scion's selection of spells is limited. He has the same number of spells known as a bard of the same level, and can choose new spells to replace old ones at 5th level and every 3 class levels after that, just as a bard does. See the bard for more information on swapping spells known.ª1
