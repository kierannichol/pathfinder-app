    "text": "At 6th level, a true silvered throne can attempt to coax a nearby spirit into service with a 1-minute-long ritual once per day, gaining that spirit\u0027s spirit ability and adding its list of spells to those he can cast using his spirit magic. The silvered throne can maintain this bond for 1 hour, or until he dismisses the spirit as a free action. At 12th level, he also gains this spirit\u0027s greater spirit power while bonded, and at 20th level gains its true spirit power as well. He can perform a wandering ritual one additional time per day at 8th level and 14th level."
