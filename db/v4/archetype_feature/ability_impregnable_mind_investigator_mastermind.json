    "text": "At 9th level, a mastermind\u0027s secrecy, obscurity, and mental conditioning reach superhuman levels. He becomes immune to any divination spell, spell-like ability, or effect that allows a saving throw (though he can still allow a divination effect to affect him if he wishes). Even divination effects that do not allow a saving throw have difficulty piercing a mastermind\u0027s barriers, as a mastermind can now choose to think in any language he speaks. Unless the opponent reading a mastermind\u0027s thoughts speaks all of the mastermind\u0027s languages, attempts at thought reading automatically fail."
