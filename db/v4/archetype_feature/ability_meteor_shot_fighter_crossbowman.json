    "text": "At 17th level, as a standard action, a crossbowman can make one attack with a crossbow at a â€“4 penalty. If the attack hits, it inflicts damage normally and the target is subject to a bull rush or a trip maneuver using the attack roll as the combat maneuver check. The crossbowman must decide which maneuver to attempt before making his attack roll."
