    "text": "A veiled adept can imbue normal animals with the ability to speak for a brief period. Once per day as a standard action, the veiled adept can touch an animal to grant it the ability to speak any language the druid knows for 1 minute per druid level. This does not increase the animal\u0027s Intelligence or improve its attitude, and the animal behaves as though communicating with someone under the effects of a speak with animals spell, save that it can speak with anyone who understands the language the veiled adept grants it. The veiled adept gains one additional use of this ability at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter."
