    "text": "At 3rd level, the azatariel adds her Charisma modifier to attack and damage rolls made with light or one-handed piercing weapons as part of her opportune parry and riposte deed (including when riposting).\nIn addition, whenever the azatariel successfully parries an opponent\u0027s attack, instead of riposting she can redirect that attack to another target as an immediate action. The new target must be within the attacker\u0027s reach, and the attacker uses the original attack roll to determine the attack\u0027s success."
