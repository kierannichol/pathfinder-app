ÊA vindictive bastard is particularly ruthless against those who have harmed her or her allies. Once per day as a swift action, she can smite one target within sight who has dealt hit point damage to her or an ally. She adds her Charisma modifier to her attack rolls and adds her paladin level to damage rolls against the target of her smite. In addition, while vindictive smite is in effect, the vindictive bastard gains a deflection bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) to her AC against attacks by the target of the smite. If the target of vindictive smite has rendered an ally of the vindictive bastard unconscious or dead within the last 24 hours, the bonus on damage rolls on the first attack that hits increases by 2 for every paladin level she has.
The vindictive smite effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the vindictive bastard rests and regains her uses of this ability. At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the vindictive bastard can invoke her vindictive smite one additional time per day, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.ª:
