ÁAt 8th level, a coral witch can naturally emulate coral's ability to affix itself in place. At the end of any round in which the coral witch did not move from her space and is standing on solid ground, she adds her class level to her CMD against any bull rush, overrun, and reposition combat maneuvers, grapple attempts to move her, and attempts to pull or push her. This bonus lasts until the start of the coral witch's next turn.
This ability replaces the hex gained at 8th level.

Major Hexes: The following major hexes complement the coral witch archetype: Beast Eye, hag's eye, Weather Control.ª-
