    "text": "At 5th level, when a pelagic hunter or her animal companion bleeds underwater into the surrounding water (whether from piercing or slashing damage, a bleed effect, or another effect that causes blood to spill), the blood transmutes into ordinary water within 1 round. This prevents sharks and other predators with keen scent from being drawn to the pelagic hunter\u0027s position by the blood and makes it harder for such creatures to track her."
