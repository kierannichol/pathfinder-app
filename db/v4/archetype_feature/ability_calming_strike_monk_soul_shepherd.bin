ëAs an immediate action after hitting an incorporeal undead creature with an unarmed strike, a soul shepherd can attempt to calm the creature, encouraging it to move peacefully to the next stage of its metaphysical journey. The target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half soul shepherd's level + the soul shepherd's Wisdom modifier) or be calmed, as calm spirit, for 1 minute.
The soul shepherd can use this ability against a haunt by making a touch attack against an AC of 10 + the haunt's CR. A haunt does not receive a saving throw against this ability, but the ability's duration changes to concentration + 1 round, up to 1 round per level. A soul shepherd can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his soul shepherd level.ª0
