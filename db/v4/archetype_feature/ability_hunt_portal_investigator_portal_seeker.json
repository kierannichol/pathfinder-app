    "text": "A portal seeker can try to locate an unseen magical portal within 60 feet by concentrating and attempting a DC 20 Knowledge (planes) check. If successful, the portal seeker becomes aware of the presence of all extradimensional portals (including those created by spells like rope trick or by magic items like bags of holding) in a 60?foot radius. If she concentrates for 3 rounds, she can pinpoint the locations of all portals in the area of effect. Some portals, at the GM\u0027s discretion, may be magically hidden and have a higher DC to detect."
