áAt 6th level, while her familiar is inside her, the putrefactor can disgorge all the crawling creatures within her at once as a standard action, retaining only her familiar. When she does, she loses 2 hit points per class level and forms a spider swarm as per the spell vomit swarm. The swarm gains the Armor Class and saving throw bonuses of her familiar. The swarm deals her verminous blood damage instead of its normal damage; while the swarm lasts, the putrefactor loses access to her verminous blood ability. The witch can target creatures with her hexes as if she occupied both the swarm's space and her own. When the duration ends, the swarm tries its best to return to her and crawl back into her body, restoring hit points equal to its current hit points, up to her maximum hit points. If the swarm dies or cannot return to her once the spell's duration ends, the witch does not regain any of her spent hit points.
Once she reabsorbs the swarm, she can't disgorge it again for 1 hour.ª/
