    "text": "At 4th level, a portal seeker can create ephemeral portals to improve her maneuverability. At the start of each day, she gains a number of Portal Points equal to her investigator level. She can spend 1 Portal Point as a swift action during a move or withdraw action to open and step through a momentary portal to a location within 20 feet that she can see. Stepping through the portal takes 5 feet of movement, and while the rest of her movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, the extra movement from the portal is a teleportation effect that doesn\u0027t provoke attacks of opportunity.\nThe distance she can travel increases by 10 feet at 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter, to a maximum distance of 100 feet at 20th level."
