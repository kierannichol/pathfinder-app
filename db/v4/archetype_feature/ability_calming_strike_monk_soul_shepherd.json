    "text": "As an immediate action after hitting an incorporeal undead creature with an unarmed strike, a soul shepherd can attempt to calm the creature, encouraging it to move peacefully to the next stage of its metaphysical journey. The target must succeed at a Will save (DC \u003d 10 + half soul shepherd\u0027s level + the soul shepherd\u0027s Wisdom modifier) or be calmed, as calm spirit, for 1 minute.\nThe soul shepherd can use this ability against a haunt by making a touch attack against an AC of 10 + the haunt\u0027s CR. A haunt does not receive a saving throw against this ability, but the ability\u0027s duration changes to concentration + 1 round, up to 1 round per level. A soul shepherd can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his soul shepherd level."
