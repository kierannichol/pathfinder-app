    "text": "Starting at 2nd level, a gun scavenger\u0027s attacks with firearms are difficult to predict. When shooting a firearm at a creature that has a dodge or insight bonus to its Armor Class, the gun scavenger treats the combined bonus as if it were 1 lower. This value increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of 5 at 20th level)."
