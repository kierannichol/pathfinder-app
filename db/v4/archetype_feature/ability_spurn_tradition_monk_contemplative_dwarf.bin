úContemplative dwarves strive to separate themselves from the rest of their race and the traditions that bind them. The bonuses for non-magical effects that target or specifically affect dwarf subtype creatures (such as a ranger's favored enemy class feature) are all reduced by half. In addition, an Contemplative becomes proficient in one martial weapon with the monk property.ª7
