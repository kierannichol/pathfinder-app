ÕAt 2nd level, a brazen deceiver has mastered the art of using magic without being detected. The brazen deceiver gains Spellsong as a bonus feat. Observers do not automatically recognize his bardic performances as anything other than ordinary speech or performance. Those specifically looking for abnormal effects must succeed at a Sense Motive check (DC = 10 + half the brazen deceiver's bard level + the brazen deceiver's Charisma modifier) to detect his performances.ª4
