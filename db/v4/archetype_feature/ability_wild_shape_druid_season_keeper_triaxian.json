    "text": "A season keeper gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level â€“ 2. If she has imbued her animal companion with the spirit of winter, she uses her full druid level when taking on the form of an ice elemental. If she has imbued her companion with the spirit of summer, she uses her full druid level when taking on the form of a plant. A season keeper cannot use wild shape to assume the form of an elemental except an ice elemental, and can assume that shape only if her animal companion has the spirit of winter. Similarly, she can assume a plant form only if her animal companion has the spirit of summer."
