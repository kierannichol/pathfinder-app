ÂAt 17th level, a vengeful hunter can, once per day, use his vengeance ability against any creature--even one that has not harmed him. If the target is also one that has damaged him since the beginning of his last turn, the bleed damage increases to 3d6 and the target is sickened for as long as the bleed effect continues.ª7
