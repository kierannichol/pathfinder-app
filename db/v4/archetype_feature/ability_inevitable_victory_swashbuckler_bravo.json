    "text": "The bravo\u0027s technique is all about flair; a display of her skill is enough to make any brawler reconsider picking a fight. At 3rd level, the bravo gains Dazzling Display as a bonus feat. She can activate its effect only while wielding a dueling sword, and she must spend 1 panache point to do so."
