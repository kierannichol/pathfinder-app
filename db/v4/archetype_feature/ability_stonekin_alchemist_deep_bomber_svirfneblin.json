    "text": "At 6th level, the deep bomber automatically learns tree shape as a 2nd-level extract, except instead of a tree, he takes the form of a stalagmite that is the same size as his current size. At 7th level, he automatically learns meld into stone as a 3rd-level extract.\nThis ability replaces swift poisoning."
