ÍAt 10th level, a fey callers can reshape the nearby area at his whim, as he pulls in aspects of the mutable and primal fey. To use this ability, he must expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher as a standard action and succeed at a DC 15 Charisma check. If he succeeds, he can apply one of the following planar traits to the area in a 60-foot radius for 2d4 minutes: normal gravity, heavy gravity, light gravity, mildly aligned (chaos, evil, good, or law), enhanced magic, or impeded magic.
At 15th level, he can instead expend a slot of 7th level or higher and attempt a DC 20 Charisma check. If successfully, he can apply two planar traits from the previous list, or any one of the following traits: no gravity, subjective directional gravity, erratic time, fire-dominant, water-dominant, negative-dominant, positive-dominant, or wild magic.ª-
