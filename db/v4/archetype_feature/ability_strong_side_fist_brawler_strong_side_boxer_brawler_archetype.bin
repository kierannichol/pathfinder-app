¯	A strong-side boxer can spend 1 minute to wrap one of her hands in rope or cord. The strong-side boxer can carry items or wield weapons in a wrapped hand, but she takes a â€“2 penalty on Dexterity-based skill checks that requires the use of that hand (such as Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks). Unwrapping a hand is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
At 3rd level, as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a strong-side boxer can dip her wrapped hand in resin and then crushed glass or small metal spikes, which remain on her wrapped hand for 1 hour. If she chooses crushed glass, she can deal slashing damage with her unarmed strikes; if she chooses spikes, she can deal piercing damage with her unarmed strikes for the duration. Whether she chooses crushed glass or metal spikes, she deals an additional 1 point of bleed damage with her unarmed strikes. At 7th level, the bleed damage increases to 1d4. At 11th level, the bleed damage increases to 1d6. At 15th level, the bleed damage increases to 2d4. At 19th level, the bleed damage is multiplied on a critical hit. Bleed damage from this ability does not stack with bleed damage from other sources.ªK
