ªWhen the mixologist creates a bomb, he can cause the detonation to produce intoxicating fumes. A creature that takes a direct hit from an alcoholic bomb becomes tipsy if it fails a Fortitude saving throw. If the creature is already tipsy, it becomes drunk instead. If the creature is already drunk, it becomes soused instead. A soused creature that fails its Fortitude saving throw passes out for 1d3 hours and wakes up with a hangover. This ability counts as a discovery that modifies bombs, so it doesn't stack with other discoveries that modify bombs.ª3
