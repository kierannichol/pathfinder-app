Vile Cursearchetype_featureclass_feature¢½
ºAt 10th level, the hagbound becomes exceptionally skilled at cursing others. She can cast bestow curse at will, but its duration becomes 24 hours. Once a creature has been affected by this ability, it is immune to the witch's vile curse ability for 24 hours. If the witch learns some secret fear or vulnerability of her target and tailors the curse to exploit this, her target takes a â€“2 penalty on its Will saving throw against the effect.ª(
