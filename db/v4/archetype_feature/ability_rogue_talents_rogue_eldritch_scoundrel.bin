¹At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the eldritch scoundrel gains a rogue or ninja talent for which she meets the prerequisites (treating her rogue level as her ninja level). If a talent requires her to expend points from her ki pool, she can instead expend a spell slot with a spell level equal to the number of ki points she would normally expend. If a talent functions only if she has ki in her ki pool, it functions as long as she still has a spell of 1st level or higher prepared. At 12th level, she can select an advanced talent in place of a rogue talent.ª5
