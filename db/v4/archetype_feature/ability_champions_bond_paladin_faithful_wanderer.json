    "text": "At 5th level, a faithful wanderer must choose the weapon option of her divine bond class feature. At 20th level, whenever her divine bond is active, she gains several additional benefits, as follows: Her DR improves to 5/--. Additionally, if she rolls a natural 20 on an attack roll against an evil outsider and confirms the critical hit, the outsider is also subject to banishment, using the faithful wanderer\u0027s paladin level as the caster level (her weapon and holy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). Finally, whenever she uses lay on hands to heal herself, she heals the maximum possible amount of hit points."
