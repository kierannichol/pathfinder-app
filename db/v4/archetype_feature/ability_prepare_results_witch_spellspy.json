    "text": "At 4th level, a spellspy\u0027s familiar can store the results of divinations for the purposes of providing false results to a rival diviner who has targeted the spellspy. As a standard action, the spellspy can store the results of one or more divinations she has cast within the past 24 hours. She can store results from any number of spells with a total spell level equal to the highest spell she can cast.\nThe next time a rival spellcaster would receive results from any of the specific divinations whose results are stored in her familiar in this manner, the stored results are transmitted to the rival caster (and are removed from the familiar) in place of any real results.\nThe rival spellcaster receives a Will saving throw (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 the spellspy\u0027s witch level + her Intelligence modifier) to recognize that the results are falsified.\nDepending on the spell, the stored results from the familiar might make this falsification obvious (and thus no Will saving throw is necessary to determine the falsification).\nThis ability replaces the witch\u0027s 4th-level hex.\nHexes: The following witch hexes complement the spellspy archetype: beast of ill-omen, evil eye, and tongues.\nMajor Hexes: The following major hexes complement the spellspy witch archetype: Beast Eye, hag\u0027s eye, and vision."
