£At 4th level, a shadow rebel gains the ability to cast misdirection on herself once per day, though instead of choosing an object for the second target, she must choose a creature in range. The caster level for this ability is equal to her class level, and the save DC for this spell is 12 + the shadow rebel's Intelligence modifier. The save DC of this ability increases by 1 if the secondary target is lawful or evil.ª.
