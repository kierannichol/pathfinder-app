    "text": "Whenever a nornkith makes an unarmed strike, she can cause shimmering silver shears to manifest around the blow, causing the unarmed strike to count as silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, she gains Improved Critical (unarmed strike) as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites."
