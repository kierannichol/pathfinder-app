©At 4th level, while in studied terrain, a cartographer intuitively knows the easiest, shortest, and fastest way through the wilderness. For the purpose of determining overland speed, the cartographer treats any trackless terrain as though he were on a trail, and he treats any terrain with a road or trail as though it were a highway. He can extend the benefit to up to one creature per investigator level traveling with him.ª6
