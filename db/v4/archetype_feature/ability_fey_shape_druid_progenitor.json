    "text": "A progenitor never gains the ability to use wild shape to transform into an elemental.\nAt 6th level, a progenitor can use wild shape to change into a Small or Medium fey. When doing so, her wild shape functions as fey form I.\nAt 8th level, a progenitor can use wild shape to change into a Tiny or Large fey. When she does so, her wild shape functions as fey form II.\nAt 10th level, a progenitor can use wild shape to change into a Diminutive or Huge fey. When she does so, her wild shape functions as fey form III.\nAt 14th level, when a progenitor uses wild shape to assume a fey form, her wild shape functions as fey form IV."
