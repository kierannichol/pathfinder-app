    "text": "A spirit binder must select a familiar for his arcane bond. Unlike in a normal familiar-summoning ritual, a spirit binder created his special familiar through a dangerous ritual catalyzed by the death of a loved one. Before the loved one\u0027s spirit fully passed on, the spirit binder was able to bind the spirit to an animal or vermin, which then became his familiar.\nA soulbound familiar\u0027s personality is that of the lost loved one, rather than a servant of the spirit binder. It can have any alignment, even one that is diametrically opposed to the spirit binder\u0027s. A soulbound familiar has the base attack bonus and base saving throws of the loved one\u0027s favored class (using the spirit binder\u0027s level as its level). If the loved one died before the beginning of the campaign, the spirit binder selects the familiar\u0027s favored class at 1st level and it cannot be changed."
