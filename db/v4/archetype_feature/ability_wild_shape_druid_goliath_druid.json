    "text": "Druids\u0027 ability to wild shape into a creature of the animal type allows a goliath druid to assume only the form of a dinosaur or megafauna. She doesn\u0027t gain the ability to become an elemental or plant.\nAt 6th level, the goliath druid can use wild shape to become a Large humanoid of the giant subtype. This functions as the alter self spell, except the goliath druid gains a +4 size bonus to Strength, a â€“2 penalty to Dexterity, and a +1 natural armor bonus. If the Large humanoid form she takes has rock throwing, she gains rock throwing (range 40 feet, 1d8 damage). If the form has the aquatic subtype, she gains the aquatic and amphibious subtypes.\nAt 12th level, when taking the form of a giant, the goliath druid\u0027s wild shape functions as giant form I.\nAt 14th level, the goliath druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge giant. When taking the form of a giant, the goliath druid\u0027s wild shape functions as giant form II."
