    "text": "At 2nd level, a guerrilla learns to use darkness to her advantage. She gains a +5 bonus on Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks while she is in areas of dim light or darkness, and can create mundane disguises in dim light or darkness with a full-round action (instead of the normal 1d3 × 10 minutes). Additionally, while in dim light or darkness, if a guerrilla would have concealment, she instead has total concealment."
