    "text": "At 1st level, when a bogborn alchemist uses a mutagen, he may choose to have his mutagen form enhanced for aquatic movement. This gives him the amphibious special quality, his feet elongate, and the webbing between his fingers and toes expands, granting a swim speed of 15 feet.\nThis replaces throw anything.\nDiscovery Options: A bogborn alchemist can select the toxic skin grippli racial trait in place of an alchemical discovery."
