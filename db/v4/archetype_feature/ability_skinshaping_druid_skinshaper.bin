«At 4th level, a skinshaper gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium humanoid and back again once per day. This ability functions as per alter self, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until the skinshaper changes back. Changing form is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The skinshaper must be familiar with the form she has chosen. She can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every 2 druid levels thereafter, up to a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, she can use skinshaping at will.
The skinshaper learns to intuitively use her body as a weapon. While skinshaping, she gains the benefit of the Improved Unarmed Strike feat, and her unarmed strike deals damage as if she were a monk with a monk level equal to her druid level â€“ 3.
At 6th level, a skinshaper gains the ability to channel the versatile nature of humanoids to enhance her body and mind. Whenever she uses skinshaping to assume a humanoid shape other than her own, she gains a +2 enhancement bonus to any one ability score. The bonus persists as long as she remains in that form. At 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, she gains an additional +2 enhancement bonus to one ability score. She can distribute these bonuses as she wishes in increments of +2, but the enhancement bonus on any single ability score cannot exceed +4.
At 8th level, a skinshaper can imitate humanoid creatures even more accurately. She gains any of the following abilities that the form she assumes has: darkvision 90 feet, low-light vision, scent, climb 60 feet, fly 60 feet (good maneuverability), swim 60 feet, ferocity, orc ferocity, and hold breath. If the form she assumes has the aquatic subtype, she gains the aquatic subtype and the amphibious special quality.
At 12th level, a skinshaper can access the racial memory of the humanoid she is imitating. If the form she assumes has any of the following racial abilities, she gains those abilities: defensive training, hatred, poison use, sneak attack +2d6, stability, and weapon familiarity.
Additionally, she can speak any racial languages of the chosen form.
At 16th level, a skinshaper gains the racial skill bonuses of the imitated humanoid, to a maximum of a +4 bonus on a given skill. The skinshaper cannot benefit from any variable racial skill bonuses associated with the chosen form (such as gnomesâ€˜ racial bonus on any one Craft or Profession skill).ª+
