Skill Bondarchetype_featureclass_feature¢ê
çAt 3rd level, a courtly hunter's animal companion gains the courtly hunter's class skills as class skills. Her animal companion can use the courtly hunter's skill ranks in a skill in place of its own, but only to a maximum of the courtly hunter's hunter level (for instance, if a character had 3 levels in courtly hunter and 5 ranks in Diplomacy, her animal companion could either share 3 ranks with skill bond or use its own ranks, whichever would result in a higher total skill bonus).ª/
