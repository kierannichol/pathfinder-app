    "text": "At 3rd level, the blade adept\u0027s bonded sword becomes a powerful, sentient black blade. The blade advances as a black blade using the blade adept\u0027s class level in place of the magus\u0027s class level and points from her arcane reservoir in place of the magus\u0027s arcane pool. A blade adept with this class feature cannot have a familiar of any kind, even from another class.\nThis ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 3rd level."
