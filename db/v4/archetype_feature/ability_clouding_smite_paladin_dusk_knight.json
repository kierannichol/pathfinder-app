    "text": "At 11th level, a dusk knight\u0027s smite impairs her foe\u0027s abilities in the dark. When a dusk knight successfully smites a foe, she reduces the target\u0027s darkvision by 60 feet for the duration of the smite. If the target has the see in darkness ability, it must succeed at a Fortitude save or lose this ability for the duration of the smite. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the dusk knight\u0027s paladin level + her Charisma modifier."
