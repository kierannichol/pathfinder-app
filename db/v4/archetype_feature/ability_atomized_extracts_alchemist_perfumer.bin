ÆA perfumer's extracts are stored in atomizers, rather than bottles or vials, allowing him to spray them at himself or an adjacent ally. The target is considered the imbiber, as if she had drunk an extract prepared with the infusion discovery. As the contents of an atomizer are inhaled, the target must be able to breathe. Atomized extracts are considered extracts for purposes of other abilities, and become inert when not in the alchemist's possession.ª3
