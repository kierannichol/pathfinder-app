ìAt 4th level, an esoteric's arcane pool is also considered a ki pool for the purposes of meeting feat and ability requirements. Points from an esoteric's arcane pool can be used for abilities that normally require ki. If an esoteric gains a ki pool, he can use points from his arcane pool and ki pool interchangeably (though not special points such as drunken ki).ª'
