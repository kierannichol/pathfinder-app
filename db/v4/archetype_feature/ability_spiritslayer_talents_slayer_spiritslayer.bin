Ô	A spiritslayer can select the following slayer talents, in addition to general slayer talents.
Disrupt Possession (Ex): Whenever a spiritslayer with this talent deals sneak attack damage to a creature that is being possessed, he also deals his sneak attack damage to the possessing entity. Once per round, a possessed creature that is damaged by disrupt possession can attempt a new Will saving throw to end the possession, gaining a +1 bonus on its save for each sneak attack damage die the spiritslayer rolled. This talent alters the spiritslayer's sneak attack, and doesn't stack with other talents that alter sneak attack. A spiritslayer must be at least 8th level before selecting this talent.
Greater Spirit Sense: A spiritslayer who selects this talent gains Greater Blind-Fight as a bonus feat, ignoring its prerequisites. In addition, he adds 1/2 his slayer level to his Perception checks to pinpoint the location of ethereal creatures, and once per round he can attempt a Perception check to pinpoint the locations of all invisible creatures within 30 feet of him without needing to take an action. A spiritslayer must be at least 10th level and have the improved spirit sense spiritslayer talent before selecting this talent.ª7
