èAt 12th level, a sin monk can spend a swift action and one daily use of Stunning Fist to draw his sinful nature to the fore of his consciousness.
The next person he hits with a melee attack before the end of his next turn must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the sin monk's class level + his Wisdom modifier) or suffer the burden of the sin monk's sins. The target is treated as if she were carrying a load one step heavier (from a light load to a medium load, and so on) and must succeed at a caster level check to use any form of teleportation (DC = 10 + the monk's class level). This is a curse effect that lasts a number of rounds equal to the sin monk's Wisdom modifier unless it is removed through remove curse or a similar effect.ª,
