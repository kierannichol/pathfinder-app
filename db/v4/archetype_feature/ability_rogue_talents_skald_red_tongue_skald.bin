ÇAt 7th level, the red tongue learns a rogue talent of his choice, treating his skald level as his rogue level. He cannot select a talent that requires or modifies a class feature he does not have (such as sneak attack), and he must meet all other prerequisites.
For every 5 skald levels beyond 7th, he gains a new rogue talent.ª3
