¸A covenbane's magical scars throb in the presence of magic. A covenbane adds half his level (minimum +1) on Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks to identify, recognize, or track a hag, arcane spellcaster, or creature with spell-like abilities. He can also use his hag sense to recognize whether someone within 30 feet of him is using magic to hide her true form. To do this, he must succeed at a Perception check against a DC equal to 15 + the target's CR; success indicates the presence of a magical disguise, but it does not reveal the creature's true form.ª)
