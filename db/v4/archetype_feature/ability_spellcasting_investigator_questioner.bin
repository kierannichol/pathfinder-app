”
A questioner casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a questioner must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The saving throw DC against a questioner's spell is equal to 10 + the spell's level + the questioner's Intelligence modifier.
Like other spellcasters, a questioner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. He knows the same number of spells and receives the same number of spell slots per day as a bard of his investigator level, including for cantrips. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence score.
At 5th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter, a questioner can learn a new spell in place of one he already knows, using the same rules as a bard. In effect, the questioner loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the questioner can cast.
A questioner need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any bard spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.ª3
