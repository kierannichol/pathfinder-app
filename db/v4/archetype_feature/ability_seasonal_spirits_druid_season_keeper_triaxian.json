    "text": "Starting at 1st level, each day when she prepares spells, a season keeper can imbue her animal companion with the spirit of summer or the spirit of winter.\nSpirit of Summer: The season keeper\u0027s animal companion projects a 15-foot-radius aura of cooling and vigor. Allies in the aura can exist comfortably in hot conditions as if they each had the seasoned racial ability of a Triaxian. At 3rd level, the aura increases the power of the season keeper\u0027s healing magic--whenever the season keeper targets an ally with a spell that has the healing descriptor, the target also gains fast healing 2 for a number of rounds equal to the spell\u0027s level. At 9th level, allies within the aura leave no trails in natural grassy or forest environments, thus can\u0027t be tracked in such terrain. At 15th level, the duration of the fast healing effect increases to 2 rounds per spell level and affected allies can ignore difficult terrain caused by natural undergrowth such as non-magical thorns, briars, overgrowth, and similar terrain. Spirit of Winter: The season keeper\u0027s animal companion projects a 15-foot-radius aura of warmth and calm. This aura allows allies to exist comfortably in cold conditions as if they each had the seasoned racial ability of a Triaxian. At 3rd level, allies gain resistance 10 to cold as long as they remain within the aura. At 9th level, affected allies leave no trails in natural snow or ice, thus can\u0027t be tracked in such terrain. At 15th level, affected allies gain resistance 20 to cold and can ignore difficult terrain caused by ice or snow."
