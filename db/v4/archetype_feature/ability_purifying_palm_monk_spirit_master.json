    "text": "At 15th level, the spirit master gains the ability to alter the balance of positive and negative energy within an opponent\u0027s body. The spirit master can make a purifying palm attack once per day, and must announce his intention before making a melee attack roll. If his attack deals damage, the target must attempt a Will save (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 the spirit master\u0027s class level + the spirit master\u0027s Wisdom modifier). On a failed save, the target cannot channel energy, nor can it be healed by positive or negative energy. This effect lasts for 1 round per class level. If the target is an undead creature, it must succeed at its Will save or be instantly destroyed."
