    "text": "At 1st level, an interrogator uses his skill with alchemy to create injections. Each day, an interrogator can create a number of injections equal to his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier. It takes 1 hour to create the injections. An injection is inert until the interrogator attempts to use it.\nUsing an injection is a standard action that requires a melee touch attack. If the attack hits, the target of an injection takes a â€“2 penalty on its Will saving throws for a number of minutes equal to half the interrogator\u0027s class level (minimum 1). If the interrogator is also using a serum with this injection, the penalty on Will saves applies to any save against the serum.\nIf the melee touch attack fails, the injection isn\u0027t delivered but can still be used again--once activated, it remains potent for 1 day. An injection that hasn\u0027t been administered becomes inert if it leaves the interrogator\u0027s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his possession. The penalties from multiple injections don\u0027t stack, nor do the penalties from injections stack with penalties from a mesmerist\u0027s stare or a witch\u0027s evil eye hex.\nInjections are mind-affecting poison effects."
