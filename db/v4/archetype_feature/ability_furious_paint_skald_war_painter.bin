	By spending 10 minutes preparing and applying special paints to his or an ally's skin, a war painter can create patterns that store the effects of one of his raging songs. The war painter must expend 1 or more rounds of his raging song class ability while anointing the ally, and the paint retains its potency until the war painter recovers his daily uses of raging song. The ally can activate the paint as a move action, gaining the benefits of the raging song, including any rage powers as appropriate.
This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the rounds of raging song the war painter expended + the war painter's ranks in Craft (calligraphy, paintings, or tattoos)--but no more than double the number of rounds of raging song expended. By halving the remaining number of rounds of raging song, an ally can suspend the paint's effects as a free action and activate the paint again later as a move action.
A war painter cab apply the effects of any feats that affect bardic performance to his furious paint, except effects that extend the effects of performances, such as the Lingering Song feat. A creature can be subject to only one application of furious paint at a time.ª.
