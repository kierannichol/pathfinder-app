    "text": "At 4th level, a sunrider can extend the bond she shares with her horse to other nearby mounted companions, forming them into a fighting force that seems to share a single mind. Allied mounts within 60 feet of the sunrider gain evasion as per the animal companion special ability. At 6th level, the range expands to 90 feet and allied mounts gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to their speed. At 8th level, the range expands to 120 feet and allied mounts gain devotion as per the animal companion special ability. At 10th level, allied mounts gain multiattack as per the animal companion special ability. At 12th level, allied mounts gain a +2 bonus on saving throws. At 14th level, allied mounts gain a +20-foot enhancement bonus to their speed. At 16th level, allied mounts gain improved evasion as per the animal companion special ability. At 18th level, allied mounts gain a +2 dodge bonus to their Armor Class and a +2 bonus on attack rolls. At 20th level, allied mounts gain DR 5/- and energy resistance 10 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic damage. These abilities function only while allied mounts are within range of the sunrider (her own mount always counts as an ally)."
