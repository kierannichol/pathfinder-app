    "text": "A speaker of the Palatine Eye can make it appear as if a corpse is speaking, similar to ventriloquism.\nA creature must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC \u003d 10 + half the bard\u0027s level + the bard\u0027s Charisma modifier) to see through the ruse. A creature that fails the saving throw is convinced that the corpse is speaking of its own volition."
