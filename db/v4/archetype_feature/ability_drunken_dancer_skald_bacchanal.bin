Ú	At 2nd level, while maintaining a raging song, a bacchanal can consume a berry affected by goodberry, a potion, or a serving of alcohol as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A berry affected by goodberry or a potion has its normal effect, while an alcoholic drink or a berry affected by goodberry via fermented fruit (see above) allows the skald to maintain his raging song that round without expending a round of raging song for the day (instead of the normal effects of the alcohol or fermented berry). For each alcoholic drink or fermented berry consumed while raging, the skald is nauseated for 1 round after his raging song ends. The internal fortitude rage power prevents this nauseated condition from occurring.
At 7th level, when the bacchanal consumes an alcoholic drink or fermented berry while maintaining his rage song, he can gain the benefits of cure light wounds or remove fear (for the duration of the raging song) at his caster level by spending 2 rounds of raging song. At 12th level, the bacchanal can gain the benefits of heroism (for the duration of the raging song) in this manner. At 17th level, he can gain the benefits of persistent vigor (for the duration of the raging song) in this manner.ª-
