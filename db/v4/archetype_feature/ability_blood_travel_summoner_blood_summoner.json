    "text": "At 8th level, a blood summoner can use his maker\u0027s call ability to allow his eidolon to travel through the blood of other creatures instead of bringing it to his side.\nThe eidolon can either emerge from the blood of a living creature within range that has fewer than its maximum hit points remaining, or burst from the corpse of a Small or larger creature within range that has been dead for no longer than 1 minute. If the eidolon emerges from an injured creature, that creature takes 4d6 points of damage, which is halved if the creature succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 the blood summoner\u0027s level + his Charisma modifier).\nThe eidolon appears in its choice of the nearest unoccupied square to the creature or corpse it emerged from, and is staggered for 1 round."
