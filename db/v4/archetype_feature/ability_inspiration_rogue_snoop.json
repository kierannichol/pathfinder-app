The snoop begins with an inspiration pool equal to half her rogue level plus her Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Unlike an investigator, a snoop can only use inspiration on skill checks, not on attack rolls or saving throws. This ability is otherwise identical to the investigator class ability of the same name."
