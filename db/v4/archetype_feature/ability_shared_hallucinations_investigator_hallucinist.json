    "text": "At 3rd level, a hallucinist under the effects of his hallucinogen can share and manipulate his hallucinatory revelations. By expending 10 minutes of the duration of his hallucinogen or one use of inspiration, he can create an effect similar to minor image or oneiric horror. At 5th level, he can create an effect similar to synesthesia.\nAny of the effects remain only while the hallucinist concentrates upon it, for up to 1 round per hallucinist\u0027s investigator level, but otherwise function as the spell.\nThe DC of saving throws against these effects is equal to 10 + 1/2 the hallucinist\u0027s investigator level + his modifier.\nAt 9th level, a hallucinist can expend 10 minutes of the duration of the hallucinogen or one use of inspiration to use aura alteration on one creature or object (unlike the other three abilities, this does not require concentration)."
