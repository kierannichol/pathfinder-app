    "text": "At 4th level, whenever an esquire challenges an opponent when his aide-de-camp is within 30 feet, he may grant his aide-de-camp bonuses equal to one-half of the bonuses he gains from challenge, including bonuses derived from the cavalier\u0027s order. If the aide-decamp is also a cavalier and challenges the same target, these bonuses do not stack. Like the esquire, his aide-decamp takes a â€“2 penalty to Armor Class against attacks from creatures other than the challenged opponent."
