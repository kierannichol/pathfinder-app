®At 7th level, a deep diver gains a swim speed equal to his unmodified base speed. Because he has a swim speed, he gains the standard +8 bonus on Swim checks to perform a special action or evade a hazard, the ability to take 10 on a Swim check even if distracted or threatened, and the ability to use the run action while swimming if he swims in a straight line. If he already has a swim speed, his swim speed increases by 10 feet.ª3
