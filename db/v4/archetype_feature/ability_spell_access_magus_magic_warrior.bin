ûAt 19th level, a Magic Warrior learns ancient secrets to using natural magic. She learns seven spells from the druid's spell list and places them in her spellbook as magus spells of the same level at which they appear on the druid spell list. She gains one druid spell not on the magus spell list for each of the listed spell levels: 0 level, 1st level, 2nd level, 3rd level, 4th level, 5th level, and 6th level.
She can ignore the divine focus component of these spells.
This replaces greater spell access.ª/
