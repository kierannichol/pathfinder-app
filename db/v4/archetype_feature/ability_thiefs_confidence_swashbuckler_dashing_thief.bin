³A dashing thief's panache is fueled by bold acts of thievery. Whenever a dashing thief uses the steal combat maneuver to steal an object worth at least 100 gp x her class level from an opponent, she regains 1 panache point. She cannot regain panache in this way from a given opponent more than once per day.ª;
