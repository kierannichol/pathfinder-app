«A solacer adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on Heal checks and can attempt Knowledge checks untrained.
At 5th level, a solacer can take 10 on checks with any Knowledge skill he has ranks in. The solacer can choose not to take 10 and can instead roll normally. In addition, once per day, the solacer can take 20 on any Heal check, though this does not affect the time it takes to perform the task attempted. He can use this ability one additional time per day for every 6 bard levels he has beyond 5th, to a maximum of three times per day at 17th level.ª-
