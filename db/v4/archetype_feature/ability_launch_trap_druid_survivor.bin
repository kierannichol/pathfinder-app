±At 9th level, a survivor can affix a magical ranger trap to an arrow or thrown weapon, allowing her to set the trap remotely or use it as a direct attack. Attaching the trap to the projectile is part of the full-round action of creating a new trap. The trapped projectile is fired or thrown in the normal manner. If the projectile is fired at a square, the trap is treated as if the survivor had set the trap in that square, except the DC is 5 lower than normal. If the projectile is fired at a creature, the target takes damage from the ranged weapon and is treated as if it had triggered the trap (saving throw applies, if any). The attack has a maximum range of 60 feet, and range increments apply to the attack roll. The duration of the trapped projectile starts from when it is created, not from when it is used.ª)
