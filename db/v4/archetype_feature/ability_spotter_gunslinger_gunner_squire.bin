„At 1st level, as a standard action, a gunner squire can spend 1 grit point to pinpoint a target within her line of sight and inform her knightly liege of the target's exact location. During the knight's next turn, if he makes a ranged attack against the pinpointed target and would take a penalty on his attack roll due to range, he may reduce this penalty by an amount equal to his gunner squire's Wisdom modifier (to a minimum penalty of 0). The gunner squire must be adjacent to her liege and able to communicate to use this deed, though a knight may move away from the gunner squire during his turn and still gain the benefits of this deed.ª/
