€An experienced smuggler knows how to smooth over interactions with customs officials. At 3rd level, when dealing with officials working at a checkpoint, conducting an inspection, or performing another such activity, a smuggler can make a Diplomacy check opposed by the presiding official's Sense Motive check to ensure her contraband makes it through. She gains a +1 bonus on this Diplomacy check. On a successful check, the smuggler pays a small bribe (5d4 gp) to guarantee her cargo remains undisturbed. This bonus rises to +2 when the smuggler reaches 6th level, +3 at 9th level, +4 at 12th level, +5 at 15th level, and +6 at 18th level.ª%
