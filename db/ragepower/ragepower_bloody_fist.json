  "description": "Once per rage, the barbarian may attempt to punch through an opponent’s flesh and rip out one of its vital organs. In order to do so, the barbarian must confirm a critical hit against an opponent with a natural attack or unarmed strike. The barbarian deals damage as normal for a critical hit and the opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 the barbarian’s class level + the barbarian’s Strength modifier) or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage as one of its vital organs is ripped free from its body."
