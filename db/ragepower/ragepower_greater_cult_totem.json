  "description": "While the barbarian is raging, when she takes hit point damage that would render her dying or dead, she remains conscious and raging until the end of her next turn after taking that damage, though she is disabled during that turn. She becomes dying or dead at the end of her next turn as normal for her current hit point total. This ability has no effect if the barbarian dies from a cause other than hit point damage, such as from a death effect or if her Constitution damage exceeds her Constitution score."
