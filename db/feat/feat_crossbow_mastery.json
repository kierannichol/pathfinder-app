  "description": "You can load crossbows with blinding speed and even fire them in melee with little fear of reprisal.",
  "prerequisites": "Dex 15, Point-Blank Shot, Rapid Reload, Rapid Shot.",
  "prerequisitesFormula": "@dex_score \u003e\u003d 15 AND @feat:point_blank_shot AND @feat:rapid_reload AND @feat:rapid_shot",
  "benefit": "The time required for you to reload any type of crossbow is reduced to a free action, regardless of the type of crossbow used. You can fire a crossbow as many times in a full attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow. Reloading a crossbow for the type of crossbow you chose when you took Rapid Reload no longer provokes attacks of opportunity.",
  "special": "Starting at 6th level, a ranger with the archery combat style may select Crossbow Mastery as a combat style feat.",
