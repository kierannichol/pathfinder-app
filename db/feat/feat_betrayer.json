  "benefit": "When you succeed at a Diplomacy check to change a creature\u0027s attitude, you can draw a weapon and make a single melee attack against that creature as an immediate action. If you changed your target\u0027s attitude to friendly or better, your target is considered flat-footed against this attack. If the target survives, it takes a -2 penalty on its initiative check for this combat. Once you attack a creature, its attitude becomes hostile.",
