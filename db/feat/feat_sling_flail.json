  "benefit": "You can make melee attacks using your loaded sling, using that weapon\u0027s normal statistics but treating it as a flail. Using a sling in this way does not expend mundane ammunition, but magical or masterwork ammunition loses its special properties after a single hit.",
  "special": "Any feats you have that apply when you use a flail also apply when you use a loaded sling as a melee weapon.",
