  "description": "You can blend the power of your performance and spellcasting.",
  "prerequisites": "Cha 13, bardic performance class ability, able to cast 1st-level spells.",
  "prerequisitesFormula": "@cha_score \u003e\u003d 13 AND @ability:bardic_performance#bard AND @spells_per_day#1",
  "benefit": "You can combine your bardic performance and your spellcasting in two ways. First, you can conceal the activity of casting a bard spell by masking it in a performance. As a swift action, you may combine your casting time of a spell with a Perform check. Observers must make a Perception or Sense Motive check opposed by your Perform check to realize you are also casting a spell. This uses 1 round of your bardic performance ability, regardless of the spell\u0027s casting time. Second, as a move action, you can use 1 round of bardic performance to maintain a bard spell with a duration of concentration. You can cast another spell in the same round you are using bardic magic to maintain concentration; if you do this, your concentration on the maintained spell ends when you end the bardic performance the spell is part of.",
