  "prerequisitesFormula": "@feat:improved_unarmed_strike AND @feat:janni_style AND @feat:janni_tempest AND @skill:acrobatics \u003e\u003d 8 AND @skill:perform#dance \u003e\u003d 8 AND  !@feat:janni_rush",
  "benefit": "While using Janni Style, you are always considered to have a running start when jumping. Further, if you jump as part of a charge and make an unarmed strike against the designated opponent, a hit allows you to roll the unarmed strike\u0027s damage dice twice and add the results together before adding modifiers (such as from Strength) or extra dice (such as precision-based damage or dice from weapon abilities). The extra damage dice are not multiplied on a successful critical hit.",
