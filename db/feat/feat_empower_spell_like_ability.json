The creature can use that ability as an empowered spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).

The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 its caster level (round down) - 2. For a summary, see the table in the description of the Quicken Spell-Like Ability feat on page 316.",
