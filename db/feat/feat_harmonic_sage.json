Success on this check allows you to do one of the following. Self-Harmonize: By performing over the acoustic reverberations of your performance, you increase the DC of your bardic performance effects +1. Reverberation: You can choose to have the effect of your current bardic performance continue for 1 round after you cease maintaining it, regardless of why you cease maintaining it. You can still have no more than one bardic performance in effect at one time.",
