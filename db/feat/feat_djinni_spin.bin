Creatures adjacent to you take your unarmed strike damage plus the electricity damage from your Elemental Fist and are deafened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from being deafened.RUltimate Combat
