  "name": "Pass For Human",
  "types": ["FEAT_TYPE_GENERAL"],
  "description": "You\u0027re easily mistaken for a human rather than a member of your own race.",
  "prerequisites": "Half-elf, half-orc, or halfling (see Special).",
  "prerequisitesFormula": "(@race \u003d\u003d \u0027Half-elf\u0027 OR @race \u003d\u003d \u0027half-orc\u0027 OR @race \u003d\u003d \u0027halfling\u0027)",
  "benefit": "You receive a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to disguise yourself as a human, and do not receive the penalty for disguising yourself as a member of another race when you do so. In areas largely populated or settled by humans, you can take 10 on your Disguise check, meaning most people tend to assume you are human unless given a reason to think otherwise.",
  "special": "A half ling may take this feat, but must have the Childlike feat as a prerequisite. The benefits of the two feats stack.",
