  "description": "You can choose to channel positive and negative energy.",
  "prerequisites": "Channel energy class feature, necromancer or neutrally aligned cleric (see below).",
  "prerequisitesFormula": "(@ability:channel_positive_energy OR @ability:channel_negative_energy) AND (@alignment \u003d\u003d \u0027ng\u0027 OR @alignment \u003d\u003d \u0027n\u0027 OR @alignment \u003d\u003d \u0027ne\u0027) AND  !@feat:versatile_channeler",
  "benefit": "You may make a choice whenever you use your channel energy class feature. If you normally channel positive energy, you may choose to channel negative energy as if your effective cleric level were 2 levels lower than normal. If you normally channel negative energy, you may choose to channel positive energy as if your effective cleric level were 2 levels lower than normal. Having this feat means you qualify for feats and abilities that have \"channel positive energy\" or \"channel negative energy\" as a prerequisite (for example, you qualify for the Command Undead feat and the Turn Undead feat).",
