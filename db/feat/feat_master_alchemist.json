  "benefit": "You receive a +2 bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks, and you may create mundane alchemical items much more quickly than normal. When making poisons, you can create a number of doses equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) at one time. These additional doses do not increase the time required, but they do increase the raw material cost. In addition, whenever you make alchemical items or poisons using Craft (alchemy), use the item\u0027s gp value as its sp value when determining your progress (do not multiply the item\u0027s gp cost by 10 to determine its sp cost).",
