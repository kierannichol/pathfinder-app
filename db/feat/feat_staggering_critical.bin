A successful Fortitude save reduces the duration to 1 round. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. The effects of this feat do not stack. Additional hits instead add to the duration.JpYou can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess Critical Mastery.RPZO1110
