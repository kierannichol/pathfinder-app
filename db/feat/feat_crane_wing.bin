Crane Wing"’You move with the speed and finesse of an avian hunter, your sweeping blocks and graceful motions allowing you to deflect melee attacks with ease.*TCrane Style, Dodge, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +5 or monk level 5th.2~(@feat:crane_style AND @feat:dodge AND @feat:improved_unarmed_strike AND @bab >= 5) OR @class:monk >= 5 AND  !@feat:crane_wing:‹Once per round, when fighting defensively with at least one hand free, you can designate one melee attack being made against you before the roll is made. You receive a +4 dodge bonus to AC against that attack. If you are using the total defense action instead, you can deflect one melee attack that would normally hit you. An attack so def lected deals no damage and has no other effect (instead treat it as a miss). You do not expend an action when using this feat, but you must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed.RUltimate Combat
