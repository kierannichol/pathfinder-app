  "name": "Rhetorical Flourish",
  "types": ["FEAT_TYPE_GENERAL"],
  "description": "You rapidly change topics and employ confusing rhetoric to distract people from your true intent.",
  "prerequisites": "Cha 13, Persuasive.",
  "prerequisitesFormula": "@cha_score \u003e\u003d 13 AND @feat:persuasive",
  "benefit": "When using the Diplomacy skill to make a request or change a creature\u0027s attitude, you can use verbal misdirection. To do so, make a Bluff check against that creature. If you succeed, you gain a +4 bonus on your next Diplomacy check against that creature if the check is made within the next minute. If you fail by 5 or more, you instead take a -2 penalty on your next Diplomacy check against that creature. Alternatively, you can use this feat to retry a single failed Diplomacy check against a creature. You take a -4 penalty on your Bluff check when using Rhetorical Flourish in this way. If you succeed, rather than gaining this feat\u0027s normal bonus, you can retry your last Diplomacy check against the creature if that check was made in the past minute.",
