You also force that opponent to succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + half your level + your Str modif ier) or become staggered for 1 round. If you use this feat to render staggered an opponent that is already staggered, you daze that opponent instead. In a similar way, you can stun an opponent that is already dazed.RPZO1118jÆ
