Smite Evil"—
Once per day, a {@class_1} can call out to the powers of good to aid her in her struggle against evil. As a swift action, the {@class_1} chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is evil, the {@class_1} adds her Cha bonus (if any) to her attack rolls and adds her {@class_1} level to all damage rolls made against the target of her smite. If the target of smite evil is an outsider with the evil subtype, an evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the {@class_1} possesses. Regardless of the target, smite evil attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.

In addition, while smite evil is in effect, the {@class_1} gains a deflection bonus equal to her Charisma modifier (if any) to her AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the {@class_1} targets a creature that is not evil, the smite is wasted with no effect.

The smite evil effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the {@class_1} rests and regains her uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the {@class_1} may smite evil one additional time per day, as indicated on Table: {@class_1}, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.
