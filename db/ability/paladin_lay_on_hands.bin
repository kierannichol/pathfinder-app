Each day she can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 her {@class_1} level plus her Charisma modifier. With one use of this ability, a {@class_1} can heal 1d6 hit points of damage for every two {@class_1} levels she possesses. Using this ability is a standard action, unless the {@class_1} targets herself, in which case it is a swift action. Despite the name of this ability, a {@class_1} only needs one free hand to use this ability.

Alternatively, a {@class_1} can use this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures, dealing 1d6 points of damage for every two levels the {@class_1} possesses. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesnâ€™t provoke an attack of opportunity. Undead do not receive a saving throw against this damage.
