ability:master_skaldMaster Skald*ÁAt 20th level, a skaldâ€™s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use. Allies with rage class abilities may use features dependent on those abilities without restriction, such as a barbarianâ€™s rage powers and a bloodragerâ€™s blood casting and bloodline abilities. Finally, when making a full attack, affected allies may make an additional attack each round (as if using a haste effect).
