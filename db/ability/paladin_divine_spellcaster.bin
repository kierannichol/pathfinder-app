paladin:divine_spellcasterSpells ({@class_1})*ƒBeginning at {ordinal(@level)} level, a {@class_1} gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the {@class_1} spell list. A {@class_1} must choose and prepare her spells in advance.

To prepare or cast a spell, a {@class_1} must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a {@class_1}â€™s spell is 10 + the spell level + the {@class_1}â€™s Charisma modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a {@class_1} can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: {@class_1}. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells). When Table: {@class_1} indicates that the {@class_1} gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Charisma score for that spell level.

A {@class_1} must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain her daily allotment of spells. A {@class_1} may prepare and cast any spell on the {@class_1} spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.

Through 3rd level, a {@class_1} has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, her caster level is equal to her {@class_1} level â€“ 3.
