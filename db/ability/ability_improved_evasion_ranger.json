  "name": "Improved Evasion",
  "description": "At 16th level, a ranger\u0027s evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion."
