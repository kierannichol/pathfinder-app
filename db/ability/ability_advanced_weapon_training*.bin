A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighterâ€™s Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.Some advance weapon training options can be selected only if the fighter meets the optionâ€™s prerequisites.Advanced weapon training options function only when the fighter is wielding a weapon from the associated group, unless otherwise noted, and use his weapon training bonus for the associated weapon group. Any bonuses on attack rolls and damage rolls granted by advanced weapon training apply only on attack rolls and damage rolls from weapons in the associated group. A fighter with an archetype that replaces weapon training cannot select advanced weapon training options.
