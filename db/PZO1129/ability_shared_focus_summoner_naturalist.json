    "text": "At 14th level, the naturalist begins to take on some of the feral nature of his eidolon. Whenever the naturalist uses animal focus to grant an aspect to his eidolon, he also gains the effects of the chosen aspect. The naturalist keeps this aspect until his eidolon is dismissed or sent back to its home plane. The naturalist gains the effects of only one aspect, even if the eidolon gains more than one (naturalist\u0027s choice)."
