If the wearer can cast summon monster spells, the wearer adds voidworm to the 3rd-level list of monsters she can summon with those spells, adds naunet to the 6th-level list, and adds imentesh to the 9th-level list. Also, once per day on command the wearer can use this ring to summon a voidworm, as if by the summon monster III spell."
