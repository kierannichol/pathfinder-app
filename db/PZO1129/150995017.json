    "text": "This leather pouch contains a set of black stones, each engraved with a different rune of ill fortune. When used as part of spell kenning, they allow the user to cast spells from the witch spell list. To cast a witch spell, the possessor must spend twice as long casting as for normal spell kenning, and must use a spell slot 1 level higher than normal. If the possessor has the master skald class feature, determine casting time as though he lacked that class feature instead of doubling casting time. The tiles can be used once per day."
