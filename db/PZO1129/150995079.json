    "text": "This +2 countering dueling rapier is particularly well balanced, and features a stout steel ball on the pommel. Three times per day, the wielder can make a surprise melee attack with the pommel as a swift action, as if proficient with the attack and at her normal attack bonus. The attack deals 1d6+2 points of bludgeoning damage, and the critical multiplier is 20/Ã—2."
