If the wearer can cast summon monster spells, the wearer adds doru to the 3rd-level list of monsters he can summon with those spells, adds aghash to the 4th-level list, adds pairaka to the 6th-level list, adds ghawwas to the 7th-level list, adds shira to the 8th-level list, and adds sepid to the 9th-level list. Also, once per day on command the wearer can use this ring to summon a doru, as if by the summon monster III spell."
