    "text": "This cloak is well crafted and stylish. As a swift action, the wearer can direct the cloak to attempt a combat maneuver check to disarm a creature within 5 feet, using the wearer\u0027s CMB. This disarm combat maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the wearer doesn\u0027t risk losing the cloak. The wearer can spend 1 panache point before making the disarm attempt to gain a +5 competence bonus on the combat maneuver check."
