    "text": "This leather collar resizes to fit almost any size of creature. Once per day on command, the creature that fastened the dire collar to the animal can cause that animal to grow larger and more bestial. The collar\u0027s fastener must be within 30 feet of the animal to do so. The animal gains the benefits of an enlarge person spell (despite the normal targeting restrictions of that spell) for 1 minute."
