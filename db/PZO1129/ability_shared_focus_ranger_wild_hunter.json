    "text": "At 7th level, a wild hunter can share his current animal focus with one creature appropriate to his hunter\u0027s bond. If the wild hunter\u0027s bond is with an animal companion, the companion automatically gains the benefits of the wild hunter\u0027s current animal focus. If the wild hunter\u0027s bond is with his companions, as a swift action he can select one bonded ally to gain the benefits of the hunter\u0027s current animal focus; this lasts until the hunter\u0027s bond ends, the animal focus ends for the wild hunter, or the wild hunter selects a different companion."
