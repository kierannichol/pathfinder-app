    "text": "At 3rd level, a spirit guide can form a temporary bond with a spirit, as the shaman\u0027s wandering spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when she refreshes her spells. A spirit guide cannot bond with a spirit that is incompatible with her alignment, ethos, or mystery (GM\u0027s discretion).\nA spirit guide gains one hex of her choice from the list of hexes available from that spirit. She uses her oracle level as her shaman level, and she switches Wisdom for Charisma and vice versa for the purpose of determining the hex\u0027s effects.\nShe uses her oracle level as her shaman level and her Charisma score instead of Wisdom for the purpose of determining its effects.\nAt 4th level, she adds the bonded spirit\u0027s spirit magic spells to her oracle spells known for that day, but only of spell levels she can cast. At 7th level, she gains the spirit ability of her current bonded spirit. At 15th level, she gains the greater spirit ability of her current bonded spirit.\nThis ability replaces the revelations gained at 3rd, 7th, and 15th levels."
