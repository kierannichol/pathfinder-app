    "text": "You cover a solid surface with a layer of sticky glue. Anyone in the area when the spell is cast must attempt a Reflex save. Those who fail become entangled, but can break free by succeeding at a combat maneuver check or an Escape Artist check as a standard action against the DC of this spell. The area of the spell is considered difficult terrain. A creature moving through the glue must succeed at a combat maneuver check or an Escape Artist check as part of its move action (DC \u003d the spell\u0027s DC). Creatures that fail lose their movement and become entangled in the first square they enter."
