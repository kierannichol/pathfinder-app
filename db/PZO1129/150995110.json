    "text": "This diminutive, shiny brass construct looks like a spider made of gears and cogs. It\u0027s roughly the size of an adult human\u0027s hand, and its legs are all picks, chisels, pliers, and other tools of fine manipulation. Its body contains reservoirs of powders and oils it can spray 2 inches out of its nozzle-spinnerets. A fine chain can be played out of a winch on the brass spider\u0027s back, connecting it to a small disk with studs and levers that control the construct\u0027s actions, enabling it to walk and crawl like a spider. It has no autonomous motivation.\nOnce per day, a character holding the brass spider\u0027s chain can use the Disable Device skill from 15 feet away without penalty, though he must have line of sight to the device he is attempting to disable. In most cases, this means any mishap caused by the skill affects the brass spider (which has hardness 5 and 25 hit points) rather than the spider\u0027s controller. Additionally, the brass spider can be used without limit as masterwork thieves\u0027 tools, without the advantage of any additional range."
