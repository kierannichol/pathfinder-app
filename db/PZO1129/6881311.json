    "text": "This glass bottle is filled with sticky goo prized by sailors for the additional traction it grants on ship decks. When applied to the soles of footwear and allowed to dry for 1 hour, liquid traction grants a +2 alchemical bonus on Acrobatics checks to keep your balance and a +2 bonus to CMD against bull rush. Liquid traction has no effect when it comes into contact with very slick or unnaturally slick surfaces such as ice or grease."
