    "text": "Even after cleaning and mending, this traveler\u0027s cloak appears worn and weathered. For wearers with the bardic performance class feature, it grants the use of raging song as a 4th-level skald by spending rounds of bardic performance. For wearers with the raging song class feature, it grants the use of inspire courage and inspire competence as a 4th-level bard by spending rounds of raging song.\nIn addition, each poet\u0027s cloak allows its wearer to grant one specific rage power when using raging song in place of his own rage powers (if any). The specific rage power varies by cloak. It must be usable by a 4th-level skald, and can\u0027t have any prerequisites other than level."
