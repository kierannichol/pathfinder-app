    "text": "This +1 hide armor is always made from the pelt of a migratory herd animal. Anyone wearing this armor can maintain a hustle for a full 8 hours without growing fatigued, doubling her normal daily overland movement rate. After that, the wearer begins to take nonlethal damage each hour, per the hustle rules (Core Rulebook 171). This armor does not increase tactical movement during combat. The benefits of this armor aren\u0027t replenished until the character has had a full night\u0027s rest."
