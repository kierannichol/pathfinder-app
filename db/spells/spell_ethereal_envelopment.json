  "description": "This spell is similar to ethereal envelope, but it allows you to shunt an unwilling creature to the Ethereal Plane and seal it there within a cocoon of misty ethereal fibers. If the target fails its save, it\u0027s forced into a cataleptic meditative state as if unconscious. However, each round at the end of its turn, it can attempt a Will save to awaken itself from this meditation. Once the target awakens, it is considered pinned, treating your caster level as your CMB and your CMD as 10 + your caster level + your ability modifier for your primary spellcasting ability score. A successful grapple combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check leaves the creature grappled rather than pinned but doesn\u0027t allow it to escape. However, a trapped creature can attack the cocoon as described in the ethereal envelope spell description."
