  "description": "Once during this spell\u0027s duration, you can spit a viscous liquid as a standard action. This liquid functions as a tanglefoot bag, except you do not have to make a successful attack roll to hit your target. The DCs to counteract this adhesive (to avoid being stuck to the floor, to fly, to break the adhesive, or to cast a spell) use the spell\u0027s DC rather than a tanglefoot bag\u0027s normal DCs. The adhesive persists for 2d4 rounds after you spit it.",
