  "description": "You condense the substance of the Ethereal Plane as it interpenetrates the Material Plane. This thickened planar conjunction slows movement through the area to a crawl. Creatures moving through condensed ether (even incorporeal creatures), move at only half their normal speed and can\u0027t take 5-foot steps. This slowing of movement doesn\u0027t stack with solid fog or similar effects. Creatures within condensed ether take a â€“2 penalty to Armor Class and on Reflex saves, and condensed ether prevents effective ranged weapon attacks. Even magic rays and similar ranged attacks suffer a 20% miss chance on attacks into or passing through condensed ether. This miss chance is not based on concealment, and Blind-Fight, true seeing, and similar effects do not reduce it.",
