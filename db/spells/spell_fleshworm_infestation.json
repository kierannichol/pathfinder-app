  "description": "With a touch, you cause an infestation of ravenous worms to manifest in the target\u0027s flesh. The target must make a Fortitude save every round. Failure means it takes 1d6 hit points of damage and 2 points of Dexterity damage, and is staggered for 1 round. If it makes the save, it takes no hit point or Dexterity damage and is only sickened for 1 round rather than staggered. Fleshworm infestationcannot be ended early by remove diseaseor heal, as the infestation starts anew if the current worms are slain. Protection from evilnegates this spell\u0027s effects for as long as the two durations overlap.Dispel evilautomatically ends a fleshworm infestation.",
