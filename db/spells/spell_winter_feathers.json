  "description": "The target\u0027s feathers thicken and fluff up to ward against winter\u0027s chill. The target suffers no harm from being in a cold environment, and can exist comfortably in conditions as low as â€“50 degrees Fahrenheit without having to make Fortitude saves. The creature\u0027s equipment is likewise protected. This spell doesn\u0027t provide any protection from cold damage, nor does it protect against other environmental hazards associated with cold weather (such as slipping on ice, blindness from snow, and so on).",
