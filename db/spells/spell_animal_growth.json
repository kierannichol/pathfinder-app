  "description": "The target animal grows to twice its normal size and eight times its normal weight. This alteration changes the animal\u0027s size category to the next largest, grants it a +8 size bonus to Strength and a +4 size bonus to Constitution (and thus an extra 2 hit points per HD), and imposes a â€“2 size penalty to Dexterity. The creature\u0027s existing natural armor bonus increases by 2. The size change also affects the animal\u0027s modifier to AC, attack rolls, and its base damage. The animal\u0027s space and reach change as appropriate to the new size, but its speed does not change. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it--the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.",
