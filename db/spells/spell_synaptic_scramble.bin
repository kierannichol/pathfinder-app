The target cannot effectively communicate while under the spell's influence, and thus cannot engage in acts like speaking, attempting Bluff checks to pass secret messages, writing, or using telepathy, although the spell doesn't prevent verbalizations made for purposes other than communication, such as command words or the verbal component of spellcasting.
