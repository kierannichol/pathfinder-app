spell:bone_flenseBone Flense"transmutation2Bone living creatureR1 round/levelb¯Choose a creature that you can see. When that creature is struck by a weapon wielded by a member of the Red Mantis, a sawtooth sabre, or by the claw of a giant mantis, the bone nearest to the wound instantly sprouts jagged, razor-sharp spurs that flense the muscle and flesh from the inside out unless the target succeeds at a Fortitude save. The creature takes 1d6 points of piercing damage per caster level. While the bone returns to normal immediately after dealing damage, the creature takes 1d4 points of bleed damage for 1 round per 2 caster levels. The victim is sickened by the pain for the duration of the bleeding. If the target creature has no bones, this spell has no effect.z
