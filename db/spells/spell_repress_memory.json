  "description": "This spell allows you to safeguard important knowledge, even from yourself. When casting this spell, you recount one piece of knowledge you possess (up to a maximum of 50 words). This knowledge disappears utterly from your mind, and you might not realize you forgot something. The magic of the spell patches omissions in your memory with indistinct haze. Repress memory protects against detect thoughts, discern lies, zone of truth, and similar spells, though careful questioning may reveal the gaps in your memory, or that your memory has been affected by the spell.",
