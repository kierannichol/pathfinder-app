  "description": "You focus emotional energy and weave it into a shroud of hardened ectoplasm around the weapon you touch, infusing it with a ghostly glow and great power. The weapon becomes a ghost touch weapon, and gains one of the following additional benefits, depending on the type of emotion you infuse into the weapon. If a special ability wouldn\u0027t apply to the chosen weapon (such as vicious on a ranged weapon), the weapon doesn\u0027t gain that benefit.",
