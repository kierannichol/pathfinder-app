  "description": "A creature that fails its save uses an immediate action to hand you whatever object it\u0027s currently wielding or holding. If the target doesn\u0027t have an immediate action available, it uses a move action at the beginning of its next turn to hand you the object. If it\u0027s currently holding or wielding more than one item, determine randomly which item it gives you. If you\u0027re no longer adjacent to the creature when it has to give you the item, the spell ends with no effect. A creature that isn\u0027t holding an item when you cast this spell is unaffected.",
