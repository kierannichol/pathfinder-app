  "description": "This spell causes a brushy beard of stiff iron to erupt from the face of a willing target. The ironbeardgrants a +1 armor bonus to AC, and this bonus stacks with any armor worn by the creature. The ironbeardmay also be used as a weapon equivalent to cold iron armor spikes. The ironbeardmakes it difficult to speak, so any spellcasting with a verbal component has a 20% spell failure chance.",
