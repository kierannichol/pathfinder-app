  "description": "You peer into the aura of one target creature or object, gaining valuable information about its condition and nature. Each round, choose one of the target\u0027s four auras. This spell functions similarly to the read aura occult skill unlock (see page 197), but doesn\u0027t require checks and returns results on all the target\u0027s auras in an instant."
