With such ammunition, the firearm's range increment is halved and the firer takes a â€“2 penalty on damage rolls. If aware of this spell's effect prior to firing the altered ammunition (a DC 16 Spellcraft check to identify the spell being cast or similar effect), the firearm's user can spend a standard action to clear the altered ammunition from the firearm. Doing so destroys that ammunition.z
