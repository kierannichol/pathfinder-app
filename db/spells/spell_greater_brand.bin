In addition, a greater brandblazes as bright as a torch when brought within 30 feet of a visible symbol of your faith. While the symbol is blazing, the recipient is sickened. Like the effects of bestow curse, a greater brandcannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by any means that removes a mark of justice.z
