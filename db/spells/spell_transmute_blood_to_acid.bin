The creature is staggered and sickened by the debilitating pain. A successful Fortitude save each round halves the damage and negates the staggered condition for 1 round. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 or fewer hit points, it dissolves, leaving only the barest trace of remains. A dissolved creature's equipment is unaffected.z
