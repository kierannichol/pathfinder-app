You can send or receive a number of dream messages equal to your caster level. Each message can be up to 25 words long or a single vague image that can't convey fine details such as words. You can send and receive these dream messages with a single target or multiple targets, but each message you send or receive counts against the total number of messages allowed. Sending a message takes 1 round. The spell ends and you wake up when you run out of messages.z
