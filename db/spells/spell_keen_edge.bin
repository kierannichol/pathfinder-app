This transmutation doubles the threat range of the weapon. A threat range of 20 becomes 19â€“20, a threat range of 19â€“20 becomes 17â€“20, and a threat range of 18â€“20 becomes 15â€“20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons. If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the keen edge on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target. Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.z
