ability:bloodline_arcanaBloodline Arcana*x: Whenever you cast a spell against a creature that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, increase that spell's DC by +2.¢ÓWhile many kobold sorcerers tout their purely draconic bloodline, over generations of eldritch training, some such spellcasters have created a bloodline that, while tinged with some draconic magic, is the embodiment of the race's virtue distilled into arcane form. Many practitioners of this bloodline go on to lead powerful kobold tribes.
