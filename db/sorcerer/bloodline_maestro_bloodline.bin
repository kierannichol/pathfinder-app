ability:bloodline_arcanaBloodline Arcana*è: Whenever you cast a spell with a verbal component and no somatic or material component, you treat your caster level as if it were one higher.¢…The spiritual power of art and song runs strongly through your family line. This may be the result of ancient pacts made with azata patrons, or even an inheritance from a lillend or trumpet archon ancestor. It could also be the lingering taint of a less savory heritage, such as from a harpy or a forefather driven to madness by the disquieting gibbering of a shoggoth. However it came to be, your family's artistic bent shows itself strongly in your magic.
