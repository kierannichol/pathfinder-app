ability:bloodline_arcanaBloodline Arcana*ÿ: Whenever you target a single creature with a spell, you gain an insight bonus equal to half the spell's level (minimum +1) for 1 round to your AC and saving throws against any spell or attack made by that creature.¢√Your family is a long line of dreamers, who dream not as ordinary mortals do but rather as those who reach through and touch the supernal realm of dreams and the farthest shores of night. Whether it is a gift or curse is not always clear, but your visions of the past and future call you ineluctably to a life of adventure.
