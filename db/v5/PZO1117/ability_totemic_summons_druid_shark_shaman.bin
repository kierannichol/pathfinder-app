ˆAt 5th level, a shark shaman may use summon nature's ally I to summon a stingray and summon nature's ally II to summon a manta ray. She may cast summon nature's ally as a standard action when summoning rays and sharks, and summoned rays and sharks gain a number of temporary hit points equal to her druid level. This ability otherwise functions as the dragon shaman's totemic summons ability.ª1
