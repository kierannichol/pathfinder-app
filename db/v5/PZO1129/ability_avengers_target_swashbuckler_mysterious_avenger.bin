€	At 5th level, a mysterious avenger gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with light or one-handed piercing melee weapons and whips. Furthermore, a mysterious avenger can study an opponent she can see as a move action. The mysterious avenger then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against that opponent, a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it, and a +1 bonus to DCs of any deeds used against that opponent. A mysterious avenger can maintain these bonuses against only one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or the mysterious avenger studies a new target.
At 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, these mysterious avenger's bonuses against a studied target increase by 1. In addition, at each such interval, a mysterious avenger is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. A mysterious avenger can discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing her to study another target in its place.
At 10th level, a mysterious avenger can study an opponent as a move or swift action.ª>
