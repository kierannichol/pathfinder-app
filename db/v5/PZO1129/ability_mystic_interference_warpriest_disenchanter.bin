£At 4th level, a disenchanter can channel a burst of pure abjuration magic to grant protection to himself and all allies with 30 feet. Affected creatures receive a +1 bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities for a number of rounds equal to his warpriest level. This is a sacred bonus if the warpriest is good-aligned or able to spontaneously cast cure spells, and a profane bonus if the warpriest is evil-aligned or able to spontaneously cast inflict spells. Using this ability consumes two uses of his fervor ability. At 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the bonus granted by mystic interference increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).ª9
