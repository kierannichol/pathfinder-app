    "text": "At 3rd level, a sacred fist can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with help from his deity. If he succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, he instead avoids the effect entirely. A helpless sacred fist does not gain the benefit of the blessed fortitude ability."
