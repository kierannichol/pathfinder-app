    "text": "At 10th level, the animist can attempt to possess creatures or objects as magic jar or possess object. When the animist is attempting to possess the creature, his familiar acts as the jar and must be within 10 feet when the animist attempts to possess a creature. The animist\u0027s soul can perceive his surroundings through the familiar\u0027s senses, clearly evaluate potential targets for possession, and communicate with his familiar telepathically. The familiar retains its autonomy while acting as the jar, and is not harmed by being used as a vessel for the animist\u0027s soul. The animist can use this ability once per day at 10th level, plus an additional time per day every 4 levels thereafter."
