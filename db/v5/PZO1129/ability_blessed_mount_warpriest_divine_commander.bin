›At 6th level, a divine commander's mount becomes a creature blessed by his deity. The divine commander's mount gains either the celestial, entropic, fiendish, or resolute template, matching the alignment of the warpriest's deity (celestial for good, entropic for chaotic, fiendish for evil, and resolute for lawful). If the deity matches more than one alignment, the divine commander can select which of the two templates the mount receives. Once the type of template is selected, it cannot be changed.
If the divine commander's deity is neutral with no other alignment components, the mount receives spell resistance equal to the divine commander's level + 5, as well as resistance 10 against two types of energy damage of the divine commander's choice.
If a divine commander's mount dies and the divine commander finds another mount, the new mount becomes a blessed mount the next time the divine commander gains a level.ª7
