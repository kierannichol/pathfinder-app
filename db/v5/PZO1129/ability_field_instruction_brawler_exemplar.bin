µAt 5th level, as a standard action an exemplar can grant a teamwork feat to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear her. This teamwork feat must be one the exemplar knows or has gained with the martial flexibility ability. Allies retain the use of this teamwork feat for 3 rounds + 1 round for every 2 brawler levels. If the granted teamwork feat is one gained from martial flexibility, this duration ends immediately if the exemplar loses access to that feat. Allies don't need to meet the prerequisites of this teamwork feat. The exemplar can use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus one additional time per day at 9th, 12th, and 17th level.
This ability otherwise counts as the cavalier's tactician class feature; feats and other effects which affect tactician (such as Practiced Tactician) apply to it.ª1
