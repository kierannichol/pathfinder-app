    "text": "At 3rd level, a champion of the faith can detect his opposed alignment. As a move action, the champion of the faith can focus on a single item or creature within 60 feet and determine whether it possesses the opposed alignment, as detect chaos/evil/good/law, learning the strength of the aura as if he had studied it for 3 rounds. The champion of the faith does not detect alignment in any other object or creature when using this ability in this way."
