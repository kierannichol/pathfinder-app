    "text": "At 4th level, as a swift action a naturalist can enhance his eidolon with the aspect of an animal. Each time he uses this ability, he can select a hunter\u0027s animal aspect and apply it to his eidolon. His hunter level for this ability is equal to his summoner level â€“ 2. He does not gain the ability to add an animal aspect to himself (see Shared Focus, below). This effect lasts until the eidolon is dismissed or sent back to its home plane.\nWhen an animal aspect is applied to an eidolon, its form is altered by superficial physical changes appropriate to that aspect. For example, using aspect of the bat might give the eidolon larger ears and eyes and perhaps membranes of skin connecting its limbs to its body, while using aspect of the stag might give the eidolon antlers and hoof like nails on its feat. None of these changes interfere with any of the eidolon\u0027s natural or magical abilities."
