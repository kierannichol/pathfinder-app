ŠAt 12th level, the shaman can interact with incorporeal entities as if his unarmed strikes and melee weapons had the ghost touch weapon special ability. While using this ability, he can also see nearby ethereal entities and likewise strike at them as if they were incorporeal. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his shaman level. The rounds need not be consecutive.ª;
