    "text": "At 9th level, the sacred fist\u0027s blessed fortitude ability improves. He still takes no damage or negative effect when he succeeds at a Fortitude save, but now when he fails a Fortitude saving throw against a spell or effect that deals damage (including ability damage and drain), he takes only half the amount of damage. A helpless sacred fist does not gain the benefit of miraculous fortitude."
