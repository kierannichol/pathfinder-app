Ä: At 12th level, as a swift action once per bloodrage you can empower your melee attacks with fear. For 1 round, creatures you hit with your melee attacks become shaken. Creatures who are already shaken become frightened. At 16th level, those who are already frightened become panicked. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.ª+
