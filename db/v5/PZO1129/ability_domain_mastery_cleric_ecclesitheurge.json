    "text": "At 1st level, when an ecclesitheurge chooses his cleric domains, he designates one as his primary domain and the other as his secondary domain. An ecclesitheurge can use his non-domain spell slots to prepare spells from his primary domain\u0027s spell list.\nEach day when he prepares spells, an ecclesitheurge can select a different domain granted by his deity to gain access to that domain\u0027s spell list instead of his secondary domain spell list. He does not lose access to his actual secondary domain\u0027s granted powers or gain access to the other domain\u0027s granted powers. For example, an ecclesitheurge with Glory as his primary domain and Good as his secondary domain can choose to gain access to the Healing domain; until the next time he prepares spells, he uses the Healing domain spell list as his secondary domain spell list instead of the Good domain spell list, but still keeps the granted powers of the Good domain and does not gain the granted powers of the Healing domain."
