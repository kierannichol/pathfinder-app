¯At 1st level, a nature fang gains the slayer's studied target class feature. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the nature fang's bonus against her studied target increases by 1. Unlike a slayer, a nature fang does not gain the ability to maintain more than one studied target at the same time.ª/
