BenefitÙWhen you attack with an unarmed strike and hit a creature that you can harm with your lay on hands or touch of corruption feature, you can use a swift action to expend a daily use of that feature to deal its normal damage as if you had hit with the feature's normal touch attack. This extra damage is not multiplied if you scored a critical hit.ª
