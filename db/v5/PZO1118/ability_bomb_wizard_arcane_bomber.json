    "text": "At 1st level, the arcane bomber gains an ability nearly identical to the alchemist\u0027s bomb ability. Unlike the alchemist, at 1st level, the arcane bomber chooses one type of energy from the following list: acid, cold, fire, and electricity. He can throw bombs of that type, but cannot modify them with discoveries. This ability stacks with the alchemist bomb ability to determine the level of bomb damage, but an arcane bomber that becomes an alchemist does not gain that class\u0027s bomb ability, nor does an alchemist that becomes an arcane bomber gain this bomb ability."
