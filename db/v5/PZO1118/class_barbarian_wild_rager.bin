Wild Rager	archetype	barbarian¢±
®Rages are barely controlled, but there are those who wholly give in to their more savage side, letting their rages take them to a confusing and uncontrolled place of terrible savagery. These barbarians become beasts, consumed with absolute bloodlust to the point where they cannot tell friend from foe.º³
