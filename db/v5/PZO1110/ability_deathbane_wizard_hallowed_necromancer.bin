œAt 5th level, a hallowed necromancer's cure spells are maximized when used to damage undead and the save DCs of her spells cast on undead creatures are 1 higher. She can expend 2 uses of positive touch as a swift action to imbue any weapon she wields with the undeadâ€“bane or ghost touch weapon special ability for 1 round per 5 wizard levels she has. These effects apply only against undead, and only while the hallowed necromancer wields the weapon. If the weapon is her arcane bond item, this ability costs only 1 use of positive touch.ª4
