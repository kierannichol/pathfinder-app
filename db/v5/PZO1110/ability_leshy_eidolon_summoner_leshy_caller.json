    "text": "When a leshy caller summons her eidolon, the eidolon\u0027s body is created from extraplanar plant material and imbued with the intelligence of a leshy spirit. Its statistics are changed from those of a standard eidolon as follows. An unchained summoner uses the plant eidolon subtype.\nType: The eidolon is still an outsider, and its statistics don\u0027t change, but it also counts as a plant. As it isn\u0027t truly a plant, it doesn\u0027t gain the plant immunities.\nBase Form: The leshy caller chooses one of the base forms listed below for her eidolon. When the eidolon is summoned in an environment matching one of these base forms, the leshy caller can change the eidolon\u0027s base form to the matching form by sacrificing one daily use of her summon nature\u0027s ally ability as a free action.\nPlant eidolon base forms are as follows.\nCactus (Desert) Size Medium; Speed 30 ft.; AC +2 natural armor: Saves Fort (good), Ref (good), Will (bad); Attack sting (1d4); Ability Scores Str 14, Dex 14, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11; Free Evolutions limbs (arms), limbs (legs), sting.
