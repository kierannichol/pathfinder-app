    "text": "At 2nd level, as long as she has at least 1 grit point, a thronewarden can act in a surprise round even if she doesn\u0027t notice her enemies, though she remains flat-footed until she acts. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on initiative checks. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 gunslinger levels beyond 2nd. Finally, at 10th level, she can spend 1 grit point to take both a standard action and a move action (or a full-round action) during the surprise round."
