ˆAt will, an enforcer can use detect chaos, as per the spell. The enforcer can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine whether it is chaotic, learning the strength of its aura as if she had studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the enforcer can't use detect chaos on any other object or individual within range.ª,
