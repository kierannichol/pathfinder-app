    "text": "Filidhs can hear the resonant song generated by all living creatures--a primal music that stretches back to the beginning of time and ahead to the unwritten future. By tapping into this cosmic melody, a filidh can steal glimpses of the future. Once per day per level, a filidh can sacrifice a spell slot as a swift action to gain an additional number of rounds of bardic performance for that day equal to the spell\u0027s level.\nIn addition, a filidh gains the following types of bardic performances.\nEchoes of Nature\u0027s Song (Su) A filidh can use his bardic performance to imbue his allies with subconscious knowledge of their own futures, improving their reflexes and ability to avoid danger. An affected ally receives a +1 insight bonus on Reflex saving throws and to AC. At 5th level and every 6 bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of +4 at 17th level. This performance is a mind-affecting ability and relies on audible components."
