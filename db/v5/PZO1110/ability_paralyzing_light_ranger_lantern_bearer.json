    "text": "At 18th level, a lantern bearer can stop light-blind enemies in their tracks, often gaining a great edge in battle. Daylight spells cast by the lantern bearer or sources of bright light wielded by him cause creatures with light blindness within the area of bright light to become paralyzed for 1 round in addition to being blinded and stunned."
