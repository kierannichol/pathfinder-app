    "text": "At 3rd level, a weapon bearer squire can ensure her liege never goes unarmed, even if his weapon has all but shattered. As a full-round action, a weapon bearer squire can make rapid repairs to a weapon she is holding and is proficient with by succeeding at a DC 20 Craft (weapons) check. The item does not regain any hit points, but loses the broken condition for a number of rounds equal to the weapon bearer squire\u0027s class level."
