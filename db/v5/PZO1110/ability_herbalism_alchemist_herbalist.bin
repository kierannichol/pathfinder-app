ÁAn herbalist's studies allow him a unique method of creating alchemical discoveries. He can attempt Profession (herbalist) checks in place of Craft (alchemy) checks for all purposes, and he gains a competence bonus equal to half his alchemist level on Profession (herbalist) checks to create alchemical items and to forage for and process herbs. An herbalist uses his Wisdom score instead of his Intelligence score for all alchemist class abilities.ª,
