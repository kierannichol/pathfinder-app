    "text": "An unwavering conduit\u0027s eidolon must be of a lawful alignment (if using the Unchained Summoner, the eidolon must be of the archon, devil, or inevitable subtype). Once selected, the evolutions of the unwavering conduit\u0027s eidolon cannot be changed when a new class level is gained (though they can be altered normally with the transmogrify spell). At least half the eidolonâ€˜s skill points must be spent on skills in which the unwavering conduit also has ranks. The eidolon gains a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells and abilities of the conjuration, enchantment, and transmutation schools. This bonus increases to +2 at 3rd level, and by an additional 1 for every 3 levels thereafter. The eidolon has 1 fewer evolution point than normal for an eidolon of the unwavering conduit\u0027s summoner level."
