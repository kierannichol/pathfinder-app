¯At 3rd level, a magic warrior can gain an aspect of an animal's might. The animal must suit the magic warrior's mask (and the animal changes if the magic warrior must create or obtain a new mask). As a standard action, the magic warrior gains one ability possessed by that animal from the list of abilities given in beast shape I (this ability does not allow her to change her size). The ability lasts for 1 minute per magus level.ª8
