    "text": "At 10th level, a treestrider can use a full-round action to move between two trees, as per the spell tree stride. Unlike the spell, this ability has a duration of instantaneous and the treestrider can make only a single transfer. She can bring her animal companion with her, but if she does, her companion can\u0027t take any actions that round. Tree stride can be used a number of times per day equal to 3 + the hunter\u0027s Wisdom modifier."
