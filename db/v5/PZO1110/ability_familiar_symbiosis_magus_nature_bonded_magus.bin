ŽA 4th level, when a nature-bonded magus is adjacent to his familiar, he can merge with his familiar as a standard action; both the nature-bonded magus and the familiar provoke attacks of opportunity with this action. Doing so causes the plant familiar to bond with a part of the nature-bonded magus's body as though it were growing on him. While merged, the nature-bonded magus's familiar can take no actions (but can still attempt Perception checks and communicate with the nature-bonded magus), and it can't be targeted or harmed by effects. As long as his familiar is merged, the nature-bonded magus gains half his plant familiar's natural armor adjustment to AC.
The nature-bonded magus can separate from his plant familiar as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity for both of them. Once they have separated, the familiar appears in an adjacent square of the nature-bonded magus' choosing.ª;
