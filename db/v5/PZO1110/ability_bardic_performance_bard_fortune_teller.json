    "text": "A fortune-teller gains the following bardic performance.\nTransparent Fate (Su): At 8th level, the fortune-teller can cause all enemies within 30 feet to have their near future revealed for all to see. A successful Will saving throw (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 the fortune-teller\u0027s level + the fortune-teller\u0027s Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability causes any creature attacked by an affected enemy to gain a +2 bonus to AC and on saving throws against the attack. As a secondary effect, if an affected creature\u0027s hit points are reduced to less than its Constitution score, it also sees a vision of its own death and must succeed at another Will save or become frightened for 1 round. A given creature needs to save against this secondary effect at most once per performance of transparent fate, even if its hit points are reduced to less than its Constitution score multiple times. A creature that was targeted by oracular performance when this performance began applies any save DC adjustment to this secondary save as well. At the GM\u0027s discretion, the revelation of the creature\u0027s fate might have other consequences; for example, a creature\u0027s allies might see it was planning to betray them."
