éThe intense study a dimensional excavator applies to dimensional forces causes him to treat his class level as 2 lower when qualifying for alchemist discoveries other than those granted by Precipitous Discoveries (see below). At 4th level, the dimensional excavator adds create pit to his list of extracts known, treating it as a 2nd-level alchemist extract. He can create an extract of this spell, which can then be thrown as a ranged attack, targeting a creature or square. If it strikes a square, the pit manifests in that area and all nearby creatures are affected normally. If a creature is struck, the pit manifests in the creature's location, and the struck creature must succeed at a Reflex save with a â€“2 penalty or fall into the pit.ªG
