˜A planar extremist forms a bond with a manifestation of the Outer Planes with which she is aligned.
This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the plane to which she is aligned, granting the planar extremist one of the domains of her alignment (for example, a lawful good planar extremist could take either the Lawful or Good domain). This option otherwise functions as a druid's nature bond if she chose a close tie to the natural world.
The second option is to form a close bond with an outsider from an Outer Planes. The abilities of this outsider companion are determined using the rules for eidolons for the unchained summoner class, as if the planar extremist were a summoner of her druid level, except the outsider companion gains no additional evolution pool (only the evolutions from its base form and base evolutions for its subtype), and it must be of a subtype whose alignment exactly matches the alignment of the planar extremist. The planar extremist can summon her outsider companion with the same 1-minute ritual a summoner normally uses to do so, but she can't cast summon monster spells if she currently has her outsider companion summoned, and she can't summon her companion if she already has a creature summoned through other means.
As the planar ally gains class levels, her eidolon's base statistics and base evolutions increase as if her druid level were her summoner level. The eidolon gains the darkvision, link, share spells, evasion, ability score increase, devotion, multiattack, and improved evasion abilities at the appropriate levels, but never gains an evolution pool.
Abilities and spells that grant additional evolution points to eidolons do not function for her outsider companion, though any abilities that would grant evolution points to an animal companion do work. The planar extremist does not gain life link or any other class features a summoner gains in relation to her eidolon.ª1
