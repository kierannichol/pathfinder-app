    "text": "A Diva gains the following bardic performances. This can never be performed more quickly than a standard action.\nDevastating Aria (Su): At 3rd level, the Diva can spend 1 round of bardic performance as a standard action to direct a burst of sonically charged words at a creature or object. This performance deals 1d4 points of damage + the diva\u0027s level to an object, or half this damage to a living creature.\nThis performance replaces inspire competence.\nScathing Tirade (Su): A Diva of 8th level or higher can use her performance to verbally lash out at another creature, causing it to become frightened. To be affected, the target enemy must be within 30 feet and be able to see and hear the diva\u0027s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the diva continues her performance, plus 1d4 rounds. Although the diva can only direct the effect at one creature at a time, its effects persist for as long as she continues the performance, even if directed at a different creature. For example, she could direct her tirade at an innkeeper, who becomes frightened, then focus her wrath on the captain of the guard, and the innkeeper remains frightened for 1d4 more rounds even though her attention is no longer directed at him. This performance cannot cause a creature to become panicked, even if the target is already frightened from another effect. Scathing tirade is a mind-affecting fear effect, and it relies on audible and visual components."
