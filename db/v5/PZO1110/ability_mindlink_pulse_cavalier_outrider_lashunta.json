    "text": "At 14th level, an outrider can send a pulse of psychic energy through the minds of allies within range of his limited telepathy as a standard action. If he does so during a surprise round, any allies not normally able to act in the surprise round can act. If an ally would normally be denied the ability to act in the surprise round, that ally\u0027s initiative is equal to her initiative roll, or to the initiative of the outrider â€“ 1, whichever is lower.\nWhether or not it is a surprise round, when the outrider uses this ability, allies within range are no longer flat-footed (assuming they were to begin with)."
