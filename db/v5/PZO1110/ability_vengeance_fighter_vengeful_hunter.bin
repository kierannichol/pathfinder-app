‡At 5th level, a vengeful hunter deals 1d4 points of bleed damage when he damages a creature that has damaged him since the beginning of his last turn. Whenever a creature takes bleed damage from this effect, it also takes a â€“1 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 round. This penalty is a pain effect and does not stack with the effects of the sickened condition. This bleed damage increases to 1d6 at 9th level, 1d8 at 13th level, and 2d6 at 17th level.ª0
