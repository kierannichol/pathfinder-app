œA cardinal adds Bluff, Intimidate, Knowledge (geography), and Knowledge (local) to her list of class skills. She gains a number of skill ranks equal to 6 + her Intelligence modifier at each level, instead of the normal 2 + her Intelligence modifier. However, she gains only one domain, and her base attack bonus from cleric levels is equal to half her class level (which is the same as for a sorcerer or wizard).ª.
