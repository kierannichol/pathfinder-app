    "text": "At 1st level, a steelbound fighter selects one type of weapon (such as shortswords, longbows, or heavy flails). He gains Weapon Focus with that specific weapon. Whenever he isn\u0027t wielding or carrying at least one weapon of this type (the weapon can be broken but not destroyed), a steelbound fighter takes a â€“2 penalty to his Wisdom score and can\u0027t benefit from his fighter class abilities (excluding bonus feats gained from fighter levels). Once the steelbound fighter\u0027s weapon awakens (see steelbound awakening below), these penalties apply whenever the fighter isn\u0027t carrying or wielding that particular weapon."
