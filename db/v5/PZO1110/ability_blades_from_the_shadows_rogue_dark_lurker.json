    "text": "At 2nd level, a dark lurker gains shadow strike as a bonus rogue talent. (A character using the unchained rogue class instead gains the ability to make attacks of opportunity against foes with cover, though not foes with improved cover or total cover).\nAt 6th level, the dark lurker can deal precision damage to targets with total concealment (though any miss chance applies normally, and may prevent an attack from hitting in the first place)."
