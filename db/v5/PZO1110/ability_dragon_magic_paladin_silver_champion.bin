µThe silver champion does not have access to the normal paladin spell list. She instead adds the 1stthrough 4th-level spells from the domains Artifice, Good, Law, Scalykind, Travel and the associated subdomains Archon, Construct, Dragon, Exploration, Toil, and Trade to her class spell list. A silver champion casts one fewer spell of each level than normal. If this reduces the number to less than 0, she can't cast spells of that level.ª3
