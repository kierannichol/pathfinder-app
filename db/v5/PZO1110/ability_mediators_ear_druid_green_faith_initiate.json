    "text": "By 3rd level, a Green Faith initiate is respected for her neutrality and even-handed attitude toward all people as well as other living things. She quickly develops a sense of other peoples\u0027 attitudes, much as she does with animals. A Green Faith initiate gains a bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks equal to half her druid level."
