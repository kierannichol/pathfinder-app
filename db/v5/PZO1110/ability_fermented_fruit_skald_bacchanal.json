    "text": "A bacchanal adds goodberry to his list of 1st-level skald spells known. In addition, he can cast it as a spell-like ability once per day. When he casts goodberry as a spell or spell-like ability, the targeted berries ferment; this causes each berry to act as a serving of an alcoholic beverage. A creature that eats a fermented berry does not gain a meal\u0027s nourishment, but it is cured of 1 point of damage and becomes slightly foolhardy as if tipsy, gaining a +1 bonus on saves against fear effects for 1 minute after eating the berry."
