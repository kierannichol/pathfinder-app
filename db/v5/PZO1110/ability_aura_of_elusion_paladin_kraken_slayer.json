    "text": "At 14th level, a kraken slayer gains a sacred bonus equal to her kraken slayer level on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks to escape a grapple and to her CMD to avoid being grappled. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a sacred bonus equal to half her kraken slayer level on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks to escape a grapple and to CMD to avoid being grappled. This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead."
