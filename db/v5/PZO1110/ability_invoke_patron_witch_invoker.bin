•At 1st level, an invoker can invite spirits associated with her patron's themes into her body and mind as a swift action. This functions like a hunter's animal focus, except she emulates facets of her patron, chosen from the list below. The invoker can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level; this duration need not be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.ª*
