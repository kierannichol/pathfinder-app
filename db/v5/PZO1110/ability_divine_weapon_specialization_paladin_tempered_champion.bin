ÓAt 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a tempered champion gains a bonus feat from the following list:
Disruptive, Divine Fighting Technique, Greater Penetrating Strike, Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Penetrating Strike, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, and Weapon Trick.
If a feat requires choosing a weapon or weapon group, the tempered champion must choose her deity's favored weapon, or its group. The tempered champion must meet the feat's prerequisites, but treats her tempered champion levels as fighter levels for this purpose.
In addition, the 4th-level tempered champion gains the increased base weapon damage of the warpriest's sacred weapon ability at her tempered champion level.ªE
