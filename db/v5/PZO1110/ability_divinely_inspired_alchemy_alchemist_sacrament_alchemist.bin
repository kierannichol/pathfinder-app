«At 3rd level, a sacrament alchemist's faith inspires him with ideas for novel alchemical achievements, although the mental strain means that he can't reliably repeat them. Once per day while preparing extracts, for a period of 24 hours, a sacrament alchemist can gain an alchemist discovery for which he qualifies. He treats his alchemist level as 2 lower for the purpose of this discovery.
This ability replaces swift alchemy.ªF
