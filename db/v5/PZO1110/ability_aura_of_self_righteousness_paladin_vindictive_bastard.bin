ÖAt 17th level, a vindictive bastard gains DR 5/lawful or good and immunity to compulsion spells and spell-like abilities. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against compulsion effects. Aura of self-righteousness functions only while the vindictive bastard is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead.ªD
