ýA ruthless agent adds half her investigator level (minimum +1) as a bonus on Intimidate checks. When the ruthless agent uses Intimidate to influence an opponent's attitude, the duration of the attitude shift is 1d6x10 minutes per investigator level (rather than the normal 1d6x10 minutes).
Additionally, the ruthless agent is an expert in blending coercion and fear. The first time the ruthless agent attempts to use Intimidate to influence an opponent's attitude and fails, she can retry it against that same opponent with no increase to the DC. Subsequent attempts to influence the same opponent are subject to increased DCs as normal.ª@
