    "text": "At 4th level, the dandy gains a different sort of spellcasting than most rangers. A dandy uses his Charisma instead of his Wisdom to determine spells per day, DCs, and other factors related to spellcasting. He casts spells spontaneously from the bard spell list (rather than the ranger spell list) with the same number of spells known and spells per day as a medium of his ranger level."
