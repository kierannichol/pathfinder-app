    "text": "A planar extremist gains one fewer spell slot per spell level than normal in which to prepare spells. The planar extremist removes all summon nature\u0027s ally spells from her spell list and replaces them with the summon monster spells of the same levels. The druid can otherwise cast spells as normal for a druid of her level."
