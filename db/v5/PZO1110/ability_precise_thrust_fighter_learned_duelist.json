    "text": "At 9th level, when using Vital Strike, Improved Vital Strike, or Greater Vital Strike, a Learned duelist adds his Intelligence modifier to damage rolls (this bonus to damage is not multiplied on a critical hit). If the duelist confirms a critical hit while using one of these feats, he automatically deals maximum damage."
