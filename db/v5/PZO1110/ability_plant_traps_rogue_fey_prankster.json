    "text": "At 8th level, the fey trickster can modify a plant (but not plant creatures) into a trap as a full-round action up to three times per day. The Perception and Disable Device DCs for the trap are each equal to 15 + his rogue level. A Tiny or larger plant can be used to perform a trip or dirty trick combat maneuver using the fey trickster\u0027s CMB and the plant\u0027s size. A Large or larger plant can be used to create a snare as per the spell. The save DC is equal to 12 + the rogue\u0027s Intelligence modifier. The fey trickster can trigger any plant trap he created as a standard action as long as he is within 60 feet of it."
