    "text": "At 8th level, the seducer can create a magical bower once per day. This functions as tiny hut with a caster level equal to the seducer\u0027s witch level, but the interior is a lush garden. Those who rest for 8 hours within the garden heal at twice the usual rate. In addition, any creature engaging in willing sexual relations with the seducer in this garden gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws for the next 24 hours. This bonus does not apply on saving throws against the seducer\u0027s spells or abilities."
