    "text": "At 20th level, a Forgefather seeker becomes capable of completely dismantling constructs. Her DR increases to 10/evil.\nWhenever she uses smite construct and hits a construct, she can immediately attempt to destroy the construct. The construct is reduced to 0 hit points and destroyed unless it succeeds at a Will save (DC \u003d 10 + half the Forgefather seeker\u0027s level + the Forgefather seeker\u0027s Charisma modifier). After this destruction effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends.\nIn addition, whenever a Forgefather seeker channels positive energy or uses lay on hands to heal a creature, she heals the maximum possible amount."
