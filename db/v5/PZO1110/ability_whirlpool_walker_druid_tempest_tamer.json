The tempest tamer gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against spells with the air or water descriptor and the spell-like and supernatural abilities of creatures with the air, aquatic, or water subtype.\nThis bonus also applies to saving throws to avoid damage from a vortex, whirlpool, or similar effects, as well as to saving throws to prevent being pulled into or moved by such effects."
