    "text": "At 2nd level, a demolitionist gains an insight bonus equal to his investigator level on Acrobatics checks to move through difficult terrain.\nAt 5th level, when attempting to damage objects and structures, he ignores the first 5 points of hardness.\nAt 8th level, the demolitionist gains a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls when attempting to sunder an item.\nAt 11th level, he can attempt a sunder combat maneuver check against a wall no more than 5 feet thick. If the damage from the sunder combat maneuver exceeds the wall\u0027s hardness, the demolitionist creates a 5-foot opening in the wall, through which a Medium creature can easily pass."
