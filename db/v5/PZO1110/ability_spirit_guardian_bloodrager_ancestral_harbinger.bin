çAt 2nd level, an ancestral harbinger can call upon her ancestors to aid her in combat, summoning a weapon of force that functions as per spiritual weapon. At 6th level, her ancestral spirit can take the form of a savage creature, functioning as per summon nature's ally II (this can't be used to summon multiple creatures from the summon nature's ally I list). At 12th level, her ancestor can manifest physically as a ghostly figure, functioning as per spiritual ally. At 18th level, her ancestral spirit can manifest either as a single powerful creature or as multiple lesser ancestors, functioning as per summon nature's ally VI. The harbinger chooses which spell this ability functions as at the time of casting, and can use this ability while in a bloodrage. The ancestral harbinger can use this ability once per day, plus an additional time per day for every 4 bloodrager levels she possesses beyond 2nd.™=
