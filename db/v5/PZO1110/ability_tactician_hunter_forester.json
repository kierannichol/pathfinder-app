Allies retain the use of this bonus feat for 3 rounds plus 1 round for every 2 levels the forester has. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of these bonus feats. The forester can use this ability once per day at 3rd level, plus one additional time per day at 7th level and every 5 levels thereafter."
