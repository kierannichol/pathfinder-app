îAt 8th level, a corpse hunter can channel his will into any weapon he wields, making it effective against incorporeal undead. A corpse hunter may imbue a single wielded weapon with the ghost touch special ability as a swift action, causing it to deal damage normally against incorporeal creatures. The corpse hunter may use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to half his ranger level; these rounds need not be consecutive. The corpse hunter can end this ability as a free action.ª8
