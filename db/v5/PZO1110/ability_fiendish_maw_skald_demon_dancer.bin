µAt 3rd level, whenever a demon dancer inspires rage, all who accept his rage gain a bite attack dealing 1d6 points of damage (for Medium allies; 1d4 points of damage if Small). This damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small) at 7th level, to 2d6 (1d8 if Small) at 12th level, and to 3d6 (2d6 if Small) at 17th level.
These increases effectively treat the affected creatures as though their sizes had increased by one size category, and so don't stack with any similar damage increases (such as the increase from the strong jaw spell) other than those due to an actual increase in size. If used as part of a full attack action, the bite attack is made at the creature's full base attack bonus â€“5.ª.
