    "text": "A life channeler must choose the Plant domain with her nature bond (she can select the Growth subdomain if she wishes). When she performs a coup de grace that kills a sentient humanoid creature (not a summoned creature), she can do so ritualistically in order to affect the area centered on the body with the enrichment version of plant growth. The sacrifice is a death effect."
