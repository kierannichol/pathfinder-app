·Beginning at 2nd level, a scavenger can sacrifice one of his gadgets to repair or enhance an adjacent mechanical device, such as a lock, trap, or vehicle. Doing so either repairs 1d6 points of damage per extract level of the gadget sacrificed or applies a bonus or penalty to one specific skill check involved in using the device. The scavenger could, for example, sacrifice a gadget to impose a penalty on all Disable Device checks to disarm a trap, add a bonus on all Disable Device checks to open a lock, or add a bonus on all Profession (driver) checks to drive a carriage.
This modifier is equal to twice the extract level of the gadget sacrificed, and lasts for 10 minutes per class level.ª;
