    "text": "A wit gains the following bardic performance.\nCutting Remark (Su): At 3rd level, a wit can wound with his words. The wit can spend 1 round of bardic performance as a standard action to deal 1d4 points of nonlethal damage + the wit\u0027s bard level to a creature within 30 feet. Damage Reduction applies to this damage. At 8th level, a target who takes damage from cutting remark is also sickened for as long as it remains within 30 feet of the wit and for 1 round thereafter. Additionally, the nonlethal damage counts as magic for purposes such as overcoming damage reduction. At 14th level, a target who takes damage from cutting remark must also succeed at a Will save (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 the wit\u0027s bard level + his Charisma modifier) or be dazed for 1 round. A creature that makes a successful save is immune to the dazing effect of the wit\u0027s cutting remark for 24 hours. Cutting remark is a mind-affecting, language-dependent effect, and relies on audible components."
