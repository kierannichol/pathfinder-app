ãAt 5th level, a ringleader expects the unexpected. When the ringleader is in a situation where he could use a particular piece of non-magical gear, the ringleader can attempt a Knowledge check appropriate to his current situation to have purchased that item in advance. The DC of the check is equal to the item's cost in gp. If he succeeds, he deducts the appropriate cost of the item from his current gp total and now has the item in question on his person. He cannot use this ability to retroactively gain an item that would change his encumbrance to a different load category, though in this case, he can attempt to retrieve such objects from a pack mule, extradimensional storage space, or other location that would not affect his encumbrance. He can use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus one additional time per day for every 5 bard levels beyond 5th.ª+
