ÛAt 5th level, a silver champion gains a drake companion. If the drake companion is at least one size larger than the silver champion, it gains the mount drake power as a bonus power. However, a silver champion doesn't gain additional uses per day of smite evil at 4th, 10th, and 16th levels, and doesn't gain mercies at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.ª2
