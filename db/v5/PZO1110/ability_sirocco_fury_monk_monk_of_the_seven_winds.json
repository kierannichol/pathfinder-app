    "text": "At 11th level, a monk of the seven winds can spend 2 ki points as a full-round action to enter a meditative trance that replicates the spell dance of a hundred cuts, using his monk level as his caster level. Unlike the spell, a monk of the seven winds must both move 10 feet and make a melee attack each round after he begins this trance to prevent the effect from ending. At 15th level, he can instead spend 3 ki points when using this ability to make his trance replicate dance of a thousand cuts with the same limitations."
