    "text": "At 8th level, both a crystal tender and her spirit animal gain all of the benefits of any ioun stones worn by one another, as long as they\u0027re within 100 feet of each other. The crystal tender\u0027s spirit animal can also embed a number of ioun stones equal to the crystal tender\u0027s Charisma modifier into its crystalline form. Embedded ioun stones don\u0027t gain any additional abilities, save that they don\u0027t orbit the spirit animal and can\u0027t be separately targeted. A slain or unconscious spirit animal immediately loses all embedded ioun stones, which tumble to the ground beside its body."
