¼Once per day as a standard action, a blightwarden can examine visible evidence of a creature that has been affected by a natural or supernatural blight. This might include visible tracks left by a creature with the fungal creature template, or a dead creature with the blighted fey template, or any similar evidence left by any creature as described in the hunt the blighted fey ability.
When the blightwarden does this, for the next 24 hours, he can use any one extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability granted by the template (or the blight subtype) for a number of minutes equal to his ranger level. This duration need not be used all at once, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. Saving throw DCs for this ability are calculated as if the blightwarden had the relevant template (for example, the DC of an ability from the blighted fey template would be equal to 10 + half the blightwarden's Hit Dice + his Constitution modifier). He cannot use abilities that would create a permanent effect beyond this ability's duration, and can never use more than one ability from a template or subtype in this way during a single 24-hour period.
For example, the blightwarden cannot use a blighted ooze's cursed domain ability to create a domain of evil. However, the blightwarden could gain a blighted fey's thorn throw ability for a number of minutes equal to his ranger level (in this case, the blightwarden would gain a thorn attack for that duration).ª0
