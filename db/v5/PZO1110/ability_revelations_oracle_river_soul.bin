·A river soul oracle must take the following revelations at the listed levels.
River Flow (Su) At 1st level, as a free action while you are underwater, you can negate the penalties you take for making bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing melee attacks underwater. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The rounds do not have to be used consecutively. River Form (Su) At 11th level, you can become one with a river. Once a day as a standard action, while immersed in a river, you can completely merge with it. Your body and all your gear meld into the water, as per meld into stone, except abilities that control or shape water expel you and deal you 5d6 damage rather than abilities that control or shape stone. You travel along with the river at the rate it is currently moving. You can remain in this form a number of hours equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Transforming back to your normal form is a swift action. River Soul Revelation (Su) At 20th level, you strengthen your ties to the river with which you bonded. While traveling on or immersed in the river, you gain fast healing 10 and immunity to bleed, death attacks, exhaustion, fatigue, nausea effects, negative levels, and sickened effects. Additionally, if you are slain and your body or some part of your body (including your ashes, if applicable) is floated down the river in a specially prepared vessel costing 5,000 gp, you return to life as per resurrection once you reach the mouth of the river, as long as the trip has taken 24 hours or longer.ª,
