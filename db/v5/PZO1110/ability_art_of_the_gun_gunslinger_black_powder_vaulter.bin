¿At 7th level, if the black powder vaulter has at least 1 grit point, she doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity when attacking with a firearm or reloading a firearm. Additionally, whenever she is wielding a firearm, she counts as threatening an area around her as though she were wielding a melee weapon. If an opponent provokes an attack of opportunity from her, she can use the pistolâ€“whip deed as her attack of opportunity, spending 1 grit point as normal.
Alternatively, if her firearm is loaded, she can spend 1 grit point to fire her gun as her attack of opportunity.ª=
