    "text": "At 3rd level, a charger\u0027s hoof attack deals an additional 1d6 points of damage and its critical threat range increases to 19–20. This effect doesn\u0027t stack with any other effect that expands the critical threat range of a weapon. Whenever he performs a charge, the charger can make an additional hoof attack against his target with a –5 penalty on his attack roll."
