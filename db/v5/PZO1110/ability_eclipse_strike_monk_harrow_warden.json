    "text": "Beginning at 15th level, the harrow warden can strike a target with enough force to realign its place in the world. Foes damaged by the harrow warden\u0027s idiot strike can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk\u0027s level + the monk\u0027s Wisdom modifier). Those that fail are transmuted into a harmless form, as per the baleful polymorph spell."
