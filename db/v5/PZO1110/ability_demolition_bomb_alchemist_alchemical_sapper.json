    "text": "At 1st level, an alchemical sapper can create a demolition bomb. This bomb deals double his normal bomb damage, half of which is bludgeoning and piercing damage, the other half of which is fire damage.\nThis bomb ignores a number of points of hardness up to 1/2 the alchemical sapper\u0027s level (minimum 1). This counts as an ability that modifies the alchemical sapper\u0027s bomb, so it doesn\u0027t stack with other discoveries that modify bombs. The alchemical sapper can\u0027t use his demolition bomb with the fast bombs discovery. An alchemical sapper can only expend one use of his bomb class feature to create a demolition bomb once per day. He can create one additional demolition bomb per day at 5th level and every 4 alchemist levels thereafter."
