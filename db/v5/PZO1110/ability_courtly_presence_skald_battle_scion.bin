şAt 1st level, a battle scion's bearing radiates command and presence, allowing her to tower over her opponents in social situations. The battle scion adds 1/2 her character level to Intimidate checks, and she starts any verbal duel with an extra edge that she can use for the presence tactic so long as she is not at a significant or extreme disadvantage in the duel. However, her bardic knowledge ability applies to only Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (history), Knowledge (local), and Knowledge (nobility).ª2
