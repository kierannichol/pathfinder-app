    "text": "At 1st level, a vermin tamer chooses a giant beetle, giant centipede, giant gecko, giant slug, or giant spider as his mount.\nThe selected mount is combat trained. The vermin tamer does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding his mount. If the vermin tamer\u0027s starting mount is large enough to act as a mount, it gains Light Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat. If the selected animal companion is too small to act as a proper mount, then the vermin tamer gains Undersized Mount as a bonus feat."
