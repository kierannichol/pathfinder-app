ñAt 11th level, whenever a Dune drifter declares a challenge, the threat range of the dune drifter's firearm is doubled against the target of his challenge. This increase only affects one weapon and does not stack with other effects that increase the threat range of the weapon. In addition, if the dune drifter rolls a misfire during his challenge, the Dune drifter can spend 1 grit point to reroll the attack roll.
The dune drifter must accept the results of the second roll, even if it is worse.ª1
