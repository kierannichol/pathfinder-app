    "text": "At 6th level, a softstrike monk can force a piece of his life force into a nonliving creature to disrupt its animating essence. If he hits an undead foe with an unarmed attack, he can spend 1 ki point as a free action to remove the target\u0027s immunity to nonlethal damage for a number of minutes equal to his Wisdom modifier. If, during this time, the target\u0027s nonlethal damage exceeds its current hit points, it is destroyed. At 10th level, a softstrike monk can also use this ability against constructs."
