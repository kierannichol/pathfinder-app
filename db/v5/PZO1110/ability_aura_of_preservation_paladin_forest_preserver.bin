¼At 14th level, a forest preserver grants animals and plants within 10 feet spell resistance equal to 11 + her paladin level. This spell resistance doesn't apply against harmless effects created by the forest preserver or allies within 10 feet of her. This ability functions only if the forest preserver is conscious.ª<
