    "text": "At 5th level, the spell warrior gains increased versatility when attempting to counteract enemy spellcasting. When counterspelling, he can expend two skald spell slots of the same level or higher than the opponent\u0027s spell, regardless of the school of that spell.\nAt 11th level, when counterspelling an opponent\u0027s spell, the spell warrior only has to expend one skald spell slot of the level of the spell being cast.\nAt 17th level, the spell warrior gains Parry Spell as a bonus feat. The skald does not have to meet the prerequisites for this feat."
