ÿAt 4th level, a seeker of the lost gains the ability to strike precisely underwater.
When a seeker of the lost makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon, the damage is not halved for being made underwater, as is usually the case for attacks that deal slashing or bludgeoning damage or, if the rogue is off-balance, attacks that deal piercing damage (see off-balance). In addition, when a seeker of the lost makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon against a construct, she ignores any hardness the construct has.ª:
