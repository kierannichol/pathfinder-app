    "text": "At 7th level, a firebrand can channel her explosive potential into a mighty blast. As a standard action, the firebrand shoots a 30-foot cone of fire from the barrel of her gun. The firebrand designates one creature in the squares affected by the cone to be the target and makes an attack roll with her firearm against that creature; on a hit, the target takes damage as if it were directly hit by both the firebrand\u0027s firearm and her bomb. Creatures in all other squares in the cone (as well as the target\u0027s square, if the gunslinger\u0027s attack missed) take splash damage as if they were in the area of the firebrand\u0027s bomb, with a Reflex saving throw for half damage. (The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + half the firebrand\u0027s gunslinger level + the firebrand\u0027s Charisma modifier.) Using this deed costs 2 grit points and expends one of the firebrand\u0027s daily uses of bombs (see the bombs ability on page 5), as well as the appropriate ammunition for the firearm attack; ammunition that does not require an attack roll cannot be used this way."
