˜At 3rd level, a beast-wrestler selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. The only humanoid subtype the beast-wrestler can select is giant. She gains a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to her CMD against creatures of the type she selected.
At 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, the beast-wrestler can select an additional type of creature. In addition, at each such interval the bonuses against any one type of creature she's chosen (including the one just selected, if so desired) increase by 2. If a specific creature falls into more than one category, the beast-wrestler's bonuses don't stack; she simply uses whichever bonus is higher.ª4
