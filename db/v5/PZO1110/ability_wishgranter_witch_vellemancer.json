    "text": "Beginning at 6th level, a vellemancer can borrow mental strength from others\u0027 hopes and dreams to empower her own spellcasting. A creature can make a wish as a free action at any time, even during the vellemancer\u0027s turn. The vellemancer must be able to hear and understand a wish in order to use it as a spell component. A spell that doesn\u0027t normally have a verbal component gains one when cast using this ability. A wish doesn\u0027t need to mention the name of a specific spell, but it must describe an outcome that can be accomplished by casting a spell the vellemancer knows (for example, wishing to be more likable could supply the verbal component for alter self, eagle\u0027s splendor, or even baleful polymorph, depending on the results). A vellemancer gains a +1 bonus to her caster level when using a creature\u0027s wish as a verbal component in this manner, but she cannot include herself as a target of such spells. She can be affected by such a spell if it affects an area rather than one or more targets. A vellemancer is under no compulsion to grant a creature\u0027s wish. Once the vellemancer grants a creature\u0027s wish using this ability, she cannot use this ability to grant that creature any further wishes for 24 hours."
