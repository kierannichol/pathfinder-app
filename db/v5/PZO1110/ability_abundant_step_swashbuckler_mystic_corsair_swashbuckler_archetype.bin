ÙAt 15th level, a mystic corsair can spend 2 panache points as a move action to move magically between spaces, as dimension door. Her caster level for this effect is equal to her swashbuckler level. She can't take other creatures with her when she uses this ability.
This deed replaces dizzying defense.
Bonus Feats: At 4th level, a mystic corsair's swashbuckler levels are considered both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of meeting combat feat prerequisites.ªO
