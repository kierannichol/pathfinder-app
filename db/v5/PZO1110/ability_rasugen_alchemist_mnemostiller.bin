œA mnemostiller learns to brew a unique type of mutagen, called a rasugen, that suppresses his mind to enter a state of sublime purity. In this state, a mnemostiller becomes incredibly resilient, but cannot perform complex skills. Once imbibed, a rasugen grants a +2 alchemical bonus on all saving throws and 2 temporary hit points per alchemist level for 10 minutes per alchemist level. In addition, while the rasugen is in effect, a mnemostiller takes a â€“2 penalty to his Intelligence score and can't attempt checks using Appraise, Craft, Disable Device, Heal, Knowledge (any), Profession, Sleight of Hand, or Spellcraft. This acts in all other ways like a mutagen.ª-
