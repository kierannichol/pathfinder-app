®At 19th level, a wild soul lands punishing blows that devastate his nemeses' ability to focus. When he confirms a critical hit against a creature against whom his nemesis bonus applies, for 1 minute the target must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + the wild soul's Wisdom modifier + twice the spell's level) to cast an arcane spell, create an extract, or use an alchemist's bomb, and the target can't spend or gain grit.ª2
