ÜA mnemostiller's alchemy relies on force of personality, using his own mind as an alchemy lab to draw and purify the mnemos collected from others.
A mnemostiller uses his Charisma score in place of his Intelligence score for the purpose of extracts and bonus extracts. A mnemostiller still uses his Intelligence score to learn new formulae.
The mnemostiller can cast detect thoughts as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier (minimum 1).ª2
