    "text": "At 1st level, a prowler at world\u0027s end gains the ability to channel the spirits of creation, granting him the medium\u0027s spirit and spirit surge abilities. A prowler channels the cheetah (which acts as the trickster), the leopard (which acts as the guardian), the lion (which acts as the marshal), and the tiger (which acts as the champion). The prowler does not have access to the archmage or hierophant legends. The favored locations for these spirits are altars, churches, sacred groves, and shrines, and their taboo requires the prowler to strongly revere nature and attempt to either destroy or incapacitate evil wherever he encounters it.\nA prowler at world\u0027s end gains his spirit\u0027s lesser power at 1st level, its intermediate power at 8th level, and its greater power at 16th level. A prowler\u0027s spirit surge bonus never advances beyond 1d6."
