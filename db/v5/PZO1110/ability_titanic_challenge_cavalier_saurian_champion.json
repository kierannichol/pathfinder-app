    "text": "A saurian champion considers only the largest creatures a true challenge. His titanic challenge adds only half his level on damage rolls against Medium or smaller creatures, but he adds a +1 bonus on attack rolls against a target of his challenge that is at least two size categories larger than himself (Huge for Medium saurian champions) and a +2 bonus on attack rolls against a Colossal target of his challenge."
