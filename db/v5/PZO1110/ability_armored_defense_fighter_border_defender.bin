®At 3rd level, a border defender gains a bonus to his CMD against bull rush, dirty trick, drag, grapple, overrun, reposition, and trip combat maneuver checks.
This bonus also applies to the DC of foes' Acrobatics checks to move through squares he threatens. This bonus is +1 when the border defender is wearing medium armor, and +3 when he is wearing heavy armor.
At 7th, 11th, and 15th levels, these bonuses increase by 1.
In addition to this, the border defender is able to choose one of the following combat maneuvers: bull rush, dirty trick, drag, grapple, overrun, reposition, or trip. When he is wearing medium or armor, the border defender adds half his armor training bonus feats on combat maneuver checks for the selected maneuver.
He can choose an additional combat maneuver at 7th, 11th, and 15th levels.ª6
