èAt 5th level, a hag-riven can expend one of her daily spell slots as a swift action to grant her claws an enhancement bonus equal to the level of the spell slot sacrificed. This bonus lasts for 1 minute and stacks with existing enhancement bonuses (such as those provided by magic fang or magic items) to a maximum of +5. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves.
Beginning at 7th level, the hag-riven can also expend some or all of the bonus provided by her sorcerous claws to add any of the following weapon properties to her claws for 1 minute: flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, keen, nullifying, seaborne, spellstealing, shock, shocking burst, or wounding.
Her claws must have a minimum enhancement bonus of +1 before any special abilities can be added.™3
