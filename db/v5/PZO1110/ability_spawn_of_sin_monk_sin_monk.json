    "text": "At 20th level, the sin monk becomes the physical manifestation of his sins. He is forevermore treated as an aberration rather than a humanoid (or whatever the monk\u0027s creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects, and his mind is so consumed by sin that he gains immunity to mind-affecting effects.\nHe does not change in appearance or gain other abilities; however, should the sin monk be slain and brought back from the dead, he returns to life as a sinspawn, retaining his class levels but otherwise replacing his creature type and racial abilities with those of his new form and becoming an NPC under the GM\u0027s control."
