    "text": "At 11th level, by expending 3 points from her arcane reservoir, an aeromancer can release a powerful blast of wind to push back her foes. This takes the form of either a 20-foot-radius burst centered on the aeromancer or a 40-foot cone originating from the aeromancer\u0027s space. She can choose which form the wind takes each time she uses the ability. The affected area is filled with hurricane-force winds (75 mph). This makes normal ranged attacks passing through this area impossible, imposes a –8 penalty on ranged attacks from siege weapons that pass through the area, and imposes a –12 penalty on Fly checks attempted within the area. Additionally, Large creatures in the area are in danger of being checked, and Medium or smaller creatures in the area are in danger of being blown away. The winds created by this ability last for 1 round."
