ªAt 2nd level, a family hunter chooses a particular family line of mortal creatures to cleanse (she must choose an actual family line like â€œThe Montrose family," rather than something generic that would cover all creatures of a given kind like â€œAll humans descended from the first human created by the gods"). She can target any creature from that family line with discern next of kin (with a caster level equal to her slayer level) at will as a spell-like ability. The save DC is Charisma-based and is modified by the slayer's studied target bonus if the creature is also her studied target. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to this ability for 24 hours. If the family hunter's chosen family line is completely eradicated, she can choose a new one after 1 month of studying.ª/
