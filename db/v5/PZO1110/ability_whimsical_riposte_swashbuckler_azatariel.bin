ýAt 3rd level, the azatariel adds her Charisma modifier to attack and damage rolls made with light or one-handed piercing weapons as part of her opportune parry and riposte deed (including when riposting).
In addition, whenever the azatariel successfully parries an opponent's attack, instead of riposting she can redirect that attack to another target as an immediate action. The new target must be within the attacker's reach, and the attacker uses the original attack roll to determine the attack's success.ª7
