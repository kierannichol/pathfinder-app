While using this feat, he doesn\u0027t provoke an attack of opportunity, even if he doesn\u0027t have the Improved Bull Rush feat.\nAt 4th level, while using the Hurricane Punch feat, the windstep master can bull rush a target up to two size categories larger. At 12th level, the windstep master\u0027s target can be up to three size categories larger. At 20th level, the target can be of any size category.\nAt 8th level, when the windstep master uses the Hurricane Punch feat to successfully bull rush a creature, he can push the creature back an additional 5 feet. At 16th level, he can push the creature back an additional 10 feet."
