êA buccaneer of 4th level or higher can use his performance to encourage an enemy to surrender. To be affected, an enemy must be within 30 feet and be able to see and hear the buccaneer's performance. An affected enemy feels the irresistible urge to drop any held weapons and fall prone. This effect lasts for 1 round--essentially, the affected enemy takes no actions on its next turn other than to lie prone, although it is not considered flat-footed or helpless. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the buccaneer's level + the buccaneer's Charisma modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature. Song of surrender is an enchantment(compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability and relies on audible components.ª/
