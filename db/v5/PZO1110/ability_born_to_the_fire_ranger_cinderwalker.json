    "text": "At 3rd level, a cinderwalker gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks when in volcanic or geothermally active areas. Such areas include calderas, hot springs, lava plains, and volcanically formed hills or mountains. In addition, the cinderwalker adds this bonus on any ability checks, saving throws, or skill checks to avoid geothermal or volcanic hazards. The cinderwalker can choose to improve this bonus in place of improving a favored terrain bonus. A cinderwalker traveling through volcanic or geothermally active areas leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he can leave a trail if he chooses)."
