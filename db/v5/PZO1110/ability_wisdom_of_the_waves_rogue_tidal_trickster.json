    "text": "A tidal trickster gains a swim speed equal to her unmodified base land speed (or increases her swim speed by 10 feet, if she has a racial swim speed). Instead of the +8 bonus granted by a swim speed, she gains a racial bonus on Swim checks equal to 4 + half her rogue level (if she has a racial swim speed, she uses the better bonus). She gains a bonus on Bluff checks equal to half her rogue level. At 3rd level, she gains a +1 bonus on Will saves whenever she is underwater; this bonus increases by 1 at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter."
