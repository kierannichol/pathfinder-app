ÔA buccaneer is a pirate who specializes in raiding ships and port towns, but who leaves his victims alive whenever possible. Buccaneers are flashy, debonair pirates who enjoy the excitement and rewards of piracy, but prefer not to kill; they are welcome on ships whose captains prefer to avoid the punishments that murder would bring or who lack the heart to strike down civilians in cold blood. Buccaneers are also popular in privateer crews--and among slave traders.º±0
