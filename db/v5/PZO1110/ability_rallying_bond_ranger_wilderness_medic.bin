éAt 4th level, a wilderness medic must choose his companions for his hunter's bond.
At 9th level, the wilderness medic can encourage all of his companions when he uses his hunter's bond to benefit his companions (see the ranger's hunter's bond ability for more details). As a free action when the wilderness medic uses a move action to grant affected allies half his favored enemy bonus, he can also grant affected allies the benefits of remove fear. The wilderness medic can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier.
At 14th level, when the wilderness medic uses this ability, he can instead affect all allies that benefit from his hunter's bond with blessing of fervor, using his ranger level as his caster level.ª4
