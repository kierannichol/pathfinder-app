    "text": "Starting at 5th level, a techslinger can select one specific type of advanced technology firearm (such as a laser pistol, mindrender, stun gun, or zero rifle). Thereafter, she gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when using that firearm. Furthermore, she treats all detrimental glitches of timeworn versions of her selected firearm as a result of no glitch. (She can retain the effects of beneficial glitches if she wishes.)\nEvery 4 levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the techslinger selects another type of advanced technology firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well."
