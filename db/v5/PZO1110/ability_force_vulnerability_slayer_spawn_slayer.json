    "text": "At 20th level, a spawn slayer can create an opening in even an invulnerable foe\u0027s defenses. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a studied target at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the damage bypasses any damage reduction and the target must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 10 + half the slayer\u0027s level + the slayer\u0027s Intelligence modifier) or lose one of its defensive abilities for 2d6 rounds. The slayer can choose which defensive ability is lost from the following options: a single immunity, all resistances, regeneration, or spell resistance. Whether or not the target fails this save, it cannot be targeted by force vulnerability again (by you or another slayer) for 24 hours."
