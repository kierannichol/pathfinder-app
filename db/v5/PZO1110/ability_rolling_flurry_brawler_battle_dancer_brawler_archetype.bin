‰When a battle dancer uses her brawler's flurry, she must move 5 feet before each melee attack or combat maneuver. If she is unable to move 5 feet, she can't attempt any further attacks or combat maneuvers. She can't exceed her maximum speed. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity if the brawler would be able to take a 5-foot step normally; if she would be unable to (for instance, if she were in difficult terrain), the movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal unless she succeeds at the appropriate Acrobatics checks.
While using this ability, she can still take her normal 5-foot step before or after making her attacks.ªE
