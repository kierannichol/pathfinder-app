    "text": "At 3rd level, a scroll scoundrel gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against abilities and spells he has already successfully saved against within the past minute (even if the spells or abilities in question were used by different creatures). This bonus increases by +1 when the scroll scoundrel reaches 6th level, and by an additional +1 for every three levels thereafter, to a maximum of +6 at 18th level."
