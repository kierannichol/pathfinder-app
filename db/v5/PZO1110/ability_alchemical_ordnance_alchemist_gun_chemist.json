    "text": "A gun chemist is adept at using his know-how to infuse his ammunition with volatile chemicals and his own magical reserves. When loading a firearm, he can infuse the ammunition as a free action. The compounds are unstable, and if not fired within a number of rounds equal to the gun chemist\u0027s Intelligence modifier (though no sooner than the end of his next turn), the alchemical ordnance becomes inert and loses its additional effects; he can still fire the firearm as normal. Each day, the gun chemist can infuse a number of pieces of alchemical ordnance equal to his class level + his Intelligence modifier, and he can fire no more than one piece per round.\nAlchemical ordnance deals damage as normal, plus an amount of fire damage equal to 1d6 + the gun chemist\u0027s Intelligence modifier. The damage of the gun chemist\u0027s alchemical ordnance increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered class level (this bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike). The explosive nature of alchemical ordnance causes the attack-- both the firearm\u0027s base damage and the alchemical ordnance\u0027s additional damage--to deal full damage to swarms of any size. If the gun chemist uses alchemical ordnance to make a scattering shot with a weapon with the scatter quality, each creature in the area instead takes additional fire damage equal to the alchemical ordnance\u0027s minimum damage (so if the alchemical ordnance would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage normally, it deals only 6 points of fire damage with a scattering shot).\nThe gun chemist\u0027s alchemical ordnance functions safely only in weapons he wields. If anyone but a gun chemist attempts to fire a firearm loaded with alchemical ordnance that is not yet inert, the firearm\u0027s misfire value increases by 4.\nIf the firearm would explode as the result of such a misfire, the explosion deals additional fire damage equal to that of the alchemical ordnance.\nAlchemical ordnance is treated like an alchemist\u0027s bomb for the purpose of discoveries, though such discoveries ignore any effects associated with a bomb\u0027s splash damage or radius unless the gun chemist also applies the exploding bullet discovery (see below). A scattering shot modified by a discovery applies additional effects as though affected creatures were caught in the splash damage of a bomb rather than subject to a direct hit. The DCs of saving throws associated with alchemical ordnance are equal to 10 + half the gun chemist\u0027s alchemist level + the gun chemist\u0027s Intelligence modifier."
