»A nornkith can always act in the surprise round, even if he does not notice her enemies, though she remains flat-footed until she takes an action. In addition, she gains a bonus on initiative rolls equal to half her monk level (minimum +1). At 20th level, a nornkith's initiative roll is automatically a natural 20.ª'
