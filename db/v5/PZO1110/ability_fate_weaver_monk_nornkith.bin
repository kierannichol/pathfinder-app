„At 11th level, a nornkith can spend 1 ki point as an immediate action to force a creature within 60 feet to reroll one saving throw before the results of the roll are revealed. The creature must take the result of the second roll, even if it's worse than the original roll. Whether the new result is a success or failure, the creature cannot be the target of this ability again for 1 day.ª(
