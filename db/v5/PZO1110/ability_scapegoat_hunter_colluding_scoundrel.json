    "text": "A colluding scoundrel is adept at redirecting a foe\u0027s hostility toward another creature, creating openings for her own attacks. A number of times per day equal to her hunter level, as a swift action, she can target one foe within 30 feet and designate one willing ally adjacent to that foe as a scapegoat. For the following minute, the target takes a –2 penalty on attacks against any creature other than the designated scapegoat, and the target has a 10% spell failure chance on spells that don\u0027t target the scapegoat or include the scapegoat in their area of effect. The penalty increases to –4 at 8th level and –6 at 15th level.\nThe colluding scoundrel can designate her animal companion as a scapegoat without it counting against her daily uses of this ability.\nThis is a mind-affecting effect. The effect ends if the colluding scoundrel falls unconscious or is slain."
