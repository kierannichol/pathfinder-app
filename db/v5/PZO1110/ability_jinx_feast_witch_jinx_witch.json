    "text": "At 10th level, when the jinx witch uses her jinx-eating ability, she also gains the ability to cast the eaten spell as a spell-like ability, using her witch level as her caster level and her Intelligence modifier to determine the spell-like ability\u0027s saving throw DC. If the eaten spell is not on her spell list or is of a spell level higher than the witch is capable of casting herself, she must succeed at a concentration check (DC \u003d 20 + the spell\u0027s level) in order to cast it; failing this check results in the loss of the spell-like ability with no effect."
