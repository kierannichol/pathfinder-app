¹At 11th level, whenever a huntmaster and any of his hunting pack or multiple animals in his hunting pack are adjacent and attack the same target in melee, they are treated as flanking. In addition, they can flank a creature with improved uncanny dodge if the huntmaster has at least 4 more levels than the target.ª.
