èAt 2nd level, a faith singer can select one domain from among those belonging to his deity. Once per day as a spell-like ability using his bard level as his caster level, he can cast the 1st-level domain spell while giving a bardic performance.
At 6th level, and every 4 bard levels thereafter, he can similarly cast the next-higher domain spell as a spell-like ability (to a maximum of the 5th-level domain spell at bard level 18th). He can use each spell-like ability only once per day.ª7
