    "text": "A crystal tender forms a mystic connection with the precious stones and gems she has sworn to protect. Her spirit animal always appears to be composed of a crystalline substance and gains a +2 bonus to its natural armor. Her spirit animal is treated as an outsider with both the earth and native subtypes, and counts as a crystalline creature for the purposes of spells and abilities. The unique nature of her spirit animal increases the cost of replacing it to 750 gp per shaman level."
