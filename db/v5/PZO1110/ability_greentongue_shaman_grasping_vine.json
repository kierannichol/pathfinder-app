    "text": "At 2nd level, as a standard action, a grasping vine can use speak with plants as a spell-like ability. The grasping vine can use this ability a number of times per day equal to half her shaman level. In addition, while under the effects of speak with plants, the grasping vine can deliver a suggestion (as per the spell) to a single plant creature within 30 feet, ignoring the plant\u0027s immunity to mind-affecting effects. The grasping vine can use this ability once per day at 2nd level, plus an additional time per day every 4 levels after 2nd level."
