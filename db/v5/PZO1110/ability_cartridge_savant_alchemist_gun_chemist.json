    "text": "At 2nd level, a gun chemist can make optimal and highly efficient use of alchemical cartridges, such as flare cartridges. If the gun chemist fires such an alchemical cartridge and it allows a saving throw to negate or reduce the cartridge\u0027s effect, the saving throw\u0027s DC increases by 1 (to a maximum DC of 22). The DC increases by an additional 1 at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 7 higher at 20th level). When a gun chemist fires an alchemical cartridge that deals a type of damage in place of a firearm\u0027s normal damage (such as a dragon\u0027s breath cartridge), he can increase the damage dealt by an amount equal to his Intelligence modifier."
