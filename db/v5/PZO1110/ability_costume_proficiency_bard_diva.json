    "text": "At 5th level, the Diva has become so used to wearing strange and cumbersome costumes for her performances that she gains medium armor proficiency and can cast bard spells while wearing medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. At 11th level, she gains heavy armor proficiency and can cast bard spells while wearing heavy armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. A multiclassed diva still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes."
