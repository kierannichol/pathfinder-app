    "text": "An oozemaster can extract deadly toxins from the bodies of slain oozes and use them against his foes, making him a deadly opponent with unpredictable stratagems. As a full-round action while adjacent to an ooze that died within the past 10 minutes, an oozemaster can attempt a Craft (alchemy) check with a DC equal to 10 + the ooze\u0027s Challenge Rating to create a toxin. If successful, the oozemaster can extract a number of doses of toxin from an ooze equal to half its Constitution modifier (minimum 1). These toxins remain potent for 1 hour before becoming inert.\nThe oozemaster can throw an ooze toxin as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet, or he can apply the toxin to a weapon as if it were an injury poison. The toxin deals 1d6 points of acid damage plus an additional 1d6 points of acid damage per 3 Hit Dice the ooze had. If the ooze had any additional effects conveyed by its slam attack other than grab (such as a gelatinous cube\u0027s paralysis ability), the oozemaster can also apply these qualities to this attack. The save DC for additional abilities produced by this attack is 10 + half the alchemist\u0027s level + the alchemist\u0027s Intelligence modifier."
