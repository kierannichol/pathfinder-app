    "text": "When a pact witch reaches 6th level, his familiar turns into an outsider native to his chosen plane.\nThe familiar retains its spells known; its memories; and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, but is treated as a member of its new race in all other respects. The type of creature the familiar becomes is indicated above on Table 1â€“1: Planar Pacts; if more than one type of familiar is listed, a pact witch can choose which type his familiar becomes."
