    "text": "At 8th level, upon confirming a critical hit against an opponent, a lycanthrope hunter can force that opponent to attempt a Will saving throw (DC \u003d 10 + the lycanthrope hunter\u0027s level + the lycanthrope hunter\u0027s Charisma modifier). If the creature fails and it has the shapechanger subtype or is under the effect of any polymorph effect, it immediately reverts to its natural form. If it is already in its natural and unaltered form, this ability has no effect."
