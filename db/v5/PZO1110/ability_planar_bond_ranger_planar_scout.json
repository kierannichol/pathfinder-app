    "text": "At 4th level, rather than forge a bond with an animal or his allies, a planar scout forms a bond with a specific plane. The planar scout becomes infused with the essence of his plane of choice, taking on physical characteristics of denizens native to his chosen plane as well as the abilities listed below.\nAligned Plane: If the planar scout selects a plane with an alignment trait, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against outsiders and creatures with the extraplanar subtype whose alignments oppose this alignment trait. This bonus increases by 1 at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter.\nAstral Plane: Each day, the planar scout can teleport up to 5 feet per ranger level as a move action. This must be used in 5-foot increments. At 10th level, he can do so as a swift action.\nEthereal Plane: The planar scout can damage incorporeal creatures with mundane weapons as if they were ghost touch weapons, and at 10th level, he can inflict critical hits and deal precision damage to incorporeal creatures.\nFey World: As a swift action a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier, a planar scout can gain fast healing 2 for a number of rounds equal to his ranger level.\nPlane of Air: As a swift action, the planar scout can gain a fly speed (average) equal to his base speed for a number of minutes equal to his ranger level (minimum 1 minute). This duration need not be used consecutively.\nPlane of Earth: The planar scout gains a +1 bonus to his natural armor. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels he gains beyond 4th level.\nPlane of Fire: As a swift action, the planar scout can wreathe his body in flames. This grants the planar scout fire resistance 5 and causes his melee attacks to each deal 1d4 additional points of fire damage. The scout\u0027s fire resistance increases to 10 at 9th level, and 15 at 14th level. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his level. These rounds need not be used consecutively.\nPlane of Shadow: The planar scout gains darkvision 60 feet and a +4 bonus on Stealth checks. The bonus on Stealth checks increases by 2 at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter.\nPlane of Water: The planar scout gains the amphibious subtype and a swim speed equal to base speed."
