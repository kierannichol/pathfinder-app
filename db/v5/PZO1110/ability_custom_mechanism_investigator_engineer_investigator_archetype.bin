äAn engineer can create a mechanism, a small device that assists with the execution of an activity. Creating a mechanism requires 1 minute of time and expends 1 use from the engineer's inspiration pool. An engineer chooses a skill to associate with the mechanism when he creates it. As an immediate action, a mechanism can be activated to grant the engineer's inspiration die on a check of the associated skill. An engineer can create a mechanism that affects attack rolls or saving throws, but she expends 2 uses from her inspiration pool to do so. Any creature can use a mechanism, but a creature can have only 1 mechanism at a time, as multiple mechanisms interfere with each other while in close proximity. A mechanism remains active for a number of minutes equal to the engineer's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). At 5th level, an engineer's mechanisms remain active for a number of minutes equal to the engineer's level. At 11th level, an engineer's mechanisms remain active for a number of hours equal to the engineer's level.™L
