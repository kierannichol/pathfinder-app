Only the enemy, not the barbarian’s ally, needs to be within the barbarian’s melee reach in order for the barbarian to make this attack of opportunity. Once the barbarian makes an attack of opportunity against a creature with this ability, she can’t use this ability to make an attack of opportunity against the same creature for 24 hours."
