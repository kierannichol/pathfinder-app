Doomsaying (Su): As a standard action, you can pronounce doom on a creature within 30 feet. The target takes a penalty equal to your oracle level on either all skill checks, all savings throws, or all attack rolls (your choice) for 1 minute or until he fails one such roll. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus. This is a curse effect. Flash of Insight (Su): You gain the cyclops racial ability of the same name. If you already possess this ability, you gain an additional daily use. Prescience (Ex): You gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class against attacks of opportunity and a +2 bonus on concentration checks. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1.ª0
