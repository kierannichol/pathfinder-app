    "text": "At 2nd level, a dwarven scholar masters one aspect of dwarven combat and gains a bonus combat feat. She must meet the prerequisites for this feat, but she treats her bard level as her base attack bonus (in addition to base attack bonuses gained from other classes and racial Hit Dice) for the purpose of qualifying for this feat. At 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, she gains another bonus combat feat."
