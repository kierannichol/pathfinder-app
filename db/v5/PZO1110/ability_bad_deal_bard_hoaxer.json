    "text": "A hoaxer can use his performance to coax a bit of luck (good or bad) into a valuable-seeming object. As a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the hoaxer can use 1 round of bardic performance to invest a single object in his possession with a hex he knows. This object must be light enough to hold in one hand, and cannot already have any magical properties. The object remains hexed as long as the hoaxer continues to spend 1 round of bardic performance each round as a swift action to maintain it, until the hoaxer drops the item, or until triggered.\nThe hex triggers immediately upon being willingly accepted by another creature, targeting its new owner. A bad deal cannot be forced on a creature or slipped into its possession without its knowledge, but a hoaxer can lie or cheat to convince his mark to accept the object, or use spells like beguiling gift.\nAt 1st level, the hoaxer knows one witch hex from the following list: blight, charm, evil eye, fortune, healing, misfortune, slumber, or unnerve beasts.\nAt 3rd level and every 3 bard levels thereafter, he can learn one additional hex. The save DC for a hoaxer\u0027s hexes is equal to 10 + 1/2 the hoaxer\u0027s bard level + his Charisma modifier. These hexes function identically to witch hexes, except they can only target single creatures, and the hoaxer can only use his hexes by investing them into objects.\nIf the hoaxer learns hexes from any other source (such as the witch class), he cannot invoke them into an object."
