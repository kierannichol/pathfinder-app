    "text": "An arcane tinkerer can turn the animating magic of a construct against itself.\nAs a standard action, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to impose a â€“1 penalty on a single construct\u0027s attack and damage rolls for 1 round. The target can attempt a Will save to negate this effect (DC \u003d 10 + half the arcane tinkerer\u0027s level + the arcane tinkerer\u0027s Charisma modifier). At 7th level, instead of gaining an arcanist exploit, an arcane tinkerer can improve her manipulate construct ability to instead affect a construct with slow for 1 round. At 13th level, if the arcane tinkerer has previously improved this ability, instead of gaining an arcanist exploit, she can improve this ability again to instead cause a construct to become helpless for 1 round."
