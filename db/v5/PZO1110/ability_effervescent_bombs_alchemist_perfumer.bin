»Rather than deal direct damage, a perfumer's bombs create an effervescent puddle in a 5-foot radius for a number of rounds equal to the alchemist's intelligence bonus (minimum 1). Each creature within this area takes 1d4 points of fire damage immediately and again each round it remains within or enters the puddle.
A creature caught in the puddle when it is first created can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the perfumer's level + the perfumer's Intelligence modifier) for half damage. The effervescent bombs' damage increases by 1d4 at 3rd level and every odd level thereafter. Effervescent bombs otherwise functions as bombs, and discoveries that apply to bombs apply to effervescent bombs.ª4
