ÂIf an aquanaut takes a fighter bonus feat that normally requires selecting a single weapon (except weapon proficiency feats), he can instead apply the feat to all melee piercing weapons with which he is already proficient and that meet all other prerequisites for that feat. This ability counts as having the feat for each such individual weapon for the purpose of meeting prerequisites. This ability also applies to the weapon mastery class feature.ª.
