Injectionsclass:alchemist#interrogatorarchetype_featureclass_feature¢£	
 	At 1st level, an interrogator uses his skill with alchemy to create injections. Each day, an interrogator can create a number of injections equal to his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier. It takes 1 hour to create the injections. An injection is inert until the interrogator attempts to use it.
Using an injection is a standard action that requires a melee touch attack. If the attack hits, the target of an injection takes a â€“2 penalty on its Will saving throws for a number of minutes equal to half the interrogator's class level (minimum 1). If the interrogator is also using a serum with this injection, the penalty on Will saves applies to any save against the serum.
If the melee touch attack fails, the injection isn't delivered but can still be used again--once activated, it remains potent for 1 day. An injection that hasn't been administered becomes inert if it leaves the interrogator's possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his possession. The penalties from multiple injections don't stack, nor do the penalties from injections stack with penalties from a mesmerist's stare or a witch's evil eye hex.
Injections are mind-affecting poison effects.ª0
