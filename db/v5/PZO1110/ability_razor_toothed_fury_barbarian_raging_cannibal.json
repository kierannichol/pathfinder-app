    "text": "At 6th level, a raging cannibal\u0027s bite becomes even more fearsome. When using her bite attack, the raging cannibal can take a â€“1 penalty on her attack roll to add 2 points of bleed damage to the damage dealt. At 10th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the attack penalty increases by 1 and the bleed damage increases by 2 points.\nThis replaces damage reduction."
