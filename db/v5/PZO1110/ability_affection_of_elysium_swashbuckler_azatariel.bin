öAn azatariel's affection relieves harmful afflictions. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, an azatariel selects a mercy from those available to a paladin whose class level is equal to her swashbuckler level. She can show her affection to a willing, adjacent creature as a standard action to apply the effects of these mercies to the targeted creature, treating her swashbuckler level as her paladin level. An azatariel can use this ability a number of times per day equal to half her swashbuckler level plus her Charisma modifier.™:
