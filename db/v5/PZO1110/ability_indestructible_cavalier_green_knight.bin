ÖAt 20th level, a green knight is virtually impervious to death. She gains a +6 bonus to her Constitution score. In addition, the green knight becomes immune to death effects and to effects that would kill her without reducing her to 0 hit points, unless the effect involves decapitation. If she is decapitated, the green knight can continue to act normally. Reattachment requires the head and body to be joined and the application of any effect that restores hit points.ª3
