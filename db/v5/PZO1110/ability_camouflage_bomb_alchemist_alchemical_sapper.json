    "text": "At 3rd level, an alchemical sapper becomes skilled at hiding his bombs. When deploying a delayed bomb or trip mine (see below), the alchemical sapper can camouflage the bomb by taking an additional full-round action. Creatures searching for traps must succeed at a Perception check (DC \u003d 10 + the alchemical sapper\u0027s alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier) to notice a camouflaged bomb."
