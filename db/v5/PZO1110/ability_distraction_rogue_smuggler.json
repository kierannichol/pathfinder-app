    "text": "A smuggler uses patter and body language to deflect searchers from hidden items. At 2nd level, a smuggler may make a Bluff check opposed by a searcher\u0027s Perception check when a searcher looks for items the smuggler has concealed. If the smuggler\u0027s Bluff check succeeds, the searcher must make a second Perception check and take the lower of the two rolls.\nThis ability replaces Evasion."
