    "text": "At 3rd level a divine guardian can intercept attacks directed at the target of her divine troth as if she had the Bodyguard and In Harm\u0027s Way feats. The divine guardian\u0027s aura of courage does not grant a bonus to allies within 10 feet, but still grants her immunity to fear effects.\nThis ability modifies aura of courage.\nBonus Feat: A divine guardian gains a bonus feat at 7th level, and additional bonus feats at 10th and 13th level."
