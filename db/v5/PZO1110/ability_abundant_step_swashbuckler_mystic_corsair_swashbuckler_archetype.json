    "text": "At 15th level, a mystic corsair can spend 2 panache points as a move action to move magically between spaces, as dimension door. Her caster level for this effect is equal to her swashbuckler level. She can\u0027t take other creatures with her when she uses this ability.\nThis deed replaces dizzying defense.\nBonus Feats: At 4th level, a mystic corsair\u0027s swashbuckler levels are considered both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of meeting combat feat prerequisites."
