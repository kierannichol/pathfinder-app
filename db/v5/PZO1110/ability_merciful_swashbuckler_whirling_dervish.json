    "text": "While violence is sometimes necessary to cleanse evil, dervishes rarely revel in a foe\u0027s defeat. A whirling dervish does not gain any panache for dropping a foe below 0 hit points unless that foe is an evil outsider or undead, or if the damage she dealt was nonlethal.\nAdditionally, she gains 1 panache point if she causes an evildoer with a number of Hit Dice equal to at least 1/2 her character level to surrender to her. She can gain this benefit no more than once per round, even if multiple enemies surrender."
