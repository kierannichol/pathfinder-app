    "text": "An armored battlemage cannot spend points from his arcane pool to enhance weapons. Instead, he can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to grant armor he is wearing a +1 enhancement bonus for 1 minute. For every 4 magus levels he has beyond 1st, the armor gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +5 at 17th level. These bonuses stack with existing armor enhancement bonuses to a maximum of +5.\nMultiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves.\nAt 5th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of the following armor special abilities: balanced, bitter, fortification (heavy, light, or medium), ghost touch, invulnerability, spell resistance (13, 15, 17, or 19), or spell storing.\nAdding these special abilities consumes an amount of bonus equal to the ability\u0027s base price modifier. In addition, the armored battlemage can grant his armor the energy resistance special ability at the cost of a +3 bonus or the improved energy resistance special ability at the cost of a +5 bonus. These special abilities are added to any the armor already has, but duplicates do not stack. If the armor is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other special abilities can be added. These bonuses and special abilities are decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time the armored battlemage uses this ability. These bonuses do not function if the armor is worn by anyone other than the magus.\nAn armored battlemage can enhance only one suit of armor in this way at one time. If he uses this ability again, the first use immediately ends."
