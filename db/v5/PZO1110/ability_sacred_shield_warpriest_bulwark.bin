ãDedicated training and divine grace allow a bulwark to lessen the burden of a shield's weight. As long as a bulwark is wielding a shield, she reduces her total armor check penalty by 1. This reduction improves by 1 for every 5 warpriest levels she has, to a maximum reduction of 5 at 20th level.
At 4th level, a bulwark can call upon the General of Vengeance's might to bless her shield as a swift action. As long as she is wielding a shield, she gains DR 1/-- and fire resistance 5. For every 4 levels beyond 4th, this DR increases by 1 (to a maximum of DR 5/-- at 20th level) and her fire resistance increases by 5 (becoming immunity to fire at 20th level). A bulwark can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her warpriest level; these rounds need not be consecutive.
As a swift action while her shield is benefiting from the General of Vengeance's blessing (or as part of the action to activate the blessing), a bulwark can direct her shield to protect an ally within 60 feet. The shield sprouts burning wings and flies to defend the ally, providing its shield bonus, damage reduction, and fire resistance to that ally instead of the bulwark. Rounds in which she uses her shield in this manner count normally against the rounds per day in which she can use this ability. As long as she has rounds of sacred shield remaining, she can recall her shield to her arm as a swift action and regain its benefits. A bulwark must maintain one hand free to direct the shield; if she no longer has a hand free or if the duration of her sacred shield ability ends, the shield drops to the ground and ceases providing any benefit.ª.
