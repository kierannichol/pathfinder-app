§At 9th level, a life channeler gains a third option when using a coup de grace on a sentient humanoid.
If the victim had a CR at least as high as the life channeler's class level, the life channeler can store the creature's life energy in her body. She can have the life energy from only 1 creature in her body at a time. While she is storing life energy, if she would take damage or die from a death effect or if she would gain negative levels or take energy drain, she can sacrifice the stored energy to negate the effect without spending an action.ª/
