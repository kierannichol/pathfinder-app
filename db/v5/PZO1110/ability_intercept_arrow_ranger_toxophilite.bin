ãAt 3rd level, a toxophilite can ready a ranged attack to deflect a ranged weapon attack against her or an ally within 30 feet. To deflect the attack, the toxophilite makes an attack with a ranged weapon. If her attack roll is greater than the attacking opponent's roll, the opponent's initial attack automatically misses. For each size category the attacking creature is larger than the toxophilite, the toxophilite takes a â€“4 penalty on her attack roll. The toxophilite must declare the use of this ability after the attack is announced, but before the roll is made. Unusually massive ranged weapons, such as boulders or ballista bolts, and ranged attacks by firearms or generated by natural attacks or spell effects can't be deflected.ª1
