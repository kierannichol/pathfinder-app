ÎAt 8th level, when using the Blackjack tactics ability, a Blackjack can include one or more creatures without levels in this archetype, but doing so reduces the duration of the effect to a number of minutes equal to the class level of the highest-level Blackjack instead of a number of hours per level. If only Blackjacks are included in the effect, all Blackjacks affected gain a +1 morale bonus on skill checks and saving throws for the duration of the effect.ª)
