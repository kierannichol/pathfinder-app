    "text": "At 4th level, a vexing dodger can move through the space of a creature two size categories larger than herself without needing to attempt an Acrobatics check. She would still need to succeed at Acrobatics checks to avoid attacks of opportunity provoked by leaving a threatened space; this ability covers only the ability to move. Additionally, whenever the vexing dodger hits a larger foe with a melee sneak attack, she can choose to forgo the sneak attack bonus damage and instead attempt make a dirty trick combat maneuver as a swift action."
