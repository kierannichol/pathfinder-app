ØAt 4th level, while bloodraging an enlightened bloodrager takes no penalties to his AC, and can still use Intelligence-, Dexterity-, and Charisma-based skills. This ability alters bloodrage and replaces the bloodline power gained at 1st level. This replaces the bloodline power gained at 4th level.
Bloodline Feat: At 6th level, an enlightened bloodrager adds Expanded Arcana, Nameless One, and all feats that list Nameless One as a prerequisite to the list of feats he can select as a bloodline feat. This replaces the damage reduction the bloodrager gains at 7th, 10th, 13th, 16th, and 19th levels.ªN
