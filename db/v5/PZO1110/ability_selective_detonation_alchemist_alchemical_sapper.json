    "text": "At 10th level, when an alchemical sapper plants a trip mine, he can designate a number of allies up to his Intelligence modifier, allowing the designated allies to pass safely through an armed trip mine\u0027s square without causing it to detonate. If another creature triggers the trip mine while an ally is nearby, the ally still takes damage as normal."
