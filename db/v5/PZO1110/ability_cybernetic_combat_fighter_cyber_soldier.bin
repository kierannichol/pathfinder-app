¼At 5th level, a cyber-soldier gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with implanted weapons, cybernetic arms, and melee or thrown weapons wielded with a cybernetic arm. Weapons wielded with two cybernetic arms receive double the bonus, except when such weapons are thrown. This damage bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels gained. This attack bonus does not stack with the attack bonus for weapon training. A cyber-soldier gains a slam attack for each cybernetic arm. These attacks deal 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for a Medium cyber-soldier and 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage for a Small cyber-soldier.
