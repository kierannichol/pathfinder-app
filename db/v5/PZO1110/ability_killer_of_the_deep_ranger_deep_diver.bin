ÉAt 20th level, a deep diver is peerless at detecting prey underwater and delivering killing blows. He can notice other creatures by scent in a 180-foot radius underwater and can detect blood in the water up to a mile away. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus while underwater. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + half the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A deep diver can instead deal an additional amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage.
A deep diver can use this ability once per day against each of his favored enemy types but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.ª3
