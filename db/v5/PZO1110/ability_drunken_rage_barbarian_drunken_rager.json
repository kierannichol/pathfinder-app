    "text": "At 1st level, a drunken rager can drink a unit of ale or other strong alcohol while raging to gain 1 drunken rage point. The act of drinking is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At 1st level, the barbarian can have a maximum of 1 drunken rage point; this maximum increases by 1 every 2 levels thereafter. These drunken rage points last for 1 hour or until spent, whichever comes first. The barbarian can use drunken rage points only while raging. Unless otherwise noted, spending a drunken rage point is a free action.\nA drunken rager can spend 1 drunken rage point to increase her movement speed by 20 feet for 1 round, provided she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and is not carrying a heavy load. She can also spend 1 drunken rage point to gain 1 additional round of her rage class feature, which lasts for 1 hour or until used."
