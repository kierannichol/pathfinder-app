    "text": "At 8th level, when using battle dance, the dervish of dawn can enter a trance-like state where his spinning motion represents the movement of the planets around the sun, and his spirit is attuned to the healing aspects of his goddess.\nBy spending a move action focusing on his whirling, the dervish can apply the Quicken Spell feat to any cure spell he is about to cast (effectively spending a move action and swift action to cast the spell). This does not alter the level of the spell or the casting time. The dervish can use this ability once per day at 8th level and one additional time per day for every two dervish levels he has beyond 8th."
