    "text": "This ability functions just like song of surrender but allows a buccaneer of 16th level or higher to affect all enemies within 30 feet. Enemies within range of this effect still receive a saving throw. Mass song of surrender is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability that relies on audible components."
