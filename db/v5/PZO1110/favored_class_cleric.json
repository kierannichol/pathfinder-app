    "text": "Role: More than capable of upholding the honor of their deities in battle, clerics often prove stalwart and capable combatants. Their true strength lies in their capability to draw upon the power of their deities, whether to increase their own and their allies\u0027 prowess in battle, to vex their foes with divine magic, or to lend healing to companions in need. As their powers are influenced by their faith, all clerics must focus their worship upon a divine source. While the vast majority of clerics revere a specific deity, a small number dedicate themselves to a divine concept worthy of devotion--such as battle, death, justice, or knowledge--free of a deific abstraction. (Work with your GM if you prefer this path to selecting a specific deity.) Alignment: A cleric\u0027s alignment must be within one step of her deity\u0027s, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis. Hit Die: d8 Starting Wealth: 4d6 Ã— 10 gp (average 140 gp.) In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less."
