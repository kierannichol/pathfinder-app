    "text": "As a standard action, a sorcerer of sleep can make a melee touch attack against a living creature to cause one of the following effects (sorcerer\u0027s choice): the target gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength, the target is fatigued, or the target takes a â€“2 penalty on saving throws against illusion and mind-affecting effects. The effects of keif touch last a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the sorcerer of sleep\u0027s sorcerer level. The effects of keif touch are not cumulative, and cannot make the target exhausted. A sorcerer of sleep can use keif touch a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier."
