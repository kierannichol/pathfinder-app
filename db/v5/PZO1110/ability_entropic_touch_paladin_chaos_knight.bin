¨At 2nd level, a chaos knight can employ the forces of entropy with a touch to shatter a mind-affecting spell or effect currently affecting an ally. As a standard action, he can touch a creature to grant that creature a new saving throw against one mind-affecting effect, with a bonus on the save equal to one-third the chaos knight's level (minimum +0). If the chaos knight targets himself, he can use this ability as a swift action. A chaos knight can use this ability a number of times per day equal to half his paladin level + his Charisma modifier.ª2
