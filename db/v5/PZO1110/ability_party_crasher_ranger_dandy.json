    "text": "At 7th level, the dandy is able to finagle his way into fancy parties, kings\u0027 balls, and other social events meant for the cream of society. To do so, he must attempt a DC 25 Diplomacy check, which takes 1d4 hours. If he succeeds, he finds himself an invitation, an invitee looking for a date, a staff member willing to look the other way, or some other way to enter the party.\nThis does not allow him to break into restricted areas or to infiltrate strictly closed gatherings, such as secret meetings; it only allows him access to social events."
