    "text": "At 6th level, a fist of the gods gains Alignment Channel as a bonus feat. When he uses this feat and spends fervor to channel energy, he can harm only outsiders with the chaotic subtype. Additionally, when using this feat, he expends only one use of his fervor to channel energy and deals 1d6 points of damage for every 2 warpriest levels he has. At 12th level, a fist of the gods can expend an additional use of fervor to channel energy as a move action."
