    "text": "While wearing or wielding his bonded item, an Elder Mythos scholar can spontaneously cast a special detect aberration spell by sacrificing a prepared 1st-level spell. Instead of detecting aberrations, this spell detects creatures associated with the Elder Mythos, such as the following (or similar creatures, at the GM\u0027s discretion):\nBhole, colour out of space, deep one, deep one elder, denizen of Leng, elder thing, flying polyp, gug, hound of Tindalos, Leng ghoul, Leng spider, mi-go, nightgaunt, ratling, shantak, shoggoth, spawn of Yog-Sothoth, star-spawn of Cthulhu, voonith, wendigo, and yithian.\nHe gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Knowledge checks to identify such creatures and Spellcraft checks to identify effects they create.\nAt 5th level, an Elder Mythos scholar adds invisibility purge and see invisibility to his spellbook and can spontaneously cast either spell by sacrificing a prepared spell of the same or higher level while wearing or wielding his bonded item.\nAt 10th level, he adds banish seeming and true seeing to his spellbook as 5th-level spells and can spontaneously cast them in the same fashion."
