    "text": "At 4th level, a witchguard forms a bond with a spellcaster he has sworn to defend. Once per day, this bond allows the witchguard to spend a move action to grant an adjacent spellcaster a +2 dodge bonus to AC and a +2 circumstance bonus on concentration checks.\nAt 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 2. The bonuses last for a number of rounds equal to the witchguard\u0027s Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).\nAt 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the witchguard can use this ability one additional time per day."
