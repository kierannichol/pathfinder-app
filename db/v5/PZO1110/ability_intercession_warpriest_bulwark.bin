¹At 12th level, by expending a use of fervor as a swift action, a bulwark can teleport to the location of a willing (or unconscious) ally and immediately teleport that ally to her own previous position, in effect switching places with the ally. A bulwark must have line of effect to the target to use this ability.ª-
