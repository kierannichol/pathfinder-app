    "text": "At 4th level, a ruthless agent has learned how to finesse her attacks to discomfort a foe. When she deals damage using her studied strike, she can make this damage nonlethal (regardless of whether her weapon normally deals lethal or nonlethal damage), forcing the target to succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC \u003d 10 + half the ruthless agent\u0027s level + her Intelligence modifier) or be sickened for 1 round and take a â€“2 penalty on Will saving throws for 1 minute. Multiple agonizing strikes do not worsen the condition or impose an additional penalty on Will saves, but they do increase the duration of both effects."
