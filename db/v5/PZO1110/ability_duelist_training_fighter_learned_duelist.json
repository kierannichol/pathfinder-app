    "text": "At 5th level, a Learned duelist must select the light blades group for the weapon training class feature. The Learned duelist\u0027s weapon training bonus with light blades increases by 1 on attack and damage rolls for every 4 levels he possesses beyond 5th (to a maximum of +4 on attack and damage rolls at 17th level). If he is using his duelist stance, this damage bonus increases by 2. The Learned duelist does not gain weapon training in any other groups as he increases in level."
