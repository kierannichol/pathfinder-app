      "Benefit": "When using the Ki Throw feat, you may throw your target into any square you threaten that is occupied by another creature. Make a bull rush combat maneuver check with a â€“4 penalty against the secondary target. If this check succeeds, the thrown creature lands prone in the secondary target\u0027s square, while the secondary target is pushed back and knocked prone in an adjacent square. If the check fails, the thrown creature lands prone in the nearest square you threaten adjacent to the secondary target.",
