¶At 19th level, when an opponent threatened by a polearm master makes a melee attack against an ally, he may take an immediate action to grant his ally a +2 shield bonus to AC and DR 5/-- against that attack. He may use this ability to protect himself, but only if the attacking creature is not adjacent to him.ª3
