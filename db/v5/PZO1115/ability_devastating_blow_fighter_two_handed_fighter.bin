­At 19th level, as a standard action, a two-handed fighter may make a single melee attack with a two-handed weapon at a â€“5 penalty. If the attack hits, it is treated as a critical threat. Special weapon abilities that activate only on a critical hit do not activate if this critical hit is confirmed.ª:
