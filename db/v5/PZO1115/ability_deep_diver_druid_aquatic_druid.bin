Deep Diverclass:druid#aquatic_druidarchetype_featureclass_feature¢Ñ
ÎAt 13th level, an aquatic druid gains DR/slashing or piercing equal to 1/2 her level. This damage reduction also applies against spells and spell-like abilities that inflict damage by grappling or crushing (e.g., black tentacles, crushing hand). She never takes pressure damage from deep water.
This ability replaces a thousand faces.ª-
