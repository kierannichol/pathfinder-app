    "text": "This primitive firearm is merely a long tube that, when ignited, propels forth a short gout of flame and a javelin. Unlike other firearms, the fire lance is wildly imprecise, and targets AC rather than touch AC. A fire lance is always treated as having the broken condition for the purpose of determining the effects of a misfire. A fire lance uses a javelin and 2 doses of black powder as ammunition. This is an early firearm."
