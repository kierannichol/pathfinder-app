    "text": "A gun tank is adept at modifying and using her armor to stop firearm attacks. Starting at 2nd level, a gun tank wearing medium or heavy armor gains half the armor\u0027s bonus plus the armor\u0027s enhancement bonus (if any) as a deflection bonus against any non-siege firearm or splash weapon attack (including the alchemist\u0027s bomb class ability; Advanced Player\u0027s Guide 28). This ability has no affect on spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities that make a touch attack.\nThis ability replaces nimble."
