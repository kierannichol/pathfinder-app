ability:armor_trainingArmor TrainingÔStarting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum ‚Äì4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.Advanced Armor Training: Beginning at 7th level, instead of increasing the benefits provided by armor training (reducing his armor‚Äôs check penalty by 1 and increasing its maximum Dexterity bonus by 1), a fighter can choose an advanced armor training option (see Advanced Armor Training below) . If the fighter does so, he still gains the ability to move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor at 3rd level, and while wearing heavy armor at 7th level.
