ability:cantripsCantrips‘Wizards can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table: Wizard under ‚ÄúSpells per Day.‚Äù These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. A wizard can prepare a cantrip from an opposition school, but it uses up two of his available slots (see below).*(*
