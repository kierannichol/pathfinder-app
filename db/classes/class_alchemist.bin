Nor is it mollified by the alchemist‚Äôs almost gleeful passion for building explosive bombs and discovering strange new poisons and methods for their use. These traits, while making him a liability and risk for most civilized organizations and institutions of higher learning, seem to fit quite well with most adventuring groups.*±% 2

ability:bombBomb–In addition to magical extracts, alchemists are adept at swiftly mixing various volatile chemicals and infusing them with their magical reserves to create powerful bombs that they can hurl at their enemies. An alchemist can use a number of bombs each day equal to his class level + his Intelligence modifier. Bombs are unstable, and if not used in the round they are created, they degrade and become inert‚Äîtheir method of creation prevents large volumes of explosive material from being created and stored. In order to create a bomb, the alchemist must use a small vial containing an ounce of liquid catalyst‚Äîthe alchemist can create this liquid catalyst from small amounts of chemicals from an alchemy lab, and these supplies can be readily refilled in the same manner as a spellcaster‚Äôs component pouch. Most alchemists create a number of catalyst vials at the start of the day equal to the total number of bombs they can create in that day‚Äîonce created, a catalyst vial remains usable by the alchemist for years.Drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb requires a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Thrown bombs have a range of 20 feet and use the Throw Splash Weapon special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as Point-Blank Shot and Weapon Focus. On a direct hit, an alchemist‚Äôs bomb inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage + additional damage equal to the alchemist‚Äôs Intelligence modifier. The damage of an alchemist‚Äôs bomb increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered alchemist level (this bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike). Splash damage from an alchemist bomb is always equal to the bomb‚Äôs minimum damage (so if the bomb would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage on a direct hit, its splash damage would be 6 points of fire damage). Those caught in the splash damage can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist‚Äôs level + the alchemist‚Äôs Intelligence modifier.Alchemists can learn new types of bombs as discoveries (see the Discovery ability) as they level up. An alchemist‚Äôs bomb, like an extract, becomes inert if used or carried by anyone else.2÷
ability:brew_potionBrew Potion±At 1st level, alchemists receive Brew Potion as a bonus feat. An alchemist can brew potions of any formulae he knows (up to 3rd level), using his alchemist level as his caster level. The spell must be one that can be made into a potion. The alchemist does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat.2ù
ability:mutagenMutagenÄAt 1st level, an alchemist discovers how to create a mutagen that he can imbibe in order to heighten his physical prowess at the cost of his personality. It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. An alchemist can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time‚Äîif he brews a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. As with an extract or bomb, a mutagen that is not in an alchemist‚Äôs possession becomes inert until an alchemist picks it up again.When an alchemist brews a mutagen, he selects one physical ability score‚Äîeither Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It‚Äôs a standard action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes the alchemist to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting him a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for 10 minutes per alchemist level. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist takes a ‚Äì2 penalty to one of his mental ability scores. If the mutagen enhances his Strength, it applies a penalty to his Intelligence. If it enhances his Dexterity, it applies a penalty to his Wisdom. If it enhances his Constitution, it applies a penalty to his Charisma.A non-alchemist who drinks a mutagen must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the alchemist‚Äôs level + the alchemist‚Äôs Intelligence modifier) or become nauseated for 1 hour‚Äîa non-alchemist can never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but an alchemist can gain the effects of another alchemist‚Äôs mutagen if he drinks it. (Although if the other alchemist creates a different mutagen, the effects of the ‚Äústolen‚Äù mutagen immediately cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not stack. Whenever an alchemist drinks a mutagen, the effects of any previous mutagen immediately end.2©
ability:throw_anythingThrow Anything˛All alchemists gain the Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat at 1st level.

Discoveries that modify bombs that are marked with an asterisk (*) do not stack. Only one such discovery can be applied to an individual bomb. The DC of any saving throw called for by a discovery is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist‚Äôs level + the alchemist‚Äôs Intelligence modifier.2é
