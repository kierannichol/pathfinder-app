Whenever the wearer spends ki points to make an additional attack, that attack roll gains a +1 insight bonus (+2 if the wearer is using a ki focus weapon with that attack). Furthermore, the wearer of a headband of ki focus is immune to the ninja\u0027s ki block trick or similar effects that block the wearer from using ki points."
