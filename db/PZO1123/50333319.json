    "text": "These bracers are constructed from woven strands of bamboo. Three times per day, as a swift action, the wearer can stretch her arms beyond their limits, increasing her reach by 5 feet until the start of her next turn. Her weapon attack rolls take a â€“4 penalty, while unarmed strikes and natural weapons using the arms take no penalty."
