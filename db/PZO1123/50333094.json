    "text": "This deceptively complex weapon appears to be nothing more than a 12-foot rope attached to a 6-inchlong, conical metal spike. Similar to a meteor hammer, it can be whirled at great speeds, then aimed to strike and pierce opponents with great reach. Once it strikes, the wielder can quickly retrieve the weapon with a tug of the rope as a free action."
