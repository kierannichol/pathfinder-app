    "text": "When worn, this mask transforms the wearer\u0027s face into a stone statue and its voice into an emotionless monotone. Though it allows the wearer to speak, its facial expressions and voice betray little emotion, granting a +10 competence bonus on Bluff checks made to lie and a +5 competence bonus on Bluff checks made to feint, but also imposing a â€“5 penalty on Bluff checks made to pass a hidden message."
