    "text": "Most bags of devouring appear to be normal sacks, but Chomper is unlike most bags of devouring. Sporting rows of vicious teeth, a bad attitude, and a thirst to devour all things, this intelligent cursed item believes that it is the favored maw and most important appendage of a creature it mysteriously refers to as the Eater of All. Chomper hates all creatures except for demons, whom it considers kindred spirits of destruction.\nChomper has all of the magical abilities of a regular bag of devouring, along with the following additional powers."
