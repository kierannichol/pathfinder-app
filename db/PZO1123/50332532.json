It is a suit of +5 heavy fortification full plate that allows its wearer to make claw attacks that deal 2d10 points of damage, and strike as +3 weapons that are treated as chaotic and evil for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. Additionally, those struck by the claws must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be affected as per the spell contagion. The armor\u0027s claws are built into the armor so these weapons cannot be disarmed. While wearing the armor, the wearer benefits from the following demonic traits.",
