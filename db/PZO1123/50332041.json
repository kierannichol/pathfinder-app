    "text": "This nonmagical heavy steel shield is made out of living steel. It has no enhancement bonus, but its material and construction can damage metal weapons that strike it. Whenever the wielder of a metal weapon (other than one made of adamantine) rolls a natural 1 on an attack against a creature wielding this shield, the item must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or gain the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it is instead destroyed."
