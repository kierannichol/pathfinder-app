    "text": "This ring of jagged steel gives the impression that it was salvaged from a suit of armor and then crudely bent into a circle. The wearer of the ring can, at will, designate any one opponent she can see as a particularly dangerous foe. She gains a +2 bonus to her AC and saving throws against attacks made by that opponent until she designates a new enemy."
