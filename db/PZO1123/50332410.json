    "text": "A formula book has 100 pages of parchment, and each alchemical extract formula takes up one page per extract level. A newly purchased formula book contains no extract formulas. An alchemist character begins play with a formula book containing the extract formulae he knows (Advanced Player\u0027s Guide 32). This is the alchemist equivalent of a spellbook for wizards (a spellbook and a formula book are essentially the same item)."
