    "text": "This macabre lantern is composed of a humanoid skull dangling from a short length of chain. A small fragment of soulstuff is trapped inside, burning slowly in a heatless flame. Its flickering light shines from the skull\u0027s eye sockets, casting light as a bullseye lantern. On command, the lantern can consume its soulstuff in a sudden blast of heat, as burning hands. Doing so extinguishes the lantern. Whenever a living creature with at least 1 HD is slain within 30 feet of an empty grim lantern, the lantern absorbs a fragment of that creature\u0027s soul, restoring its glow."
