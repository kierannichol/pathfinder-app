    "text": "These supple, velvet gloves are the sort that might be thrown down in challenge for a duel or other single combat. By removing a glove and using it to make a melee or ranged touch attack against an opponent, the wearer of the other glove gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against the target, and the target gains a â€“1 penalty on attack rolls against the wearer. Both of these effects last for 1 minute, but immediately end if anyone but the glove\u0027s wearer attacks the challenged opponent. Both gloves must be worn by the same creature."
