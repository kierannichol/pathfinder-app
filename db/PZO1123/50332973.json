    "text": "Crafted to evoke the barbed talons of the Mantis God himself, a sawtooth sabre may be used as a Martial Weapon (in which case it functions identically to a longsword). If you have the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (sawtooth sabre) feat, for the purpose of two-weapon fighting you can treat it as a light melee weapon; for all other purposes, it is a one-handed melee weapon."
