Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is worn. It also grants skill ranks as a headband of vast intelligence, but always grants ranks in a Knowledge skill.\nAs a swift action three times per day, the wearer can call upon the headband to reveal the abilities and weaknesses of a creature within line of sight.

At the start of her next turn, the wearer receives additional information as though she had made the check with a natural roll of 10.
