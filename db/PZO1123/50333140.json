    "text": "This gurgling, luminescent elixir comes in several different varieties, each keyed to a particular type of metallic or chromatic dragon. A creature that drinks the elixir can, as a standard action, breathe out a single blast of energy similar to a dragon\u0027s breath weapon, dealing 7d6 points of energy damage. Creatures in the area may attempt a DC 16 Reflex save for half damage. The magic of the elixir ends after one use of the breath weapon or after 1 hour has passed, whichever comes first. The type of energy produced and the shape of the blast are determined by the elixir\u0027s associated dragon type:\nBlack or copper dragon: 30-foot line of acid.\nBlue or bronze dragon: 30-foot line of electricity.\nBrass dragon: 30-foot line of fire.\nGreen dragon: 15-foot cone of acid.\nGold or red dragon: 15-foot cone of fire.\nSilver or white dragon: 15-foot cone of cold."
