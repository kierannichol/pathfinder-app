úThe longer the wielder of a stalking weapon studies a target, the more effective her strike. As a standard action, a character wielding a stalking weapon can command it to study a creature within 60 feet. The wielder must have line of effect and line of sight to that target. When the wielder attacks the studied creature, on a successful hit the stalking weapon deals +1d6 points of bonus damage per consecutive round spent studying a target, up to a number of bonus dice equal to the stalking weaponâ€™s enhancement bonus. This bonus damage is precision damage and only applies to the first successful hit against that creature. If the wielder attacks a creature other than the studied creature, commands the weapon to study a different creature, or ends her turn more than 60 feet from the studied creature, the weapon loses all bonus damage dice against the previously studied creature.
