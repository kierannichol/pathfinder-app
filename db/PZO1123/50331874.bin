£This saucerlike object has a flat bottom, a handle, and a spike on top. You can affix a candle onto the spike (up to 3 inches in diameter) and hold the candlestick by the handle. The flat bottom means you're able to set it down and not worry about the candle falling over and extinguishing itself. A typical candlestick is crafted from baked clay or a cheap metal such as copper, but elaborate and expensive ones exist.
