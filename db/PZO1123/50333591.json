    "text": "This gritty and irregular +1 sling bullet explodes into a cloud of choking dust when it successfully strikes its target. This cloud fills a 5-foot cube and follows the target for 1d6 rounds before dispersing. Any creature ending its turn in the cloud must make a successful DC 13 Fortitude save or be sickened and blinded for 1 round."
