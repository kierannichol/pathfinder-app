    "text": "This dwarven version of the more famous rod of lordly might has no spell-like powers; however, when wielded by a dwarf, it increases all AC, attack roll, CMD, CMB, and saving throw bonuses from a dwarf\u0027s racial traits by +1. The rod shares the mundane powers of a rod of lordly might, but its magical weapon forms are tailored to dwarven preferences."
