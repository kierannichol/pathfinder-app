    "text": "Invisible ink is a staple of spies, rebels, and secret societies everywhere. Messages written with invisible ink only become visible under specific circumstances. Revealing the secret message with the proper triggering agent is a full-round action per page of text. A successful Craft (alchemy) check reveals the message without the proper trigger and takes 1 hour (the DC varies by ink quality).\nSimple: This ink is keyed to a single, fairly common trigger, such as heat or vinegar (DC 20 to reveal without the trigger).\nAverage: This ink is keyed to either two common triggers or one uncommon trigger, such as blood or acid (DC 25 to reveal without the trigger).\nGood: This ink is keyed to either two uncommon triggers or one rare trigger, such as a specific vintage of wine or a specific kind of monster\u0027s blood (DC 30 to reveal without the trigger).\nSuperior: This ink is keyed to either two rare triggers or one unique trigger, such as the blood of a specific person (DC 35 to reveal without the trigger)."
