    "text": "This leather belt is worn over one shoulder and runs diagonally across the chest and back. It has small loops or pouches for holding eight objects the size of a flask or small dagger. You can use the \"retrieve a stored item\" action to take an item from a bandolier. You can wear up to two bandoliers at the same time (any more than this and they get in each other\u0027s way and restrict your movement)."
