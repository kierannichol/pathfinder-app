    "text": "When poured on ground in a circle, this pure white salt sanctifies the enclosed area as the spell consecrate. Applying the salt takes 1 round per dose. A single dose is sufficient to form a 5-foot radius circle, with each additional dose increasing the circle\u0027s radius by 5 feet. The area within the circle remains consecrated for 1 hour per dose, though any corporeal creature can spend a standard action to break the circle and end the effect prematurely. A newly created pouch of grave salt holds 5 doses.\nGrave salt can also be used directly against restless spirits. A single dose can be hurled up to 15 feet as a ranged touch attack. An incorporeal undead creature struck by the salt must make a DC 14 Will save or take 1d4 points of Charisma damage. Strong winds and other effects that penalize ranged attacks make it impossible to employ the salt in this manner."
