    "text": "This item functions as the lesser belt of mighty hurling, except it grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and any thrown weapons its wearer hurls are treated as though they had the returning quality. This does not apply to improvised ranged weapons, splash weapons, or weapons the wearer lacks proficiency with. Treat the bonus to Strength as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn."
