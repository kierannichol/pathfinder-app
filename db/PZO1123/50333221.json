    "text": "This platinum key can open nearly any lock or door with a mere touch. With a touch of the key, a lock of DC 40 or lower unlocks. When a creature holding the key attempts to break down a door with a break (locked) DC of 28 or lower, the door is broken and opened. In all other cases it grants the creature possessing Perfection\u0027s Key a +10 bonus on Disable Device checks to pick locks, and a +10 bonus on attempts to break down doors.",
