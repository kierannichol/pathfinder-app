    "text": "Every step taken in harmonizing armor produces a symphony of sounds. The armor harmonizes with music played, lyrics sung, and words spoken by its wearer, creating a pleasant counter-melody. Its wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Perform checks, but takes a â€“5 penalty on Stealth checks. The wearer can be silent only if he takes no physical actions. The armor also amplifies harmful sounds, and the wearer gains vulnerability to sonic energy damage (sonic energy attacks deal an additional 50% damage to the wearer). If the wearer has the bardic performance class feature, the harmonizing armor causes bonuses and penalties from performances that have an audible component to continue for 1 round after the wearer ceases performing. Beginning a new bardic performance ends the effects of the previous performance immediately. This ability does not stack with the Lingering Performance feat. The harmonizing ability can be applied to any armor, but not shields."
