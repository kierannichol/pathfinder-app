    "text": "This ring operates exactly like a ring of feather falling. However, it also makes the wearer clumsy. She takes a â€“4 penalty to Dexterity and has a 20% chance of spell failure when trying to cast any arcane spell that has a somatic component. (This chance of spell failure stacks with other arcane spell failure chances.)"
