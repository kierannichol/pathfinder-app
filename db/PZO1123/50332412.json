    "text": "This +2 heavy steel shield has a distinct curve to its shape and often bears the device of a valiant knight. The wearer of this shield gains a +2 bonus on Reflex saves against effects that originate or burst from a point outside his own square, as though he had cover. It does not protect against spread effects. This bonus does not stack with that granted by actual cover or give cover to any creature other than the wearer. In addition, the dragonslayer\u0027s shield grants its wielder a +2 morale bonus on Will saves against the frightful presence ability."
