    "text": "This special ability can only be placed on bows. Once per round, when a shot made with this weapon misses its target, as a free action the weaponâ€™s wielder can cause that shot to swerve and try to hit the target again. The arrow fired gets a second attack at the same attack bonus as the first attack it made."
