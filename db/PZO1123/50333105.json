    "text": "When played, this sturdy snare drum increases the run speed of allied creatures within 120 feet as if they had the Run feat. Activating the drum is a standard action that requires a DC 20 Perform (percussion) check; maintaining the playing is a free action if the player is running. If the bearer stops playing the drum, the enhanced running speed ends. The drum may be used for up to 1 hour per day. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be used in 10-minute increments."
