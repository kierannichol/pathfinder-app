    "text": "A summoner wearing a ring of ectoplasmic invigoration can use his maker\u0027s call class feature to absorb his eidolon (dismissing it in the process) instead of bringing it to his side. He gains 2 temporary hit points per Hit Die of the eidolon and the benefits of a lesser restoration spell. T he eidolon must still be within range of his maker\u0027s call ability. Any temporary hit points gained fade after 1 hour or when the eidolon is summoned again. A wearer with the transposition ability can transport himself to the eidolon\u0027s square (still absorbing and dismissing it) rather than calling the eidolon to him."
