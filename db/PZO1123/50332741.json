    "text": "The imperial intelligence agency, the Hatharat, entrusts rings of return to agents within Taldor and other hostile regions. When a transport command word is spoken (a standard action), a ring of return whisks the wearer to the nearest imperial administration building within Kelesh\u0027s borders, as if via greater teleport. If anyone attempts to remove a ring of return from the wearer\u0027s finger without speaking a removal command word (a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity), the attempt triggers the effect, transporting both the wearer and the person attempting to remove the ring. A successful DC 20 Will save allows a character to resist the teleportation, but in any event, a ring of return can be used only once; after its single charge is expended, it becomes an ordinary, nonmagical ring."
