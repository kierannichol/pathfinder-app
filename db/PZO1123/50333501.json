    "text": "This necklace is set with a bloodstone sculpted to look like a scintillating green eye. It gives the wearer a +4 competence bonus on Charisma checks and Charisma-based checks made to interact with gnomes, a +2 competence bonus on similar checks when dealing with beings of the fey creature type, and a â€“2 penalty on similar checks when interacting with anyone else. The wearer can read, speak, and understand the Gnome language. If the wearer is not a gnome, she gains low-light vision, and may cast dancing lights, ghost sound, prestidigitation, and speak with animals each once per day as a spell-like ability."
