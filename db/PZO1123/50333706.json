    "text": "This ability doubles the threat range of a weapon. Only piercing or slashing melee weapons can be keen. If you roll this special ability randomly for an inappropriate weapon, reroll. This benefit doesnâ€™t stack with any other effects that expand the threat range of a weapon (such as the keen edge spell or the Improved Critical feat)."
