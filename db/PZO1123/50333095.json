    "text": "Two times per day, the wearer of these shoes can call forth 1d4 spirit servants to aid her. The spirit servants are invisible, mindless, shapeless beings that act as servants summoned by the unseen servant spell. The spirits return to the shoes after 3 hours have passed. The wearer can choose to dismiss one or more of the spirit servants early.\nOnce per day, the wearer can command the ghostly spirits inside her haunted shoes to emerge and swirl around her, making her difficult to target in combat. The wearer gains concealment (20% miss chance) for 3 minutes. The spirits cannot be harmed, but a true seeing spell ignores the concealment effect. The concealment effect cannot be activated while any of the spirits are currently being used as unseen servants."
