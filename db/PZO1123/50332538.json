    "text": "This golden amulet is used by religious sects as a way to help the faithful capture fugitives or defend themselves without doing undue harm to potential converts. While the wearer is using her divine powers of retribution (such as a cleric\u0027s smite, an inquisitor\u0027s smiting judgment, or a paladin\u0027s smite), the amulet grants her the ability to make unarmed strikes in melee combat as if she had the Improved Unarmed Strike feat."
