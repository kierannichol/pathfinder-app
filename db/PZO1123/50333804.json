    "text": "This suit of armor best serves a wearer who focuses on assisting and protecting his allies. Benevolent armor is usually decorated with motifs of prosperity, plenty, and generosity, such as helping hands, cornucopias, and flourishing plants. When the wearer of a suit of benevolent armor uses the aid another action to give an ally a bonus to AC against an opponent’s next attack, he also adds the benevolent armor’s enhancement bonus to the ally’s AC."
