    "text": "Made to resemble a courtier\u0027s fan, this device consists of silk paper stretched and folded over a folding frame of hardened steel. Folding fans are typically wielded in pairs using a technique that distracts the opponent. The fans sport sharp tips, which can be poisoned. For a list of appropriate poisons, see Poisons on page 110."
