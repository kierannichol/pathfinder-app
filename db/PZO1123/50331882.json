    "text": "This collection of coarsely ground spices, seeds, musk, and alchemical reagents are meant to be rubbed into your skin and clothes in order to override your scent, increasing the DC of tracking you by scent by +10 for 24 hours. Because you still have a smell, creatures with scent can still detect and pinpoint you if you are cloaked; they just can\u0027t identify your smell as something unique. Washing for 1 full round removes the scent cloak."
