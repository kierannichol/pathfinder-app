Reversible as a move action, the dappled camouflage of its other side grants a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks. Regardless of the cape\u0027s current facing, the wearer can spend an immediate action at will to roll an Escape Artist check against being grappled, bound, or restrained as if the cape targeted her with liberating command (Ultimate Combat)"
