    "text": "This valuable garment appears to be a normal robe until it is put on. Its wearer is able to see in all directions at the same moment due to scores of visible, magical eye-like patterns that adorn the robe. She also gains 120-foot darkvision.\nThe robe of eyes sees all forms of invisible or ethereal creatures or objects within 120 feet. The wearer of a robe of eyes gains a +10 competence bonus on Perception checks. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC even when flat-footed, and can\u0027t be flanked. She is not able to avert or close her eyes when confronted by a creature with a gaze attack.\nA light or continual flame spell cast directly on a robe of eyes causes the wearer to be blinded for 1d3 minutes. A daylight spell blinds the wearer for 2d4 minutes."
