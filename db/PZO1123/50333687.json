    "text": "Typically crafted from hollowed-out animal horn, but increasingly crafted from metal in a wide variety of shapes, a powder horn can hold up to 10 doses of black powder. A powder horn protects black powder stored within in it from exposure to fire, electricity, firearm misfires, and water, and the narrow end of the horn is useful in funneling the expensive powder carefully into the barrel of a firearm."
