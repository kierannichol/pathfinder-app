    "text": "This glass teardrop hangs on a platinum chain and can be used once per day to grant a surge of power. This surge can be used in one of two ways. As a swift action, the wearer of the amulet can make one melee or ranged attack at his highest attack bonus. Alternatively, if the wearer of the amulet has a ki pool, he can instead focus on the power of the amulet as a full-round action and regain two ki points."
