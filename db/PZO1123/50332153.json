    "text": "These massive boots are made from mastodon hide. The boots are so large and cumbersome that their wearer takes a â€“2 penalty on Stealth checks, but gains a +2 enhancement bonus on overrun attempts and a +2 dodge bonus to AC while attempting an overrun combat maneuver. In addition, once per day the wearer can make a trample attack (Bestiary 305). Regardless of his actual size, the creature wearing the boots can trample creatures of size Large or smaller in his path. The trample attack deals 2d8+18 points of damage (Reflex DC 29 halves)."
