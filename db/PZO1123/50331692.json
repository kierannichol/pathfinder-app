    "text": "Embroidered images of cherry blossoms and cranes in flight adorn this blue silk kimono. The wearer can move and reposition these images on the kimono at will. The kimono grants its wearer a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws and a +4 bonus on all caster level checks.\nOnce per day, the wearer can capture a single creature within 60 feet within the kimono (no save), shunting the victim into an extradimensional space similar to that created by a maze spell. Inside this otherworldly prison, the maze appears as an endless cherry orchard filled with \"walls\" of windblown cherry blossoms and cranes flying overhead. Each round on its turn, the victim inside the kimono may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the kimono as a full-round action. If the victim doesn\u0027t escape, it is released after 10 minutes, returning to where it had been before the kimono drew it in. If this location is occupied by another creature or a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space.\nWhenever a creature is drawn inside the kimono, the victim\u0027s image temporarily manifests as another embroidered design among the kimono\u0027s other images. While a victim is trapped inside, the kimono\u0027s bonuses on saving throws and caster level checks are increased by 2 (to +6). The kimono\u0027s increased bonuses return to normal when the victim is freed or released."
