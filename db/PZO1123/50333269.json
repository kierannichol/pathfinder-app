    "text": "This barbed +1 outsider (water) bane bolt is etched with runes of thirst and desiccation. Any living creature struck by a dust bolt begins dying of thirst, as the spell cup of dust (DC 14 Fortitude negates). Creatures with the aquatic or water subtype save with a â€“4 penalty, and on a failed save they are also sickened and staggered for 1 round."
