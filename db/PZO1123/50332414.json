    "text": "If this small scarab brooch is held for more than 1 round or carried in a living creature\u0027s possessions for 1 minute, it changes into a horrible, burrowing, beetlelike creature. The thing tears through any leather or cloth, burrows into flesh, and reaches the victim\u0027s heart in 1 round, causing death. A DC 25 Reflex save allows the wearer to tear the scarab away before it burrows out of sight, but she still takes 3d6 points of damage. The beetle then returns to its scarab form. Placing the scarab in a container of wood, ceramic, bone, ivory, or metal prevents it from coming to life and allows for long-term storage of the item."
