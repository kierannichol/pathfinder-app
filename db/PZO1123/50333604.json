    "text": "The surface of this silver medallion is covered in angular geometric shapes that refract light randomly. The medallion grants a continuous +2 resistance bonus on saves versus mind-affecting spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. If the wearer fails a save to avoid becoming dominated or confused, the amulet immediately grants the wearer a second saving throw to resist the effect. If this second save is successful, the medallion\u0027s power fades away entirely and it becomes a simple piece of silver jewelry."
