    "text": "This intimidating weapon appears to be a longsword with multiple hooks, barbs, and serrations along the blade, excellent for catching and sundering a foe\u0027s weapon. Wielders without the Improved Sunder feat use a shatterspike as a +1 longsword only. Wielders with the Improved Sunder feat instead use shatterspike as a + 4 longsword when attempting to sunder an opponent\u0027s weapon. Shatterspike can damage weapons with an enhancement bonus of +4 or lower."
