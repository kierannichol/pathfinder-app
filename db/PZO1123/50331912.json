    "text": "Large eagle feathers decorate the back and arms of this magnificent cape. Should the cape\u0027s wearer fall more than 5 feet, the cape spreads out behind the wearer and she gently drifts to the ground. This acts exactly like a feather fall spell for the wearer only. Once per day, if the wearer grasps the edges of the cape and spreads her arms, she transforms into an eagle (as per the beast shape I spell, except that it allows only eagle form and the wearer gains the eagle\u0027s full fly speed of 80 feet). This effect lasts for 10 minutes but can be ended prematurely as a standard action. In addition, while in eagle form, the wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks."
