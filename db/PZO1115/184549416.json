    "text": "The mouth of this heavy, dark iron cauldron is shaped like a monstrous maw and is large enough to accommodate a single Medium creature. When the cauldron is filled with pure water and certain rare and sacred herbs, and a deceased creature is placed inside it, the cauldron can restore the creature to life as if with a raise dead or resurrection spell. The spell effect depends on the components used: raise dead costs 5,000 gp worth of materials, while resurrection costs 10,000 gp worth of materials. The cauldron is usable once per day."
