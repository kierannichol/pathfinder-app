    "text": "Handheld magnets are relatively weak and are mainly used to detect or pull iron, mithral, or adamantine at a short range. They are not powerful enough to tug metal over significant distances or aid in disarming creatures wielding metal weapons. This hand-sized horseshoe magnet can lift up to a 3-pound iron weight."
