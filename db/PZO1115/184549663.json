    "text": "This fine silver circlet typically has a carved moonstone inset on the front or a crescent moon design. The wearer of a moon circlet gains darkvision out to 60 feet (if she does not already possess it). Its other effects only benefit a wearer capable of casting arcane spells.\nDuring the waxing moon, the wearer\u0027s caster level is considered one higher for purposes of caster level checks and spell effects; during the three nights of the full moon, this benefit increases to two levels higher than normal. However, this additional power comes with a price. During the waning moon, the wearer\u0027s caster level is considered one lower for purposes of caster level checks and spell effects, and during the three nights of the new moon, this penalty increases to two levels lower.\nRemoving a moon circlet imposes 2 negative levels on the wearer until the next full moon (or until the circlet is worn again, whichever comes first). These negative levels cannot be restored by any means short of a limited wish, wish, or miracle."
