    "text": "This heavy weapon fires a pair of iron-tipped bolts with a single squeeze of the trigger. Because of its size and weight, you take a –4 penalty on your attack roll if you\u0027re proficient with it, or –8 if you\u0027re not. If the attack hits, the target takes damage from both bolts. Critical hits, sneak attack damage, and other precision-based damage apply to only the first bolt. Reloading one bolt is a standard action; the Rapid Reload feat reduces this to a move action. Crossbow Mastery (Advanced Player\u0027s Guide) allows you to reload both bolts as a move action. A double crossbow fires crossbow bolts."
