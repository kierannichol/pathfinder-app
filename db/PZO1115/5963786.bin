ÐSaws can take many different shapes, from small carpentry saws to the long, two-handled saws used by lumberjacks. You can insert a saw between a door and its frame to cut through wooden bolts or bars, dealing 5 hit points per round plus your Strength modifier to the sawed object as a full-round action. Hearing the sawing requires a successful DC 10 Perception check. Saws used to cut ice on rivers have a point on the end to break through the ice before cutting.
