    "text": "The wearer of this slender white leather glove may, as a standard action, press it against any surface or object and cause a luminous handprint to appear. This print glows any color the wearer wishes, sheds light as a candle, and is easily visible from a distance of up to 60 feet. Such handprints last for 1 day before fading away. The glowing handprint matches the wearer\u0027s hand in terms of size, position of fingers, and so on."
