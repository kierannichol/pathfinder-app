    "text": "A traveling spellbook is less cumbersome than a normal one, but holds fewer spells. It has 50 pages. Some wizards prefer to travel with a smaller spellbook, omitting specialized spells that are rarely used on adventures. Others hide a traveling spellbook containing their most important spells, just in case."
