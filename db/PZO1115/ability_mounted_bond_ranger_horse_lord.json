    "text": "At 4th level, the horse lord forms a bond with an animal he can use as a mount, which becomes his animal companion. A Medium Ranger can select a camel or a horse. A small Ranger can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or dog if he is at least 7th level.\nThis ability functions like the druid animal companion ability except that the Ranger\u0027s effective druid level is equal to his Ranger level â€“ 3. The Ranger gains a +2 bonus on Handle Animal and Ride checks with his animal companion mount.\nThis ability replaces hunter\u0027s bond."
