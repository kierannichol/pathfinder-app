    "text": "You create a low-cresting wave of water that carries the target along the surface of water or the ground. When moving across level ground, the target\u0027s speed increases by 10 feet. If going downhill, speed increases by 20 feet instead, but slipstreamprovides no movement bonus when going uphill. While swimming, the slipstreamincreases the target\u0027s swim speed by 20 feet--if the target does not have a swim speed, this spell grants a swim speed of 20 ft."
