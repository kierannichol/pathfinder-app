    "text": "This deck of illustrated cards is used by those in tune with the spirit world to predict the futureâ€”and by charlatans to take money from the gullible. A common deck only has simple drawings on simple wooden plaques. A quality fortune-teller\u0027s deck usually consists of wooden plaques with painted color images; it is suitable as a focus for the augury spell, and provides a +1 circumstance bonus on Profession (fortune-teller), Profession (medium), and similar Profession checks. A masterwork fortuneteller\u0027s deck may be wood, ivory, or even metal, with painted or carved images, and is often highlighted with gold inlays or tiny gems; it has all the benefits of a quality deck, except it provides a +2 circumstance bonus on the listed skill checks."
