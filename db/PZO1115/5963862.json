    "text": "These weapons fit snugly around the knuckles and allow you to deal lethal damage with an unarmed strike. You may hold, but not wield, a weapon or other object in a hand wearing brass knuckles. You may cast a spell with a somatic component while wearing brass knuckles if you make a successful concentration check (DC 10 + the level of the spell you\u0027re casting). Monks are proficient with brass knuckles. Brass knuckles can\u0027t be disarmed."
