The effect of invigorateis merely an illusion, however, not a substitute for actual rest or respite. When the spell ends, the subject takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage, along with the return of the original condition(s). A creature can be under the effects of only one invigoratespell at a time; if it is cast a second time on that creature, the first effect immediately ends."
