    "text": "You grant the touched creature limited protection from magical effects that inflict damage based on the target creature\u0027s alignment, such as holy smite, order\u0027s wrath, a paladin\u0027s smite evil attack, or an unholyweapon. Choose one alignment type: chaos, evil, good, or law. The subject takes 5 less points of damage from effects that specifically harm creatures of that alignment. The value of the protection increases to 10 points at 7th level and 15 points at 11th level. The spell protects the recipient\u0027s equipment as well."
