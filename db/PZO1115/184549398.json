    "text": "Each elemental metamagic rod is built with the power to control and transform a specific energy type (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). The wielder can cast up to three spells per day that deal damage of the rod\u0027s energy type instead of the spell\u0027s normal damage type, as though using the Elemental Spell feat (Advanced Player\u0027s Guide). For example, an elemental metamagic rod (cold) always makes spells deal cold damage."
