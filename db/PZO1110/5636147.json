    "text": "This item appears to be a string or cluster of spherical beads, sometimes with the ends tied together to form a necklace. (It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character\u0027s worn magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really isâ€”a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a fireball spell (Reflex DC 14 half).\nSpheres come in different strengths, ranging from those that deal 2d6 points of fire damage to those that deal 10d6. The price of a sphere is 150 gp for each die of damage it deals.\n"
