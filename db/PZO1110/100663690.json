    "text": "These boots appear to be ordinary footgear. On command, they sprout wings at the heel and let the wearer fly, without having to maintain concentration, as if affected by a fly spell (including a +4 bonus on Fly skill checks). The wearer can fly three times per day for up to 5 minutes per flight."
