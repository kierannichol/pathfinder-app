    "text": "The wearer of these boots is able to travel across snow at her normal speed, leaving no tracks. Additionally, the boots enable her to travel at normal speed across the slipperiest ice (horizontal surfaces only, not vertical or sharply slanted ones) without falling or slipping. Finally, boots of the winterlands warm the wearer, as if she were affected by an endure elements spell."
