    "text": "The lenses of this item are made of special crystal, its band woven with tiny patterns of metallic thread almost invisible to the naked eye. When placed over the eyes of the wearer, the lenses enable her to see much better than normal at distances of 1 foot or less, granting her a +5 competence bonus on Disable Device checks. Both lenses must be worn for the magic to be effective."
