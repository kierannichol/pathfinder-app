    "text": "Half-plate armor combines elements of full plate and chainmail, incorporating several sizable plates of sculpted metal with an underlying mesh of chain links. While this suit protects vital areas with several layers of armor, it is not sculpted to a single individual\u0027s frame, reducing its wearer\u0027s mobility even more than a suit of full plate. Half-plate armor includes gauntlets and a helm."
