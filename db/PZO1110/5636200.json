    "text": "A dwarven urgrosh is a double weaponâ€” an axe head and a spear point on opposite ends of a long haft. The urgrosh\u0027s axe head is a slashing weapon that deals 1d8 points of damage. Its spear head is a piercing weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage. You can use either head as the primary weapon; the other becomes the off-hand weapon. If you use an urgrosh against a charging character, the spear head is the part of the weapon that deals damage. Dwarves treat dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons."
