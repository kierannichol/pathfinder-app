    "text": "You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject\u0027s subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the spell\u0027s subject can see the phantasmal killer. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage."
