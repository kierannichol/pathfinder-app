    "text": "These clothes are of poor quality, the fabric little more than sack cloth, often patched and mended many times over. A peasant\u0027s outfit consists of a loose shirt and baggy breeches, or a loose shirt and skirt or overdress. Cloth wrappings are used for shoes, causing significantly more wear on the feet."
