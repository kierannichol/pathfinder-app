    "text": "This finely cut and polished stone is indistinguishable from an ordinary jewel in appearance. When it is gazed through, a gem of seeing enables the user to see as though she were affected by the true seeing spell. A gem of seeing can be used for as many as 30 minutes a day, in increments of 5 minutes. These increments do not need to be consecutive."
