    "text": "With a DC 5 Perform (wind instruments) check, you can use a whistle to signal the same sorts of situations as signal horns. A whistle\u0027s piercing report can be clearly heard (Perception DC 0) up to a quarter-mile away. For each quarter-mile beyond, Perception checks to hear a whistle take a –2 penalty. Silent whistles that only animals and other creatures with keen hearing can hear also exist."
