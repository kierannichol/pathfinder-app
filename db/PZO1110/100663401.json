    "text": "This weapon usually appears to be a particularly frighteninglooking iron or steel mace. On command, this +2 heavy mace causes the wielder\u0027s clothes and appearance to transform into an illusion of darkest horror, such that living creatures in a 30- foot cone become panicked as if by a fear spell (Will DC 16 partial). Those who fail this save take a â€“2 morale penalty on saving throws, and they flee from the wielder. The wielder may use this ability up to three times per day."
