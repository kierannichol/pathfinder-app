    "text": "This dark, polished stone reduces the possessor\u0027s base land speed by half. Once picked up, the stone cannot be disposed of by any nonmagical meansâ€”if it is thrown away or smashed, it reappears somewhere on the possessor\u0027s person. If a remove curse spell is cast upon a loadstone, the item may be discarded normally and no longer haunts the individual."
