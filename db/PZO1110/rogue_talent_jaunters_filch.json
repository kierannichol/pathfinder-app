    "text": "As a move action, the rogue can expend a mote of movement to teleport one unattended object within 25 ft. + 5 ft./2 rogue class levels to any other location within the same range, including into the rogue’s hands. If used on any object attended by a creature, the subject gets a Will Save (DC 10+1/2 the rogue’s class level + her Charisma modifier) to negate and the subject is aware something attempted to teleport the object. This is considered a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to the rogue’s class level."
