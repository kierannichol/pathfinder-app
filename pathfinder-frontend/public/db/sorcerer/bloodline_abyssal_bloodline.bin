ability:bloodline_arcanaBloodline Arcana*Â: Whenever you cast a spell of the summoning subschool, the creatures summoned gain DR/good equal to 1/2 your sorcerer level (minimum 1). This does not stack with any DR the creature might have.¢ïGenerations ago, a demon spread its filth into your heritage.
