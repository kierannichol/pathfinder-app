ability:bloodline_arcanaBloodline Arcana*Ç: You count as a hag for the purpose of joining a hag's coven. The coven must contain at least one hag. In addition, whenever you are within 30 feet of another sorcerer with this bloodline or a witch with the coven hex, you can use the aid another action to grant a +1 bonus to the other spellcaster's caster level for 1 round.¢èMisfortune, pestilence, and nightmares follow your family like vermin drawn to carrion. Somewhere in your family history, a hag's foul influence entered your bloodline. You may actually be related to the hag, or you may still be suffering the effects of a curse that a hag laid upon your kin in generations past. Now the hag's powers are part of your heritage.
