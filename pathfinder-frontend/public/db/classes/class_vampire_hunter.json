  "shortDescription": "Vampire hunters obsessively stalk their quarry— not just vampirekind, but all those supernatural beasts and undead terrors that serve the Nobility. These champions of the living track their blasphemous prey, learn their weaknesses, and bring them low. Doing so requires more than training and guile, though. To stand against the darkness, vampire hunters adopt a measure of their foes’ unnatural power, turning vampirekind’s sinister might back against them. Vampire hunters are the vanguard in the battle against evil, but know to value the perspective, support, and magic of other expert adventurers.",
