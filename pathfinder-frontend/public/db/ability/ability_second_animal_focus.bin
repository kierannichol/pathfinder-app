As with the companionâ€™s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.If the hunterâ€™s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companionâ€™s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companionâ€™s aspects to herself, not both.
