rogue:master_strikeMaster Strike"äUpon reaching 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects:

The target can beâ€¦
- put to sleep for 1d4 hours
- paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or
- slain

Regardless of the effect chosen, the target receives a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogueâ€™s level + the rogueâ€™s Intelligence modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is made, that creature is immune to that rogueâ€™s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.
