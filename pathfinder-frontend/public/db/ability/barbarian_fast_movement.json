  "description": "A {@class_1}’s land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the {@class_1}’s speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the {@class_1}’s land speed."
