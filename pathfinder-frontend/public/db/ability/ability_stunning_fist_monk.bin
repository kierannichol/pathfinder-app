ability:stunning_fist#monkStunning Fist*¼At 1st level, the monk gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. The monk may attempt a stunning attack a number of times per day equal to his monk level, plus one more time per day for every four levels he has in classes other than monk.At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition to the target of his Stunning Fist. This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect.At 4th level, he can choose to make the target fatigued.At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute.At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds.At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target.At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds.The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature sickened by Stunning Fist cannot become nauseated if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.
