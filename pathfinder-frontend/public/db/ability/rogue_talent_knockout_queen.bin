She can create no more than 1 dose for every 3 rogue levels she has (minimum 1 dose). Creating drow poison in this way does not require a skill check, but the created poison spoils if not used within 24 hours. (This spoilage means that selling doses of this poison for a profit to unsuspecting merchants might well result in unwanted repercussions and reprisals!)
