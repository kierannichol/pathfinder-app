When doing so, a brawler has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the â€œmonkâ€ special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawlerâ€™s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawlerâ€™s flurry. A brawler with natural weapons canâ€™t use such weapons as part of brawlerâ€™s flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawlerâ€™s flurry attacks.At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawlerâ€™s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using brawlerâ€™s flurry.
