This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian\u0027s speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian\u0027s base speed.",
