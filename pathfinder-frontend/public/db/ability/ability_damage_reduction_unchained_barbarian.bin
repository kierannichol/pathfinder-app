Each time the barbarian takes damage from a weapon or natural attack, subtract 1 from the damage taken. At 10th level and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction rises by 1 point (up to 5 points at 19th level). Damage Reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.ª20,ability:damage_reduction#unchained_barbarian
