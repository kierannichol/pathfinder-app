  "description": "While raging, whenever you succeed at a check to start a grapple, you can choose to deal damage as if you had also succeeded at a check to maintain the grapple. In addition, while raging, whenever you succeed at a combat maneuver check to maintain a grapple, you can choose to give yourself, the target of your grapple, or both the prone condition as a free action while continuing to maintain the grapple."
