ÊA summoner learns a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table: Summoner Spells Known under â€œSpells Known." These spells are cast like any other spell, but they may be cast any number of times per day. Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normally.ª
