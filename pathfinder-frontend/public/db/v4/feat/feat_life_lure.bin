FYour channeled positive energy is irresistibly sweet to nearby undead.ß
BenefitÓAs a standard action, you can channel positive energy to fascinate all undead within 30 feet for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). Undead that succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Charisma modifier) are unaffected. Channeling energy for this purpose does not heal or harm creatures.ª
