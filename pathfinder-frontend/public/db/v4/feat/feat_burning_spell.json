      "Benefit": "The acid or fire effects of the affected spell adhere to the creature, causing more damage the next round. When a creature takes acid or fire damage from the affected spell, that creature takes damage equal to 2 x the spell\u0027s actual level at the start of its next turn. The damage is acid or fire, as determined by the spell\u0027s descriptor. If a burning spell has both the fire and acid descriptor, the caster chooses what kind of damage is dealt by the burning spell effect. A burning spell uses up a slot two levels higher than the spell\u0027s actual level."
