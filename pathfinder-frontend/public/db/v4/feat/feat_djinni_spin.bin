You can surround yourself with the power of the storm, spinning like a hurricane to unleash a violent blast of electrical energy.å
BenefitÙWhile using Djinni Style, as a standard action you can spend two Elemental Fist (Advanced Player's Guide 158) attempts to surround yourself with a whirlwind of electrified air. Creatures adjacent to you take your unarmed strike damage plus the electricity damage from your Elemental Fist and are deafened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from being deafened.ª
