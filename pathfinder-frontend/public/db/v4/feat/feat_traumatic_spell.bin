ICreatures harmed by your spells relive their torments in nightly terrors.Ü
BenefitÐA traumatic spell causes lingering memories of pain and suffering in creatures harmed by it. When a creature fails a saving throw against a traumatic spell, the next time it sleeps it must succeed at a Will save with a DC equal to the original spell's DC or be affected as if by nightmare. Each time the target fails its save, it must save again the following night or be affected by another nightmare, though the save DC decreases by 2 each night after the first.ª
