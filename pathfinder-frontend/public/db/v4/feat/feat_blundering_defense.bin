`Your feverish and sometimes comical defensive techniques offer enough distraction to aid allies.ô
BenefitèWhenever you fight defensively or use the total defense action, allies gain a luck bonus to AC and CMD equal to 1/2 the dodge bonus you gain from the action you are taking. Allies only gain this bonus while they are adjacent to you.ª
