While you are in this style you must use Elemental Fist to deal electricity damage and you gain a bonus on electricity damage rolls equal to your Wisdom bonus. Further, while you are using this style and have remaining Elemental Fist attempts, you also gain a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity. A condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC also makes you lose this dodge bonus."
