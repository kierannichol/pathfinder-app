      "Benefit": "Casting a quickened spell is a swift action. You can perform another action, even casting another spell, in the same round as you cast a quickened spell. A spell whose casting time is more than 1 round or 1 fullround action cannot be quickened. A quickened spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell\u0027s actual level. Casting a quickened spell doesn\u0027t provoke an attack of opportunity.",
      "Special": "You can apply the effects of this feat to a spell cast spontaneously, so long as it has a casting time that is not more than 1 full-round action, without increasing the spell\u0027s casting time."
