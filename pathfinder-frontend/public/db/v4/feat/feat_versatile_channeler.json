    "sections": {
      "Benefit": "You may make a choice whenever you use your channel energy class feature. If you normally channel positive energy, you may choose to channel negative energy as if your effective cleric level were 2 levels lower than normal. If you normally channel negative energy, you may choose to channel positive energy as if your effective cleric level were 2 levels lower than normal. Having this feat means you qualify for feats and abilities that have \"channel positive energy\" or \"channel negative energy\" as a prerequisite (for example, you qualify for the Command Undead feat and the Turn Undead feat).",
      "Note": "This feat only applies to necromancers, neutral clerics who worship neutral deities, or neutral clerics who do not worship a deity-characters who have the channel energy class ability and have to make a choice to channel positive or negative energy at 1st level. Clerics whose alignment or deity makes this choice for them cannot select this feat."
