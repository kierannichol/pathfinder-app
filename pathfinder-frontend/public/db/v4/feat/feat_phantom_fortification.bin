VYour phantom remains partly immaterial even when fully manifested in ectoplasmic form.¶
BenefitöYour phantom has a 50% chance of ignoring critical hits and precision-based damage when fully manifested in its ectoplasmic form, as if wearing armor with the moderate fortification special ability. This doesn't stack with other similar effects, and doesn't apply against attacks made with ghost touch weapons or weaponlike constructs made of force (such as a clenched fist, mage's sword, or spiritual weapon).™!
