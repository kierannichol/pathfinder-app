      "Benefit": "A creature with this feat can halt its movement while flying, allowing it to hover without needing to make a Fly skill check. If a creature of size Large or larger with this feat hovers within 20 feet of the ground in an area with lots of loose debris, the draft from its wings creates a hemispherical cloud with a radius of 60 feet. The winds generated can snuff torches, small campfires, exposed lanterns, and other small, open flames of non-magical origin. Clear vision within the cloud is limited to 10 feet. Creatures have concealment at 15 to 20 feet (20% miss chance). At 25 feet or more, creatures have total concealment (50% miss chance, and opponents cannot use sight to locate the creature).",
      "Normal": "Without this feat, a creature must make a Fly skill check to hover and the creature does not create a cloud of debris while hovering."
