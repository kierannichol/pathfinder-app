      "Benefit": "As an additional use of the faith healing skill unlock, you can attempt to manipulate a creature\u0027s psychic form to heal damage to its physical form. This works as the treat deadly wounds use of the Heal skill, but also grants the creature a number of temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage healed. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour. Psychic healing doesn\u0027t require a healer\u0027s kit. A creature can benefit from psychic healing only once per day, and can\u0027t benefit from both this ability and treat deadly wounds in the same day."
