      "Benefit": "If another spellcaster tries to counterspell your casting, she adds +4 to her Spellcraft DC when trying to determine your spell. Because you have studied how to mask the recognizable elements of your spellcasting, you gain a +2 bonus on your Spellcraft checks to identify and counter an opponent\u0027s spell if it is a spell you know or have in your spellbook."
