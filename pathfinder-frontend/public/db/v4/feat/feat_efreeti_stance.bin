BenefitñYou gain one additional Elemental Fist attempt per day. While using Efreeti Style, you gain fire resistance equal to your base attack bonus or your monk level plus any base attack bonus gained from levels in classes other than monk, whichever is higher. While denied your Dexterity bonus to AC you are also denied this resistance.
