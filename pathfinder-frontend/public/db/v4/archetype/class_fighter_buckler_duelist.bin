¦These duelists use their bucklers both to defend themselves and to launch unexpected strikes while chopping and hewing at their foes' unprotected bodies and heads with their falcatas. They wear any type of armor, but favor bucklers, and are comfortable using both hands for offense and defense.ºÆE
