Sea Reaver	archetype	barbarian¢×
ÔNot all barbarians hunt forests, plains, and mountains. Some are raiding terrors on the sea and coasts, pillaging those who hoard treasure and pursuing monsters of the deep. Some sea reavers are no more than hunters of the open sea, while others are raiders striking fear into coastal settlements within reach of the sea reavers' longships.ºÇ8
