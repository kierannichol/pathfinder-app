ŽA ghost hunter's smite evil ability does not automatically bypass DR (other than DR/good).
However, she treats her weapon as a ghost touch weapon against the target of her smite. She does not deal extra damage on the first attack against evil outsiders and evil dragons, but she deals 3 points of damage per paladin level she possesses to undead creatures on the first attack (instead of 2 points).ª1
