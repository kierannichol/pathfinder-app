    "text": "Instead of a light or one-handed melee weapon, an eldritch archer must use a ranged weapon for spell combat. She doesn\u0027t need a free hand for ranged spell combat. The eldritch archer cannot accept an attack penalty to gain a bonus on concentration checks to cast a spell defensively."
