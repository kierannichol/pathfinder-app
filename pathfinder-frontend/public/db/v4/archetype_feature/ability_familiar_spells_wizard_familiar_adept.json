    "text": "A familiar adept stores his spells in his familiar rather than in a spellbook, exactly as a witch does. His familiar can freely trade spells known with a witch\u0027s familiar, provided the spells traded are on both casters\u0027 class spell lists. The familiar adept\u0027s familiar uses the witch rules for familiars, including the increased cost of replacing the familiar."
