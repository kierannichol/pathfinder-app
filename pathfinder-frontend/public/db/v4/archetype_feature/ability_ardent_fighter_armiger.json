    "text": "Armigers are difficult to sway from their beliefs. At 2nd level, an armiger gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against charm effects. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 fighter levels beyond 2nd. Once per day, if an armiger is forced to take an action that is diametrically opposed to her order\u0027s beliefs and values while under the influence of a charm or compulsion effect, she can immediately attempt a Will save against the effect\u0027s DC to resist acting out that order. Success does not remove the existing charm or compulsion effect, but does allow the armiger to resist betraying her beliefs."
