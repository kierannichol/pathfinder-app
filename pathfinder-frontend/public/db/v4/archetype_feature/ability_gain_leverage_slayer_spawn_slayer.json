    "text": "At 7th level, a spawn slayer learns techniques to counteract a foe\u0027s size advantage. When performing a combat maneuver against a studied target of Large or larger size, the spawn slayer gains a bonus on the check equal to the creature\u0027s size modifier to CMB (Large +1, Huge +2, Gargantuan +4, and Colossal +8). The spawn slayer adds this same bonus to his CMD when defending against combat maneuvers from a Large or larger studied target."
