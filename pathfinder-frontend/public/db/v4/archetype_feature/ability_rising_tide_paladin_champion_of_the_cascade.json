    "text": "At 5th level, a champion of the cascade\u0027s connection to her deity allows her to summon rivers and alter her surroundings. As a standard action, she can change up to two 5-foot squares per paladin level within 100 feet to become freshwater pools with a depth of up to 5 feet per paladin level. The squares must be adjacent to each other.\nEach creature standing in the area where she first creates the water must attempt a Reflex save (DC \u003d 10 + half the paladin\u0027s level + the paladin\u0027s Charisma modifier) to jump to the nearest unaffected space and avoid falling into the water. The champion of the cascade can use this ability for 1 minute per paladin level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.\nThe changed squares revert back to their original form after the duration ends, and any creatures in the water are shunted out to the nearest open space.\nAt 10th level, as a swift action, she may spend 1 minute of her rising tide\u0027s duration to create a geyser in any body of water she has created, lifting an allied creature in that square up to 10 feet per paladin level into the air for 1 round."
