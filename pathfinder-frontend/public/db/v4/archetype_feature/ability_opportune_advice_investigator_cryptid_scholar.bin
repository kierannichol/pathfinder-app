çAt 4th level, when the cryptid scholar succeeds at a Knowledge check to identify a monster's special powers or vulnerabilities, he can take a move action to share his insights with his allies. Allies within 30 feet who can hear the cryptid scholar gain a +1 insight bonus to their ACs and on saving throws against extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities used by creatures of the same type and all the same subtypes as the monster identified. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the cryptid scholar's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) or until he uses knowledgeable strike (see below), whichever comes first. This bonus increases by 1 at 8th level and every 4 investigator levels thereafter (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). A creature cannot benefit from opportune advice regarding more than one specific kind of monster at a time.
Once the cryptid scholar has used this ability to provide a bonus against a specific kind of monster, he can't grant a bonus against that same kind of monster again for 24 hours, unless he expends one use of inspiration when taking a move action to use this ability.ª<
