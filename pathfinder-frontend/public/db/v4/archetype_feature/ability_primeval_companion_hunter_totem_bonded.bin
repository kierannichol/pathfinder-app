¹The totem-bonded adopts a powerful animal native to the region-often one suited to the cold tundra-selected from the following list: aurochs, badger, bear, big cat, elk, giant raven, mastodon, rhinoceros, walrus, wolf, or any creature categorized as megafauna. At the GM's discretion, she can select other animal companions.
In addition, a 7th-level totem-bonded's animal companion can grow further. If the animal companion's natural size is Large but it is normally available as a Medium animal companion at 7th level (such as a bear), the totem-bonded can have the companion increase in size. To generate statistics for such a creature, apply the following modifications: Size Large; AC +1 natural armor; Ability Scores Str +4, Dex -2, Con +2. Increase the damage of each of the companion's natural attacks by one die size.ª5
