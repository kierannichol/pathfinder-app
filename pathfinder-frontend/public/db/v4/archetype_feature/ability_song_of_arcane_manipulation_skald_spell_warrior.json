    "text": "At 10th level, a spell warrior can sacrifice his own rage magic to counter an opponent\u0027s spell. When using raging song, he can counterspell as an immediate action without interrupting his raging song. However, in addition to expending a spell slot (or spell slots) to attempt to counter the opponent\u0027s spell, the skald must expend 1 round of raging song per spell level of the opponent\u0027s spell (for example, if attempting to counterspell a 3rd-level spell, the skald must expend one of his own 3rd-level spell slots and 3 rounds of raging song)."
