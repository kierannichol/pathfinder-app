ÏA strong-side boxer can use her off hand as if it were a buckler, gaining a +1 natural armor bonus to her AC as long as she does not use her off hand to make attacks. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.
While using her off hand in this manner, the strong-side boxer treats that hand as a buckler for the purposes of other feats and abilities (though she is also considered to have a free hand).ªF
