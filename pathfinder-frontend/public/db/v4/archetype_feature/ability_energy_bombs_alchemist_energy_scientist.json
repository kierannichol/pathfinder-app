    "text": "Whenever an energy scientist regains his daily uses of bombs, he must attune to one element and its corresponding energy type: air (electricity), earth (acid), fire (fire), or water (cold). The energy scientist\u0027s bombs deal the type of energy damage that corresponds to his attuned element until he regains his daily uses of bombs, at which point he must attune to one element again. If the energy scientist uses a discovery that changes his bomb\u0027s damage type to one that is different from that of his attuned element (such as using the acid bomb discovery when the alchemist is attuned to fire), instead of its normal amount of damage, the bomb deals 1d4 points of damage, plus 1d4 for every odd-numbered alchemist level.\nThis ability causes the explosive bomb and inferno bomb discoveries to change the bomb\u0027s damage type to fire if the alchemist is not attuned to fire."
