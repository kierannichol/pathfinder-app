    "text": "At 3rd level, whenever a woodland sniper makes a ranged attack against a creature within 30 feet that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), he deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. This damage increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. Should the woodland sniper score a critical hit with his ranged attack, this additional damage is not multiplied. A woodland sniper cannot use sneak attack with a melee attack.\nAt 6th level and every 3rd level thereafter, the range at which he can make a sneak attack increases by 10 feet."
