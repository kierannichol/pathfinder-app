    "text": "A herald caller depends on summoned allies to overcome her foes, which affords her little experience with the martial pursuits typical of other clerics and a narrower spiritual focus. A herald caller can choose only one domain from her deity\u0027s list of domains, rather than the normal two domains, and she doesn\u0027t gain proficiency with medium armor or shields."
