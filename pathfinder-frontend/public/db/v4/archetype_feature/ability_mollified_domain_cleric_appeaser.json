    "text": "At 1st level, an appeaser gains no domain or domain bonus spells. Once per day as a standard action, he can sacrifice his own force of will to gain divine providence. Doing so deals 1d3 points of Charisma damage to the appeaser, and allows him to select a single domain offered by his deity (except the Evil domain or its subdomains). The appeaser gains access to any granted powers offered by the domain he would otherwise qualify for, and can sacrifice a prepared spell to cast a domain spell from that domain just as if he were spontaneously casting a cure or inflict spell. He retains access to this domain for a number of minutes equal to 1/2 the appeaser\u0027s cleric level + plus his Wisdom modifier. Any domain abilities that can be used a limited number of times per day can be used only once each time that particular domain is invoked.\nAn appeaser can gain a mollified domain one additional time per day (taking Charisma damage each time) at 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level. An appeaser can invoke only a single mollified domain at a time."
