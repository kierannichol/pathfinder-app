³At 3rd level, a spirit master can charge his unarmed strike so it affects incorporeal creatures. The spirit master's unarmed strike deals half damage to incorporeal creatures, or full damage if it's a magic weapon (such as via an amulet of mighty fists). This benefit lasts for a number of rounds equal to the spirit master's class level. A spirit master can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Wisdom modifier.ª/
