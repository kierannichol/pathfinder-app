³A tribal fighter learns to fight with his bare hands and wield traditional tribal weapons so effortlessly that they are almost extensions of his arms. He gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. For the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of style feats and feats that have style feats as prerequisites, the tribal fighter counts as having a number of skill ranks equal to his fighter level in all skills in which he is trained.ª2
