´At 8th level, once per day as a standard action, a summit sentinel can create a rushing wave of earth and stone. The summit sentinel chooses a point on the ground or floor within 30 feet. Rippling waves of earth and stone emanate from the chosen point in a 25-foot cone in a direction of the summit sentinel's choice. Each creature in the area takes 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage and is pushed to the end of the cone. A target that succeeds at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier) takes half damage and is not pushed.ª/
