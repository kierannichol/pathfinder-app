At 5th level and above, a slayer can maintain more than one studied target at a time only if all targets are closely related to one another (even if they aren't part of the family line she seeks to cleanse). This includes blood relatives; undead spawn; constructs or undead and their creator; summoned creatures and their summoner; creatures that are charmed, dominated, or otherwise under direct magical control and their controller; and cohorts, followers, animal companions, familiars, and similar associates of one master.ª2
