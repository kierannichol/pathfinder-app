ãA dragon skald gains access to the following raging song.
Glorious Epic (Su) At 3rd level, a dragon skald learns how to truly extol the virtues and prowess of the heroic figures in his epic tales. By performing for 10 minutes and expending 1 round of raging song, the dragon skald can influence opinions positively towards a heroic subject of the dragon skald's choice. If the subject of the epic attempts a Diplomacy or Intimidate check against anyone who listened to the full performance, he receives a circumstance bonus on that check equal to the Will save bonus granted by the dragon skald's inspired rage.ª-
