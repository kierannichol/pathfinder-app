ÓAt 4th level, the infestation begins assuming various functions of the witch's organs. She gains a 25% chance to negate the extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks, as per the light fortification magic armor ability. At 10th level, this increases to a 50% chance (as per moderate fortification), and at 16th level it increases to a 75% chance (as per heavy fortification). Whenever the putrefactor negates additional damage from a melee attack in this way, the attacker takes damage as if exposed to her verminous blood, even if it has already been targeted by this ability this round.ª2
