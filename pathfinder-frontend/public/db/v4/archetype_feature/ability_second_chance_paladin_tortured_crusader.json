    "text": "At 2nd level, once per day, a tortured crusader can spend two uses of lay on hands and choose an unambiguous trigger such as “when I am paralyzed\" or “when I am about to fall unconscious from hit point damage,\" as well as a mercy she knows starting at 3rd level.\nWhen the named trigger occurs, the tortured crusader gains the benefits of a lay on hands with the chosen mercy without spending an action. This healing can prevent her from falling unconscious or dying. If the effect doesn\u0027t trigger, it expires the next time the tortured crusader recovers uses of lay on hands."
