    "text": "At 2nd level, the swarming creatures within a putrefactor begin to replace her bodily fluids. Whenever she takes slashing or piercing damage from a melee attack, the creatures spill out and bite the attacker, dealing 1d6 points of damage, which count as damage from a Diminutive swarm. A creature can take damage from this ability only once per round. This damage increases by 1d6 at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter."
