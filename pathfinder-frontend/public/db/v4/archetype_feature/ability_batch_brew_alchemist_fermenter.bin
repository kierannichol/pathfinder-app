Batch Brewarchetype_featureclass_feature¢ö
óAt 6th level, a fermenter learns how to brew tinctures in larger batches. Whenever she creates a tincture using Craft (alchemy), she can simultaneously create a number of additional tinctures equal to her Intelligence modifier. She expends resources for each tincture separately, but she attempts a single Craft check and applies the result to each tincture being brewed.ª-
