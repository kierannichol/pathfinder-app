ùAt 3rd level, a galvanic saboteur can dodge the precise attacks of even the most technologically advanced foes. The ranger gains a luck bonus to AC against attacks that target his touch AC as long as his opponent's type matches that of his first favored enemy. This luck bonus is equal to 1/2 the ranger's favored enemy bonus against that creature type. At 8th, 13th, and 18th levels, the ranger gains this luck bonus to AC against attacks that target touch his AC as long as his opponent's type matches his second, third, and fourth favored enemy, respectively. A galvanic saboteur's animal companion (if he chose one for his hunter's bond) also gains this luck bonus.™3
