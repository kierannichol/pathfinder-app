‚At 20th level, a virtuous bravo becomes a master at dispensing holy justice with her blade.
When the virtuous bravo confirms a critical hit with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, she can choose one of the following three effects in addition to dealing damage: the target is rendered unconscious for 1d4 hours, the target is paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or the target is slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save.
On a success, the target is instead stunned for 1 round (it still takes damage). The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the virtuous bravo's paladin level + her Charisma modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a bravo's holy strike, regardless of whether or not it succeeds at the save, that creature is immune to that bravo's holy strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to critical hits are also immune to this ability.ª8
