    "text": "At 2nd level, a hallucinist gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against drug addiction. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, a hallucinist becomes completely immune to drug addiction, but he can choose to lower this immunity for any particular drug. If he becomes addicted to a drug, he must fully recover from the addiction before he can resume his immunity to addiction to that drug."
