    "text": "A Tekritanin arbiter gains Tekritanin as a bonus language. Tekritanin is a fluid and evolving hybrid tongue which shares roots with many modern languages. When the arbiter speaks Tekritanin, any creature that speaks a common human language will understand him well enough to allow the arbiter to use the Diplomacy skill or affect the creature with language-dependent effects. At the GM\u0027s discretion, some human languages might be too divergent or unrelated to Tekritanin to use this ability immediately. In this case, the arbiter must interact with creatures speaking the language for at least 1 hour to permanently apply this ability to the foreign language. A Tekritanin arbiter adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to Linguistics checks."
