–At 2nd level, a jinx witch learns to absorb (or â€œeat") antagonistic magical effects targeting her. If a jinx witch succeeds at a Will or Fortitude saving throw that negates a hostile spell effect, she can consume the spell energy as an immediate action. The witch treats her caster level as 1 higher when casting the next prepared spell she casts after eating a jinx in this manner. If the spell cast is of the same school as the eaten spell, the witch instead treats her caster level as 2 higher. A jinx witch can store only one eaten spell at a time, and can use this ability a number of times each day equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. If the jinx witch uses this ability to eat a spell that targets more than one creature or that creates an area of effect, it uses 2 of her daily uses of the ability and all other targets or creatures in the area of effect receive a +2 bonus on their respective saving throws. If the jinx witch does not use the bonus provided by an eaten spell within 1 hour, the stored energy dissipates harmlessly.ª+
