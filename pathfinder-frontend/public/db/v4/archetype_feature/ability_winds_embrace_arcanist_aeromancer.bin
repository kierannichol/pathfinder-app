§At 5th level, an aeromancer can expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir to call upon the winds to gently carry her through the air while protecting her from harm. She is affected as though by the spell air walk and is surrounded by protective winds that function similarly to a wind wall spell, except the effect surrounds only the aeromancer and moves with her wherever she goes. Both of these effects last for 1 minute.ª0
