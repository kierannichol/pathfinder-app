At 11th level, the bravo can cast aside restraint in favor of a blindingly fast assault of unpredictable strikes inspired in part by the overwhelming brutality of a dragon in Combat. Once per round as part of a full attack, the bravo can spend 1 panache point to make an additional attack with her dueling sword at her highest attack bonus. If she reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with this additional attack, she regains 2 panache points rather than the normal 1 point she would gain from striking a killing blow.ª.
