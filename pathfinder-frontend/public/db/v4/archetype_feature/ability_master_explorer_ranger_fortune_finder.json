    "text": "A fortune-finder of 20th level becomes a master explorer. He can move through any sort of terrain that impedes movement at his full speed, even if it is enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion. As a full-round action, he can study one opponent he can see and has already studied with adaptable study, increasing the benefits he gains from that ability to equal his full favored enemy bonus."
