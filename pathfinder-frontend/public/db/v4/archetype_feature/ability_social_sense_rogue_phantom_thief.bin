¸At 3rd level, a phantom thief's social sixth sense allows her to avoid danger in social situations and to act first when it breaks out. She receives a +1 bonus on Sense Motive checks to avoid being surprised by a foe, on Bluff checks to surprise a foe, and on initiative checks for surprise rounds that involved Bluff and Sense Motive checks to determine surprise. This bonus increases by 1 at 3rd level and every 3 rogue levels thereafter.ª/
