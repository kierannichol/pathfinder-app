    "text": "At 4th level, a agitator can captivate a crowd once per day, as per the spell enthrall (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 the agitator\u0027s rogue level + her Charisma modifier).\nDuring the spell\u0027s effect, the agitator can attempt a DC 15 Charisma check to increase her individual or organizational influence with the members of the crowd by 1 rank or step. Or, if the crowd members\u0027 attitudes toward the agitator are indifferent or worse, this check can improve their attitudes by 1 step. The agitator can never use this ability to increase her individual or organization influence or improve the crowd\u0027s attitude by more than 2 ranks or steps."
