    "text": "At 14th level, a toxicant can drink a poison as a standard action and suspend it within her own body. She is not affected by the poison, and doesn\u0027t need to attempt saving throws against it. When the toxicant next uses her toxic secretion on a creature that attacks her with a natural or unarmed attack, she can expose the attacker to the digested poison (with that poisonâ€˜s normal duration, effects, and save DC) rather than her normal toxic secretion, even if the digested poison isn\u0027t normally a contact poison. The alchemist can maintain only a single digested poison at a time. If she digests a new poison, any older digested poison is lost."
