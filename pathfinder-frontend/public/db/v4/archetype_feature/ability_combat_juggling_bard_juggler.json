    "text": "At 2nd level, a juggler can hold and wield (in other words, “juggle\") up to three items or weapons in his hands. The juggler must be able to hold and wield an object in one hand in order to juggle it.\nThis ability doesn\u0027t grant the juggler additional attacks, though it does allow him to use different weapons as part of a full attack. As long as he is juggling fewer than three objects, the juggler is considered to have a free hand (for the purposes of drawing a weapon, using somatic components, using Deflect Arrows, and so on). At 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the maximum number of objects the juggler can juggle increases by one, to a maximum of seven objects at 18th level.\nIf the juggler is affected by any action or condition that would require a concentration check while he is juggling, he must attempt a Sleight of Hand check to continue juggling and avoid losing concentration. The check\u0027s DC is the same as a concentration check, treating the spell level as twice the number of objects being juggled.\nIf the juggler fails his Sleight of Hand check, he drops all juggled objects but one, determined randomly."
