    "text": "At 5th level, a scrapper selects one fighter weapon group. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when performing a sunder combat maneuver with a weapon from the chosen group. He does not provoke attacks of opportunity when performing a sunder combat maneuver with a weapon from the chosen group. If the scrapper has the Improved Sunder feat, the bonuses on attack and damage rolls from this ability double. At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a scrapper can either take the fighter\u0027s weapon training class feature or improve his bonuses from the scrapper training class feature by 1."
