³At 2nd level, a blazing torchbearer has mastered lighting and holding a torch to the point that it sheds more light than those carried by his peers. The radius of normal and increased illumination of any torch held by a blazing torchbearer increases by 10 feet. Once per day as a standard action, the blazing torchbearer can create a brilliant flash of light that blinds everyone within 10 feet (including the torchbearer) for 1 round.ª:
