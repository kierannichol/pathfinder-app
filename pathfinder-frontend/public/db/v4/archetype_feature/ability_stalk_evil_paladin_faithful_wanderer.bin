Stalk Evilarchetype_featureclass_feature¢Ã
ÀA faithful wanderer isn't interested in going out in a blaze of glory after exhausting a limited ability to smite evil. Instead, she has developed techniques to evade, stalk, and punish evil whenever necessary. She gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, Stealth, and Survival checks against evil outsiders, as well as a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. These bonuses don't stack with favored enemy bonuses. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 2 (to a maximum of +10 at 20th level). At 7th level, the faithful wanderer also gains these bonuses against undead, and at 13th level, she also gains these bonuses against evil dragons.ª3
