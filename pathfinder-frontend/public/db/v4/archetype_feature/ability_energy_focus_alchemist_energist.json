    "text": "An energist chooses whether to pursue the path of positive energy or the path of negative energy. Once selected, this choice can\u0027t be changed. If he chooses negative energy, he adds harm as a 6th-level formula and the inflict spells to his alchemist formulae list and removes heal and the cure spells."
