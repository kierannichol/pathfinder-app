›At 4th level, an opportunist can select an edge from those listed below. Every 4 levels beyond 4th, he can select one additional edge, to a maximum of five at level 20.
This ability replaces the bonus feats gained at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th levels.
Alchemical Admixture (Ex)
As a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, the opportunist can combine two alchemical weapons into a single vial. When thrown as a splash weapon, the mixture has the effects of both component substances and targets are affected as if hit by both. The mixture becomes inert after 1 hour. Combining identical alchemical weapons has no effect.
The opportunist can use this ability once per day for every 4 fighter levels he has.
Alchemical Refinement (Ex)
The opportunist increases the save DC of any alchemical item he crafts by 1 for every 3 fighter levels he has. Doing so increases the raw material cost to craft that item by 10 gp for every +1 increase. This bonus applies only when the opportunist uses the crafted alchemical item himself; it functions as a normal item of its type for all other users.
Bombs (Ex)
The opportunist can make a number of bombs per day equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). These bombs act as alchemist's bombs and deal 1d6 points of fire damage, plus an additional 1d6 points for every 3 fighter levels the opportunist has.
Clouded Shift (Ex)
As part of the standard action to ignite a smokestick or smoke pellet, the opportunist can take a 5-foot step, even if he has already moved this round. He can use this ability only if he has not already taken a 5-foot step this round, and only if the smoke from his alchemical tool conceals his starting location.
Poison Use (Ex)
The opportunist no longer risks poisoning himself when applying poison to a weapon.
