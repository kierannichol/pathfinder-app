    "text": "At 4th level, a forester can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the forester is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless forester does not gain the benefit of evasion."
