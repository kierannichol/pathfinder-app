ñAt 20th level, a dune drifter is able to select three additional deeds for use with his Amateur Gunslinger feat--two from the list of deeds available to 15th-level gunslingers, and one from the list available to 19th-level gunslingers.
In addition, if the dune drifter confirms a critical hit on an attack made with a firearm, the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will saving throw (DC = 10 + the dune drifter's base attack bonus) reduces this effect to staggered instead of stunned.ª3
