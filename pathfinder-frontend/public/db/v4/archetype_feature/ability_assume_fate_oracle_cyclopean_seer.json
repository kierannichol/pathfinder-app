    "text": "As an immediate action when targeted by an effect that requires a saving throw, you can choose another creature within line of sight that is attempting a save against the same effect. The target takes a penalty on its saving throw equal to 1d4 + 1 for every 4 levels you possess. You gain the value of their penalty as a luck bonus on your saving throw. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus."
