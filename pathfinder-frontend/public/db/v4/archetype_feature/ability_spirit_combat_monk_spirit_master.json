    "text": "At 3rd level, a spirit master can charge his unarmed strike so it affects incorporeal creatures. The spirit master\u0027s unarmed strike deals half damage to incorporeal creatures, or full damage if it\u0027s a magic weapon (such as via an amulet of mighty fists). This benefit lasts for a number of rounds equal to the spirit master\u0027s class level. A spirit master can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Wisdom modifier."
