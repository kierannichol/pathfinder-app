øAt 7th level, a corpse hunter may move easily through difficult terrain in areas where corpses are interred, such as graveyards, catacombs, crypts, or necropolises. When in such an environment, the corpse hunter may move at his normal speed without taking damage or suffering any impairment, although any magical effects and enchantments that impair movement still affect him.ª4
