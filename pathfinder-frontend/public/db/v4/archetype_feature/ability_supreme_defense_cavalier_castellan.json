    "text": "At 20th level, whenever the castellan readies an action to make a melee attack against a creature that is not yet adjacent to him, his readied attack deals double the normal amount of damage (or triple the damage if using a brace weapon against a charge). In addition, if the cavalier confirms a critical hit on the readied attack, the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save (DC \u003d 10 + the cavalier\u0027s class level + the cavalier\u0027s Strength modifier) reduces this to being staggered for 1d4 rounds."
