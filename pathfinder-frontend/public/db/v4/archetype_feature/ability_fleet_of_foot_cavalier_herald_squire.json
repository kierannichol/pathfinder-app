    "text": "At 2nd level, a herald squire gains fast movement, as the barbarian class feature of the same name. If the herald squire gains fast movement from another class, the bonuses to her speed do not stack. Whenever she makes long overland journeys alone or with only her mount, the distance a herald squire can travel each day increases by 20%."
