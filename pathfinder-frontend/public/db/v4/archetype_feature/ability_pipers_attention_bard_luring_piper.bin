ÞStarting at 2nd level, whenever a luring piper is actively using Perform (wind instruments) as part of a bardic performance, he gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against language-dependent, mind-affecting, and sonic effects. If this effect is caused by a fey creature, the luring piper can also roll the saving throw twice and take the better result.ª1
