    "text": "A divine herbalist has mastered countless alchemical techniques that supplement her divine powers and greatly aid her when she heals the sick and wounded. She gains a competence bonus on Profession (herbalist) checks equal to 1/2 her oracle level (minimum 1), and uses her Charisma modifier in place of her Wisdom modifier when attempting Profession (herbalist) checks. Additionally, a divine herbalist can identify potions as if via detect magic using Profession (herbalist) instead of Spellcraft, and she can attempt such a check after holding a potion for 1 round."
