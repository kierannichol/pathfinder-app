    "text": "At 8th level, if a harvester irrigator studies his target for 3 rounds (spending a standard action each round to do so) and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (Harvester irrigator\u0027s choice). The death attack fails if the target detects the harvester irrigator or recognizes him as an enemy. If the victim of the attack fails a Fortitude save (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 the harvester irrigator\u0027s class level + the harvester irrigator\u0027s Intelligence modifier) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim is rendered helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per 2 rogue levels that the harvester irrigator has. If the victim\u0027s saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the harvester irrigator has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the irrigation attempt within the next 3 rounds. A Harvester irrigator can attempt to kill or paralyze a creature in this way once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 additional rogue levels he has after 8th."
