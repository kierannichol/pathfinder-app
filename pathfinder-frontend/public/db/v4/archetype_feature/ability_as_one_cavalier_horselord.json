    "text": "At 9th level, a horselord gains the benefits of the Spring Attack feat so long as he is mounted. He uses his mount\u0027s movement for this action, and neither he nor his mount provokes attacks of opportunity from the target. When he makes a single attack with a one-handed slashing weapon in this way, the attack deals 1d6 additional points of damage. This bonus damage increases to 3d6 at 17th level. This ability counts as the Spring Attack feat for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites, but only while the horselord is mounted."
