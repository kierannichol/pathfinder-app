    "text": "A bouda keeps a small fetish: sometimes a carved idol, other times a necklace adorned with teeth or bones.\nA bouda\u0027s spells come from the will of evil spirits residing in the fetish, and its ability to hold spells functions in a manner identical to the way a witch\u0027s spells are granted by her familiar. The bouda must commune with her fetish each day to prepare her spells and can only prepare spells stored in the fetish.\nAt 3rd level, a bouda can use her fetish to deliver touch spells a number of times per day equal to 1/4 her witch level (minimum 1). When casting a touch spell, as a free action she can use this ability. When she does, she can deliver her spell as a ranged touch spell within a range of 30 feet. At 10th level, she can deliver these spells within a range of 60 feet.\nAt 15th level and higher, she can deliver these spells within a range of 90 feet."
