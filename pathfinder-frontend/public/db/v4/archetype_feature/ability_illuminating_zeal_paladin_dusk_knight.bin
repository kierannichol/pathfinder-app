™At 4th level, a dusk knight gains the ability to grant darkvision to her allies. As a standard action, the dusk knight grants one target touched darkvision with a range of 60 feet for 1 hour. If the target already has darkvision, the range increases by 60 feet instead. If the dusk knight targets herself, using this ability is a swift action. Using this ability consumes two uses of her lay on hands ability.ª4
