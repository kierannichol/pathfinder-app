    "text": "When a puppetmaster has a creature under the effects of an enchantment spell and that creature has line of sight to an illusion spell the puppetmaster has cast with a duration of concentration, the puppetmaster can link the illusion spell to the enchanted target. As long as the target has line of sight to the illusion and is enchanted, and the puppetmaster has line of sight to both the target and the illusion, the puppetmaster can maintain the illusion as a free action each round. The puppetmaster can maintain only one illusion spell in this way. At 13th level, the puppetmaster can maintain two illusion spells in this way, requiring a separate enchanted target for each illusion."
