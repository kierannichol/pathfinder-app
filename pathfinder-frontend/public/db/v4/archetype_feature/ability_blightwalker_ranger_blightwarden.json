    "text": "At 3rd level, a blightwarden gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks when in areas afflicted by a natural or supernatural blight. Blighted areas include cursed lands, domains of evil, regions negatively affected by a spell or ability that affects at least a 300-square-foot area, or regions where a specific affliction is prevalent. In addition, the blightwarden adds this bonus to ability checks, saving throws, and skill checks to avoid natural and supernatural hazards in blighted areas. He can choose to improve this bonus in place of improving a favored terrain bonus. A blightwarden traveling through blighted areas leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he can leave a trail if he chooses)."
