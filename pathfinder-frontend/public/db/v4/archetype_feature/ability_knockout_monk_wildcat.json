    "text": "Starting at 9th level, once per day a wildcat can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. He must announce this intent before making his attack roll. If the wildcat\u0027s strike is successful and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 the wildcat\u0027s level + the higher of the wildcat\u0027s Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect; this is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 12th level, a wildcat can use this ability twice per day."
