¯
At 8th level, a blighter can end any effect affecting a creature that could be reversed by break enchantment. To do so, the affected creature must imbibe one of the blighter's infused extracts of the healing subschool of at least 3rd level. The blighter must then attempt a caster level check as described in break enchantment. If the blighter succeeds at the check, the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. The blighter can also use this ability to attempt to dispel primal magic events affecting a creature or an area. To do so, the affected creature must imbibe an infused extract as described above, and the blighter must attempt a caster level check against a DC equal to 11 + the primal magic event's CR. If he succeeds at the check, the primal magic event ends as if the blighter had successfully used dispel magic. If the blighter attempts to dispel a primal magic event affecting an area, as a standard action, he must dump an infused extract of the healing subschool of at least 3rd level onto an affected square. He then must attempt a caster level check against a DC equal to 11 + the primal magic event's CR. If he succeeds at the check, the primal magic event ends as if the blighter had successfully used dispel magic.
This ability replaces poison resistance +6 and the discovery gained at 8th level.ª:
