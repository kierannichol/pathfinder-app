    "text": "An angelfire apostle is less concerned with the traditional divine magic that many religious adherents receive. The angelfire apostle receives one fewer spell slot at each spell level. When an angelfire apostle gets no spells per day at a spell level, he can cast domain spells of that level normally, but can only cast nondomain spells of that level if he gets them as bonus spells."
