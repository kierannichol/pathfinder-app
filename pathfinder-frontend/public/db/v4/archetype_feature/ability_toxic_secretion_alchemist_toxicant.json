    "text": "At 1st level, a toxicant has learned to mimic creatures with the ability to secrete harmful toxins through the skin. Once per day, in a process that takes 10 minutes, the toxicant can create and imbibe a tincture that causes her skin to secrete a mild toxin. The toxicant is immune to this secretion, but any creature that hits her with a natural attack or unarmed strike must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 the toxicant\u0027s alchemist level + the toxicant\u0027s Intelligence modifier). On a failed save, the target takes an amount of damage equal to the toxicant\u0027s Intelligence modifier. At 4th level, a target that fails its save must succeed at a second save 1 round later or take the same amount of damage again. This effect repeats as long as the target continues to fail its saving throws, to a maximum number of rounds equal to 1 + 1 for every 4 alchemist levels the toxicant possesses (to a maximum of 6 rounds at 20th level).\nThis is a poison effect. The toxicant can suppress this secretion as a standard action, in which case it remains suppressed for 1 hour or until the toxicant reactivates it as a standard action.\nAt 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the toxicant can choose a condition to have her toxin impose.\nOnce this choice is made, it can\u0027t be changed. A creature that fails its save against the toxic secretion also gains these conditions until it succeeds at a save against the secretion, or until the toxin\u0027s duration ends.\nAt higher alchemist levels, the toxicant gains access to stronger conditions; some replace lower-level conditions, which must be selected first. The following conditions are available at the given alchemist levels: 3rd--bleed (1d6), dazzled, fatigued, or sickened; 6th--dazed or shaken; 9th--blinded (replaces dazzled) or staggered (replaces dazed); 12th--exhausted (replaces fatigued); 18th--stunned (replaces exhausted and staggered).\nAs a swift action, the toxicant can collect and concentrate this secretion into a poison she can deliver as a touch attack or apply to a weapon. Targets of such attacks must attempt saving throws as if they had touched the toxicant\u0027s toxic secretion. The toxicant can do this a number of times per day equal to her alchemist level + her Intelligence modifier."
