ºAt 3rd level, a virtuous bravo gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light armor or no armor.
Anything that causes the virtuous bravo to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes her to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 paladin levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level).ª,
