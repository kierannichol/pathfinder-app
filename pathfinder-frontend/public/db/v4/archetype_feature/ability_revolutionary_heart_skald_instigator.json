    "text": "At 7th level, an instigator\u0027s tumultuous mastery of demagoguery and revolution makes it difficult for others\u0027 compulsions to sway him.\nOnce per day, when he fails a saving throw against a compulsion effect, he can attempt another saving throw after 1 time increment (1 round if the effect is measured in rounds, 1 minute if the effect is measured in minutes, 10 minutes if the spell is measured in 10-minute increments, and so on). Every 6 skald levels thereafter, he gains an additional daily use of this ability (to a maximum of 3 per day at 19th level)."
