    "text": "A true silvered throne\u0027s divine magic arises from communion with spirits alongside study of archaic lore compiled into a personal occult grimoire.\nUnlike a wizard\u0027s spellbook, this grimoire doesn\u0027t contain specific spells. By studying his grimoire, a true silvered throne can prepare any spell on the shaman spell list or provided by his spirit. If this grimoire is lost or destroyed, he cannot prepare new spells or use his spirit magic class feature until it is replaced, which requires 1 week of work."
