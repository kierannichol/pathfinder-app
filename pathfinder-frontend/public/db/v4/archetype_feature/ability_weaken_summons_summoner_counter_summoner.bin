ËAt 10th level, as a standard action, a counter-summoner can attempt to weaken a summoned or called creature within 60 feet. The targeted creature takes a â€“2 penalty on attack and damage rolls and to Armor Class for 1 minute per summoner level. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the counter-summoner's class level + his Charisma modifier) negates this effect. A given summoned creature can't be targeted by this ability more than once per 24-hour period.ª7
