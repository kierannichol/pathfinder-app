    "text": "At 8th level, the vellemancer adds the following spells to her familiar for free: bear\u0027s endurance, bull\u0027s strength, cat\u0027s grace, eagle\u0027s splendor, fox\u0027s cunning, and owl\u0027s wisdom. The vellemancer can cast these spells only as part of her wishgranter ability, but she can sacrifice any prepared spell of 2nd level or lower to spontaneously cast one of these spells."
