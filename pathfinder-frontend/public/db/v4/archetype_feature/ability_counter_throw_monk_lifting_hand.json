    "text": "At 12th level, a lifting hand can ready an action to trigger if a creature tries to attack her.\nWhen the readied action triggers, the lifting hand can attempt a grapple combat maneuver check with a +2 bonus. If she succeeds, she grapples the creature and negates the triggering attack, and she can spend an immediate action to use the Savage Slam feat."
