ÍA deep marshal learns numerous arcane secrets involving the shaping and warding of earth and stone. She adds the following sorcerer/wizard spells to her magus spell list as magus spells of the same level: crafter's curse, crafter's fortune, erase, expeditious excavation, fabricate, greater make whole, knock, major creation, make whole, mending, minor creation, move earth, passwall, stone shape, transmute mud to rock, transmute rock to mud, and all 0- through 6th-level sorcerer/wizard spells of the abjuration school. She must still add such spells to her spellbook to prepare them. If a spell appears on both the magus and sorcerer/wizard spell lists, the magus uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. A deep marshal cannot cast spells from the enchantment, illusion, or necromancy school and she cannot activate spell-completion or spell-trigger magic items that use spells from those schools (without making a successful Use Magic Device check).ª3
