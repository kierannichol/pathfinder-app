ôAt 4th level, a provocateur can cause all observers fascinated by her fascinate performance to become less friendly to a target creature or group of her choice for 10 minutes per bard level. Affected observers' attitudes toward the target, the target's influence with affected observers, and affected observers' trust level as contacts for the target are all reduced by one step. If she reveals information during the performance that would reduce those creatures' attitudes anyway, those attitudes worsen by an additional step for the duration.
If the provocateur engages in a verbal duel against the target with an audience affected by damning performance, she automatically gains two edges.
At 18th level, the duration increases to 1 day per bard level.ª3
