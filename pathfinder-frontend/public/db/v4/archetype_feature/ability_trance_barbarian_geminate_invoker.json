    "text": "As a free action, a geminate invoker can enter a self-imposed trance, ignoring the physical limits of his body. This ability functions similarly to a barbarian\u0027s rage, except where noted below, and feats, spells, and abilities that affect a barbarian\u0027s rage (such as the Extra Rage feat) apply to an geminate invoker\u0027s trance. A geminate invoker gains rage powers as per a normal barbarian, but he can never gain totem rage powers via this ability.\nInstead of the normal rage bonuses and penalties, a geminate invoker in a trance gains a +4 morale bonus to his Constitution; gains a +2 morale bonus on Reflex and Will saving throws; takes no penalties to AC; can still use Dexterity-, Intelligence-, and Charisma-based skills; and gains Diehard as a bonus feat. The Constitution bonus increases to +6 and the save bonus increases to +3 when he gains greater rage, and they increase to a +8 Constitution bonus and a +4 bonus on saves when he gains mighty rage."
