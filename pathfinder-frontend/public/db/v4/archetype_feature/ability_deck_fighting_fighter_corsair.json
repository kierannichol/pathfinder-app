    "text": "A corsair is used to fighting on crowded decks, and isn\u0027t fazed by fighting multiple opponents at once. At 2nd level, he gains Cleave as a bonus feat. He may use this feat even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A corsair does not take the normal â€“2 penalty to his AC when using the Cleave feat."
