ñAn esoteric is proficient with simple weapons only. This alters the magus's weapon and armor proficiency.
Diminished Spellcasting: An esoteric has one fewer spell slot of each level than a regular magus. If this reduces his number of spell slots of a particular level to zero, he can cast spells of that level only if his Intelligence allows bonus spells of that level.ª:
