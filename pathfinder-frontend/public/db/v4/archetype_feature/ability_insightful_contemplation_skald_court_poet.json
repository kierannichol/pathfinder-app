    "text": "At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Intelligence and Charisma and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but they also take a â€“1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of insightful contemplation, allies other than the court poet can\u0027t use any Strength-based skills or make any physical effort that requires a Constitution check. At 4th level and every 4 skald levels thereafter, the song\u0027s bonus on Will saves increases by 1; the penalty to AC doesn\u0027t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song\u0027s bonuses to Intelligence and Charisma increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian\u0027s rage ability, those affected are not fatigued after the song ends.)"
