    "text": "At 2nd level, an arcane healer gains the ability to channel positive energy as a cleric of one level lower than his level. If a creature within the channeled energy\u0027s area of effect would be allowed a save against its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcane healer\u0027s level + the arcane healer\u0027s Charisma modifier. An arcane healer can use this ability once per day at 2nd level, gaining an additional use per day every four levels thereafter (6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th), to a maximum of 5 times per day at 18th level."
