ÓAt 8th level, a needler learns how to deliver all types of poisons with subtlety. As a standard action, she can deliver an ingested or inhaled poison to a creature within reach by placing a dose of poison on the target's lips, on the target's neck, or through other similar contact with the target's skin as if the poison were a contact poison. Delivering poison in this way requires a successful Sleight of Hand check opposed by the target's Perception check. The poison is not lost on a failed check, but it must be successfully delivered within 1 minute of the first attempt, or it is wasted.ª/
