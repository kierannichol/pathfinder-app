ôA puppetmaster can cast spells from the bard and magus spell lists, and treats bard spells as magus spells.
Because he does not have a bardic performance ability, some bard spells (which modify or require bardic performance) are poor choices for a puppetmaster. He must add bard spells to his spellbook prior to preparing them as normal.
A puppetmaster can learn bard spells from a formula book or spellbook (if they are also alchemist extracts or wizard spells) or a scroll (as if learning a wizard spell from a scroll), or can select them to be one or more of the two magus spells he adds to his spellbook at each magus level.ª(
