    "text": "At 1st level, a crimson chymist discovers how to create a specialized mutagen that grants her aspects of a praying mantis. A mantis mutagen functions as an alchemist mutagen, save that it always enhances Dexterity and applies a penalty to Charisma. When imbibed, the mutagen causes the crimson chymist\u0027s flesh to grow red chitinous plates on her body as natural armor and a row of small, cosmetic barbed hooks along her arms."
