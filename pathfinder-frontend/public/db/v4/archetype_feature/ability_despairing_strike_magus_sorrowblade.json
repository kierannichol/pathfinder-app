    "text": "At 3rd level, the sorrowblade can wield the power of despair. By spending 1 point from her arcane pool as a swift action, she can imbue the weapon she is wielding with pure anguish. The first creature she strikes with this weapon within the next minute must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 the sorrowblade\u0027s magus level + her intelligence modifier) or become shaken for 1 minute. Multiple despairing strikes can\u0027t make a creature frightened."
