žAt 2nd level, when a raging cannibal reduces a creature of the same creature type as herself to 0 or fewer hit points with her bite attack during combat while raging, she can consume a chunk of its body to gain a portion of its power. If the creature's CR equals or exceeds her barbarian level, the raging cannibal gains 1 additional round of rage. She can never consume the same creature's vigor more than once. At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the raging cannibal gains 1 additional round of rage each time she uses this ability.ª6
