    "text": "A jinyiwei follows a mandate to combat corruption in the mortal world. A jinyiwei adds her Wisdom modifier to her inspiration pool, rather than her Intelligence modifier. Additionally, rather than dabbling in the arcane arts of alchemy, a jinyiwei is empowered by the forces of celestial bureaucracy. She casts spells as an inquisitor of the same level."
