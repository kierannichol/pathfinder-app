    "text": "At 5th level, a trap breaker can attempt to disarm a mechanical trap by detonating it rather than disarming it with a Disable Device check. As a full-round action, a trap breaker may expend one of his bombs to make a ranged touch attack against a trap, using the trap\u0027s Disable Device DC as its AC. If the attack misses, the bomb\u0027s splash damage activates the trap. If the attack hits, the bomb deactivates the trap without setting it off. The trap breaker must both know the location of the trap and be able to reach the trap\u0027s trigger with a ranged touch attack in order to use this ability. At 8th level, a trap breaker can disarm magic traps with this ability."
