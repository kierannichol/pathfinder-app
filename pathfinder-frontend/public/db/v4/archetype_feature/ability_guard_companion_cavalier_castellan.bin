§At 4th level, the castellan forms a bond with an animal companion that serves as a guard.
While most castellans select birds or canines, the castellan can choose any animal companions available to rangers.
This ability functions like the druid nature bond ability, except that the castellan's effective druid level is equal to his cavalier level â€“ 3 and his animal companion doesn't gain the share spells special ability.ª1
