    "text": "At 16th level as a full-round action, a blood summoner\u0027s eidolon can enter and control the body of any corporeal creature that has blood.\nThis ability functions as marionette possession, except that the eidolon\u0027s body also enters the target and the target can be unwilling. A successful Will save (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 the blood summoner\u0027s level + his Charisma modifier) negates this effect. This ability can be used once per day at 16th level, twice per day at 18th level, and three times per day at 20th level. The eidolon can end this possession at any time as a standard action. If the host body is slain while the eidolon is possessing it, the eidolon is immediately ejected, takes 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round."
