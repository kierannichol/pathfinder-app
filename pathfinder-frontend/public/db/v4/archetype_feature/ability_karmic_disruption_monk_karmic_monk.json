    "text": "At 16th level, a karmic monk can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to add 1d6 points of damage to his unarmed strikes against creatures of either chaotic, evil, good, or lawful alignment for 1 round. This stacks with other abilities that deal damage based on alignment. He cannot alter his alignment choice until the next time he uses this ability.\nCreatures that are of the appropriate alignment and are struck by this attack must succeed at a Will save (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 the karmic monk\u0027s class level + the karmic monk\u0027s Wisdom modifier) or lose any damage reduction based on alignment for a number of rounds equal to the karmic monk\u0027s Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 round). A creature that succeeds at this save is immune to having its damage reduction disrupted by that karmic monk for 24 hours. This attack disrupts only alignment components of damage reduction, not any other components; for example, DR/cold iron and good becomes DR/cold iron."
