    "text": "At 2nd level, a covenbane can designate an entire coven as his studied target by studying any single member. He applies his studied target bonus against all members of the studied creature\u0027s coven, and all members of the coven count as one target for the purposes of determining the maximum number of studied targets a slayer can maintain. This bonus remains even if one or more members of the coven die after the covenbane studies them. Beginning at 7th level, the covenbane can designate other magically linked creatures, such as those bound by a hivemind or a telepathic bond spell, as a coven, but he can target only three members of such a link. Studying a coven always requires a move action, even if the slayer could normally study a target with a swift or immediate action."
