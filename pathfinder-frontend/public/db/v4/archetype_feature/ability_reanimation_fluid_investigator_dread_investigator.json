    "text": "At 7th level, a dread investigator adds undead anatomy I to his formula book, and he can share this extract with an unconscious creature as if he had the infusion discovery. If the creature is dying when it receives the infusion, it stabilizes and gains temporary hit points equal to twice the dread investigator\u0027s level. Rather than having the extract take effect immediately, the dread investigator may choose for the extract to remain latent for up to 10 minutes per level. He can trigger the extract\u0027s effect at any point by touching the creature as a standard action, and it automatically triggers if the creature using it is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. The dread investigator can also amplify the effect of the extract, allowing it to function as undead anatomy II, but this reduces the extract\u0027s duration to 1 round per level and at the end of its duration the creature using the extract is reduced to –1 hit points.\nAt 13th level, a dread investigator adds undead anatomy II to his formula book, and at 19th level undead anatomy III, which he can use in the same way, including amplifying the effect of the extract to the next-higher-level undead anatomy spell."
