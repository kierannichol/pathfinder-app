    "text": "At 11th level, a charger can attempt to overrun any number of targets in the path of his charge as a free action. For each successful overrun combat maneuver check, the charger automatically deals an amount of damage to the overrun target equal to that of his hoof attack and can continue with his charge. If any overrun attempt fails during the charge, the charger\u0027s progress ends in the space directly in front of the target where the maneuver failed. These overrun attempts do not provoke attacks of opportunity. For each target in the path of his charge, the charger incurs a cumulative â€“2 penalty on his overrun combat maneuver checks."
