    "text": "At 2nd level, as a standard action, an energist can create and throw a healing ampoule of the same energy type as his bombs up to 30 feet, using two of his daily uses of bombs. A living creature subject to a direct hit by a healing ampoule of positive energy regains 1d4 hit points plus an additional 1d4 hit points for every even-numbered alchemist level an energist has beyond 2nd, while a direct hit by a negative energy healing ampoule instead restores an equivalent number of hit points to an undead target.\nIn either case, the energist adds his Intelligence modifier to the number of hit points healed, as if the ampoule were a splash weapon benefiting from his throw anything ability. A healing ampoule has no splash effect on adjacent targets unless it misses the target; if it misses, determine where it lands as if it were a splash weapon. Healing ampoules don\u0027t damage creatures normally damaged by the energist\u0027s chosen energy type."
