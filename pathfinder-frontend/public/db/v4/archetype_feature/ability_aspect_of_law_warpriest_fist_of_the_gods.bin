ôAt 20th level, a fist of the gods can channel an aspect of law, growing even more inflexible.
Once per day as a swift action, a warpriest can treat his level as his base attack bonus, gains DR 20/chaotic, and becomes immune to mind-affecting effects. In addition, he can take the average result on any die roll instead of rolling normally. This ability lasts for 1 minute.ª7
