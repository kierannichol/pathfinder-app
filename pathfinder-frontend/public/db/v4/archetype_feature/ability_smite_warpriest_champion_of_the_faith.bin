At 4th level, a champion of the faith can focus his powers against his chosen foes. As a swift action, the champion of the faith chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is of his opposed alignment, the champion of the faith adds his Charisma bonus (if any) to his attack rolls and adds his warpriest level to all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of his smite is an outsider with the subtype corresponding to his opposed alignment, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per warpriest level the champion of the faith possesses. Regardless of the target, smite attacks automatically bypass any DR the target possesses.
In addition, while smite is in effect, the champion of the faith gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the smite targets a creature that's not of the champion of the faith's opposed alignment, the smite is wasted with no effect.
The smite effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the champion of the faith regains spells. The champion of the faith can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 4th (to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level). Using this ability consumes two uses of his fervor ability.ª4
