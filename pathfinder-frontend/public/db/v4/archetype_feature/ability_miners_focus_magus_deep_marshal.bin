·At 3rd level, a deep marshal can use the magical properties of her weapon in order to augment her spellcasting. Whenever she casts a magus spell while wielding a magic battleaxe, heavy pick, warhammer, or weapon with the word â€œdwarven" in its name, she adds half the weapon's enhancement bonus to the her caster level (minimum +1). When attempting a caster level check to overcome spell resistance, she instead adds her weapon's full enhancement bonus.
In addition, she is treated as having a number of ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering) and Profession (miner) equal to her magus level, and she attempts Profession (miner) checks using her Intelligence modifier instead of her Wisdom modifier.ª.
