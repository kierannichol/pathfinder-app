÷At 10th level, once per day when a witch killer observes a creature within 30 feet cast an arcane spell or use an arcane spell-like ability, he can use foster hatred on that character, or target one creature harmed by the arcane effect with vengeful outrage, identifying the caster as the enemy. He can use this ability twice per day at 15th level, and he can use this ability three times per day at 20th level. The save DC is Charisma-based and uses the witch killer's slayer level as his caster level.ª1
