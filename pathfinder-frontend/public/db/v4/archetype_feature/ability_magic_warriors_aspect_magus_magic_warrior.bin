åAt 3rd level, as a standard action, a Magic Warrior can gain an aspect of an animal's might by expending 1 point from her arcane pool. The animal must be the same one that the Magic Warrior's mask represents (the animal can change if the Magic Warrior creates or obtains a new mask). The Magic Warrior gains one ability the animal has from the list of abilities given in beast shape I (this ability doesn't allow her to change her size). The ability lasts for 1 minute per class level.ª8
