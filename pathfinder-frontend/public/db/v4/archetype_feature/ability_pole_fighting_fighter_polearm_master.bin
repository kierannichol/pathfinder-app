âAt 2nd level, as an immediate action, a polearm master can shorten the grip on his spear or polearm with reach and use it against adjacent targets. This action results in a â€“4 penalty on attack rolls with that weapon until he spends another immediate action to return to the normal grip. The penalty is reduced by â€“1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.ª3
