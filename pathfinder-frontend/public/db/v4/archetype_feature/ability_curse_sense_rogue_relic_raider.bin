·At 4th level, a relic raider adds 1/2 her rogue level on Perception checks to notice haunts and on Spellcraft checks to identify cursed items (using detect magic or similar effects).
In addition, the relic raider gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against curses and haunts and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by haunts. These bonuses increase by 1 at 6th level and every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).ª-
