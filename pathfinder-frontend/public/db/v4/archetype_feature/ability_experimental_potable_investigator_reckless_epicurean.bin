¾At 5th level, once per day, a reckless epicurean can prepare one experimental potable using a formula that she does not know from the alchemist formulae list into an extract slot of the appropriate level.
These experimental potables often have side effects. When a creature consumes one of these potables, the investigator must succeed at a Spellcraft check (DC = 15 + the formula's level). On a failure, she must roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to determine the extra effects. If the wild magic surge effect isn't possible due to the nature of the spell or effect, roll instead on the Universal Surge Effects table.
Results concerning the caster affect the drinker of the experimental potable instead.
At 8th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, the reckless epicurean can prepare one additional experimental potable per day.ªC
