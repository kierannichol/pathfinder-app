ÛAt 2nd level, when the swindler uses Sleight of Hand, creatures take a penalty on their Perception checks equal to half the swindler's class level to notice the attempt. The swindler also reduces the normal â€“20 penalty by an amount equal to her class level when attempting a Sleight of Hand check as a move action instead of as a standard action.
