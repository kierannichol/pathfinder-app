ÉAt 2nd level, a bloody-knuckled rowdy gains a bonus feat. This bonus feat must be a style feat or a feat with a style feat as a prerequisite. The bloody-knuckled rowdy treats his bloodrager levels as monk levels when qualifying for and calculating the effects of style feats and feats that have style feats as prerequisites.
At 5th level, the bloody-knuckled rowdy gains the Combat Style Master feat. He doesn't need to meet the prerequisites for this feat.ªD
