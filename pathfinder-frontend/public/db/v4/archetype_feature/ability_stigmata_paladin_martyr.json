    "text": "As a standard action, the martyr can chant hymns of faith and cause bleeding stigmata to visibly appear on his body; at 7th level, he can manifest stigmata as a move action, and at 13th level, he can do so as a swift action. He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Charisma modifier at 1st level, plus 1 additional round per day for each level beyond 1st. While his stigmata are active, he takes 1 point of bleed damage, which automatically ceases when he ends this ability but otherwise does not relent, even in the face of magical healing or Heal checks. His stigmata assist his allies, duplicating the effect of the countersong, distraction, or inspire courage bardic performance of a bard of his paladin level, though both countersong and distraction use Heal skill checks instead of Perform skill checks. At 10th level, he can choose to duplicate the effects of inspire greatness. At 16th level, he can choose to duplicate the effects of inspire heroics."
