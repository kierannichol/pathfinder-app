    "text": "At 5th level, a clocksmith learns to improve upon his construct familiar. A clocksmith can grant his familiar 1 evolution point worth of eidolon evolutions for every 5 wizard levels he has, though he can\u0027t select any evolutions that require a specific base form.\nEach time the clocksmith gains a level, he can change his familiar\u0027s evolutions. These evolutions stack with those from the Evolved Familiar feat."
