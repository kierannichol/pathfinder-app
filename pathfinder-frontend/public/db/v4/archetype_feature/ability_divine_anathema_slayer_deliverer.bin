„At 10th level, as a free action a deliverer can declare a studied target to be his divine anathema. The studied target's alignment must be at least two steps away from that of the deliverer. Against this target, the deliverer's attacks deal an additional 2d6 points of damage; this damage is directly from divine power and does not stack with the bonus damage from a holy or unholy weapon, or a weapon with a similar weapon special ability or effect. A deliverer can have only one divine anathema at a time.
This ability replaces the advanced slayer talent gained at 10th level.
Slayer Talents: The following slayer talents (and rogue talents) complement the deliverer archetype: combat trick, finesse rogue, foil scrutiny*, terrain mastery, trap spotter, and trapfinding*. (Those with asterisks [*] are detailed in the slayer class.)
Advanced Slayer Talents: The following advanced slayer talents (and advanced rogue talents) complement the deliverer archetype: assassinate*, evasion, hunter's surprise, and master of disguise.ª/
