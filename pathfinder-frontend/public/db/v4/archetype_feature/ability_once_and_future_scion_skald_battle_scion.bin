—At 20th level, a battle scion becomes extremely difficult to kill. Whenever she is slain, as long as her body isn't destroyed, she enters a deathlike sleep for 3 days, after which she returns to life as per raise dead, except that it can restore her even if she was slain by a death effect. Spells that would restore her to life function as if she were dead during this time, allowing her to recover sooner.ª7
