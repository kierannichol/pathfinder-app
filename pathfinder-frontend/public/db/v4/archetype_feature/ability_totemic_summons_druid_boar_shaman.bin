“At 5th level, a boar shaman may cast summon nature's ally as a standard action when summoning boars or other porcine creatures, and these summoned creatures gain temporary hit points equal to her druid level. She can apply the young template to any boar or other porcine creature to reduce the level of the summoning spell required by one. She can also increase the level of summoning required by one in order to apply either the advanced or the giant template, or increase it by two to apply both the advanced and giant templates.ª0
