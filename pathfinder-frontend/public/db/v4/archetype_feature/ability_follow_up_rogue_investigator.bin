®An investigator can roll twice on any Diplomacy check made to gather information, and receives the information for both results. This takes the same amount of time as one check. If the lesser of the two checks reveals false information, the rogue is aware of it.
False information is not revealed in this way if the people she questioned do not know it to be false.
This ability replaces trapfinding.
Rogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement the investigator archetype: coax information, fast picks, follow clues, hard to fool, and minor magic*.ª+
