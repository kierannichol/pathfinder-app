    "text": "At 6th level, an alchemical sapper can expend two uses of his bomb class feature to prepare a special kind of trap called a trip mine. This special bomb remains inert until 1 round after it leaves the alchemical sapper\u0027s possession, after which time it becomes armed. When a creature enters a square containing an armed trip mine, it explodes, dealing normal bomb damage to all creatures in its square (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 the alchemical sapper\u0027s alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier; Reflex half ) and splash damage to every creature adjacent to that square. A trip mine can be disarmed with a successful Disable Device check (with a DC equal to the trip mine\u0027s save DC); otherwise, it lasts until the next time the alchemical sapper refreshes his daily bombs.\nIf the alchemical sapper expends four uses of his bomb class feature, his trip mine deals damage as per a demolition bomb; this does not count against his daily uses of the demolition bomb ability. Other than demolition bomb, discoveries that modify bombs cannot apply to trip mine."
