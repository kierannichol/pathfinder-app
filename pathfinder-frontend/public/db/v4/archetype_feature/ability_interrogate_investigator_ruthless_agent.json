    "text": "At 3rd level as a full-round action, a ruthless agent can ask a target one question for every 2 investigator levels she has. The target is not compelled to answer truthfully, but the ruthless agent\u0027s implicit or explicit threats and looming manner leads the target to believe the ruthless agent will cause it serious harm if it lies. This imposes a –2 penalty on the target\u0027s Bluff checks to lie when answering the specific questions the ruthless agent asked. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the penalty increases by 2 (to a maximum of –12 at 18th level). She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. This is a mind-affecting fear effect."
