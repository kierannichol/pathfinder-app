    "text": "At 8th level, as an immediate action, a siegebreaker can distract a foe he just hit with an attack or combat maneuver, imposing a –2 penalty on the foe\u0027s attack rolls, caster level checks, or skill checks for 1 round. The foe can negate this penalty with a successful Fortitude save (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 the siegebreaker\u0027s fighter level + his Strength modifier). At 14th level, the penalty increases to –4."
