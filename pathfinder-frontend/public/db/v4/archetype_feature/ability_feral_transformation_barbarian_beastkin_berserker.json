    "text": "At 4th level, when entering a rage, a beastkin berserker can take the form of a Small or Medium animal. This functions as beast shape I, except the duration is for as long as the beastkin berserker rages and the animal must be one she has chosen with her savage rapport.\nAt 8th level, the beastkin berserker can use feral transformation to take the form of a Large or Tiny animal that she has chosen with her savage rapport. Feral transformation now acts as beast shape II.\nAt 12th level, a beastkin berserker is able to use feral transformation to take the form of a Huge or Diminutive animal that she has chosen with her savage rapport. Feral transformation now functions as beast shape III."
