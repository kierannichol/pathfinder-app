The familiar can use the chosen one\u0027s lay on hands ability, including all of her mercies, but each such use consumes two uses of the paladin\u0027s lay on hands ability. Starting at 4th level, the familiar can also channel positive energy, but each such use consumes four uses of the paladin\u0027s lay on hands ability."
