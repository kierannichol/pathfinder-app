    "text": "At 1st level, a blightseeker creates a special kind of alchemist bomb that delivers a payload of alchemically engineered fungal spores. These bombs infest their target with a virulent blight (see below). The blightseeker\u0027s bombs deal 1d4 points of damage (instead of 1d6), plus 1d4 points of damage for every 2 alchemist levels beyond 1st.\nA creature that takes a direct hit from a spore bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC \u003d 10 + half the blightseeker\u0027s level + his Intelligence modifier) or suffer the associated blight effects. Creatures that take splash damage from the bomb are not affected by the blight."
