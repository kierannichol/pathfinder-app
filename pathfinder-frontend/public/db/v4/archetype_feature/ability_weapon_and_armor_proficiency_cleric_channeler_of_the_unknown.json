She instead gains proficiency with one martial or exotic weapon, chosen when she first takes this archetype, which thereafter effectively functions as her holy or unholy symbol for the purposes of class abilities and spellcasting. The weapon chosen cannot be one associated with her former deity.\nOnce she makes this choice, she can\u0027t later change it."
