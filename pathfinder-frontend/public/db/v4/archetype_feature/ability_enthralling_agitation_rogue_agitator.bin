íAt 4th level, a agitator can captivate a crowd once per day, as per the spell enthrall (DC = 10 + 1/2 the agitator's rogue level + her Charisma modifier).
During the spell's effect, the agitator can attempt a DC 15 Charisma check to increase her individual or organizational influence with the members of the crowd by 1 rank or step. Or, if the crowd members' attitudes toward the agitator are indifferent or worse, this check can improve their attitudes by 1 step. The agitator can never use this ability to increase her individual or organization influence or improve the crowd's attitude by more than 2 ranks or steps.ª3
