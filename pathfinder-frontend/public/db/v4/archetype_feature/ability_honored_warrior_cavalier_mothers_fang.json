    "text": "A mother\u0027s fang is expected to act as a military leader in wartime and a governor in peace time, and as a result, he must be versed both in the martial and political arts. At 1st level, he gains Combat Expertise as a bonus feat, and if his Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the sole purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats that require Combat Expertise as a prerequisite.\nAt 2nd, 8th, and 15th levels, the mother\u0027s fang gains a vigilante social talent and a bonus combat feat. When selecting his vigilante social talent, a mother\u0027s fang can select celebrity discount, celebrity perks, great renown, incredible renown, instant recognition, loyal aid, renown, social grace, or triumphant return. He treats his cavalier level as his effective vigilante level when determining whether he meets a talent\u0027s prerequisites, as well as its effects. He gains the improved attitude and Intimidate bonuses from renown as if he were in both social and vigilante identities.\nWhen selecting skills with social grace, he must choose from the following list: Appraise, Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Knowledge (geography, history, local, or nobility), Perform, Profession (soldier), or Sense Motive.\nHe is always considered to be in his social identity for the purpose of social grace (though he continues to receive the benefits for both identities from renown). When selecting his bonus combat feat, he can choose from only combat feats that list Combat Expertise as a prerequisite."
