ÊA softstrike monk focuses on blows that do not inflict deadly harm. When a softstrike monk deals nonlethal damage with his unarmed strikes, his monk level is treated as 4 levels higher for the purposes of determining the damage he deals (to a maximum of 4d8 at 20th level for a Medium monk). When dealing lethal damage with his unarmed strikes, his monk level is treated as if it were 4 levels lower (minimum 1st level) for the purpose of determining damage.ª5
