êAt 2nd level, an energy scientist can siphon power from slain elementals into temporary alchemical weapons. While studying the remains of an elemental that has been dead for no longer than 1 minute per alchemist level, you can attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = 20 + the elemental's CR) as a standard action.
Success means the alchemist produces a number of canisters of alchemist's fire (from fire and magma elementals), bottled lightning (from air and lightning elementals), deadground dust (from earth and mud elementals), or liquid ice (from water and ice elementals) equal to half the elemental's CR, rounded down. These items cannot be sold and become inert after 24 hours. At 6th level, the save DCs of the items produced increase by 2.ª8
