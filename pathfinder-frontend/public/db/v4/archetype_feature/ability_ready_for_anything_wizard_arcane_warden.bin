ÐInstead of crafting magical items or learning ways to manipulate metamagic, arcane wardens prefer to spend their time providing safety and refuge for others. At 1st level, an arcane warden gains a bonus feat associated with aiding allies or providing shelter. At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the arcane warden gains an additional bonus feat. The arcane warden must qualify for any feat he takes, and must choose from the following list: Alertness, Endurance, Great Fortitude, Improved Great Fortitude, Leadership, Self-Sufficient, Skill Focus (Survival), Toughness, or any teamwork feat.ª6
