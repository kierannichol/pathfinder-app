ÔEach day when a planar rifter recovers grit, he can attune his grit pool to one of the following subtypes: air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water.
Whenever he is on a plane that has an alignment or elemental trait, he can switch his attunement to match one of that plane's traits as a standard action. After reducing an outsider to 0 hit points or below, he can switch his attunement to match one of that outsider's subtypes as a free action. He regains grit as normal from critical hits, but killing blows replenish his grit pool only if the target is an outsider.
This alters grit.
Deeds: A planar rifter gains the following deeds.
Infused Bullet (Su) At 1st level, a planar rifter's bullets carry the essence of a plane to which his grit pool is attuned, striking true against creatures that shrink from that plane's nature. As long as he has at least 1 point in his grit pool, he gains the following benefits: if he infuses his bullets with an alignment, his bullet's damage counts as that alignment for the purposes of overcoming DR; if he infuses his bullets with an element, half of his bullet's damage changes to an energy type determined by the element infused: acid (earth), cold (water), electricity (air), or fire (fire).
This deed replaces the deadeye deed.
Planar Surge (Su) At 7th level, a planar rifter can spend 1 grit point as a swift action to change the attunement of his grit pool to any alignment or element. This new attunement remains for 1 minute, after which time the grit pool becomes unattuned.
This deed replaces the dead shot deed.
Breaching Shot (Su) At 15th level, a planar rifter can fire bullets with such precision that he tears temporary rifts between planes. As a standard action, he can spend 3 grit points to shoot at a location within his firearm's first range increment and tear a 10-foot-radius portal to a plane of his choice. The rift leads to a random location on the plane that is between 5 and 500 miles from his intended destination, as plane shift. The rift remains open for 1 minute, during which time any number of willing creatures can pass through. It is a one-way rift, and it is insufficiently stable to reveal details about the environment on the other side.
This deed replaces the menacing shot deed.
Banishing Shot (Su) At 19th level, whenever a planar rifter confirms a critical hit against an extraplanar target, he can spend 1 grit to deal normal damage, and the target must succeed at a Will saving throw with a DC equal to 20 + the planar rifter's Wisdom modifier. On a failed saving throw, the target is returned to its original plane as per the banishment spell.ª4
