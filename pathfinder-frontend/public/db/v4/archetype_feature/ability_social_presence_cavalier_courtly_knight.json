    "text": "A courtly knight gains a +1 bonus on all Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks. At 4th level and every 4 cavalier levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 20th level). A courtly knight starts any verbal duel with an extra edge she can use for only the presence tactic unless she is at a significant or extreme disadvantage in the duel."
