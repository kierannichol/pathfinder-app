When she\u0027s using this ability, the selected spell\u0027s range becomes touch, and she must deliver the spell through the spirit animal via the spirit animal\u0027s deliver touch spells supernatural ability. The shaman\u0027s effective caster level for these spells is 2 higher than her normal caster level. The overseer can deliver any other spells via the deliver touch spells spirit animal ability."
