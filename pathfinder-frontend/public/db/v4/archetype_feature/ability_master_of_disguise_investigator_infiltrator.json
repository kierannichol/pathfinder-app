    "text": "At 1st level, an infiltrator can use disguise with great results. When disguising himself as a different gender, race, age category, or size category, an infiltrator reduces the penalties for each by –2. For example, if the infiltrator disguises himself as a female two age categories older than himself, he would take a –2 to the check instead of a –6. Also, an infiltrator can disguise himself with 1d3 minutes of work (instead of the normal 1d3 ? 10 minutes of work)."
