Fey Speecharchetype_featureclass_feature¢Ä
ÁAt 1st level, a feyspeaker's words carry a tiny fragment of the otherworldly power of the fey's voices. She gains Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, and Sense Motive as class skills. A feyspeaker also learns Sylvan as a bonus language. In addition, the feyspeaker gains a number of skill ranks at each level equal to 6 + her Intelligence modifier, instead of 4 + her Intelligence modifier. The feyspeaker's base attack bonus from her druid levels is equal to half her druid level (much like a sorcerer's base attack bonus is calculated), rather than the usual druid base attack bonus.ª*
