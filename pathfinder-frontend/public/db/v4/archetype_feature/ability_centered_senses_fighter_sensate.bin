ˆAt 5th level, a sensate can center his senses as a move action. While centered, a sensate gains a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and Will saves. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter. A sensate loses his centered state if he gains the confused, dazed, fascinated, staggered, or stunned condition; falls unconscious; or fails a Will save.ª.
