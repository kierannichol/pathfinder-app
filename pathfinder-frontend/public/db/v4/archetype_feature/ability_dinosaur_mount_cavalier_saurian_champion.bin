This mount functions as a cavalier's normal mount with the following adjustments: The saurian champion's mount must be a dinosaur. The saurian champion can ride mounts of his size category and larger, rather than only those of a larger size. Increase the mount's Strength score by 8 for the purpose of determining its carrying capacity. Whenever an ability or feat allows the saurian champion's mount to make a hoof attack, the mount can make a claw or bite attack instead.ª7
