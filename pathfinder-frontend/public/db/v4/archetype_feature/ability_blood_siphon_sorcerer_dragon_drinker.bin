 At 19th level, when the dragon drinker is within 60 feet of a creature of the dragon type that is suffering bleed damage, she can, as a swift action, draw a dose of its blood into herself as though she had consumed it from a vial. Additionally, when she consumes dragon's blood, it heals 3d8 points of damage and provides a +3 resistance bonus on Fortitude and Will saves for 1 minute in place of its normal effects.ª3
