´A skirmisher relies on his skills and the element of surprise rather than the heaviest shields and armor. He gains Acrobatics and Stealth as class skills. In addition, the skirmisher gains a number of skill ranks at each level equal to 4 + his Intelligence modifier, instead of 2 + his Intelligence modifier.ª5
