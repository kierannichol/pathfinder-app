    "text": "At 12th level, upon making a successful attack with a slashing or piercing weapon, the venomblade can spend a use of the ability granted by the Spit Venom feat as a swift action to spray his toxin into the wound. This imposes a â€“4 penalty on the victim\u0027s saving throw against the poison and causes the target to take 1d6 additional points of damage from all successful attacks for 1 round.\nThis is a poison effect."
