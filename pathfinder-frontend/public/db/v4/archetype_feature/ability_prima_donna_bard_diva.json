    "text": "At 2nd level, as her efforts to outdo her rivals increase, a Diva can spend additional rounds of bardic performance to augment countersong, deadly performance, fascinate, frightening tune, and scathing tirade (see below). When used, this ability gives her a +2 bonus on her Perform check or saving throw DC for those performances. The diva must spend an additional round of bardic performance for every round she uses prima donna to increase her Perform check result or saving throw DC."
