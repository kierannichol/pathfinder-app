šAt 8th level, a stonesinger causes the ground to shudder and buckle with his song. All enemies within 30 feet of the stonesinger must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the stonesinger's level + his Charisma bonus) when he begins a bardic performance or be knocked prone. Prone and flying creatures, as well as creatures with the earth glide universal monster ability, are unaffected by this performance.ª%
