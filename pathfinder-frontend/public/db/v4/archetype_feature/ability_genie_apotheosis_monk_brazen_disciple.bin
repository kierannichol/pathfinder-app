At 20th level, a brazen disciple is treated as a native outsider with the fire subtype rather than as a humanoid (or whatever the monk's creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. He has immunity to fire and vulnerability to cold. Once per day, the brazen disciple can grant a limited wish (as per the spell limited wish) to a non-outsider as a spell-like ability (CL 20th).ª4
