²At 19th level, a drunken master can take a drink and expel a gout of alcohol-fueled fire in a 30-foot cone. Creatures within the cone take 20d6 points of fire damage. A successful Reflex saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wis modifier) halves the damage. Using this ability is a standard action that consumes 4 ki points from the monk's ki pool. The monk must have at least 1 drunken ki point to use this ability.ª3
