    "text": "At 3rd level as a standard action, a swamp poisoner can smear the poison generated through the use of his toxic skin alternate racial trait onto the ground in a 5-foot area, instead of onto a weapon or his own body. The first creature other than the swamp poisoner to enter the area is exposed to the poison.\nThe poison loses its potency after 1 hour. This area is considered a trap, and the DCs of Perception checks to notice it and Disable Device checks to disable it are equal to 10 + half the swamp poisoner\u0027s level + the swamp poisoner\u0027s Constitution modifier.\nThe swamp poisoner also gains an extra use per day of his toxic skin alternate racial trait, plus one additional use per day for every 3 levels beyond 3rd."
