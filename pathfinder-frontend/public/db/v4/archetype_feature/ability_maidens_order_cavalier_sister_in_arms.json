    "text": "A sister-in-arms does not choose an order. Instead, she is considered to belong to both the order of the dragon and the order of the lion, and she gains all of the benefits of both orders (including additional class skills and conditional skill bonuses, additional challenge benefits, and order abilities) at the appropriate levels. At 1st level, a sister-in-arms chooses which order\u0027s edicts she must follow; generally, those of the fanged crown choose the order of the lion\u0027s edicts, while those of the scarlet rose choose the order of the dragon\u0027s edicts."
