âAt 2nd level, in place of a combat style feat, a poison darter can select any rogue talent that modifies sneak attacks or any alchemist discovery that modifies poisons he creates and applies, using his Wisdom modifier in place of his Intelligence modifier and his ranger level in place of his alchemist or rogue level for the purpose of meeting prerequisites. He can use the sticky poison discovery to apply a single dose of poison to two blowgun darts without reducing its potency.ª0
