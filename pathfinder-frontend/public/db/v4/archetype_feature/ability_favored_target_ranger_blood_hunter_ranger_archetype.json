    "text": "At 2nd level, as a move action, a blood hunter can declare a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table as the target of his hunt. The blood hunter then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type and a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against these creatures. A blood hunter can maintain these bonuses against only one creature type at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the blood hunter declares a new favored target or 1 hour passes, whichever comes first.\nAt 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks against this favored target increase by 1.\nAt 7th level, a blood hunter can declare a favored target as a move or swift action.\nFavored target is modified by any feat, spell, or effect that specifically works with the favored enemy ranger class feature. Additionally, the favored target ability always grants or uses a minimum of the blood hunter\u0027s full favored target bonus for the purposes of effects that use the value of the ranger\u0027s favored enemy bonus. For example, a blood hunter grants his full favored target bonus to his companion when using the hunter\u0027s bond class feature."
