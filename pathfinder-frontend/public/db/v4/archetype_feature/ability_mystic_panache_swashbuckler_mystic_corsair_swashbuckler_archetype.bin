ÇA mystic corsair regains panache only when she confirms a critical hit or makes a killing blow with a light or one-handed weapon from the monk weapon group. Additionally, the mystic corsair gains the ability to use a light or one-handed monk weapon for her swashbuckler class features, deeds, and feats, even if the weapon is not a piercing weapon, but she can't use other light or one-handed weapons with her class features or deeds.
This alters panache.ªP
