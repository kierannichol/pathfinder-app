ö	At 1st level, a Diva may choose a region where she is famous, and within that region, the locals are more likely to react favorably toward her. The bard gains a bonus on Bluff and Intimidate checks in that area and to influence people from that area.
At 1st level, this region is a settlement or settlements with a total population of 1,000 or fewer people, and the modifier on Bluff and Intimidate checks is +1. As the diva grows more famous, additional areas learn of her (typically places where she has lived or traveled, or settlements adjacent to those where she is known) and her bonuses apply to even more people. At 5th level, the region is a settlement or settlements with a total population of 5,000 or fewer people, and the modifier on Bluff and Intimidate checks is +2. At 9th level, the region is a settlement or settlements with a total population of up to 25,000 people, and the modifier on Bluff and Intimidate checks is +3. At 13th level, the region is a settlement or settlements with a total population of up to 100,000 people, and the modifier to Bluff and Intimidate is +4. At 17th level and above, the diva's renown has spread far, and most civilized folk know of her (GM's discretion); the diva's modifier on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks is +5.ª
