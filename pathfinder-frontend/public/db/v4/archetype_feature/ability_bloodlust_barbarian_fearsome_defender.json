    "text": "At 5th level, a fearsome defender\u0027s eagerness for bloodshed makes her quicker to act in a fight. She adds her Charisma modifier to initiative checks and always acts during the surprise round. If the fearsome defender is surprised during the surprise round, she acts last in that round and then determines initiative order normally for the remainder of combat."
