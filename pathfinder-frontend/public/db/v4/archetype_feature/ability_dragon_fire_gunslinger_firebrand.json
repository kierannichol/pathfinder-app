At 1st level, as a swift action, the firebrand can spend 1 grit point to add her Charisma modifier to the DCs of all dragon\u0027s breath cartridges she fires until the end of her turn. Her attacks with dragon\u0027s breath cartridges misfire only if a 1 is rolled on two or more of the damage dice."
