³Instead of relying on alchemical research to find clues, a spiritualist relies on communion with the world beyond death. At 1st level, a spiritualist gains the ability to use comprehend languages, detect secret doors, and identify, but each has a casting time of 1 minute, as the spiritualist needs to consult with the spirits of the dead that dwell in his area or that are somehow attached to him in some way. The spiritualist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his investigator level + his Wisdom modifier.
As he goes up in level, the spiritualist gains the ability to use other spells with the casting time as above. At 5th level, he can use augury. At 7th level, he can use speak with dead and locate object. At 9th level, he can use legend lore. Each of these requires one use of this ability.ª=
