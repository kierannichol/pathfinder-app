While the sword is flying in this way, the sword binder can monitor the area around the sword with clairaudience/clairvoyance as a swift action.\nThis ability can be used once per day at 10th level, and an additional time per day at 15th level and again at 20th level.\nThis ability can be used for 2 rounds per sword binder level each day."
