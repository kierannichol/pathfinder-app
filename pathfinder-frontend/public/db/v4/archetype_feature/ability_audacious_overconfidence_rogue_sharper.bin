øAt 4th level, after failing an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw, a sharper can reduce her saving throw bonus from lucky save by 1 for 24 hours in order to reroll the failed roll. She can use this ability once per day at 4th level, plus an additional time per day at 10th level and again at 16th level. The decreases to her bonus from lucky save stack with each other.ª5
