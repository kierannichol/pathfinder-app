ÈA gallant must belong to either the order of the blue rose, the order of the guard, the order of the lion, or the order of the sword. A gallant must also be of lawful good or neutral good alignment. A gallant who ceases to be lawful good or neutral good, or who violates his order's edicts, loses all class features except armor and weapon proficiencies until he restores his alignment or atones for his violation (see the atonement spell), as appropriate.ª1
