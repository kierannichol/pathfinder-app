    "text": "At 4th level, a fortune-finder can adapt and orient himself to new environments and new enemies. He gains a +1 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks whenever he is in a terrain he hasn\u0027t selected as one of his favored terrains. He leaves no trail and can\u0027t be tracked in any such terrain (though he can leave a trail if he so chooses).\nIn addition to this, the fortune-finder can study an opponent he can see as a move action. He then gains a bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, as well as on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The bonus is equal to half the fortune-seeker\u0027s highest favored enemy bonus. A fortune-finder can\u0027t attempt Knowledge checks untrained to identify an opponent he has studied with adaptable study. Bonuses from adaptable study don\u0027t stack with those from the favored enemy ability. The ranger can study only a single target at a time."
