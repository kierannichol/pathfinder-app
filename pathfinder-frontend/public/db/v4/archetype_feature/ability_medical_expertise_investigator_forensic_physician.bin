‘At 1st level, a forensic physician can use inspiration on any Heal checks without expending a use, if he is trained in the skill, but not on any Linguistics check.
If he later takes the expanded inspiration investigator talent, he can use inspiration on Linguistic checks without expending a use, if he is trained in the skill.
A forensic physician adds half his investigator level (minimum 1) on Heal checks. This bonus doubles on Heal checks to notice tampering with medical evidence, such as those used to defeat dress corpse.ª@
