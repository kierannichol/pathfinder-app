    "text": "At 9th level, a disciple of the forked tongue can use his performance to sow distrust into the mind of an enemy within 30 feet. An affected creature treats its allies as hostile for the purposes of their spells and abilities--it is never considered a willing target of spells and must attempt saving throws against them when possible, and it gains no benefit from allied bardic performances and other abilities that specifically target allies. For every 3 levels a disciple of the forked tongue has beyond 9th, he can target one additional enemy while using this performance (up to a maximum of four at 18th level)."
