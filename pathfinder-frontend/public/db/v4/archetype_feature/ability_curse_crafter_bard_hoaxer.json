    "text": "At 5th level, a hoaxer learns how to craft cursed items. He gains one item creation feat as a bonus feat at 5th level, plus an additional item creation feat every 6 levels thereafter. He can use these feats only to craft cursed items. In addition, he can craft items that appear magical but have no true magical properties--as if permanently affected by the magic aura spell--for 50 gp."
