    "text": "By combining traditional Green Faith chants and fey songs into his bardic performance, a cultivator gains the ability to affect a creature of the plant type with mind-affecting bardic performances. However, doing so requires the cultivator to expend 1 additional round of bardic performance each round he maintains a performance augmented by verdant voice."
