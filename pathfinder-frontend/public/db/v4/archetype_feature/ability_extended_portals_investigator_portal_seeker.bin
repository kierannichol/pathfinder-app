öAt 11th level, a portal seeker can spend 2 Portal Points to create two portals as a standard action, one in an adjacent square and one within 5 feet per investigator level she has in a visible location. These portals persist until the end of her next turn, and creatures of any size can step move through either, using 5 feet of movement to exit from the other portal. At the end of her next turn, she can spend an additional 2 Portal Points as a free action to extend the portals' duration by 1 round.ª:
