    "text": "At 12th level, a yokai hunter can attempt to shrug off the magical energies of a yokai. He gains a +4 insight bonus on saving throws to resist the spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of favored yokai. In addition, once per day as a standard action, a yokai hunter can shed an effect placed on him by a yokai as break enchantment, using his yokai hunter level as his caster level."
