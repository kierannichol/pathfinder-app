äAt 3rd level, a majordomo knows how to make just about any work task more efficient, from cleaning a great hall after a big party to crafting a magic item.
Whenever an ally begins a workday task such as Craft, Profession, magic item creation, spell research, managing a kingdom, using the downtime rules, or other similar tasks, the majordomo can spend one use of inspiration and 1 minute of planning to create a plan for that ally. If the ally chooses to follow the majordomo's plan and attempts the task on the same day, if the task would normally take at least 4 hours, it instead takes 30 minutes less time, and if the task would normally take at least 8 hours, it instead takes 1 hour less time.
If using the kingdom building rules, at 3rd level, the majordomo counts her Intelligence score as 2 higher when determining the bonus she provides in a kingdom leadership role.
Her effective Intelligence score increases by an additional 2 at 6th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter.ª6
