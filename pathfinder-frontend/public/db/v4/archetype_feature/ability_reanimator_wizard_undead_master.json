    "text": "An undead master adds the following spells to his spellbook at the given wizard levels: 1st--repair undead; 3rd--lesser animate dead; 5th--animate dead; 7th--undead anatomy I; 9th--create undead; 11th--undeath to death; 13th--create greater undead; 15th--undead anatomy IV; 17th--cursed earth. He can spontaneously cast any of these spells by sacrificing a prepared spell of the same level or higher. The undead master can cast lesser animate dead, animate dead, create undead, and create greater undead as if they were 1 level lower than their normal wizard spell level; this does not alter their level for the purpose of item crafting and the like."
