óAt 1st level, at will, an enlightened paladin can detect life forces as if he were using a paladin's detect evil class ability; however, instead of sensing evil creatures, he senses creatures that have a ki pool. Each such creature has an aura like a cleric of an aligned deity, and treats its current number of ki points as its Hit Dice for the purposes of this ability.ª;
