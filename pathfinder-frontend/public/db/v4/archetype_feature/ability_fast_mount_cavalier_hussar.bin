Fast Mountarchetype_featureclass_feature¢ı
úA hussar is able to spur on any mount that he rides to faster speeds than other riders. The base speed of any creature that the hussar is riding increases by 10 feet. This applies to all forms of movement that the mount possesses. At 5th level and every 5 cavalier levels thereafter, this bonus increases by an additional 5 feet (to a maximum increase of 30 feet at 20th level).ª)
