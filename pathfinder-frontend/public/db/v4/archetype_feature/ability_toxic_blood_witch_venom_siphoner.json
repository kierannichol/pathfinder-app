    "text": "At 6th level, the venom siphoner\u0027s blood becomes toxic, empowering her abilities. Any creature that deals bleed damage to her with a natural, light or one-handed weapon is automatically exposed to the same poison granted to her familiar and must succeed at the save or be affected by the poison. Additionally, when casting spells that have a single target and require a Fortitude save, she can cause the spell to deliver this poison as a free action; a target who succeeds at the save against the spell also avoids being affected by the poison. She can cause spells to deliver poison in this way a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. This ability refreshes when the venom siphoner communes with her familiar to prepare her daily spells."
