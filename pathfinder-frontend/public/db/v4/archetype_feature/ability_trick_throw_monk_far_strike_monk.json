    "text": "At 11th level, a far strike monk can infuse his thrown weapons with ki to hit targets that he might otherwise miss. By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, the far strike monk can ignore concealment. By spending 2 points, he can ignore total concealment or cover. By spending 3 points, he can ignore total cover, even throwing weapons around corners. The weapon must still be able to reach the target; for instance, a target inside a closed building with no open doors or windows cannot be attacked using Trick Throw. These effects last for 1 round."
