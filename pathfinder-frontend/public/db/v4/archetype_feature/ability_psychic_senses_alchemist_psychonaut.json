    "text": "At 8th level, a psychonaut adds clairaudience/clairvoyance, detect scrying, scrying, and speak with dead to his formula book as 3rd-level extracts (a scrying extract does not require a focus or divine focus component). When a psychonaut uses a speak with dead extract, he gains the power to hear the lingering spirit within a corpse rather than enabling the corpse to audibly speak, but the extract otherwise works as the spell.\nThis ability replaces poison resistance +6."
