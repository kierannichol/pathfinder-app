    "text": "At 11th level, when the toxophilite takes a full-attack action with a ranged weapon, she can choose to forgo one of her attacks. If she does so, she can use her intercept arrow ability as an immediate action instead of a readied action at any time before her next turn. Her attack roll to intercept uses the same bonuses as the attack she chose to forgo during her previous action."
