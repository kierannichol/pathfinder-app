    "text": "At 8th level, a pureblade gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting spells and effects. This bonus increases to +4 at 12th level and +6 at 16th level. In addition, once per day as a standard action, a pureblade can shed a magical effect placed on him by an aberration as break enchantment, using his slayer level as his caster level. A pureblade can use this ability twice per day at 12th level and three times per day at 16th level."
