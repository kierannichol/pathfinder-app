If the number of grit points to perform a deed is reduced to 0, the gunslinger can perform this deed as long as she has at least 1 grit point.

Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it\u0027s worth 4d10 gp when sold).

Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it\u0027s more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger\u0027s ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.Critical Hit with a Firearm: Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger\u0027s character level does not restore grit.Killing Blow with a Firearm: When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger\u0027s character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.","effects":[{"adjustState":{"level":1,"key":"ability:grit#gunslinger","delta":1}}]},{"id":"ability:bonus_feat#gunslinger","name":"Bonus Feat","descriptionText":"At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement.

Furthermore, when she misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value of that firearm increases by 2 instead of 4.
