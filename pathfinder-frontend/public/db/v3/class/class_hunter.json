Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter\u0027s minutes of duration per day--it remains in effect until the hunter changes it.

If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the companion\u0027s statistics and abilities.

The animal companion can use skirmisher tricks when commanded, a number of times per day equal to half its Hit Dice plus its Wisdom modifier.If a hunter releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. While the hunter\u0027s animal companion is dead, any animal she summons with a summon nature\u0027s ally spell remains for 1 minute per level instead of 1 round per level.
