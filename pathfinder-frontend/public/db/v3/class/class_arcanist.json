The arcanist\u0027s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist\u0027s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist\u0027s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist\u0027s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell\u0027s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.","effects":[{"adjustState":{"level":1,"key":"ability:arcane_reservoir#arcanist","delta":1}}]},{"id":"ability:consume_spells#arcanist","name":"Consume Spells","descriptionText":"At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a move action, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell.

Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way.
