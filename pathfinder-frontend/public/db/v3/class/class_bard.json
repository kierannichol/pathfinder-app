{"id":"class:bard","name":"Bard","children":[{"id":"ability:bardic_performance#bard","name":"Bardic Performance","descriptionText":"A bard is trained to use the Perform skill to create magical effects on those around him, including himself if desired. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Charisma modifier. At each level after 1st a bard can use bardic performance for 2 additional rounds per day. Each round, the bard can produce any one of the types of bardic performance that he has mastered, as indicated by his level.Starting a bardic performance is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. Changing a bardic performance from one effect to another requires the bard to stop the previous performance and start a new one as a standard action. A bardic performance cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the bard is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. A bard cannot have more than one bardic performance in effect at one time.At 7th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a swift action.Each bardic performance has audible components, visual components, or both.If a bardic performance has audible components, the targets must be able to hear the bard for the performance to have any effect, and many such performances are language dependent (as noted in the description). A deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with an audible component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to bardic performances with audible components.If a bardic performance has a visual component, the targets must have line of sight to the bard for the performance to have any effect. A blind bard has a 50% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with a visual component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Blind creatures are immune to bardic performances with visual components.List of Bardic Performances:","effects":[{"adjustState":{"level":1,"key":"ability:bardic_performance#bard","delta":1}}]},{"id":"ability:deadly_performance#bard","name":"Deadly Performance","effects":[{"adjustState":{"level":1,"key":"ability:deadly_performance#bard","delta":1}}]},{"id":"ability:frightening_tune#bard","name":"Frightening Tune","effects":[{"adjustState":{"level":1,"key":"ability:frightening_tune#bard","delta":1}}]},{"id":"ability:mass_suggestion#bard","name":"Mass Suggestion","effects":[{"adjustState":{"level":1,"key":"ability:mass_suggestion#bard","delta":1}}]},{"id":"ability:cantrips#bard","name":"Cantrips","descriptionText":"Bard\u0027s learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table: Bard Spells Known under â€œSpells Known.\" These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.","effects":[{"adjustState":{"level":1,"key":"ability:cantrips#bard","delta":1}}]},{"id":"ability:bardic_knowledge#bard","name":"Bardic Knowledge","descriptionText":"A bard adds half his class level (minimum 1) to all Knowledge skill checks and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained.","effects":[{"adjustState":{"level":1,"key":"ability:bardic_knowledge#bard","delta":1}}]},{"id":"ability:well_versed#bard","name":"Well-versed","descriptionText":"At 2nd level, the bard becomes resistant to the bardic performance of others, and to sonic effects in general.
