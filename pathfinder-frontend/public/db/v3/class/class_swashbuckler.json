She fights with panache: a fluctuating measure of a swashbuckler\u0027s ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a swashbuckler gains a number of panache points equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Her panache goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Charisma modifier (minimum 1), though feats and magic items can affect this maximum. A swashbuckler spends panache to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains panache in the following ways.","effects":[{"adjustState":{"level":1,"key":"ability:panache#swashbuckler","delta":1}}]},{"id":"ability:nimble#swashbuckler","name":"Nimble","descriptionText":"At 3rd level, a swashbuckler gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor.

In effect, the swashbuckler loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability.
