)ability:fast_movement#unchained_barbarianFast Movement¢éA barbarian's base speed is faster than the norm for her race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's base speed.ª1/)ability:fast_movement#unchained_barbarian"…
 ability:rage#unchained_barbarianRage¢®A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. At 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. For each level after 1st she possesses, the barbarian can rage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as that gained from bear's endurance, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter a rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.While in a rage, a barbarian gains a +2 bonus on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and Will saving throws. In addition, she takes a â€“2 penalty to Armor Class. She also gains 2 temporary hit points per Hit Die. These temporary hit points are lost first when a character takes damage, disappear when the rage ends, and are not replenished if the barbarian enters a rage again within 1 minute of her previous rage. While in a rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skill (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration (such as spellcasting).A barbarian can end her rage as a free action, and is fatigued for 1 minute after a rage ends. A barbarian can't enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter a rage multiple times per day. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends.ª(& ability:rage#unchained_barbarian"·
(ability:danger_sense#unchained_barbarianDanger Sense¢ÈAt 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (if the barbarian has trap sense from another class).ª0.(ability:danger_sense#unchained_barbarian"ˆ
&ability:rage_power#unchained_barbarian
Rage Power¢ŸAs a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the barbarian gains a rage power. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging. Some of these powers are always active during a rage, and others require the barbarian to take an action to use them. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.ª.,&ability:rage_power#unchained_barbarian"Ç
2ability:improved_uncanny_dodge#unchained_barbarianImproved Uncanny Dodge¢ºAt 5th level, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least 4 more levels in a class that provides sneak attack than the barbarian has barbarian levels.If the barbarian also has uncanny dodge from another class, levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the barbarian.ª:82ability:improved_uncanny_dodge#unchained_barbarian"Ñ
,ability:indomitable_will#unchained_barbarianIndomitable Will¢ÖAt 14th level, the barbarian gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while raging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she gains during her rage.ª42,ability:indomitable_will#unchained_barbarian"í
(ability:greater_rage#unchained_barbarianGreater Rage¢þAt 11th level, a barbarian's bonus on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and Will saves while raging increases to +3. In addition, the amount of temporary hit points gained when entering a rage increases to 3 per Hit Die.ª0.(ability:greater_rage#unchained_barbarian"Â
,ability:damage_reduction#unchained_barbarianDamage Reduction¢ÇAt 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Each time the barbarian takes damage from a weapon or natural attack, subtract 1 from the damage taken. At 10th level and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction rises by 1 point (up to 5 points at 19th level). Damage Reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.ª42,ability:damage_reduction#unchained_barbarian"°
)ability:tireless_rage#unchained_barbarianTireless Rage¢¾At 17th level, a barbarian is no longer fatigued at the end of her rage. If she enters a rage again within 1 minute of ending a rage, she doesn't gain any temporary hit points from her rage.ª1/)ability:tireless_rage#unchained_barbarian"ê
'ability:mighty_rage#unchained_barbarianMighty Rage¢þAt 20th level, a barbarian's bonus on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and Will saves while raging increases to +4. In addition, the amount of temporary hit points gained when entering a rage increases to 4 per Hit Die.ª/-'ability:mighty_rage#unchained_barbarian"Í
)ability:uncanny_dodge#unchained_barbarianUncanny Dodge¢ÛAt 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.ª1/)ability:uncanny_dodge#unchained_barbarian¢¡Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.ª
