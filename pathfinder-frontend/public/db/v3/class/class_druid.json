This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –4 penalty on the check.","effects":[{"adjustState":{"level":1,"key":"ability:wild_empathy#druid","delta":1}}]},{"id":"ability:resist_natures_lure#druid","name":"Resist Nature\u0027s Lure","descriptionText":"Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey.

Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the beast shape I spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn\u0027t provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains in levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily usage of this ability, regardless of the form taken.At 6th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid\u0027s wild shape now functions as beast shape II. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid\u0027s wild shape functions as elemental body I.At 8th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid\u0027s wild shape now functions as beast shape III. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid\u0027s wild shape now functions as elemental body II. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid\u0027s wild shape functions as plant shape I.At 10th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid\u0027s wild shape now functions as elemental body III. When taking the form of a plant, the druid\u0027s wild shape now functions as plant shape II.At 12th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature.
