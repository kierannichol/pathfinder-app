He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized. A skald with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.If a skald already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.","effects":[{"adjustState":{"level":1,"key":"ability:uncanny_dodge#skald","delta":1}}]},{"id":"ability:spell_kenning#skald","name":"Spell Kenning","descriptionText":"At 5th level, a skald is learned in the magic of other spellcasters, and can use his own magic to duplicate those classes\u0027 spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald spells known, expending a skald spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a spell with spell kenning always has a minimum casting time of 1 full round, regardless of the casting time of the spell.At 11th level, a skald can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, he can use this ability three times per day.","effects":[{"adjustState":{"level":1,"key":"ability:spell_kenning#skald","delta":1}}]},{"id":"ability:raging_song#skald","name":"Raging Song","descriptionText":"A skald is trained to use music, oration, and similar performances to inspire his allies to feats of strength and ferocity. At 1st level, a skald can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each level thereafter, he can use raging song for 2 additional rounds per day.Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard\u0027s bardic performance special ability for any effect that affects bardic performances. A skald may learn bard masterpieces.A raging song has audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs.If a raging song affects allies, when the skald begins a raging song and at the start of each ally\u0027s turn in which they can hear the raging song, the skald\u0027s allies must decide whether to accept or refuse its effects. This is not an action. Unconscious allies automatically accept the song. If accepted, the raging song\u0027s effects last for that ally\u0027s turn or until the song ends, whichever comes first.At 7th level, a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action instead.","effects":[{"adjustState":{"level":1,"key":"ability:raging_song#skald","delta":1}}]},{"id":"ability:improved_uncanny_dodge#skald","name":"Improved Uncanny Dodge","descriptionText":"At 8th level and higher, a skald can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the skald by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the target has skald levels.If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the character.","effects":[{"adjustState":{"level":1,"key":"ability:improved_uncanny_dodge#skald","delta":1}}]},{"id":"ability:rage_power#skald","name":"Rage Power","descriptionText":"At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power that affects the skald and any allies under the influence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual rage power more than once.When starting an inspired rage, the skald chooses which rage powers (if any) to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of these rage powers, using the skald\u0027s level as their effective barbarian level. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers that require a minimum barbarian level. If the rage power\u0027s effects depend on the skald\u0027s ability modifier (such as lesser spirit totem), affected allies use the skald\u0027s ability modifier instead of their own for the purposes of this effect.If a rage power requires another rage power (such as disruptive, which requires superstition), the skald cannot grant that rage power to allies unless he can also grant that power\u0027s prerequisite. He may add multiple rage powers to an inspired rage at the same time using this ability (such as granting superstition and disruptive simultaneously).If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per day or per rage (such as renewed vigor), each ally affected by the inspired rage song is subject to that limit (with once per rage abilities limited to once per inspired rage).If the skald has rage powers from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during an inspired rage. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times.If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage as well.","effects":[{"adjustState":{"level":1,"key":"ability:rage_power#skald","delta":1}}]},{"id":"ability:master_skald#skald","name":"Master Skald","descriptionText":"At 20th level, a skald\u0027s inspired rage no longer gives allies a penalty to AC, nor limits what skills or abilities they can use.
