ability:fourth_aspect#shifterFourth Aspect¢âAt 1st level, a shifter gains her first aspect--a category of animal to which her body and soul have become supernaturally attuned. She can shift into her aspect's minor form (see Aspects) for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Shifting into a minor form is a swift action, while ending the effect is a free action that can be taken only on the shifter's turn. Until a shifter reaches 9th level and gains the chimeric aspect class feature, she can assume only one minor form at a time. Shifting to a new aspect (or aspects, in the case of chimeric aspects or greater chimeric aspects) ends all minor forms currently manifested. The minor forms of aspects are not polymorph effects, and the shifter does not lose the benefits of a minor form while affected by polymorph effects.As the shifter gains levels, she gains more aspects; she gains her second aspect at 5th level, a third aspect at 10th level, and a fourth at 15th level.™%#ability:fourth_aspect#shifter"‡

Wild Shape¢ÓThe ability details below have been updated based on this FAQ entry.At 4th level, a shifter gains the ability to turn herself into the major form of one of her aspects and back again. This ability functions as beast shape II, except as noted here. The shifter can turn into the major form of only one of her aspects at a time. Using wild shape to change to a major form or back is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Often a particular aspect's major form grants abilities beyond the normal effect of beast shape II. Each major form details the abilities the shifter gains with that major form and at what level; she gains these instead of the form abilities from beast shape II, but she still gains beast shape II abilities that are size dependent.A shifter loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal of that form can make, but she can communicate with other animals of the same general grouping as her form. She can also communicate in nonverbal ways with allies.A shifter can use wild shape for a number of hours each day equal to her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier.

Both a devoted defender of druidic circles and a fierce predator, the shifter can take on the forms of nature and even fuse them together with devastating effect and unbridled savagery. By way of the druidic discipline of wild shape, they become living aspects of the wild. At first, they are able to assume only a minor aspect, but with time and practice they can fully transform into ever more powerful forms. The shifter class offers players a way to experience a shapeshifting character that is more martially inclined than a spellcasting druid. With each new level, the shifter‚Äôs powers grow in new and surprising ways, creating a character that thrives in battle, exploration, and stealth. Shifters are protectors of druidic circles and avengers of nature, yet a shifter‚Äôs magic is different from that of her druidic kin. Rather than invoking spells from the natural world or forging alliances with animals, shifters focus their supernatural powers inward to gain control over their own forms. Their ability to change their forms is as varied as the wonders of the wilds themselves but always remains at least partially rooted in the natural world. There are many paths to becoming a shifter; most are trained in that role by druidic circles and have their powers unlocked via rituals of initiation. Yet some stumble upon the gift naturally, as if their blood bore the secrets of shifter transformation. For those leaning toward the causes of law and good, the path of the shifter is one of contemplation and understanding. They become one with nature through mental and physical mimicry and gain an ever deeper spiritual understanding of the ebb and flow of the natural world. Those leaning toward the chaotic and evil teachings of druidic philosophy find such enlightenment through more violent means. These are typically quicker transformations, both brutal and painful, imparting the dark lessons of nature through its most catastrophic forms. Shifters who lean toward true neutrality are the most diverse when it comes to their command of metamorphic secrets. Role: The shifter is so attuned to nature and the wild beasts of the world that she can call upon those powers to mystically fortify her being. Fluid in form and function, she can shape herself to overcome hardships and support those she befriends or serves. Alignment: Any neutral. Hit Die: d10. Starting Wealth: 3d6x10 gp (average 105 gp). Class Skills The shifter‚Äôs class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).

Weapon and Armor Proficiency A shifter is proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. She is also proficient with the natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) from the shifter claws class feature and of forms she assumes with wild shape. Shifters are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor. A shifter can wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as if it were steel. Shifters are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood. A shifter who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to use her shifter aspect, shifter claws, wild shape, and other shifter supernatural or spell-like abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter. Bonus Languages A shifter‚Äôs bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures, and Aklo, the tongue spoken by certain sinister fey or otherworldly denizens of reaches of the wild rarely explored by humanity. These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race. A shifter speaks Druidic, a secret language known only to druids and shifters, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level shifter. Druidic is a free language for a shifter; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages, and it doesn‚Äôt take up a language slot. Shifters are forbidden to teach this language to non-druids or non-shifters. For the purposes of teaching and learning the Druidic language, shifters are considered to be druids‚Äîthe nuances of the language are instrumental in teaching characters of both classes to use and control their abilities. While the rare druidic circle might bar shifters from its order, and while some eccentric shifters may view druids as competitors or even enemies, all shifters are assumed to speak it. Shifter Aspect (Su) At 1st level, a shifter gains her first aspect‚Äîa category of animal to which her body and soul have become supernaturally attuned. She can shift into her aspect‚Äôs minor form (see Aspects) for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Shifting into a minor form is a swift action, while ending the effect is a free action that can be taken only on the shifter‚Äôs turn. Until a shifter reaches 9th level and gains the chimeric aspect class feature, she can assume only one minor form at a time. Shifting to a new aspect (or aspects, in the case of chimeric aspects or greater chimeric aspects) ends all minor forms currently manifested. The minor forms of aspects are not polymorph effects, and the shifter does not lose the benefits of a minor form while affected by polymorph effects. As the shifter gains levels, she gains more aspects; she gains her second aspect at 5th level, a third aspect at 10th level, and a fourth at 15th level. Shifter Claws (Su) At will, a shifter in her natural form can extend her claws as a swift action to use as a weapon. This magical transformation is fueled as much by the shifter‚Äôs faith in the natural world as it is by inborn talent. The claws on each hand can be used as a primary natural attack, dealing 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if she is Small). If she uses one of her claw attacks in concert with a weapon held in the other hand, the claw acts as a secondary natural attack instead. As the shifter gains levels, the power of her claws increases. At 3rd level, her claws count as magic weaponsSOURCE, ignore DR/cold iron and DR/silver. At 7th level, her claw damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small). At 11th level, her claw damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small). At 13th level, her claw damage increases to 1d10 (1d8 if Small). At 17th level, the damage die does not increase, but the critical multiplier becomes √ó3. Lastly, at 19th level, the claws ignore DR/adamantine and DR/‚Äî. While a shifter uses wild shape to assume her aspect‚Äòs major form, her natural attacks gain the same benefits granted by her shifter claws ability. If the form she takes has claw attacks, she can use either the base damage of her shifter claws or the damage of the form‚Äôs claws, whichever is greater. If the form does not have claw attacks, she can choose up to two natural attacks that would deal less damage than her shifter claw damage and have those attacks instead deal the same damage as her shifter claws. Alternate Natural Attacks A shifter can draw on her chosen animal aspect to transform her hands into deadly weapons, as represented by the shifter‚Äôs claws class feature, but not every animal has prominent claws. The following list provides alternate natural attacks for the shifter claws class feature. Each time the shifter activates her shifter‚Äôs claws ability in her natural form, she can manifest one of the alternate natural attacks listed below for any of her chosen aspects, or those that relate to her archetype. Each alternate natural attack replaces one of the shifter‚Äôs claw attacks. The shifter can gain up to two different alternate natural attacks with this method.

In some cases, a capstone specifies what ability it replaces. A character can‚Äôt select an alternative capstone if she has previously traded away her class capstone via an archetype. Clerics and wizards can receive a capstone at 20th level, despite not having one to begin with. Flexible Form (Su) At 20th level, the shifter has control over her bodies down to the finest details. When the shifter uses wild shape, she gains a total of a +6 bonus to her physical ability scores, which she can distribute as she likes each time she shifts. For example, she can gain a +4 bonus to Strength and a +2 bonus to Dexterity, and the next time she shifts she can instead gain a +6 bonus to Constitution. Aspects A shifter draws her primary strength from an association with a specific type of animal. As a result, when a shifter uses her shifter aspect or wild shape class features, she can assume only the forms of her chosen aspects. Until reaching 5th level, a shifter has only a single aspect, but as she increases in level, she gains more control over her metamorphosis, allowing her to take on multiple aspects and even merge aspects. All shifter aspects have a minor form and a major form. The minor form grants a shifter a few of the animal‚Äôs physical traits, while the major aspect is the form she takes on when she uses wild shape to fully transform into an animal. The list of abilities gained with the major aspect include those gained from the wild shape class feature, but the benefits gained from any resulting changes to size are not listed here (see beast shape II). If the creature has no listed base land speed, use 30 feet as the base land speed. The following options represent only the most common choices used by shifters. Other aspects based on different animals certainly exist, and might grant similar powers or entirely new abilities based on the animal‚Äôs themes and nature.

When she reaches 5th level and takes this favored class option again, her base speed becomes 35 feet. This bonus applies only when the shifter is wearing no armor. PRG:UW Gathlain: Add a +1 bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks relating to plants and flying animals. Source PPC:WO Ghoran: Add 1/5 to the shifter‚Äôs natural armor bonus when using wild shape to assume a major form. PRG:UW Gnome: Gain energy resistance 1 against acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Each time the shifter selects this reward, increase that energy resistance by 1, to a maximum of energy resistance 10. Once the gnome reaches energy resistance 10, she can select a new type of energy to build her resistance to the next time she selects this favored class option. PRG:UW Grippli: Add a +1 bonus on Survival checks to follow tracks through swamps. Source PPC:WO Half-Elf: Add a +1/2 bonus on Survival checks to get along in the wild, to avoid getting lost, and to avoid all natural hazards. PRG:UW Half-Orc: Add a +1/3 bonus on critical hit confirmation rolls when using shifter claws (maximum bonus of +5). This bonus does not stack with Critical Focus. PRG:UW Halfling: Increase the AC bonus from defensive instinct by 1/4 against creatures of size Large or larger. PRG:UW Human: Add 1/3 to the number of minutes the shifter can assume her minor form each day PRG:UW Kitsune: Add 1/4 to the number of minutes the shifter can assume her minor form each day. Source PPC:WO Kobold: Add a +1/4 bonus on Stealth checks while in the shifter‚Äôs minor or major form. Source PPC:WO Orc: Add 1/5 to the damage dealt when using the shifter claws ability. Source PPC:WO Ratfolk: Add a +1 bonus on wild empathy checks to influence animals and magical beasts that live underground. Source PPC:WO Tiefling: Add a +1 bonus on wild empathy checks to improve the attitude of fiendish creatures.
