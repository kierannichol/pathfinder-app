Lastly, once a poison is identified, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC \u003d the poison\u0027s saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison. Success renders the dose harmless.

The damage is 1d6 at 4th level, and increases by 1d6 for every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 9d6 at 20th level). The damage of studied strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to studied strike.If the investigator\u0027s attack used a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), he may choose to have the additional damage from studied strike be nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. If the investigator chose to make an attack with a lethal weapon instead deal nonlethal damage (with the usual â€“4 penalty), the studied strike damage may also deal nonlethal damage.The investigator must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot.

At 4th level, an investigator can use a move action to study a single enemy that he can see. Upon doing so, he adds 1/2 his investigator level as an insight bonus on melee attack rolls and as a bonus on damage rolls against the creature. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.An investigator can only have one target of studied combat at a time, and once a creature has become the target of an investigator\u0027s studied combat, he cannot become the target of the same investigator\u0027s studied combat again for 24 hours unless the investigator expends one use of inspiration when taking the move action to use this ability.","effects":[{"adjustState":{"level":1,"key":"ability:studied_combat#investigator","delta":1}}]},{"id":"ability:alchemy#investigator","name":"Alchemy","descriptionText":"Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potion-like extracts.When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator\u0027s level as the caster level.An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on Table: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator\u0027s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping--an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant--comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.An investigator uses the alchemist formulae list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formulae he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract\u0027s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator\u0027s extract is equal to 10 + the extract\u0027s level + the investigator\u0027s Intelligence modifier.An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1st-level formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modifier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook. An investigator can study a wizard\u0027s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator\u0027s or an alchemist\u0027s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.","effects":[{"adjustState":{"level":1,"key":"ability:alchemy#investigator","delta":1}}]},{"id":"ability:poison_immunity#investigator","name":"Poison Immunity","descriptionText":"At 2nd level, an investigator gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison.

The investigator has an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his investigator level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). An investigator\u0027s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night\u0027s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use inspiration once per check or roll. The investigator can use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he\u0027s trained in the skill.Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of inspiration each time from the investigator\u0027s pool.
