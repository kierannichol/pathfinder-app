    "text": "At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk\u0027s robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist."
