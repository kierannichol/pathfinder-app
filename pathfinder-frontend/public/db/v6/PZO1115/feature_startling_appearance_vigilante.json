    "text": "At 5th level, a vigilante learns to use the element of surprise to his advantage, startling foes that are unaware of his presence. Whenever a vigilante with this ability attempts an attack against a foe that is completely unaware of the vigilante\u0027s presence (usually due to Stealth or invisibility), the foe is treated as flat-footed for the rest of the vigilante\u0027s turn (uncanny dodge or a similar ability prevents this effect unless the vigilante is at least 4 levels higher than the foe with uncanny dodge).The foe also takes a â€“4 penalty on attacks made against the vigilante until the start of the vigilante\u0027s next turn."
