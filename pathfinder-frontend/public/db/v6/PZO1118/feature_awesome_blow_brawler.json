    "text": "At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler\u0027s choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can\u0027t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent\u0027s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)"
