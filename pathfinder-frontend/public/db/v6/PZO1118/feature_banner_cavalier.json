    "text": "At 5th level, a cavalier\u0027s banner becomes a symbol of inspiration to his allies and companions. As long as the cavalier\u0027s banner is clearly visible, all allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made as part of a charge. At 10th level, and every five levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by +1. The banner must be at least Small or larger and must be carried or displayed by the cavalier or his mount to function."
