ÁThis ability has been added based on this FAQ entry.After attaining 18th level, a shifter no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the shifter still dies of old age when her time is up.ª
