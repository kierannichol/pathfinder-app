It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. An alchemist can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time--if he brews a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. As with an extract or bomb, a mutagen that is not in an alchemist\u0027s possession becomes inert until an alchemist picks it up again.When an alchemist brews a mutagen, he selects one physical ability score--either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It\u0027s a standard action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes the alchemist to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting him a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for 10 minutes per alchemist level. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist takes a –2 penalty to one of his mental ability scores. If the mutagen enhances his Strength, it applies a penalty to his Intelligence. If it enhances his Dexterity, it applies a penalty to his Wisdom. If it enhances his Constitution, it applies a penalty to his Charisma.A non-alchemist who drinks a mutagen must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the alchemist\u0027s level + the alchemist\u0027s Intelligence modifier) or become nauseated for 1 hour--a non-alchemist can never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but an alchemist can gain the effects of another alchemist\u0027s mutagen if he drinks it. (Although if the other alchemist creates a different mutagen, the effects of the “stolen\" mutagen immediately cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not stack. Whenever an alchemist drinks a mutagen, the effects of any previous mutagen immediately end.",

Bombs are unstable, and if not used in the round they are created, they degrade and become inert--their method of creation prevents large volumes of explosive material from being created and stored. In order to create a bomb, the alchemist must use a small vial containing an ounce of liquid catalyst--the alchemist can create this liquid catalyst from small amounts of chemicals from an alchemy lab, and these supplies can be readily refilled in the same manner as a spellcaster\u0027s component pouch. Most alchemists create a number of catalyst vials at the start of the day equal to the total number of bombs they can create in that day--once created, a catalyst vial remains usable by the alchemist for years.Drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb requires a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Thrown bombs have a range of 20 feet and use the Throw Splash Weapon special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as Point-Blank Shot and Weapon Focus. On a direct hit, an alchemist\u0027s bomb inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage + additional damage equal to the alchemist\u0027s Intelligence modifier.

Splash damage from an alchemist bomb is always equal to the bomb\u0027s minimum damage (so if the bomb would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage on a direct hit, its splash damage would be 6 points of fire damage). Those caught in the splash damage can attempt a Reflex save for half damage.
