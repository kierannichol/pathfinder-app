  "description": "You transmute blood in the target\u0027s body to acid, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage/2 levels (maximum 12d6) each round.  The creature is staggered and sickened by the debilitating pain. A successful Fortitude save each round halves the damage and negates the staggered condition for 1 round. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 or fewer hit points, it dissolves, leaving only the barest trace of remains. A dissolved creature\u0027s equipment is unaffected.  Anyone who strikes the target with a non-reach melee weapon, natural weapon, or unarmed attack takes 3d6 points of acid damage as the acidic blood sprays on the attacker. If the attack is from a piercing or slashing manufactured weapon, the weapon also takes this damage.  This spell has no effect on creatures immune to critical hits or bleed effects.",
