You can change each of the following four auras with one casting of aura alteration.  Alignment Aura: You can change the target's apparent alignment to thwart spells that detect alignment, such as detect evil. You can alter the alignment by up to one step on each alignment axis, but can't make the creature appear to have a diametrically opposed alignment. For instance, you couldn't make a lawful evil character appear to be chaotic or good. You can also adjust the power of the alignment aura up or down in level by a number of steps equal to 1/2 your level or fewer.  Emotion Aura: Your manipulations mask the true emotions  of the target, instead depicting any combination of colors on the emotional spectrum that you wish. Creatures attempting Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Sense Motive checks against the target receive no bonuses on their checks based on information gleaned from the target's aura.  Health Aura: You adulterate the target's aura to mask the condition of its physical body, revealing instead a wounded status, poison or disease status, and conditions of your choice. You likewise mask the target's available ki points or similar resources, manipulating its aura to suggest any number within the range normally available to the target.  Magic Aura: You alter a creature or item's magic aura so that it registers to detect magic (and spells with similar capabilities, like analyze aura) as though it were nonmagical, a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify. A single casting of aura alteration is sufficient to mask all of the magic auras on the target. If an object bearing aura alteration has identify cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes the aura is false and detects the object's actual qualities if he succeeds at a Will save. If a targeted item's own aura is overwhelming, aura alteration can't alter it.zA
