  "description": "A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the creature is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere.  The sphere contains its subject for the spell\u0027s duration. The sphere functions as a wall of force, except that it can be negated by dispel magic. A subject inside the sphere can breathe normally.  The sphere cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.",
