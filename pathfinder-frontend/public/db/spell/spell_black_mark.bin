Black Mark"
necromancy2Bone creatureR	permanentb‹You mark the target with a black marking on its skin; the mark's exact appearance determined by you, but can be no larger than your hand. The black mark functions as a mark of justice, and when the mark is activated, the target becomes shaken anytime it is on or in the water more than a 5 feet from shore. In addition, as long as the black mark is active, the target is affected as if subject to nature's exile (Advanced Player's Guide 233), but all creatures with the aquatic or water subtype or with a swim speed are made hostile, even those not of the animal type, though non-aquatic animals are not.z
