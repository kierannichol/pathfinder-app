The target's actual alignment is not changed, but spells like detect evil or detect good detect only the aura, not the creature's actual alignment. For the duration of this spell, effects influenced by the target's alignment function according to the imposed aura, not the creature's actual aura. When the spell ends, the target's aura returns to normal, and alignmentaffecting magic affects it according to its actual alignment.z
