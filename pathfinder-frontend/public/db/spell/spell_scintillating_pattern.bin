The spell affects a total number of HD of creatures equal to your caster level (maximum 20).

HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. The spell affects each subject according to its HD.  6 or less: Unconscious for 1d4 rounds, then stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then confused for 1d4 rounds. (Treat an unconscious result as stunned for nonliving creatures.) 7 to 12: Stunned for 1d4 rounds, then confused for an additional 1d4 rounds.  13 or more: Confused for 1d4 rounds.  Sightless creatures are not affected by scintillating pattern.z
