Water can be created in an area as small as will actually contain the liquid, or in an area three times as large--possibly creating a downpour or filling many small receptacles. This water disappears after 1 day if not consumed.  Note: Conjuration spells can't create substances or objects within a creature. Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.z
