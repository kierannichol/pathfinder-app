necromancy2:30-ft.-radius emanationRconcentration + 2 roundsb¿You create a spectral choir and conduct its tortured, ghostly moans, deluding listeners into believing they are suffering the torments of the dead.  The transparent singers occupy a 10-foot cube, but they are intangible and do not interfere with creatures in any physical way, nor can they be attacked.  Creatures within 30 feet of the choir experience wracking pain that causes them to take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks.  Individuals who exit the area of effect take these penalties for an additional 2 rounds before the delusion wears off.z
