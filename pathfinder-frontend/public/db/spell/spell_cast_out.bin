abjuration2Bcreature touchedRinstantaneousb€With a melee touch attack you blast a single creature and disrupt any magic controlling it. The target takes 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). In addition, you make a dispel check against any magic jar effect (including a ghost's malevolence ability) or enchantment (compulsion) spells on the target creature, starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells. Treat this as a targeted dispel magic spell, except cast out can dispel one such spell for every four caster levels you possess. A successful Will save halves the damage and limits the dispelling to a single spell or effect.z'
