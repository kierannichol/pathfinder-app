You can choose for the writing to be visible or invisible, and it doesn't harm the material upon which it is placed. A detect magic spell causes an invisible mark to glow and be visible. If any creature other than you touches the warded object or area and fails a Fortitude save, its skin turns bright red for 1 hour per level. This coloring cannot be washed away, but it can be dispelled.  See invisibility, true seeing, a gem of seeing, or a robe of eyes likewise allows the user to see an invisible mark. A read magic spell reveals the words, if any. The ward cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an erase spell.z
