  "description": "You create a transparent, shimmering wall through which creatures and objects appear to be wildly distorted to viewers. Any creature that passes through the wall is immediately assailed by overwhelming vertigo, becoming nauseated for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save; if nauseated, the creature must also succeed at a DC 12 Acrobatics check or fall prone. Creatures gain partial concealment (20% miss chance) against creatures on the other side of the wall.  The wall must be vertical and rectangular. It need not touch the ground. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or creature when it is cast, the spell fails.",
