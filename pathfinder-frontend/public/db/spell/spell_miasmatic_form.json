  "description": "This spell functions like gaseous form, except the target\u0027s vaporous body is dangerous to creatures that touch it. A creature can make a Fortitude save (DC 14 + your Intelligence modifier) on its turn to resist the vapors. When you cast this spell, you select one of the following options.  Stinking cloud: The target\u0027s body nauseates creatures that fail their saving throws, as stinking cloud (Fortitude negates, see text). This form of the spell does not require a material component.  Poisonous cloud: The target\u0027s body is deadly poison, dealing 1d2 points of Constitution damage to creatures that fail their saves (Fortitude halves). This form of the spell requires a material component.",
