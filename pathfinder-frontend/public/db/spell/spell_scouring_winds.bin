You can move the storm up to 30 feet each round as a move action.  Any creature in the area takes 3d6 points of piercing damage each round. The area is considered a windstorm (see Table 13-10: Wind Effects, Core Rulebook 439).  If a creature with spell resistance successfully resists this spell, it is unaffected by the winds and sand, but still unable to see within the area of the spell.z
