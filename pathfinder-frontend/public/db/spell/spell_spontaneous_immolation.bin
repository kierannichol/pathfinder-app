The target takes 3d6 points of fire damage and catches on fire (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444). A successful Fortitude save reduces this damage by half and prevents the target from catching on fire. Each round on your turn, a burning target can attempt a new save to extinguish the flames (DC equal to the DC of the spell); otherwise it takes another 1d6 fire damage.z
