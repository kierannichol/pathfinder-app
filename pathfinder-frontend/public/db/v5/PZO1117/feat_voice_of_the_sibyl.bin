#Your voice is strangely compelling.³
Benefit§You get a +1 bonus on all Bluff, Diplomacy, and Perform (oratory) skill checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in one of these skills, the bonus increases to +3 for that skill. You do not get these bonuses if you do not use your voice when using the skill (such as using Bluff to feint in combat).ª
