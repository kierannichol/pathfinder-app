¾Teleport trap wards an area, redirecting all teleportation into or out of the area to a specific point within the area determined by you at the time of casting. The destination must be an open space on a solid surface. The spell's area overlaps walls and other solid and liquid objects (preventing intruders from bypassing the ward by teleporting into a wall or through similar means). A teleporting creature that is affected by a teleport trap can resist the effect with a Will save--if the save is successful, the creature simply doesn't teleport at all (but the use of the teleport effect is still consumed)--either to the intended location or the teleport trap's actual destination. A DC 27 Knowledge (arcana) allows such a creature to recognize the teleport trap's presence, but does not reveal the trap's linked destination.
