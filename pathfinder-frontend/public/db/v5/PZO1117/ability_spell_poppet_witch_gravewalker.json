    "text": "Each gravewalker carries around a gristly, inanimate poppet stitched from human skin and stuffed with shards of bone, fingernails, and grave dirt. A gravewalker\u0027s spells come from the will of evil spirits residing in the poppet, and its ability to hold spells functions in a manner identical to the way a witch\u0027s spells are granted by her familiar. The gravewalker must commune with her poppet each day to prepare her spells and cannot prepare spells that are not stored in the poppet.\nThis ability replaces familiar."
