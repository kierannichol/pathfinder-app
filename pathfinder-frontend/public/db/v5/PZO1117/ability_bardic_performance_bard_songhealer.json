    "text": "A songhealer gains the following type of bardic performance.\nHealing Performance (Su): A bard of 14th level or higher can use his performance to create an effect equivalent to heal on a living target (or harm on an undead target), using the bard\u0027s level as the caster level. Using this ability requires 5 rounds of continuous performance, and the target must be able to see and hear the bard throughout the performance. The healing performance relies on audible and visual components."
