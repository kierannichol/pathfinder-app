Effect²The ritual allows the primary caster to observe an area at any distance, as per scrying, except that the sensor created for this scrying effect is an enormous visible image of the primary caster in the air above the area (even if the area viewed is indoors or underground) that cannot be dispelled. This image can take any form that the primary caster desires, such as an exact replica or a shape formed from shadows or clouds, but the image is always recognizable as the primary caster. The primary caster can speak to any creatures in the area with a loud voice that emanates from the image. The following spells function reliably through the sensor: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, detect thoughts, message, read magic, tongues, and true seeing. Any other spell requires a successful concentration check to function through the image (DC = 20 + double the level of the spell); on a failure, the spell is lost.
