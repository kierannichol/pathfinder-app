ÏThis works like the paladin's normal divine bond ability, except as follows. If the paladin's bond is with a weapon, she cannot use that ability to add the brilliant energy, disruption, or merciful weapon properties, but she can add the bane weapon property (but only against dragons). If the paladin's bond is with her steed, the steed gains the paladin's aura-based immunities and her aura does not affect allies.
This replaces the standard divine bond ability.ª75
