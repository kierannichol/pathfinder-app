    "text": "At 2nd level, a chirurgeon\u0027s extracts of cure spells automatically act as infusions, and can be used by non-alchemists. When a chirurgeon prepares his extracts, he may choose to render any or all of his infused curatives inert and prepare other extracts to replace them (unlike infusions, which continue to occupy the alchemist\u0027s daily extract slots until consumed or used)."
