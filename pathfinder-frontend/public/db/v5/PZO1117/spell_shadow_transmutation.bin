›You suffuse one subject's body with energy from the Shadow Plane, altering its form to match a creature from the Shadow Plane. Shadow transmutation can mimic any of the following spells: animal growth, anthropomorphic animalUM, enlarge person, fins to feetARG, longarmACG, polymorph, reduce person, and stone fist. If using shadow transmutation as polymorph, the target does not gain any sensory abilities that its new form has (such as lowlight vision or darkvision) and the speed of any movement types gained from the spell cannot exceed the target's base speed or natural speed with those movement types (whichever is higher). A creature under the effects of shadow transmutation deals normal damage and has all the normal abilities and weaknesses of whatever form it assumes using the spell.
