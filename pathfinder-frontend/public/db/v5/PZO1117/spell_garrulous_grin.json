    "text": "This Nidalese spell plants a seed of supernatural fear deep in a subject\u0027s mind, causing self-doubt, stuttering, and evasiveness. Affected creatures have difficulty meeting anyone\u0027s gaze and seem dishonest or guilty. The target takes a â€“4 penalty on Bluff and Diplomacy checks to convince another of the truth of her words, and on Diplomacy or Intimidate checks to influence another creature\u0027s attitude."
