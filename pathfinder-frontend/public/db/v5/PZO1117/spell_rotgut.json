    "text": "You transform the target into a cheap alcohol of your choice, such as beer, grog, mead, rum, or wine. The alcohol doesn\u0027t taste good, but it\u0027s drinkable and just as effective as normal alcohol in making creatures inebriated (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 237). This spell doesn\u0027t work on holy water, potions, magical liquids, or water that is part of a creature."
