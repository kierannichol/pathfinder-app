‚At 20th level, a paladin becomes a conduit for the power of her god. Her DR increases to 10/evil. Whenever she uses smite evil and successfully strikes an aberration, the creature must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the paladin's level + the paladin's Charisma modifier) or be banished to oblivion. This ability does not kill the creature, but it is sent to a remote place, such as deep underground or far into space (if it is a creature native to space), and cannot return under its own power for at least 100 years.
Whenever the paladin channels positive energy or uses lay on hands to heal a creature, she heals the maximum possible amount.ªA
