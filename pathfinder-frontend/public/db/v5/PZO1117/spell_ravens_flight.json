    "text": "You can cast this spell only if it is the first action you take on your turn. In a burst of shadowy feathers, you turn into a Tiny blurred shape reminiscent of a black raven until the beginning of your next turn. You gain a fly speed of 50 feet with good maneuverability, and apply appropriate size modifiers (though your ability scores don\u0027t change). Until the beginning of your next turn, you can take only the 5-foot step, move, run, or withdraw actions. If the spell is dispelled while you are still aloft, the power of flight dissipates slowly; you float downward 60 feet on your next turn, then fall any remaining distance."
