You may influence creatures of that type with wild empathy, if their Intelligence score is 1 or 2, or they do not possess an Intelligence score. Once you choose the type of creature, it cannot be changed.w
SpeciallYou may select this feat more than once. Each time, you may choose an additional creature type to influence.ª
