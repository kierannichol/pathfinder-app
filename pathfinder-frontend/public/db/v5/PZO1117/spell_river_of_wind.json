    "text": "Summoning up the power of the tempest, you direct a current of forceful winds where you please. This spell creates a 5-foot-diameter line of wind--the direction of the wind is away from your location when you cast the spell, and remains constant in that direction for the spell duration. Creatures caught in a river of windtake 4d6 nonlethal damage and are knocked prone. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and prevents being knocked prone."
