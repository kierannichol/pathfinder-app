ÇMost summoners bond with one eidolon for their entire lives, but the broodmaster forges a link with multiple smaller eidolons that make up his brood. Separately, a broodmaster's eidolons are no match for a summoner's single eidolon, but taken as a whole, an eidolon brood makes up in quantity what it lacks in individual power.ºÛ
