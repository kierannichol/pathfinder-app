    "text": "This functions as thought shield III, but any creature that tries to read your thoughts while this spell lasts must succeed at a Will save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Additionally, if you succeed at your save against a psychic crush spell, you take no damage. This spell can be undercast."
