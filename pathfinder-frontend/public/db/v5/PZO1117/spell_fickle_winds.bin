½You create a mobile cylinder of wind encompassing every target of the spell and protecting them as wind wall, but not interfering with them in any way. For example, arrows and bolts fired at the targets are deflected upward and miss, but the targets' own arrows or bolts pass through the wall as if it were not there.
