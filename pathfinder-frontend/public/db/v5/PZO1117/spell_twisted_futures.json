    "text": "By rearranging the threads of fate, you disrupt fortunate outcomes for other creatures. A creature affected by this spell is unable to benefit from effects that grant the ability to roll multiple times and take the higher result (like the swashbuckler\u0027s charmed life ability) or to choose the die result in lieu of rolling (like the wizard\u0027s prescience school power or the cyclops\u0027s flash of insight ability). This doesn\u0027t affect abilities that force a creature to take the lower of two rolls, such as ill omen or a pugwampi\u0027s unluck aura (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 144). A cyclops can\u0027t use its flash of insight ability to save against this spell."
