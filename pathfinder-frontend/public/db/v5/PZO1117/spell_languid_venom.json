    "text": "You greatly extend the time it takes for the poison you touch to take effect, giving that poison an onset time up to 1 hour per caster level. (You touch the poison\u0027s container, so you don\u0027t risk exposing yourself to a contact poison.) The target doesn\u0027t attempt a saving throw when initially exposed to the languid venom, but instead saves at the end of the poison\u0027s onset time. If the poison is neutralized or otherwise cured prior to the end of its onset time, it is rendered harmless. Failing saves against multiple doses of languid venom have the normal cumulative effect for poisons (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 558)."
