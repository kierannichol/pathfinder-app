úYou are able to read a person's surface thoughts and take cues from the person's appearance, body language, and manner of speech to infer a great deal of information about the person, even if that person is in disguise (including polymorph effects). When casting the spell, attempt a DC 20 Sense Motive check with a bonus equal to your caster level. A successful skill check reveals to you one of the following pieces of information of your choice, plus one additional piece of information for every 5 points by which your check result exceeds 20: age, alignment, classâ€ , featsâ€ , gender, native language, place of origin, race or ethnicity, racial traitsâ€ , religion, sexual orientation, or training in a Craft, Perform, or Profession skill. For items marked with a cross (â€ ), if the target has more than one of these features, each one you discover counts as a piece of information.
