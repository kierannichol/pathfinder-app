    "text": "At 2nd level, a preservationist adds Handle Animal to his list of class skills. He adds summon nature\u0027s ally I to his formula book as a 1st-level extract. When he prepares that extract, he actually prepares a tiny, preserved specimen in a bottle (as with a caster casting the spell, the preservationist doesn\u0027t have to choose the creature until he uses the extract). When the alchemist opens the bottle, the specimen animates and grows to normal size, serving the preservationist as per the spell and otherwise being treated as a summoned creature. When the duration expires, the preserved creature decays into powder. If the preservationist has the infusion discovery, another character can use the infused specimen. The Augment Summoning feat can be applied to these specimens."
