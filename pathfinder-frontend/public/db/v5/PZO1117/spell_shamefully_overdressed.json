    "text": "The target sees its own attire as hopelessly out of fashion, ostentatious, and embarrassing, and is filled with a compulsion to strip off all clothing. Each round, the target must spend a move action to remove a worn item that can be removed with a move action, dropping the item once it is removed. The target doesn\u0027t distinguish between magical and nonmagical items when removing them. Each round it removes an item as determined randomly from the following slots: belt, body, chest, eyes, feet, hands, head, headband, shoulders, or wrists. When determining randomly, don\u0027t include any slots if the character has no item of that sort, and don\u0027t include items that take more than one move action to remove. Though creatures can\u0027t have more than one magic item in any of those slots, they can have multiple mundane items that fit each slot, in which case randomly decide which one they remove. If a target is wearing clothing that doesn\u0027t fit in any of those slots, such as breeches or a quiver, add it to the list of possibilities at the GM\u0027s discretion."
