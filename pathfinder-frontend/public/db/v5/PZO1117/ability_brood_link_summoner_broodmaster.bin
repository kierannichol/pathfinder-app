Brood Linkarchetype_featureclass_featureclass:summoner#broodmaster¢Ã
ÀAt 2nd level, a broodmaster forms a close bond with his eidolons. This ability works like the standard summoner life link ability, except the broodmaster can only sacrifice hit points to prevent damage to one eidolon in the brood at a time. If two or more eidolons in the brood take enough damage to send them back to their home plane, the broodmaster can only sacrifice hit points to prevent damage to one of them.
This ability replaces life link.ª-+
