    "text": "You bestow divine protection on your companion. The target gains spell resistance equal to 5 plus half your caster level against spells and spell-like effects produced by evil creatures. The target also gains a +1 sacred bonus on saving throws and DR 5/evil or silver. Creatures under the effects of this spell often take on a celestial appearance, such as golden feathers or a radiant aura, but they are not truly celestial creatures."
