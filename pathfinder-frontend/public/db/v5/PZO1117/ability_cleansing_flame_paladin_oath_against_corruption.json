    "text": "At 11th level, you may expend two uses of your smite evil ability to ignite your weapon with a cleansing blue flame for 1 minute. This flame sheds light as a torch. Aberrations within 20 feet of the flame take a â€“4 penalty on attack rolls against you and your allies, and your allies within 20 feet of the flame gain a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from aberrations.\nThis ability replaces aura of justice."
