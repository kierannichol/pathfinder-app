BenefitýYou may implant a bomb in a willing or helpless creature (a mindless creature under your control, such as a zombie, counts as willing for this purpose). This takes 1 hour and expends 1 use of your bomb ability for the day. When the implanted creature dies or is destroyed, the bomb detonates in the creature's square as if it were a delayed bomb set by you (though you can set the bomb's damage to less than your normal bomb damage). You can use any bomb-affecting discoveries on this implanted bomb (acid bomb, frost bomb, smoke bomb, and so on) as normal. The bomb automatically detonates 24 hours after you implant it in the creature.ª
