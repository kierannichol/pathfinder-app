×The targeted room is enchanted to have magical appeal for customers, an increase in the workflow of its employees, or the generation of additional materials to work with. While this spell is in effect, the targeted room produces 1 more Goods, Labor, Influence, or Magic than it already does. If the room produces multiple types of capital, it produces an additional capital of each type. If the room generates gp, it generates 25% more. Only the capital that the room normally generates increases-- rooms that do not already generate Magic, for instance, do not generate Magic because of this spell.
