    "text": "This spell functions like grease, except as noted here. When you use this spell to cover a solid surface with slippery grease, the 10-foot squares must form a continuous area, each part of which must be within the spell\u0027s range. When you use this spell to create a greasy coating on items, no two of the targeted items can be more than 30 feet apart. You cannot target both items and surfaces with a single casting of this spell."
