      "Effect": "The witch can cause a creature within 60 feet to be shunned by its allies for a number of rounds equal to the witch\u0027s Intelligence modifier. Any other creature attempting to directly assist the target with a harmless spell or aid another action must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the aiding creature is unaffected by this hex. If the save fails, the aiding creature can\u0027t follow through, the action is lost, and the aiding creature can\u0027t directly aid the target for the duration of this hex. This hex does not prevent the target from benefiting from area of effect spells."
