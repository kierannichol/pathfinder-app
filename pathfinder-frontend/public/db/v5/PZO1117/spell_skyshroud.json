    "text": "The caster designates the area of a hemisphere within the spell\u0027s range. If a solid object would block the creation of the hemisphere (such as a ceiling or wall), the spell instead conforms to the geometry of the location up to the maximum area of effect for the spell. The hemisphere displays an image of the sky as it appears directly above where the spell was cast. This effect bypasses natural impediments, such as rock or stone, that would obstruct the targeted location from the sky."
