    "text": "You create an illusory duplicate of your familiar that moves erratically around your familiar\u0027s space, frequently moving through the familiar\u0027s body with a blurring effect that makes it indistinguishable from the real creature. Attacks against the familiar have a 50% miss chance; attacks that miss instead target the familiar figment, which reacts as if damaged as appropriate to the attack but unlike a mirror imageis not destroyed when struck. This spell does not grant your familiar concealment or prevent it from being targeted by spell effects that do not require an attack roll."
