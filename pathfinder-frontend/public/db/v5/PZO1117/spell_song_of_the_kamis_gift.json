      "Effect": "The primary caster appeals to a local kami to ask for assistance in battle. The casters must assemble a shrine within 100 feet of the kami\u0027s ward. Once the ritual begins, the casters each utter a unique prayer to the kami, complete with devotionals and explanations about why the kami\u0027s help is needed. If the casting is successful, the kami manifests (as per summon monster V) and fights alongside the casters. This kami uses the statistics for a kodama and refuses to move farther than 1 mile from its ward."
