    "text": "You interfere with attempts to predict the target\u0027s future by preventing divinations from revealing what the target will do and what will befall the target while under the spell\u0027s effects. Instead of the target\u0027s true actions or experiences, divinations resolve as if the target will experience some different future you describe as you cast false future. The target creature can attempt a Will save to avoid the initial effect, and creatures using divinations get a Will save to disbelieve the illusion. This spell doesn\u0027t prevent divinations cast after the duration\u0027s end from determining what the subject actually did during the time you obscured using false future."
