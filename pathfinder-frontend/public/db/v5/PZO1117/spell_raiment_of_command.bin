áYou are cloaked in an illusion of authority. Others perceive you to be a legitimate figure of authority, such as a higher-ranking official, a religious figure, or a more powerful warrior. This illusion grants you a +5 bonus on all Diplomacy and Intimidate checks. If you attempt to disguise yourself as a specific authority figure whom you have met in person, you gain a +10 competence bonus on the Disguise check and any Bluff check related to impersonating that authority figure.
