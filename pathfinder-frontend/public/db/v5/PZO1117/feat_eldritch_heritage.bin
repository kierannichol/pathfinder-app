eYou are descended from a long line of sorcerers, and some portion of their power flows in your veins.ô
BenefitèSelect one sorcerer bloodline. You must have Skill focus in the class skill that bloodline grants to a sorcerer at 1st level (for example, Heal for the celestial bloodline). This bloodline cannot be a bloodline you already have. You gain the first-level bloodline power for the selected bloodline. For purposes of using that power, treat your sorcerer level as equal to your character level â€“ 2, even if you have levels in sorcerer. You do not gain any of the other bloodline abilities.ª
