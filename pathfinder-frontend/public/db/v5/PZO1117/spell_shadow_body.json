    "text": "You exchange the crude matter of your material body with the insubstantial essence of the Plane of Shadow, becoming a living shadow yourself. You are visible as an unattached shadow in bright light or normal light, but you gain total concealment in dim light or darkness. Against creatures with darkvision, you gain concealment rather than total concealment. Your shadow body is incorporeal for most purposes, though you can\u0027t fly or pass through solid objects or creatures. However, you can move at your normal speed along any surface, including horizontal and vertical surfaces and liquids, and you are never slowed by difficult terrain. Your size doesn\u0027t change."
