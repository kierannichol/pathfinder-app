    "text": "You send out a magical message to any eldritch entities of a particular kind within a 100-mile radius, which can be delivered to up to 20 such creatures, starting with the nearest creatures until the limit has been met. This spell can\u0027t contact creatures with more than 6 Hit Dice. You can\u0027t send a specific message, but this spell (and all similar contact entity spells) can be characterized as an open invitation to make contact and establish communication. If there is an appropriate entity within range, the spell succeeds automatically. You don\u0027t know whether the message was received, nor any specific details about what creatures received it or how many. Creatures that receive the message know the location and distance from where the spell was cast. Because this spell doesn\u0027t call or summon the target, the target must have its own way to reach the place where the spell was cast."
