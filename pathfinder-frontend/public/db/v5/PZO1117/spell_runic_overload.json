    "text": "This spell charges magical runes to an explosive degree. If cast on a creature with magical runes on its body, such as a rune giant or a runescarred creature (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lost Cities of Golarion 60), it deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to the target and stuns the target for 1 round. When the spell is cast in this way, it must overcome the target\u0027s spell resistance. A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the stun effect."
