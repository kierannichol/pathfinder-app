­You step into any magical or naturally occurring storm and commune directly with the power of the wind and rain. This spell allows the storm's power to fill you, granting you knowledge and images of what else lies within its reach. As long as you remain within the storm, you can concentrate on it for 1 minute to determine whether or not other living creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher are caught in the storm within 400 feet of you. Due to the nature of the spell, you do not need to attempt concentration checks against violent wind or storms when casting the spell, but other elements that might disrupt spellcasting require checks as normal. While the spell is in effect, you no longer need to attempt concentration checks as a result of wind or storms for spells you cast or concentrate on.
