    "text": "You mix a malign spirit into a piece of food, a drink, or some other item to be consumed (including alchemical items, potions, elixirs, or similar items). The skin tag spell discharges when the item is consumed, affecting the creature that used the item unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save. The spirit embeds itself somewhere in the affected creature\u0027s skin, forming a painless set of wrinkles and tags of skin that looks vaguely like a face when the haunt activates. You are considered to have a body part from the affected creature for the purpose of scrying and similar divination spells. Once per day as a standard action, you can remotely cause the spirit to make the affected creature\u0027s skin crawl, causing the creature to become sickened for 1d4 rounds + 1 round per 2 caster levels you have (to a maximum of 5 extra rounds at 10th level) unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save. Alternatively, once per day you can remotely use a hex, a mind-affecting spell, or a necromancy spell that causes disease or possession on the affected creature. Each time you use the remote sickening or spell or hex effect, the spell\u0027s haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round."
