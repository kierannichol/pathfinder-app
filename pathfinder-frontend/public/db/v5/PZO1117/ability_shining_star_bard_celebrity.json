    "text": "At 8th level, the celebrity has learned how to focus attention on himself so thoroughly that even the presence of danger does not distract his adoring crowd. When using fascinate, a target making a save to break the effect because of a potential threat takes a â€“4 penalty on that save, and even obvious threats require a save rather than automatically breaking the effect. Creatures affected by the bard\u0027s fascinate ability ignore the shaken condition."
