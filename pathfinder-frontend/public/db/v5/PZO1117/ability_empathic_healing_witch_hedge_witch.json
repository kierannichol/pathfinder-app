    "text": "A hedge witch can minister to a diseased or poisoned target, redirecting the affliction into herself. For a poisoned target, the witch must tend to him as a standard action; he makes his next saving throw against the poison as normal, but the witch suffers the effects of the failed save instead of the poisoned creature. For a diseased target, the witch must tend to the sick person for an hour; he makes his next saving throw against the disease as normal, but the witch suffers the effects of the failed save instead of the diseased creature. The witch does not actually become poisoned or diseased (and is not contagious and does not need to be cured), but suffers the effects of the affliction as if she had been. The witch normally uses this ability to extend the life of someone near death, giving him time to recover. This ability has no effect if the witch is immune to disease or poison.\nThis replaces the witch\u0027s hex gained at 8th level.\nHexes: The following witch hexes complement the hedge witch archetype: cauldron, feral speech [UM], healing, tongues.\nMajor Hexes: The following major hexes complement the hedge witch archetype: major healing, weather control, witch\u0027s brew [UM]."
