—You cast this spell as you begin crafting an item using a Craft skill, and add your Spellcraft ranks to Craft checks made to create that item. As part of concentrating on the spell, you must continue chanting the verbal components, pausing at most for a few seconds at a time to speak, chew, and so on. If the crafting takes more than 1 day to complete, you must cast the spell each day to gain its benefit.
