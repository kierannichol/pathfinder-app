      "Benefit": "If your tumor familiar is attached, and you would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the familiar throws itself in the way of the attack as an immediate action. If it makes a Reflex saving throw (DC \u003d damage dealt), it takes all the damage from the attack; if it fails, it takes half damage and you take half damage."
