    "text": "You can use dispel magic to end one ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, or to counter another spellcaster\u0027s spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can\u0027t be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can\u0027t be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect."
