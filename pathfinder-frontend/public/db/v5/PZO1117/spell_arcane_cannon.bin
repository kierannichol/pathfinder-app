ÚYour focus becomes a Medium arcane cannonthat appears in an unoccupied square within the spell's range. If no unoccupied square is within range, the spell fails. The cannon comes into existence loaded. Each round thereafter, the cannon can either fire or load. A cannon must be loaded to fire. You do not need to supply ammunition for the cannon.
