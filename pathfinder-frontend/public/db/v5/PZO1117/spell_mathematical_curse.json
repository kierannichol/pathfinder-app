    "text": "Using the Path of Numbers, you are able to influence the seemingly random elements in the environment around a creature, reducing that creature\u0027s efficacy. Roll 3d8 and choose one of the dice--this die\u0027s result is the penalty mathematical curse imparts. Next, choose either of the two remaining dice; the d20 roll corresponding to that result on the Eight Basic Energies table is the roll the spell\u0027s penalty applies to. The result of the final die represents the number of rounds that mathematical curse lasts. A creature can be under the influence of only one mathematical curse at a time. If mathematical curse is cast on a creature already affected by that spell, the new curse replaces the previous one."
