    "text": "You pull the breath from a creature\u0027s lungs, dealing damage and leaving it unable to speak, use breath weapons, or cast spells with verbal components. If the target fails its saving throw, it takes 2d6 points of damage, and it cannot speak, use breath weapons, or anything else requiring breathing, and a visible line of swirling air leaves the target\u0027s mouth and enters your mouth."
