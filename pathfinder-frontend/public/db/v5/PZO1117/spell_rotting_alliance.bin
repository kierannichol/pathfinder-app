ÂYou curse two or more creatures to sicken and waste away while in each others' company. Each target that fails a Fortitude save becomes cursed with a wasting sickness. The disease has no onset period, and those who contracted it must attempt a second Fortitude save immediately. A target that fails this second saving throw takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage and 1d6 points of Charisma damage. Every day thereafter, each target that was within 100 feet of another target during the previous 24 hours takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage and 1d6 points of Charisma damage (reroll to determine the specific amount of damage each day). A successful Fortitude save negates the damage for that day only.
