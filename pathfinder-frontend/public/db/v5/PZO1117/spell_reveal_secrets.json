    "text": "When you cast this spell, you ask the target whether it has a secret about a specific topic that can be described in 10 words or fewer. This can concern a person, place, or thing (such as a town\u0027s mayor, the ring worn by a traveling merchant, or the bridge spanning a nearby river) or an easily distinguished event (such as a historic battle or a recent rash of disappearances). If the target knows a secret about the topic (information it believes isn\u0027t common knowledge and which it would not normally tell you), it states it has a secret. The target doesn\u0027t mention anything about the secret and doesn\u0027t remember telling you it has a secret. If the target succeeds at its saving throw, it isn\u0027t compelled to reveal whether it knows a secret and is aware that you asked."
