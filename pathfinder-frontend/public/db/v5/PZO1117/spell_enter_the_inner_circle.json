      "Effect": "This ritual forms the basis of an initiation ceremony for the secret society. Other organizations might have their own versions of the ritual, substituting Perception and Stealth for two skills appropriate to the organization (such as Knowledge [religion] for a church). The primary caster and all secondary casters but one must be members of the organization, and exactly one secondary caster--the initiate--must not be."
