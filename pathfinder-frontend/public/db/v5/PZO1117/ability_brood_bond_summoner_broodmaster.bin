Brood Bondarchetype_featureclass_featureclass:summoner#broodmaster¢å
âAt 14th level, a summoner's life becomes linked to his brood. This functions as the life bond ability, except the broodmaster can only transfer damage to one eidolon in the brood at a time. If that eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, all excess damage remains with the broodmaster, killing him.
This ability replaces life bond.ª.
