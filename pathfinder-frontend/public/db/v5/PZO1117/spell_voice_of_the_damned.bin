Effect¡The caster rouses the lingering consciousness of a neutralized haunt. Upon the ritual's completion, a spirit resembling the entity that empowered the haunt manifests before the caster and scrawls a message of 25 words or less onto the provided parchment, using the caster's blood. This message provides a cryptic clue regarding how to permanently destroy the haunt, acting much like the information granted by a divination spell, except that there is no chance that the information will be incorrect because the haunt hopes to end its suffering.
