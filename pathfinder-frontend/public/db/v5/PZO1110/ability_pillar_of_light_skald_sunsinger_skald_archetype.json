    "text": "At 3rd level, a sunsinger skald can use her raging song to call upon her goddess to imbue her with glory and make all who see it pay heed. A great beam of sunlight shines down upon the skald, casting bright light in a 30-foot radius, and allows the skald\u0027s raging song to function as the fascinate bardic performance."
