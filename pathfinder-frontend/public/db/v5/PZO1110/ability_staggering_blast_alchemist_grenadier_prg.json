    "text": "At 10th level, a grenadier\u0027s bombs become particularly overwhelming when they explode.\nWhenever a grenadier confirms a critical hit with a bomb, the creature directly struck by that bomb is staggered for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful Fortitude saving throw (DC equals the bomb\u0027s Reflex save DC to avoid splash damage) reduces the duration to 1 round. The effects of this ability stack with a frost bomb\u0027s staggering effect, but not with the effects of the Staggering Critical feat. Additional critical hits with bombs add to any duration remaining from previous ones."
