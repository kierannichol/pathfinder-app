ÓAt 8th level, a colluding scoundrel deals 2d6 additional points of damage on attacks against a target threatened by an ally currently designated as the scapegoat.
This increases to 3d6 points of damage at 15th level.
This is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit, but it does stack with sneak attack and similar effects.ª5
