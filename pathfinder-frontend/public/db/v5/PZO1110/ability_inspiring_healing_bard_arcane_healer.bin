äAt 5th level, an arcane healer gains the ability to expend rounds of his bardic performance to provide extra healing to his allies. By expending 2 rounds of bardic performance, an arcane healer can cast cure light wounds as a spell-like ability.
At 11th level, the arcane healer can expend 2 rounds of bardic performance to cast cure moderate wounds as a spell-like ability.
At 17th level, he may instead expend 2 rounds of bardic performance to cast cure serious wounds as a spell-like ability. No single target may be affected by an arcane healer's inspiring healing ability more than once in a 24-hour period.ª3
