Ý	At 1st level, a dreamthief selects an emotional focus from among those available to a spiritualist's phantom.
She gains the abilities granted by that emotional focus (with the exception of the focus determining her good saving throws--she retains the typical rogue saves). For each of the two skills associated with that emotional focus, a dreamthief gains ranks in that skill equal to her rogue level; this does not allow her ranks in these skills to exceed her Hit Dice.
A dreamthief is considered to be both a phantom and a spiritualist for the purpose of emotional focus abilities whose effect references both a phantom and a spiritualist, such as dutiful strike, and she treats her rogue level as both her spiritualist level and her phantom Hit Dice when determining abilities and save DCs.
Once per round when a dreamthief makes a melee attack, she can declare that attack to be a dreamstrike. This does not require an action, but a dreamthief must declare a dreamstrike before making the attack roll. A dreamstrike is treated as a slam attack for the purpose of emotional focus abilities that apply to a phantom's slam attacks, such as miserable strike. At 20th level, any melee attack a dreamthief makes automatically gains this benefit.ª0
