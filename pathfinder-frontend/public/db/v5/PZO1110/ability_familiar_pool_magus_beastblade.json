    "text": "At 7th level, when a beastblade prepares his magus spells, he can expend points from his arcane pool (up to a maximum number of points equal to his Intelligence modifier) to empower his familiar. For each point expended in this way, the familiar can cast one magus spell as a spell-like ability once that day. Each spell selected must be 3 spell levels lower than the highest spell level the beastblade can cast, and can\u0027t require a material component that costs more than 1 gp."
