½A faithful wanderer quickly learns the skills she needs to survive. She gains Knowledge (nature), Knowledge (planes), Perception, Stealth, and Survival as class skills but doesn't gain Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Knowledge (nobility), or Ride as class skills. A faithful wanderer gains a number of skill ranks equal to 4 + her Intelligence modifier at each level (instead of gaining a number of skill ranks equal to 2 + her Intelligence modifier).ª7
