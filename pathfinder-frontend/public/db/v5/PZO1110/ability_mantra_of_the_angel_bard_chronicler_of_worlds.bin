£At 15th level, the chronicler of worlds can create a potent ward against outsiders. While maintaining this performance, when the chronicler of worlds is hit by an attack from an outsider or fails a saving throw against an outsider's extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability, as an immediate action she can attempt a Knowledge (planes) check and use the result as her Armor Class or her saving throw result against that attack or effect. The chronicler cannot use her planar lore ability to take 20 on this Knowledge (planes) check.
This can retroactively alter the results of the attack or ability. The chronicler of worlds must decide to use this ability before the effects of the successful attack or failed saving throw have been announced. Mantra of the Angel relies on audible components.ª<
