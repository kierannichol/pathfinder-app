    "text": "At 6th level, as a standard action, a twinned summoner can swap locations with his eidolon as if each were using dimension door, using the twinned summoner\u0027s caster level. If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. If either the twinned summoner or his eidolon occupies more squares than the other, each must occupy one or more squares that were occupied by the other if possible, or as close as possible if not. The twinned summoner can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 6th. At 8th level, he can use this ability as a swift action."
