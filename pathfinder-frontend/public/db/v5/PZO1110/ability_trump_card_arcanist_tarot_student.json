    "text": "At 9th level, a Tarot student can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir and draw a card from her harrow deck as a standard action to learn her own fate or that of an ally within 30 feet. The target\u0027s fate depends on the suit of the card drawn from the deck.\nBooks: The target gains a +2 insight bonus on her next caster level check. Crowns: The target gains a +2 insight bonus on her next saving throw. Hammers: The target gains a +4 insight bonus on the damage roll of her next successful melee attack. Keys: The target gains a +4 insight bonus on her next initiative check. Shields: The next time the target receives magical healing, she regains an additional number of hit points equal to the Tarot student\u0027s arcanist class level. Stars: The target gains a +4 insight bonus on her next skill check.\nA creature cannot have more than one trump card in effect at one time; drawing a new trump card for a target negates the effect of the previous trump card. A Tarot student can attempt to read the fate of an enemy within 30 feet, resulting in a penalty for that target equal to the bonus granted above, but the target is entitled to a Will save (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 the Tarot student\u0027s arcanist level + her Charisma modifier) to negate the effect. This is considered a curse effect. A Tarot student can have trump cards in effect for multiple creatures at the same time."
