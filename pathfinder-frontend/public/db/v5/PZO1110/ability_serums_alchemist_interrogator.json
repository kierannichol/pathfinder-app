    "text": "At 1st level, an interrogator augments his ability to influence others through supplemental serums.\nAn interrogator prepares his serums at the same time as his injections and he can apply them to any injection as a swift action before he makes the attack roll for the injection.\nAn interrogator knows one serum at 1st level and can learn another serum in place of a discovery. The save DCs of serums are equal to 10 + 1/2 the interrogator\u0027s alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier. A creature can be under the effect of only a single serum at a time--with the exception of memory modification serum--with any further serums on the same creature replacing the old serum. Unless otherwise noted, a creature that succeeds on its saving throw against a serum is immune to that serum\u0027s effects for 24 hours.\nAn interrogator can never gain any sort of mutagen or cognatogen, even from a discovery or another class.\nThis ability replaces mutagen and persistent mutagen."
