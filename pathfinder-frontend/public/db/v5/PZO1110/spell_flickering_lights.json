    "text": "You cause the illumination in the area to seem to flicker erratically, fluctuating between absolute darkness and blinding brightness. The level of light in the area changes at the start of each creature\u0027s turn, as determined by rolling a percentile die and consulting the following table. d% Illumination Level 1-10 Supernatural darkness 11-25 Darkness 26-50 Dim light 51-90 Normal light 91-00 Bright light Even darkvision can\u0027t see through supernatural darkness (as deeper darkness). Bright light affects creatures with light blindness or light sensitivity. For the purpose of superseding its effects with higher-level light or darkness spells, flickering lights counts as a light spell when it increases the ambient light level and a darkness spell when it decreases the ambient light level."
