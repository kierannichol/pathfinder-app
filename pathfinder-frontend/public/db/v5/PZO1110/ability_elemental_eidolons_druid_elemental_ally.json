    "text": "At 1st level, an elemental ally has four elemental eidolons she can summon, one each for the elements of air, earth, fire, and water. Their abilities and statistics are determined using the rules for elemental eidolons for the Unchained Summoner class, as if the elemental ally were a summoner of her druid level, except they gain no additional evolution pool (just those evolutions from their base form and base evolutions from their subtype).\nEach of the four elementals has its own base form, skills, and feats. The elemental ally can summon one of these elementals with the same 1-minute ritual a summoner normally uses to do so. The elemental ally can\u0027t summon an eidolon or cast summon nature\u0027s ally if she currently has an eidolon summoned. She also can\u0027t summon an eidolon if she currently has a creature summoned through other means. If one of the elemental ally\u0027s eidolons is killed, she cannot summon any eidolons for 24 hours. The elemental ally can dismiss her eidolon as a standard action.\nAs the elemental ally gains levels, her elemental eidolons\u0027 base statistics and base evolutions increase as if her druid level were her summoner level. The eidolons gain the darkvision, link, share spells, evasion, ability score increase, devotion, multiattack, and improved evasion abilities at the appropriate levels, but never gain an evolution pool. Abilities and spells that grant additional evolution points to eidolons do not function for elemental eidolons, though any ability that would grant evolution points to an animal companion does work. The elemental ally does not gain life link or any other class features a summoner gains in relation to her eidolon."
