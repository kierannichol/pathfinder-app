ËAt 3rd level, an urban bloodrager can attune her spells so they are less likely to impact her allies or innocent bystanders. When the bloodrager casts a spell, she can grant a +2 bonus on the saving throw against that spell to any creatures she is aware of that are targeted by the spell or within the spell's area. Any creature that receives this bonus and succeeds at its save is unaffected by the spell, as if it hadn't been targeted or wasn't in the area.ª;
