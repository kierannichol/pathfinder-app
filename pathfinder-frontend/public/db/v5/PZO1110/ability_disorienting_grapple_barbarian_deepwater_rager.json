    "text": "At 5th level, a deepwater rager becomes an expert in flipping and spinning opponents as they are grappled. An opponent grappled by the deepwater rager gains the sickened condition for as long as it has the grappled condition. When the creature\u0027s grappled condition ends, for any reason, it must succeed at an Acrobatics check (with a DC equal to the deepwater rager\u0027s CMD) or fall prone."
