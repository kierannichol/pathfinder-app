öAt 2nd level, a hallucinist has a deep understanding and appreciation of drugs. If the hallucinist spends 1 minute physically examining a drug, he can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural drug or a Knowledge (arcana) check to identify any magical drug (DC = the drug's addiction saving throw DC). Once he identifies a drug, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = the drug's addiction saving throw DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the drug. Success renders the dose harmless. The hallucinist has no chance of accidentally drugging herself when examining or attempting to neutralize a drug.ª1
