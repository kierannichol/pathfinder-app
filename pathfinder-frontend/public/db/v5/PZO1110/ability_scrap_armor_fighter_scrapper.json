    "text": "At 3rd level, a scrapper learns to salvage scrap from constructs or other pieces of armor and attach them to his own armor. Salvaging scrap from a destroyed construct or from another creature\u0027s armor takes 1 minute.\nScrap from a construct grants the scrapper a natural armor bonus to AC equal to one-quarter the construct\u0027s Hit Dice (minimum +1). If the scrap is salvaged from a piece of armor, it instead grants a natural armor bonus to AC equal to 1 + the armor\u0027s enhancement bonus (if any). The salvaged armor piece is flimsy and prone to breaking. Scrap is immediately destroyed by any sunder combat maneuver that targets the armor to which the scrap is attached. Otherwise, scrap crumbles and falls away after a number of days equal to the natural armor bonus that it grants. At 11th level, scrap salvaged from a construct also grants DR/adamantine equal to one-quarter of the construct\u0027s Hit Dice."
