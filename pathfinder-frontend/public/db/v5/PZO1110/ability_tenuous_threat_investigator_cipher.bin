ŠAt 5th level, a cipher's opponents tend to forget that he is a threat. The first time each day that he successfully hits an opponent who is not the target of his studied combat with a melee attack, the opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the cipher's investigator level + his Intelligence modifier) or be affected by the cipher's studied strike. This is a mind-affecting effect.ª1
