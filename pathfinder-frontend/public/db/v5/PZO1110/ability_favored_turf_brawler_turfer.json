    "text": "At 3rd level, a turfer chooses a type of terrain from the ranger\u0027s favored terrain list. When in that type of terrain, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD.\nAt 7th level and every 4 brawler levels thereafter, the turfer chooses an additional terrain in which to gain these bonuses. Each time, in one selected terrain (including the one just chosen), her bonus on initiative checks increases by 2, and her bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD increases by 1."
