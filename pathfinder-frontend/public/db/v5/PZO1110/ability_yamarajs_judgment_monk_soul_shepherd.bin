ÊAt 15th level, a soul shepherd can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a standard action to attempt to free an enslaved soul from an effect that is imprisoning it, such as soul bind or trap the soul. This functions as a targeted dispel magic spell with a caster level equal to the soul shepherd's level. He can spend an additional ki point when he activates this ability to gain a +4 bonus on the caster level check. If the soul is held prisoner by a creature or a non-spell effect, the soul shepherd frees it if his caster level check result is at least 11 + the creature or effect's CR.ª3
