    "text": "At 10th level, a bonded wizard can repair her bonded item or turn it into another object once per day as a full-round action. Transforming it functions as polymorph any object, but does not alter the item\u0027s magical properties (including its item slot), while repairing it functions as make whole. The wizard may also sacrifice a prepared spell in order to repair an additional 1d6 points of damage per level of the sacrificed spell."
