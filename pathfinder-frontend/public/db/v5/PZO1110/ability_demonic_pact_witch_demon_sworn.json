At the indicated levels, she gains the spells below in place of her normal patron spells:\n2nd--protection from good, 6th--unholy blight, 10th--dispel good, 14th--blasphemy, 18th--unholy aura.\nCasting spells with the evil descriptor from this replacement list has no effect on the demonsworn\u0027s alignment."
