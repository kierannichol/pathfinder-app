    "text": "A gun scavenger gains the following deeds at the listed level.\nChange Out (Ex) At 1st level, as a full-round action, a gun scavenger can remove the broken condition from a single firearm she is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. When she does, she can replace the broken part with a specialized, short-lived component that does one of the following: gives the firearm the scatter weapon quality; increases the damage dealt by the pistol-whip deed by one die size; or increases the firearm\u0027s range increment by 10 feet. A firearm with such a modification increases its misfire chance cumulatively by 1 each time it is fired until it misfires. When it does misfire, the effects of the temporary component are lost. A gun scavenger must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the gun scavenger spends 1 grit point to perform a change out, she can either perform the change out as a standard action instead of a full-round action, or perform the change out on a firearm that isn\u0027t broken.\nThis deed replaces the quick clear deed.\nJury-Rig (Ex) At 7th level, as a standard action, a gun scavenger can adjust a firearm she is currently wielding to fire in an unconventional way. She can spend 1 grit point to grant her firearm one of the following magic weapon enhancements for 1 round per gunslinger level: distance, flaming, glamered, or thundering. If she spends 2 grit points, she can instead grant the firearm flaming burst or stalking. Multiple uses of this ability don\u0027t stack with themselves."
