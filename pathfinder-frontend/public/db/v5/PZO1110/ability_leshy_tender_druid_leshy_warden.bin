ÄAt 4th level, a leshy warden can either grant her leaf leshy a +2 increase to Strength and Dexterity or transform it into a gourd leshy. At 8th level, the leshy warden can either grant her current leshy a +2 increase to Strength and Dexterity or transform it into a fungus leshy. At 12th level, she can either grant her current leshy a final +2 increase to Strength and Dexterity or transform it into a seaweed leshy. If the leshy is transformed, it gains the normal ability scores of its new form; ability score increases granted by this ability don't carry over to its new form.ª.
