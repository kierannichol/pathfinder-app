    "text": "This spell teleports the suit of armor you are wearing off of your body and onto an ally within range; the target must be the same size and general shape as you. This armor appears on the target\u0027s body fully formed and properly donned, granting the creature the immediate benefit of its protection. If the target of guardian armor was already wearing armor, the armor wearing it is removed from the target\u0027s body and falls undamaged into an adjacent square."
