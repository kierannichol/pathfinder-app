ÆA filidh is proficient with light armor and is prohibited from wearing metal armor. A filidh can wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell. Filidhs are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but can use only those made of wood.
A filidh who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast bard spells or use any of his supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.ª7
