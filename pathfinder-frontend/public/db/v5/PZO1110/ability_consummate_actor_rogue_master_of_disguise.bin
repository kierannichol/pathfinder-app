óA master of disguise adds half her rogue level (minimum 1) on all Disguise checks and on Bluff checks to stay in character while using Disguise.
At 2nd level, she gains the quick disguise rogue talent, and she can create a disguise twice as quickly as normal even for that rogue talent (she can create a disguise that encompasses only minor details as a standard action).ª8
