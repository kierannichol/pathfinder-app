A velvet blade focuses her studies on social infiltration rather than brute force, believing it is easier to kill an opponent quietly and unprepared than in a loud battle. She adds her studied target bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Intimidate, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, Stealth, and Survival checks against studied opponents, as well as to the DCs of slayer class abilities she uses against such opponents. She never gains a bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls from her studied target ability.ª4
