    "text": "At 11th level, a twilight sage\u0027s mastery over life and death allows her to transfer life energy into a fading vessel. Once per day, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir while touching a creature that died within the past round to affect that creature as if it had received a breath of life spell, using her arcanist level as the caster level. At the same time, a willing or unconscious living creature within 300 feet that has a number of Hit Dice equal to or greater than the recipient\u0027s instantly dies. This ability is a death effect, and if the victim doesn\u0027t actually die (such as if it was summoned or is immune to death effects), the recipient doesn\u0027t receive the breath of life effect."
