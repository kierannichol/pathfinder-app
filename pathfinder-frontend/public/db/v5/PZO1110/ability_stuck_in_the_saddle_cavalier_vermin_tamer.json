    "text": "A practiced vermin tamer can remain steady in the saddle even in unconventional situations. At 4th level, he gains a +4 circumstance bonus on any checks to stay in the saddle when his mount is climbing walls or flying. At 8th level, this bonus increases to +8, and he never falls off his mount when he is rendered unconscious."
