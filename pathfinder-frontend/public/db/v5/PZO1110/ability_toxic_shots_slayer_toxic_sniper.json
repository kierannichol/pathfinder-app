    "text": "At 4th level, a toxic sniper can coat his ammunition in poison without requiring a pitted bullet. He is trained in applying poison in this way and cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to his ammunition.\nThe toxic sniper can create a number of toxic shots per day equal to half his slayer level plus his Wisdom modifier. The penetrating nature of a toxic shot increases the DC of any poisons applied in this way by 2. A toxic sniper cannot create a toxic shot that is part of an alchemical cartridge."
