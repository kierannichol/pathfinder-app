èA dungeon rover gains the ability to improve the attitude of mindless subterranean creatures. This ability functions as the wild empathy class feature, except a dungeon rover can influence any vermin (even those without Intelligence scores) instead of animals. Additionally, a dungeon rover can influence oozes with a â€“4 penalty on his vermin affinity check.ª3
