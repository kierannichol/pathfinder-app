    "text": "At 20th level, a dune drifter is able to select three additional deeds for use with his Amateur Gunslinger feat--two from the list of deeds available to 15th-level gunslingers, and one from the list available to 19th-level gunslingers.\nIn addition, if the dune drifter confirms a critical hit on an attack made with a firearm, the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will saving throw (DC \u003d 10 + the dune drifter\u0027s base attack bonus) reduces this effect to staggered instead of stunned."
