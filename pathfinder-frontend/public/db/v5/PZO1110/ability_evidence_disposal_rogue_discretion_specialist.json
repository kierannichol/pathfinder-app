    "text": "A discretion specialist can cover up a corpse\u0027s cause of a death--or dispose of it entirely. At 4th level, the discretion specialist gains the ability to cast dress corpse as a spell-like ability, using her rogue level as her caster level. She can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 5 rogue levels she has (to a maximum of five times at 20th level).\nAt 12th level, she can spend two uses of this ability to disintegrate a corpse entirely as a full-round action, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust (a disintegrated creature\u0027s equipment is unaffected). The target cannot be an undead creature. A corpse disintegrated this way cannot be brought back to life except by resurrection or more powerful magic, including miracle or wish."
