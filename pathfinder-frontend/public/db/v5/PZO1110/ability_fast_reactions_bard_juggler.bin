At 1st level, a juggler gains Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat. At 5th level, he gains Snatch Arrows as a bonus feat. The juggler doesn't need to meet the prerequisites for these feats. The juggler can use the ability granted by these feats an additional time each round at 11th level (with a â€“5 penalty on his second attack roll) and at 17th level (with a â€“10 penalty on his third attack roll).ª*
