    "text": "At 4th level when the serpent-fire adept has her sacral chakra open and chooses to benefit from its power, her fly speed is equal to either her base land speed or her bonus to her base speed from the monk fast movement class ability (whichever is higher). She maintains this fly speed for a number of rounds equal to her Wisdom bonus (minimum 1 round), even if she closes her chakras."
