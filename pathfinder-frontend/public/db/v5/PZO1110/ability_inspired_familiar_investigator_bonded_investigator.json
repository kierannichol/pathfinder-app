    "text": "At 4th level, a bonded investigator\u0027s familiar becomes a cunning assistant to the investigator. The familiar can access the investigator\u0027s inspiration pool to augment its own actions; the use of inspiration is deducted from the investigator\u0027s number of daily uses as normal. The familiar can use the inspiration ability (and gains the increased benefits of investigator talents that affect the bonus dice used in this ability) but cannot expend uses of inspiration for other purposes."
