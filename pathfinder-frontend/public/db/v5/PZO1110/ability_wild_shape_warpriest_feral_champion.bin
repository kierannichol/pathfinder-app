Wild Shapearchetype_featureclass:warpriest#feral_championclass_feature¢Ñ
ÎAt 7th level, a feral champion gains wild shape, as the druid ability of the same name, and treats his warpriest level â€“ 3 as his effective druid level for the purposes of this ability. However, a feral champion does not gain the ability to take on elemental or plant forms with wild shape. A feral champion can use wild shape once per day at 7th level and one additional time per day every 4 levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 19th level.ª2
