    "text": "At 9th level, a hooded knight gains dimension door as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to his cavalier level. If the hooded knight is riding a mount, his mount does not count against the number of creatures he brings along with this ability. If the destination is not a road, the hooded knight is shunted to the nearest open space on a road, taking damage as described in the dimension door spell. The cavalier can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time for every 4 levels beyond 9th, to a maximum of three times per day at 17th level."
