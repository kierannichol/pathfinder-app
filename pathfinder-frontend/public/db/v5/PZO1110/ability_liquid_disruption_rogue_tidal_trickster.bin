àAt 4th level, a tidal trickster can use her knowledge of the cohesion of liquids to disrupt certain foes. She can deal sneak attack damage to oozes and creatures with the water subtype that are normally immune to precision damage (such as water elementals), and she ignores a hydrokineticist's chance to negate precision damage from elemental overflow.ª6
