ÈAt 8th level, the galvanic saboteur has gathered enough parts and scrap from his constructed enemies that he can infuse some of his attacks with a bit of their alien energy. Once per day as a standard action, the ranger can make a static strike as a melee attack at his full base attack bonus. If the attack hits, it deals an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage and the ranger can make an additional attack at his full base attack bonus against a foe that is adjacent to the previous foe and still within his reach, as if he had Cleave, except he doesn't take a â€“2 penalty to his AC and the second attack deals an additional 2d6 points of electricity damage.
At 12th level, the ranger can continue to make attacks against adjacent creatures, as if he had Greater Cleave, with each hit increasing the amount of electricity damage dealt to the next foe in line.
The ranger can use this ability twice per day at 14th level and three times per day at 20th level.ª5
