àA survivor's number of spells per day for each spell level is one less than normal (for example, a 4th-level survivor can cast three cantrips, two 2nd-level spells, and one 1st-level spell per day). If this reduces the number of spells for a level to 0, she gains only the bonus spells for that level she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score.ª5
