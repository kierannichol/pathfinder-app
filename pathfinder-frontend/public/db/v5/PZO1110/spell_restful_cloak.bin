£A cloak you are wearing transforms into a canvas tent large enough to hold four Medium creatures, firmly pitched in a flat area adjacent to you (if there is no such area, this spell simply fails). A creature regains 1 hit point for each hour it rests in the tent, in addition to any other benefits of resting. Additionally, a fatigued creature resting within the tent for 1 hour loses the fatigued condition, but a creature cannot recover from being fatigued more than once per casting of restful tent. At the end of the spell's duration, the tent transforms back into a cloak. If the tent is moved prior to the expiration of the spell's duration, the spell immediately ends.
