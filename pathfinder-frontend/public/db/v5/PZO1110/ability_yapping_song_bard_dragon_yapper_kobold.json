    "text": "A dragon yapper can use performance to annoy those that hear it, causing them to take a –1 penalty on attack and damage rolls (minimum 1) and a –1 penalty on saves against fear effects and charm effects as long as the dragon yapper continues performing.\nThis penalty increases by 1 at 5th level and every 6 levels thereafter. Yapping song is a mind-affecting ability that uses audible components, but is not language-dependent."
