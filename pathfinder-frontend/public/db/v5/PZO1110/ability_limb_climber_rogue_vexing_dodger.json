    "text": "When adjacent to or in the space of a corporeal creature at least one size category larger than herself, a vexing dodger can climb that creature\u0027s body with a successful Climb check against a DC equal to the target creature\u0027s CMD. Although the vexing dodger is holding on to the creature, this action isn\u0027t a grapple; it doesn\u0027t provoke attacks of opportunity from the creature, and neither the vexing dodger nor the creature she climbs gains the grappled condition. While the vexing dodger is on the climbed creature, the creature takes a penalty on attack rolls against the vexing dodger equal to the number of sneak attack dice the dodger possesses."
