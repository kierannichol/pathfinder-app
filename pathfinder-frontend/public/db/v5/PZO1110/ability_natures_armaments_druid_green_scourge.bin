á	A green scourge can lose a prepared 1st- or 2nd-level spell in order to cast shillelagh or flame blade, respectively. She can instead choose to lose a higher-level spell in order to increase the enhancement bonus of her shillelagh, or to add any of the following weapon special abilities to her shillelagh or flame blade: bane (aberrations only), frost, mighty cleaving, returning, shock, throwing, or vicious. If the target weapon is a quarterstaff, these bonuses apply to only one of its ends. If a flame blade gains the frost or shock special ability, the base damage of the spell changes to match the energy type; neither a flame blade nor shillelagh can gain both of these special abilities. A green scourge cannot add the throwing property to a flame blade unless she also adds the returning property.
When adding weapon special abilities or increasing the enhancement bonus, the final level of the spell expended is 1 higher than the base spell level (2nd for shillelagh and 3rd for flame blade), increased by the additional special abilities' total base price modifier. For example, creating an aberrationâ€“bane vicious flame blade requires spending a 5th-level spell slot, which also counts as a 5th-level spell for purposes of dispelling.ª4
