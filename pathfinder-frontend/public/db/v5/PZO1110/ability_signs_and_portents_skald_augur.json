    "text": "At 2nd level, an augur can read signs and portents to attempt to ascertain how events in the near future will play out. This allows the augur to cast augury as a spell-like ability. At 7th level, he can instead use signs and portents to cast divination as a spell-like ability, and at 12th level, he can instead cast commune as a spell-like ability. At 17th level, he can use signs and portents twice per day."
