    "text": "At 10th level, a grenadier\u0027s bombs become particularly overwhelming when they explode. Whenever a grenadier scores a successful critical hit with a bomb, the creature directly struck by that bomb is staggered for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC equals the bomb\u0027s Reflex save DC to avoid splash damage) reduces the duration to 1 round. The effects of this ability stack with a frost bomb\u0027s staggering effect, but not with the effects of the Staggering Critical feat. Additional hits from a staggering blast add to the effect\u0027s overall duration."
