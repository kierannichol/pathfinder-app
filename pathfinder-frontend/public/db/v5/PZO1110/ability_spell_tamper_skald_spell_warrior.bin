ÖAt 20th level, when a spell warrior successfully counterspells an opponent's spell, the opponent suffers a backlash of magical energy and takes 1d6 points of damage per spell level of the countered spell. If the opponent succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the skald's level + the skald's Charisma modifier), the damage is reduced by half. This damage is magical and is not subject to damage reduction or energy resistance.
This ability replaces master skald.ª/
