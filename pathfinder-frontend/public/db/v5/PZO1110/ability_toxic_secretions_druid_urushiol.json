    "text": "At 1st level, an urushiol\u0027s body becomes capable of producing a single dose of poison per day. At 3rd level and every 2 druid levels thereafter, the number of daily doses increases by 1, to a maximum of 10 doses at 19th level. The urushiol\u0027s daily doses are replenished when he regains his spells, but any of his weapons that are still poisoned with urushiol venom count against his daily limit. The urushiol is immune to his own poison and cannot accidentally poison himself when applying his own poison or attacking with a weapon coated with it. Regardless of the delivery method he chooses, his poison has the following base statistics.\nUrushiol Venom: type poison (varies); save Fort negates; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d3 Strength damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the urushiol\u0027s level + his Wisdom modifier.\nAt 1st level, an urushiol can secrete this poison as a numbing injury poison on a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or manufactured weapon by spending 1 of his daily doses as a standard action. He must choose a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or manufactured weapon in his hand that deals piercing or slashing damage and that is not already poisoned or poisonous. The weapon remains poisoned until the urushiol scores a hit with it, the weapon leaves his possession for more than 1 round, or the poison is wiped away.\nAt 4th level, an urushiol\u0027s body becomes so saturated with poison that even his flesh is poisonous.\nWhenever a creature damages the urushiol with a bite or swallow whole attack, the urushiol can release ingested poison into the creature by spending 1 of his daily doses as an immediate action.\nAt 7th level, an urushiol can spend 2 daily doses of his poison as a standard action to secrete a contact poison and coat one of his limbs with the secreted poison. The urushiol can deliver the poison by making a successful touch attack as a standard action, which can be part of the same standard action he used to secrete the poison. If the attack misses, the poison persists upon his limb throughout the subsequent rounds until he hits a target or touches something else with his poisoned limb.\nAt 11th level, an urushiol can spend 3 daily doses of his poison as a standard action to release a 20-foot-radius cloud of inhaled poison centered around him that lasts for 1 round.\nAt 14th level, an urushiol\u0027s venom changes in frequency to 1/round for 4 rounds. In addition, when using his urushiol venom, an urushiol can spend an extra dose of his poison to change the damage type of the poison to Dexterity damage or Constitution damage. He can use this alteration in combination with any of the other abilities. For example, he could spend a total of 3 doses to create a cloud of inhaled poison that deals Constitution damage."
