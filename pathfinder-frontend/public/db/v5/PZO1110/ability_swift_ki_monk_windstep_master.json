During this time, the windstep master can remain airborne even if he doesn\u0027t reach a solid surface.\nHe can also spend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to increase his wind step distance by 20 feet for 1 round.\nThe windstep master does not gain the ability to spend ki to increase his base speed by 20 feet for 1 round."
