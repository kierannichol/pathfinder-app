»At 15th level, a seeker becomes skilled at modifying his bloodline spells with metamagic. When a seeker applies a metamagic feat to any bonus spells granted by his bloodline, he reduces the metamagic feat's spell level adjustment by 1. Thus, applying a Metamagic feat like Still Spell to a spell does not change its effective spell level at all, while applying Quicken Spell only increases the spell's effective spell level by 3 instead of by 4. This reduction to the spell level adjustment for Metamagic feats does not stack with similar reductions from other abilities.ª+
