¢At 3rd level, a child of war gains eldritch armor training. This functions as armor training, except as a swift action she can also reduce the arcane spell failure chance due to armor she is wearing by 15% for any spells she casts this round. This reduction increases to 20% at 7th level, 25% at 11th level, and 30% at 15th level. In addition, if she has Arcane Armor Training or Arcane Armor Mastery, rather than having their normal effects, each of those feats increases the arcane spell failure reduction of her eldritch armor training by 10%.ª;
