    "text": "As a standard action, a stone warder can create a warding rune in any adjacent square. The stone warder selects a sorcerer spell known that is at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell she can cast, and casts it as part of creating the rune of warding. The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less, and it must target one or more creatures. Rather than have its normal effect, the spell is stored in the rune. The first creature to enter the square triggers the rune of warding, and becomes the target of the selected spell. Regardless of the number of targets the spell can normally affect, it affects only the creature that triggers the rune.\nThe rune is invisible and lasts a number of rounds equal to the stone warder\u0027s level or until discharged. If placed on a solid rock or stone surface, it instead lasts 1 minute per sorcerer level the stone warder has or until discharged. The stone warder cannot create a rune of warding in a square occupied by an existing rune of warding or another creature.\nThe rune counts as a spell of the same level as the spell stored within it for the purposes of dispelling. It is considered a magic trap and can be discovered with a successful Perception check (DC \u003d 25 + the level of the stored spell) and disarmed with a successful Disable Device check (DC \u003d 25 + the level of the stored spell). The stone warder can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier."
