×An appeaser channels negative energy, but also gains limited access to positive energy.
At 5th level, an appeaser can channel positive energy as a full-round action, but he treats his cleric level as if it were 4 lower when determining the amount of damage he can deal to undead and the amount of hit points he can restore to living creatures.ª.
