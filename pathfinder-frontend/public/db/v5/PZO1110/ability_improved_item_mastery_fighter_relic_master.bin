At 3rd level, once per day, a relic master can use a item mastery feat she knows with a magic item that doesn't have an appropriate spell in its construction requirements. The magic item must meet all other requirements of the item mastery feat. Alternatively, if she is using a magic item with an appropriate spell in its construction requirements, she can use an item mastery feat without it counting against the feat's total uses per day. She can use this ability one additional time per day at 7th, 11th, and 15th levels.ª9
