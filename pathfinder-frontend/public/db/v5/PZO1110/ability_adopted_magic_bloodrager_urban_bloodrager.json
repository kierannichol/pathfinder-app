    "text": "At 7th level, an urban bloodrager learns some of the secrets of other magical traditions from other denizens of the city. She can select from the bard or magus spell list any spell of a level she can cast, and add it to her bloodrager spell list and to her bloodrager spells known.\nAt 10th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the urban bloodrager can add another such spell to her spell list and spells known. If she chooses to learn a new spell in place of an old one, she can exchange a bard or magus spell for another.\nThis ability replaces damage reduction."
