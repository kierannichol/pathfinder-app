Nonmagical fires are automatically extinguished, and all creatures and objects in the area gain fire resistance 5. The conjured water is conductive, and whenever a doused creature takes electricity damage, it takes 1 additional point of electricity damage. At 6th, 12th, and 18th levels, the fire resistance increases by 5 and the additional electricity damage increases by 1 point."
