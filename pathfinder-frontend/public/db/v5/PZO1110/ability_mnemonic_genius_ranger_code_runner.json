    "text": "A code runner learns to memorize and accurately recall information, even if he does not speak or understand the language in which the information was presented. The code runner can spend 1 hour and attempt a DC 15 Linguistics check to memorize a single passage of up to 150 words of information in a language he speaks.\nFor every 5 by which he exceeds the DC, he can memorize 150 additional words. The DC is increased by 10 if the message is encoded or in a language he doesn\u0027t understand. A code runner can memorize one such message at any given time. If he fails to memorize a message, he can retry as many times as he wants, as long as he spends 1 hour each time. Once a message has been memorized, he can recall it with perfect accuracy until he memorizes a different message."
