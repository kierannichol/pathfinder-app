èA blightwarden's first favored enemy is always a special type of creature: blighted. His bonuses from his first favored enemy apply to creatures with one or more of the following templates: blighted fey, fungal creature, fungoid, Mana Wastes mutant, mutant, mutant goblin, and plagued beast. Additionally, the bonuses apply against creatures with the blight subtype.
Each time the blightwarden gains a new favored enemy, his additional +2 bonus always applies to this first favored enemy.ª4
