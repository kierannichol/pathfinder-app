    "text": "You imitate the mad cacophony created by the awful beings associated with the Outer God, Azathoth. This spell targets only creatures with the ooze type, creatures with the amorphous special ability, and non-bipedal creatures with a special association with the Outer Gods. This music draws the targets\u0027 attention to the caster, as per the fascinate bardic performance. It affects mindless creatures despite the mindless quality typically granting immunity to mind-affecting effects, though it doesn\u0027t ignore any other immunity to mind-affecting effects the creature might have. The caster doesn\u0027t have to maintain the effect each round--the music continues for the duration of the spell. Creatures fascinated by mad sultan\u0027s melody become immune to any other casting of the spell for 24 hours after the spell ends, and the spell ends if the fascination breaks on any of its targets for any reason (such as an attack)."
