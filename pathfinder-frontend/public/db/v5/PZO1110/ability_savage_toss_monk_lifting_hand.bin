åA lifting hand gains Savage Slam as a bonus feat, even if she doesn't meet the prerequisites.
At 4th level, when the lifting hand succeeds at her grapple combat maneuver check while using the Savage Slam feat and her grapple combat maneuver check result exceeds the opponent's CMD by at least 5, she can throw the opponent into an non-adjacent square. The lifting hand can throw the opponent 10 feet, plus an additional 5 feet for every 5 by which her grapple check exceeds the opponent's CMD. For instance, if the lifting monk exceeds the target's CMD by 15, she can throw the target into a square 20 feet away.
At 8th level, when using Savage Slam, the lifting hand's target no longer receives a bonus to its CMD when the lifting hand attempts to throw it into a dangerous area.™,
