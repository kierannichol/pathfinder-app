    "text": "A wyrm sniper swaps a trio of deeds for the following deeds.\nMunitions Master: At 7th level, a wyrm sniper can spend 1 grit point to reduce the number of full-round actions (or move actions, if the sniper has the Master Siege Engineer feat) required to load a light siege engine by 1. This deed replaces the gunslinger\u0027s startling shot deed.\nSkeleton Crew: At 11th level, as long as a wyrm sniper has at least 1 grit point, she treats all light siege engines as requiring a crew of one fewer than normal to operate (minimum 1). This deed replaces the gunslinger\u0027s lightning reload deed.\nAnti-Air Targeting: At 15th level, whenever a wyrm sniper targets a creature\u0027s wings with the targeting deed, the wyrm sniper completely disables one of the creature\u0027s wings on a successful hit. If the wyrm sniper hits her target, the creature falls to the ground, regardless of its altitude, taking the appropriate amount of falling damage as a result. As long as the target has at least one functioning wing, it may attempt a DC 20 Fly check to gain the benefits of feather fall instead of plummeting to the ground. In either case, it must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the wyrm sniper\u0027s level + the wyrm sniper\u0027s Wisdom modifier) or fall prone when reaching the ground."
