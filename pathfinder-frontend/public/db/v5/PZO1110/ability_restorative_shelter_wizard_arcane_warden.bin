ûWhile an arcane warden can find refuge in many naturally occurring hideaways, his preferred places of rest are magically created cottages, homes, and even manors. An arcane warden learns the following spells: mage's magnificent mansion, rope trick, secure shelter, and tiny hut. These spells do not take up room in the arcane warden's spellbook, and he does not need his spellbook to prepare these spells. He must still be the appropriate level to prepare the spell in question. The arcane warden's caster level is treated as 2 higher than his actual caster level for the purposes of determining the duration of these spells and resolving attempts to dispel these spells. Any creature that spends at least 8 hours relaxing in one of these shelters gains a bonus equal to the level of the spell that created it on any saving throws against disease or poison effects made in the next 24 hours.ª7
