ÀAt 8th level, when a vexing dodger attempts a dirty trick maneuver against a creature she's climbing, she gets a bonus on the combat maneuver check equal to the number of sneak attack dice she has.
If she chooses to sicken the target with her dirty trick and succeeds at her combat maneuver check, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vexing dodger's level + her Intelligence modifier) or be nauseated for 1 round.ª6
