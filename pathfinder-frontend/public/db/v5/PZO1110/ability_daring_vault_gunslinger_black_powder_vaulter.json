    "text": "A black powder vaulter can spend 1 grit point as a swift action to increase her land speed by 20 feet (gaining the appropriate bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump) until the end of her turn. If the black powder vaulter jumps while affected by this deed, she can make a second jump while midair if she is adjacent to a wall, column, or other solid, permanent structure. The second jump counts as having a running start even if the direction is different from the first jump."
