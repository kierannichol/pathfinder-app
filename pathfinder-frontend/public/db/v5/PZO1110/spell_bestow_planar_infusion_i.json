    "text": "This spell draws upon the latent planar energy of the caster\u0027s surroundings, allowing her to temporarily infuse a creature with the plane\u0027s power. The touched creature gains that plane\u0027s basic infusion for the spell\u0027s duration. This spell has no effect if cast on the Material Plane, and it ends as soon as the spell\u0027s target leaves the plane with which it has been infused. Details on planar infusions can be found in each plane\u0027s Infusion section (listed here)."
