žA dinosaur druid specializes in assuming the form of dinosaurs when using wild shape. When she assumes the form of a dinosaur via wild shape, she gains a +2 size bonus to her Constitution in addition to the other modifiers granted by beast shape. When she uses wild shape to assume the form of a creature other than a dinosaur, the wild shape effect lasts for only 1 minute per level, rather than 1 hour per level.ª2
