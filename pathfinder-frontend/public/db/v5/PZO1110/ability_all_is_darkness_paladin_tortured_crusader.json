    "text": "Everything around a tortured crusader is so bleak that detecting evil only reminds her that the odds are always against her. A tortured crusader doesn\u0027t gain the detect evil or divine grace class features. At 1st level, a tortured crusader gains the smite evil ability, but she doesn\u0027t add her Charisma bonus to attack rolls or a deflection bonus equal to her Charisma bonus to her AC against the target of her smite. At 2nd level, she adds a +4 bonus to attack rolls and a +4 deflection bonus to AC against the target of her smite."
