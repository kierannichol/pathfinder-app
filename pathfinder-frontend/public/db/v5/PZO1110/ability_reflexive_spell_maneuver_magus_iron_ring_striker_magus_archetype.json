    "text": "At 16th level, when an iron-ring striker is the target of a combat maneuver check to bull rush, disarm, sunder, or trip, as an immediate action he can target his attacker with a magus spell he has prepared with a range of touch. If the spell would normally require a touch attack, an iron-ring striker can attempt a combat maneuver check for this attack instead. The iron-ring striker must be wearing light armor or no armor to use reflexive spell maneuver."
