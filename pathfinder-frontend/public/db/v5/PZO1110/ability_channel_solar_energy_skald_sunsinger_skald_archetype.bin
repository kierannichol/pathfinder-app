·At 5th level, a sunsinger skald can channel energy as a cleric once per day to heal wounds or harm undead like a good-aligned cleric. When she does so, she fills the area affected by the channeled energy with light, and can outline creatures in the area of effect as per faerie fire. The sunsinger uses her skald level as her effective cleric level when channeling positive energy. Undead who are particularly harmed by sunlight take a â€“2 penalty on saving throws against this channeled energy, and take 1 additional point of damage per die of damage dealt by the effect.
At 11th level, a sunsinger can channel energy twice per day. At 17th level, she can use this ability three times per day.ªC
