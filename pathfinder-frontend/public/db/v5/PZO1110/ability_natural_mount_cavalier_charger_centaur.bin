ŒA charger counts as having the Mounted Combat feat only for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites, and substitutes the Acrobatics skill for any Ride skill prerequisites when acquiring feats that have Mounted Combat as a prerequisite. Because of his equine form, a charger can wield a lance one-handed as if mounted and deals double damage with a lance while charging. A charger can never gain the benefit of the Mounted Combat feat (or other similar feats or effects, such as Trick Riding) if ridden by another creature.ª5
