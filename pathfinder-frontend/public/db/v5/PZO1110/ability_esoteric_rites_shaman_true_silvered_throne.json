    "text": "At 8th level, a true silvered throne gains a +1 insight bonus on skill checks attempted as part of an occult ritual. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 shaman levels beyond 8th (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). If the true silvered throne is the ritual\u0027s primary caster, he also adds this bonus to the caster level of the ritual\u0027s effect."
