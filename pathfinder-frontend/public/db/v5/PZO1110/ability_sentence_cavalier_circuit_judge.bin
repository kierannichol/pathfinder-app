¶Once per day as a swift action, the circuit judge can choose one target within sight to sentence. The circuit judge gains the potential for a variety of bonuses related to that target. The circuit judge chooses the form of these benefits from the following list of inquisitor judgments: destruction, justice, protection, purity, or smiting.
The benefits of these judgments apply only to the circuit judge and the target--the protection judgment's bonus to Armor Class, for example, applies only to attacks made by the sentenced target (not any creature who attacks the circuit judge while the judgment is active). Treat the circuit judge's level as her inquisitor level for the purposes of determining how these judgments increase in power. The circuit judge can use this ability twice per day at 1st level, plus two additional times per day for every 3 cavalier levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of 14 times per day at 19th level. She can switch her sentence as a swift action, but doing so expends an additional daily use of this ability.
Sentencing a foe requires much of the circuit judge's concentration. The circuit judge takes a â€“2 penalty to her Armor Class, except against attacks made by the target of her sentence.
The sentence remains in effect either until the target is dead or unconscious or until the combat ends.
Sentences are considered challenges for the purposes of the effects listed in the challenge section describing the cavalier's order.ª.
