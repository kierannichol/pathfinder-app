    "text": "At 4th level, a provocateur can cause all observers fascinated by her fascinate performance to become less friendly to a target creature or group of her choice for 10 minutes per bard level. Affected observers\u0027 attitudes toward the target, the target\u0027s influence with affected observers, and affected observers\u0027 trust level as contacts for the target are all reduced by one step. If she reveals information during the performance that would reduce those creatures\u0027 attitudes anyway, those attitudes worsen by an additional step for the duration.\nIf the provocateur engages in a verbal duel against the target with an audience affected by damning performance, she automatically gains two edges.\nAt 18th level, the duration increases to 1 day per bard level."
