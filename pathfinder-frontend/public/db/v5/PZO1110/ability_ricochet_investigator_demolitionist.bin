”At 3rd level as a standard action, the demolitionist can attack an adjacent wall or object with a melee weapon. On a hit, he creates a 15-foot-cone of rock shards or splinters that deals 2d6 points of damage to targets in the area of effect. A target can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the demolitionist's level + his Intelligence modifier) to reduce this damage by half. At 9th level, the damage increases to 4d6, and the investigator can create this effect with a ranged weapon by targeting a wall or object within 30 feet.ª2
