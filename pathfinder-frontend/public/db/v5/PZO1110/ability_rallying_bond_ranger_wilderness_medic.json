    "text": "At 4th level, a wilderness medic must choose his companions for his hunter\u0027s bond.\nAt 9th level, the wilderness medic can encourage all of his companions when he uses his hunter\u0027s bond to benefit his companions (see the ranger\u0027s hunter\u0027s bond ability for more details). As a free action when the wilderness medic uses a move action to grant affected allies half his favored enemy bonus, he can also grant affected allies the benefits of remove fear. The wilderness medic can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier.\nAt 14th level, when the wilderness medic uses this ability, he can instead affect all allies that benefit from his hunter\u0027s bond with blessing of fervor, using his ranger level as his caster level."
