¨At 3rd level, a fist of the gods can cast detect chaos three times per day as a spell-like ability, using his warpriest level as his caster level. If the fist of the gods already has, or later gains, the ability to cast detect chaos, then he can cast detect chaos at will as a spell-like ability.ª6
