ÜAt 1st level, an infiltrator can use disguise with great results. When disguising himself as a different gender, race, age category, or size category, an infiltrator reduces the penalties for each by â€“2. For example, if the infiltrator disguises himself as a female two age categories older than himself, he would take a â€“2 to the check instead of a â€“6. Also, an infiltrator can disguise himself with 1d3 minutes of work (instead of the normal 1d3 ? 10 minutes of work).ª:
