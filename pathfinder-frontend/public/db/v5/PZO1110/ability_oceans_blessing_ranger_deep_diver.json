    "text": "A deep diver adds buoyancy, control water, elemental speech (water only), hydraulic push, hydraulic torrent, ride the waves, river whip, water breathing, and wave shield to his ranger spell list at the same spell level as they appear on the cleric spell list or sorcerer/wizard spell list, whichever is lower. He still must select them as spells known, as normal."
