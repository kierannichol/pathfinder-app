    "text": ": At 1st level, you gain an arcane bond, as a wizard equal to your sorcerer level. Your sorcerer levels stack with any wizard levels you possess when determining the powers of your familiar or bonded object. This ability does not allow you to have both a familiar and a bonded item. Once per day, your bonded item allows you to cast any one of your spells known (unlike a wizard\u0027s bonded item, which allows him to cast any one spell in his spellbook)."
