    "text": "At 2nd level, when a portal seeker detects a portal, she can attempt a Knowledge (planes) check (DC \u003d 15 + the portal\u0027s caster level, or DC 25 if the caster level isn\u0027t specified) to determine the portal\u0027s destination plane. If her result exceeds the DC by 5 or more, she also determines the rough location on the destination plane where the portal leads, and if the result exceeds the DC by 10 or more, she also determines any command words, portal keys, and other necessary elements needed to open the portal."
