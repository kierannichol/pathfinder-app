¹At 9th level, a seasoned commander gains an additional daily use of his inspiring speech ability, and he can also choose to use his inspiring speech to grant the effects of inspire greatness to one ally (instead of inspire courage). For every 2 levels a seasoned commander attains beyond 9th, he can target one additional ally while using this ability (up to a maximum of six at 19th level). This ability functions in all other respects like the seasoned commander's inspire courage ability. Whichever inspiring speech he chooses to use, if the seasoned commander uses an inspiring speech before the duration of his previous inspiring speech ends, the new inspiring speech replaces the old speech.ª;
