×Beginning at 15th level, the harrow warden can strike a target with enough force to realign its place in the world. Foes damaged by the harrow warden's idiot strike can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wisdom modifier). Those that fail are transmuted into a harmless form, as per the baleful polymorph spell.ª0
