éAt 5th level, when a totem channeler starts an inspired rage raging song and adds a totem rage power, he can add totem rage powers from a different group. Adding or maintaining totem rage powers from the additional group requires spending 1 additional round of raging song each round. He can activate up to two additional totem groups at 11th level and up to three additional totem groups at 17th level. He must spend 1 additional round of raging song each round for each additional totem group.
If the totem channeler does not have enough rounds of raging song remaining to maintain his inspired rage, the song ends.ª2
