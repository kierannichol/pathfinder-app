    "text": "At 3rd level, a fearsome defender exudes hostility, creating a threatening atmosphere in her presence. The fearsome defender gains a +1 bonus on Intimidate checks, and the DCs of Intimidate checks to demoralize her allies within 30 feet increase by 1. Both the bonus and the increase to DCs increase by 1 at 6th level and every 3 barbarian levels thereafter."
