    "text": "A firebrand uses her Charisma instead of Wisdom to determine the number of grit points she gains at the start of each day and to determine the DCs of her gunslinger deeds. A firebrand treats direct hits with her bombs as firearm attacks for the purpose of regaining grit. This ability works in all other ways like the gunslinger\u0027s grit class feature.\nThis ability alters grit."
