    "text": "At 3rd level, a skirmisher learns to be more maneuverable while wearing light or no armor. He gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor and while carrying no more than a light load. Anything that causes the skirmisher to lose his Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the skirmisher to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of +4 at 15th level).\nIn addition, a skirmisher gains an enhancement bonus of +5 feet to his base speed. At 7th level, the bonus increases to +10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor or light armor, and when he is carrying no more than a light load."
