íAt 8th level, the vellemancer adds the following spells to her familiar for free: bear's endurance, bull's strength, cat's grace, eagle's splendor, fox's cunning, and owl's wisdom. The vellemancer can cast these spells only as part of her wishgranter ability, but she can sacrifice any prepared spell of 2nd level or lower to spontaneously cast one of these spells.ª5
