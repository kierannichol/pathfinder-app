In addition, whenever she confirms a critical hit against a foe that is in an area of dim light, that foe is blinded for 1d6 rounds.\nThis ability replaces master strike.\nRogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement the shadow scion archetype: false friend, fast stealth, slow reactions, surprise attack, and underhanded."
