    "text": "At 11th level, when a wild soul hits an arcane spellcaster, a creature with extract slots, or a creature with grit (but not grit-like pools such as panache) with a weapon attack, the target either loses its highest-level available spell or extract slot or loses 1 point of grit, and the wild soul gains 5 temporary hit points. A target of this ability can negate this effect with a successful Fortitude save (DC \u003d 10 + half the ranger\u0027s level + his Wisdom modifier). Regardless of the outcome of the saving throw, the target is immune to this ability for 24 hours."
