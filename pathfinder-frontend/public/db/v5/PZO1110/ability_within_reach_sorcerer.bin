Ã: At 15th level, your ultimate destiny is drawing near. Once per day, when an attack or spell that causes damage would result in your death, you may attempt a DC 20 Will save. If successful, you are instead reduced to â€“1 hit points and are automatically stabilized. The bonus from your fated ability applies to this save.ª#!
