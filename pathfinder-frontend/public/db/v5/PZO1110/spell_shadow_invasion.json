    "text": "Using a slashing motion with the spell\u0027s focus as part of the casting of shadow invasion, you cut open a rift to the Plane of Shadow that fills a 30-foot area with shadowy energies. This area is stationary and becomes dark and gloomy, reducing the light level by one step (as darkness). Certain spells are enhanced within the area; spells of the shadow subschool that have reduced effects when disbelieved (such as shadow evocation) have their reduced effects increased by 20% (to a maximum of 90%) when determining their effects on targets within the area of shadow invasion."
