    "text": "At 4th level, a leshy warden can either grant her leaf leshy a +2 increase to Strength and Dexterity or transform it into a gourd leshy. At 8th level, the leshy warden can either grant her current leshy a +2 increase to Strength and Dexterity or transform it into a fungus leshy. At 12th level, she can either grant her current leshy a final +2 increase to Strength and Dexterity or transform it into a seaweed leshy. If the leshy is transformed, it gains the normal ability scores of its new form; ability score increases granted by this ability don\u0027t carry over to its new form."
