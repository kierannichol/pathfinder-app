    "text": "When a deep shaman uses beckoning chill on a creature in the water, that creature becomes fatigued due to hypothermia for the duration, and it also becomes entangled if the creature takes damage from he deep shaman\u0027s spirit abilities and from spells and abilities with the water descriptor. Her crashing waves hex applies to her spirit abilities that deal damage as if they were spells with the water descriptor, raising her effective shaman level for those abilities. Instead of mist\u0027s shroud and watersight, she can select the two hexes below."
