    "text": "At 4th level, a drovier can imbue her allies (including herself ) with an aspect of a wild animal. As a standard action, she chooses an animal totem and grants the abilities of that totem to every ally within 30 feet. This otherwise functions like the spell animal aspect. She can use this ability for 10 minutes per druid level each day. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 10-minute increments. If she uses the ability to grant a new aspect, any previous aspect immediately ends.\nAt 6th level, the drovier\u0027s communal aspect ability grants the benefits of the spell greater animal aspect. The drovier can still choose only one aspect to grant her allies.\nAt 8th level, the drovier can choose to grant her allies the benefits of the spell aspect of the falcon instead of an animal aspect.\nAt 10th level, the drovier can choose to grant her allies the benefits of the spell aspect of the bear instead of an animal aspect.\nAt 12th level, the drovier can choose to grant her allies the benefits of the spell aspect of the stag instead of an animal aspect.\nAt 14th level, the drovier can choose to grant her allies the benefits of the spell aspect of the wolf rather than an animal aspect.\nAt 20th level, the drovier can use this ability at will."
