¡At 7th level, a softstrike monk can use wholeness of body on both himself and other creatures, though it heals only nonlethal damage. If he uses this ability on an unconscious foe, he can spend 1 additional ki point to force the creature to accept a pact of life. The creature must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the softstrike monk's level + his Wisdom modifier) or the pact renders it unable to directly attack the monk and any allies within 60 feet, as per sanctuary, for a number of days equal to the softstrike monk's level.ª@
