At 3rd level, an overseer gains the ability to cast any of her mind-affecting spells that target a single creature through her spirit animal. When she's using this ability, the selected spell's range becomes touch, and she must deliver the spell through the spirit animal via the spirit animal's deliver touch spells supernatural ability. The shaman's effective caster level for these spells is 2 higher than her normal caster level. The overseer can deliver any other spells via the deliver touch spells spirit animal ability.ª+
