¢At 3rd level and every 4 cleric levels thereafter, a divine scourge can select the following hexes from the witch class hex list, up to a maximum of five hexes at 19th level: blight, cursed wound, evil eye, misfortune, scar, slumber, and unnerve beasts.
At 11th level, a divine scourge can instead select from the following list of major hexes: agony, hoarfrost, infected wounds, nightmares, and retributions.
The divine scourge uses her Wisdom modifier instead of her Intelligence modifier to determine the save DCs of her hexes. Any hex that refers to using her Intelligence modifier to determine its duration or effect instead uses her Charisma modifier for that purpose.ª1
