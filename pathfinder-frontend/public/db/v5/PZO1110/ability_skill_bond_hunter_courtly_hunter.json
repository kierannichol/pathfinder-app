    "text": "At 3rd level, a courtly hunter\u0027s animal companion gains the courtly hunter\u0027s class skills as class skills. Her animal companion can use the courtly hunter\u0027s skill ranks in a skill in place of its own, but only to a maximum of the courtly hunter\u0027s hunter level (for instance, if a character had 3 levels in courtly hunter and 5 ranks in Diplomacy, her animal companion could either share 3 ranks with skill bond or use its own ranks, whichever would result in a higher total skill bonus)."
