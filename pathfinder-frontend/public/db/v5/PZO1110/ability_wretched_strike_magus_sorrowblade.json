    "text": "At 12th level, the sorrowblade can cause foes to lose all hope. By spending 1 point from her arcane pool as a swift action, she can imbue the weapon she is wielding with the power of unbridled pessimism. The first creature she strikes with this weapon within the next minute must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC \u003d to + 1/2 the sorrowblade\u0027s magus level + her intelligence modifier) or take a -2 penalty an attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls for 1 hour. Additionally, during this time, the creature can\u0027t gain morale bonuses of any kind, and whenever the creature rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll or saving throw, fails an ability or skill check by more than 5, or takes additional damage as a result of a foe\u0027s confirmed critical hit, the penalty on rolls imposed by the wretched strike becomes -3 for 1 round. This increased penalty doesn\u0027t stack, even if multiple catastrophes occur on the same round."
