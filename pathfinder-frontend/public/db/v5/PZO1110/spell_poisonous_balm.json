    "text": "You mend the target\u0027s injuries, curing 3d8 hit points + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15) as cure serious wounds, but leaving its body laced with a subtle toxin that remains inert until you activate it. A target that decides to attempt the Will save and succeeds is healed for half (as cure serious wounds) and negates the toxin. Otherwise, you can activate the toxin by concentrating on the spell as a standard action, at which point the victim takes 1d3 points of Strength damage per round for 6 rounds. Once the poison is active, the target can attempt a Fortitude save each round to negate that round\u0027s damage and end the affliction. If you don\u0027t trigger the poison for 1 hour, the spell ends and leaves the target unharmed."
