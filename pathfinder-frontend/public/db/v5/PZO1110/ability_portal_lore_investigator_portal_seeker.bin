ÿAt 2nd level, when a portal seeker detects a portal, she can attempt a Knowledge (planes) check (DC = 15 + the portal's caster level, or DC 25 if the caster level isn't specified) to determine the portal's destination plane. If her result exceeds the DC by 5 or more, she also determines the rough location on the destination plane where the portal leads, and if the result exceeds the DC by 10 or more, she also determines any command words, portal keys, and other necessary elements needed to open the portal.ª5
