    "text": "Fungal spores become fully integrated into the druid\u0027s body, inside and out. At 15th level, she gains all immunities granted by the plant creature type as well as the light sensitivity universal monster rule. She counts as a plant for the purposes of effects that would negatively affect or damage plants. In addition, she no longer needs to eat or sleep in the typical manner, and instead gains the fungal creature\u0027s rejuvenation ability. She can perform her daily meditation during her rejuvenation."
