    "text": "At 3rd level, once per day when the banishing warden confirms a critical hit against a target of her smite evil effect, she can attempt to forcibly banish the target to its home plane. The creature struck must succeed at a Will save (DC \u003d 10 + half the banishing warden\u0027s level + the banishing warden\u0027s Charisma modifier) or be sent back to its home plane as per dismissal. At 10th level, a creature dismissed in this manner takes an amount of damage equal to 2 points per paladin level at the start of its next turn. The banishing warden gains an additional daily use of this ability at 9th and 15th level."
