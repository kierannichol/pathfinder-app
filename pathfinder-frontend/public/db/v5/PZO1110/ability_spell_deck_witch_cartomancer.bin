Spell Deckclass:witch#cartomancerarchetype_featureclass_feature¢‹
ˆEach cartomancer carries a special harrow deck that allows her to communicate with her patron. Its ability to hold spells functions identically to the way a witch's spells are granted by her familiar. The cartomancer must consult her harrow deck each day to prepare her spells and cannot prepare spells that are not stored in the deck. The spell deck cannot be used for this purpose if any cards are missing.
This ability replaces the witch's familiar.
