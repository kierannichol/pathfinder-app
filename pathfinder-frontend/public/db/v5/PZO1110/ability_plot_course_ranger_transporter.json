    "text": "At 3rd level, a transporter can spend 1d4 hours and attempt a DC 15 Knowledge (geography) check to plot a subtle course of travel between his current location and another destination. The transporter\u0027s course of travel is almost never direct, as it is optimized for smuggling. Thereafter, the transporter gains a +2 bonus on initiative, Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks involving traveling along his plotted course.\nAt 8th level, if the transporter\u0027s Knowledge (geography) check exceeds the DC by 10, the bonuses increase to +4. At 13th level, if his Knowledge (geography) check exceeds the DC by 20, the bonuses increase to +6, and at 18th level, if the transporter\u0027s check exceeds the DC by 30, the bonuses increase to +8.\nA transporter can gain the benefits of only a single plotted course at any given time. If the transporter ever strays from the course or attempts to plot a new course for any reason, he loses the benefits of his current course immediately. A transporter can retry his Knowledge (geography) check to plot a course as long as he spends 1d4 hours each time."
