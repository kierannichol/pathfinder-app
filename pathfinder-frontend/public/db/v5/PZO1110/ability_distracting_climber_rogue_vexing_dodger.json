    "text": "At 8th level, when a vexing dodger attempts a dirty trick maneuver against a creature she\u0027s climbing, she gets a bonus on the combat maneuver check equal to the number of sneak attack dice she has.\nIf she chooses to sicken the target with her dirty trick and succeeds at her combat maneuver check, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 the vexing dodger\u0027s level + her Intelligence modifier) or be nauseated for 1 round."
