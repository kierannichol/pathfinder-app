Ã	Beginning at 6th level, a vellemancer can borrow mental strength from others' hopes and dreams to empower her own spellcasting. A creature can make a wish as a free action at any time, even during the vellemancer's turn. The vellemancer must be able to hear and understand a wish in order to use it as a spell component. A spell that doesn't normally have a verbal component gains one when cast using this ability. A wish doesn't need to mention the name of a specific spell, but it must describe an outcome that can be accomplished by casting a spell the vellemancer knows (for example, wishing to be more likable could supply the verbal component for alter self, eagle's splendor, or even baleful polymorph, depending on the results). A vellemancer gains a +1 bonus to her caster level when using a creature's wish as a verbal component in this manner, but she cannot include herself as a target of such spells. She can be affected by such a spell if it affects an area rather than one or more targets. A vellemancer is under no compulsion to grant a creature's wish. Once the vellemancer grants a creature's wish using this ability, she cannot use this ability to grant that creature any further wishes for 24 hours.ª,
