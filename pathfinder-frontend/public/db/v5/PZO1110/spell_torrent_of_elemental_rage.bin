ôA shimmering torrent of raw elemental power springs into existence, originating from your outstretched palms. The blast resembles a horizontal whirlwind of howling winds, searing flame, and tumbling shrapnel of ice and metal. Any creature in the area of effect must make a Reflex save or take 8d6 points of damage from a variety of effects--2d6 points of fire damage, 2d6 points of cold damage, 2d6 points of sonic damage, and 2d6 points of slashing damage that overcomes adamantine damage reduction.
