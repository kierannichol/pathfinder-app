    "text": "At 3rd level, a makeshift scrapper gains the ability to enhance an item, making it a more effective weapon or changing the way it can be used. As a swift action, she can alter a single improvised weapon to either grant it a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls or use it to gain a +1 shield bonus to her AC. The makeshift scrapper can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to her rogue level. These rounds need not be consecutive, and the makeshift scrapper can change the enhancement each time she activates the ability. The bonus increases by 1 every 4 levels thereafter, up to a maximum bonus of +5 at 19th level."
