ÎAt 20th level, a dune rider can use the desert's heat to finish off his foes. As a standard action, he can make a single attack at his full base attack bonus while in warm desert, hills, or mountains, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude save or suffer the additional effect. The DC of this save is 20 + the dune rider's Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds, it can't be targeted by this ability again for 24 hours.ª/
