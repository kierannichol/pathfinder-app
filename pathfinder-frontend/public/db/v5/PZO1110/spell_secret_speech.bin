This spell grants the target the ability to send secret messages embedded within normal speech. This is similar to the secret messages ability of the Bluff skill, but no check is needed; the speaker's intended recipient always understands the hidden message perfectly, but other listeners cannot perceive the message at all. The target can send only one message at a time, though it can send that message to multiple listeners. The secret message is considered to be in the same language the target is speaking, and intended recipients hear and understand both the actual speech and the secret message. The target can make itself understood as far as its voice carries.
