›At 2nd level, a fermenter under the influence can make her bombs more potent, but they also become unstable and more difficult to aim. As long as the fermenter is under the effects of a drug or tincture, or has imbibed an alcoholic drink in the past 10 minutes, her bombs deal 1 additional point of damage per damage die. While this ability is in effect, she also takes a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls made with her bombs. At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, this penalty increases by 1 (to a maximum penalty of â€“5 at 19th level).ª1
