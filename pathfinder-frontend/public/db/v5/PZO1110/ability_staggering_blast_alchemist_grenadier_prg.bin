´At 10th level, a grenadier's bombs become particularly overwhelming when they explode.
Whenever a grenadier confirms a critical hit with a bomb, the creature directly struck by that bomb is staggered for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful Fortitude saving throw (DC equals the bomb's Reflex save DC to avoid splash damage) reduces the duration to 1 round. The effects of this ability stack with a frost bomb's staggering effect, but not with the effects of the Staggering Critical feat. Additional critical hits with bombs add to any duration remaining from previous ones.ª7
