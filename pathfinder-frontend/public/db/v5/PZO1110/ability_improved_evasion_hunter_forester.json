    "text": "At 11th level, a forester\u0027s evasion improves. Improved evasion works like evasion, except while the forester still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, she takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless forester does not gain the benefit of improved evasion."
