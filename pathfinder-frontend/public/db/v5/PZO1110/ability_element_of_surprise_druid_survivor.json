    "text": "At 4th level, if a survivor makes a successful attack during a surprise round against a target that is unaware of her, her victim takes a penalty on its initiative check during the following round equal to half the damage dealt by the survivor\u0027s attack (minimum 0, maximum equal to the survivor\u0027s class level). This cannot reduce an initiative result below 1."
