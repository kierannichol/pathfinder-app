åAn energist's bombs deal damage based on the energy he chose at 1st level. If he chose positive energy, his bombs damage undead creatures, dealing an amount of positive energy damage equal to his normal bomb damage.
If he chose negative energy, his bombs damage the living, dealing 1d4 points of negative energy damage plus 1d4 additional points at every odd-numbered alchemist level beyond 1st (instead of 1d6). He can't apply discoveries with an asterisk (*) to his bombs. When an energist reaches 10th level, undead damaged by his positive energy bombs must succeed at a Will save or flee for 1 round as if affected by the Turn Undead feat, while living creatures damaged by an energist's negative energy bombs must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round. An energist's bombs don't heal creatures normally healed by the energist's chosen energy type.ª0
