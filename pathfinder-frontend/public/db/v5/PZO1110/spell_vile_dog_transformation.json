    "text": "You transform one or more dogs into evil, monstrous creatures. Each dog can attempt a Will save to negate the transformation, but if the dog trusts you (it has been trained by you for a purpose, or has been in your care for at least 30 days and generally treated well), it takes a â€“4 penalty on this saving throw. Each transformed dog has the same stats as a hell hound (Bestiary 173) except that it doesn\u0027t have fire immunity and cold vulnerability and instead has acid, cold, and fire resistance 5. Additionally, each transformed dog deals an extra 1d6 points of acid damage with its bite attack (instead of fire damage), and its breath weapon is replaced with a vaporous cloud that spreads out in front of the creature in a 10-foot cone, dealing 2d4 points of acid damage. The creature can\u0027t understand Infernal but understands any languages you know. The dog is normally neutral evil, but is chaotic evil if you are chaotic or lawful evil if you are lawful."
