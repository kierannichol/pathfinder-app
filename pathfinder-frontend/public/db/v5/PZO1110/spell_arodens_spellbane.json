    "text": "One of many spells originally created by the Last Azlanti before he became a god, Aroden\u0027s spellbanecreates an area within which spells selected by you simply do not function. Select one spell per five caster levels at the time of casting. The spells selected cannot be changed after the spell is cast. Aroden\u0027s spellbaneotherwise functions like antimagic field, except its emanation only prevents the functioning of the selected spells. Only the exact spells mentioned are affected--a spellbaneset to prevent the casting of summon nature\u0027s ally IIwould not prevent castings of summon nature\u0027s ally Ior summon nature\u0027s ally III. If you move into an area where a previously cast spell you have selected as a banned spell is in effect, that spell is affected as if by antimagic field. If the spell affects a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check against the creature\u0027s spell resistance to make it wink out."
