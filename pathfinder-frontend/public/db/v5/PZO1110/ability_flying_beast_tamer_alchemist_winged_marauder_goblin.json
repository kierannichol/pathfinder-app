    "text": "At 1st level, a winged marauder acquires a flying mount as an animal companion. This works as the druid animal companion class feature, except the marauder must select a dire bat or giant vulture. The marauder\u0027s effective druid level is equal to his alchemist level. A marauder and his companion don\u0027t gain the share spells ability."
