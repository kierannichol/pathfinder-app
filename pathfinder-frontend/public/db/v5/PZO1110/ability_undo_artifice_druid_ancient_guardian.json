    "text": "At 13th level, an ancient guardian gains the ability to reduce a nonliving item to its component raw materials. This acts as the spell polymorph any object, but works on magical or non-magical nonliving objects. The duration is always permanent. Unlike polymorph any object, this ability can\u0027t be used to mimic the effects of other spells. Items subject to this effect receive a Fortitude saving throw to negate the effect (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 the ancient guardian\u0027s druid level + her Wisdom modifier). Magic items receive a circumstance bonus on this save equal to +1 for every 5,000 gp of the item\u0027s value.\nAn ancient guardian can use undo artifice a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier."
