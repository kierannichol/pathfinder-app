    "text": "At 2nd level, when the familiar can see and hear its master, it can use any combat feat possessed by the eldritch guardian. The familiar doesn\u0027t have to meet the feat\u0027s prerequisites, but at the GM\u0027s discretion may be precluded from using certain combat feats due to its physical form. For example, an eldritch guardian\u0027s pig familiar with access to Exotic Weapon Proficiency (spiked chain) would not gain the ability to use spiked chains, since it doesn\u0027t have any limbs capable of properly handling them."
