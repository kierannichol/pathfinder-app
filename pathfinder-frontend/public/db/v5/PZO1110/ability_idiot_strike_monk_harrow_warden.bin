¹At 1st level, the harrow warden can make an unarmed strike against a target and curse the creature with bad luck. Foes damaged by an idiot strike must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wisdom modifier) or become jinxed. A jinxed creature must roll twice whenever it attempts an attack roll, a saving throw, a skill check, or a caster level check for 1 round, taking the lower result in each instance. The harrow warden can use idiot strike once per day per monk level. She must declare that she is using an idiot strike before making the attack roll; thus, a failed roll wastes the attempt.
At 4th level and again at 12th level, the jinx effect lasts an additional round.
At 16th level, a harrow warden can expend two uses of idiot strike to instead curse her target as the bestow curse spell.ª.
