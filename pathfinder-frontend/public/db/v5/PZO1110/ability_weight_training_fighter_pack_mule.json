    "text": "At 3rd level, a pack mule learns to be more maneuverable when carrying loads. Whenever he is carrying a medium or heavy load, he reduces the check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by 1. At 7th, 11th, and 15th levels, these benefits increase by 1 (to a maximum of 4 at 15th level).\nIn addition, a pack mule can move at his normal speed while carrying a medium load. At 7th level, a pack mule can move at his normal speed while carrying a heavy load."
