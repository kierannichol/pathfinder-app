°The dune rider adds half his level as a bonus on Ride checks in warm deserts, hills, and mountains. At 11th level, the dune rider and his mount no longer treat sand or rocky ground as difficult terrain, and they gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to their base speed in warm deserts, hills, and mountains.ª*
