«A coral witch crafts her familiar out of living coral, coaxing the tiny organisms to grow in the shape of a larger animal or vermin. The coral witch chooses a familiar as normal, but its type changes to vermin (aquatic) and it gains the amphibious special quality. The coral witch's familiar has an Intelligence score as normal for the witch's level, but it has immunity to mind-affecting effects. When underwater near a coral reef of any size, a coral witch can spend 8 hours to restore her familiar to full health at no cost, unless the familiar is killed, in which case she must follow the usual rules for replacing her familiar. A coral witch can never gain an improved familiar.ª/
