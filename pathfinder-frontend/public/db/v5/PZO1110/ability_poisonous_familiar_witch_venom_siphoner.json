    "text": "The venom siphoner chooses either her familiar\u0027s bite attack or its claw attacks; once chosen, this selection can\u0027t be changed. The chosen natural attack gains the following poison ability:\nSiphoner Poison: Natural attack--injury; save Fort DC 10 + half the witch\u0027s level + the witch\u0027s Intelligence modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex; cure 1 save.\nFamiliars without an appropriate natural attack instead gain the ability to spit the poison as a ranged touch attack.\nThis spit attack deals no damage, but it exposes the struck creature to the poison, forcing it to attempt a saving throw to resist the poison as normal. If the familiar already has a poison, the witch can instead empower its poison. An empowered poison\u0027s frequency increases by 50%. If the witch ever replaces her familiar, she must choose how this ability applies to her new familiar as soon as she receives it."
