½An ancient guardian doesn't gain spontaneous casting at 1st level. Instead, at 3rd level, she can channel stored spell energy into a spell capable of dispelling hostile thoughts and strong emotions. She can â€œlose" a prepared spell in order to cast calm emotions.
Instead of the normal Will saving throw for that spell, the DC of a calm emotions spell cast with this ability is 10 + 1/2 the ancient guardian's druid level + her Wisdom modifier.ª6
