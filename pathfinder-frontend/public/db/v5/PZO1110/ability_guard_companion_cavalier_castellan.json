    "text": "At 4th level, the castellan forms a bond with an animal companion that serves as a guard.\nWhile most castellans select birds or canines, the castellan can choose any animal companions available to rangers.\nThis ability functions like the druid nature bond ability, except that the castellan\u0027s effective druid level is equal to his cavalier level â€“ 3 and his animal companion doesn\u0027t gain the share spells special ability."
