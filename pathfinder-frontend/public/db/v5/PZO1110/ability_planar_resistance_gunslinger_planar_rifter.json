    "text": "At 2nd level, when a planar rifter infuses his grit with the essence of a plane, he gains protection against that plane\u0027s dangers. If he attunes his grit pool to chaos, good, evil, or law, he gains resistance to magical effects that deal damage based on the chosen alignment, such as holy smite, order\u0027s wrath, a paladin\u0027s smite evil attack, or an unholy weapon. If he attunes his grit pool to air, earth, fire, or water, he gains protection against the energy type associated with that element (see infused bullet on page 6). He reduces the amount of damage taken from attacks of the chosen type by 2 points per gunslinger level."
