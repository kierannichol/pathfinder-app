ØAt 4th level, a fungal pilgrim who selected the Plant domain for her nature bond gains the ability to grow fungal creatures from the spores of her body. Once per day, when casting a summon nature's ally spell to summon a single creature, the fungal pilgrim can infuse her fungal connection into the casting. The creature summoned must be selected from the summon nature's ally list for 1 spell level lower than the spell cast. For example, if the fungal pilgrim casts summon nature's ally III, she must choose a creature from the list in summon nature's ally II.
Creatures summoned in this manner gain the fungal creature template, except they do not gain the create spawn and poison spore cloud special attacks. A creature summoned in this manner cannot be harvested for its poison.
A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, it can be used any number of times per day.ª2
