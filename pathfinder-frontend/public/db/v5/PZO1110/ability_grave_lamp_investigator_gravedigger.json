    "text": "At 4th level, a gravedigger can form a psychic bond with a lantern, using it as a conjuration implement in much the same way as she uses her relic focus as a necromancy implement. She can expend inspiration to fuel her grave lamp\u0027s focus powers the same number of times each day as she can for her relic focus (for example, a 6th-level gravedigger with 6 points of inspiration could expend up to three uses of inspiration as mental focus for her relic focus and up to three uses of inspiration as mental focus for her grave lamp)."
