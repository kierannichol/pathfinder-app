    "text": "A dwarven scholar gains the following type of bardic performance.\nWar Chant (Su): At 1st level, a dwarven scholar can use her performance to inspire the martial prowess of the ancient dwarves in her allies. The dwarven scholar selects a single combat feat she knows. Allies affected by this performance gain the benefit of this feat for as long as the performance is maintained. To be affected, an ally must be able to perceive the dwarven scholar\u0027s performance. If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat by the dwarven scholar\u0027s allies while using this ability counts toward the dwarven scholar\u0027s feat\u0027s daily limit.\nAt 6th level, the dwarven scholar may grant the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat. Maintaining two feats in this way requires spending 2 rounds of bardic performance every round."
