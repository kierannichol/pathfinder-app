    "text": "An Elder Mythos scholar keeps copious notes on how to use magic against the servants of the Elder Mythos in his spellbook. Every spell he adds to his spellbook takes up an additional 1d6 pages and costs twice the normal amount to inscribe; however, when casting spells prepared from his grimoire, he gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks and increases the save DCs by 1 against the creatures listed in talisman of revealing below."
