    "text": "At 10th level, the serpent-fire adept gains Chakra Master as a bonus feat. She need not meet the feat\u0027s prerequisites. When maintaining her open chakras with chakra expertise, she can spend 1 point of ki to gain the benefits of two chakras rather than one in that round (or three chakras, if she has opened her crown chakra). At 14th level, the serpent-fire adept\u0027s pool of serpent-fire ki increases to 7 points, and at 18th level, it increases to 9 points."
