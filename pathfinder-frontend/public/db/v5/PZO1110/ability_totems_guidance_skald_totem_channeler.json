    "text": "At 9th level, the totem channeler can draw strength and protection from his totem powers when he wades into battle with song on his lips. When he adds a totem rage power to his inspired rage, he and his allies gain a +1 insight bonus to AC and on saving throws for the duration of the totem channeler\u0027s raging song. At 14th level, this bonus increases to +2. This bonus applies only to the first totem rage power he applies to his inspired rage."
