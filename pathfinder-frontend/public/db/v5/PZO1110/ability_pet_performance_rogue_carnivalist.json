    "text": "A carnivalist gains use of several bardic performances, making Handle Animal checks in place of any Perform checks.\nAt 2nd level, she gains the distraction bardic performance.\nAt 4th level, she gains the fascinate bardic performance.\nAt 6th level, she also gains use of the following performance.\nTrained Legerdemain (Ex): At 6th level, a carnivalist can command a familiar or pet within 30 feet to make a Disable Device or Sleight of Hand check as if trained in the skill, using its own skill ranks (if any), Dexterity modifier, and equipment, with a competence bonus equal to 1/2 her rogue level. The check requires the normal amount of time to complete and the DC increases by 5. The carnivalist must maintain this pet performance each round her familiar or pet attempts a Disable Device or Sleight of Hand check.\nThe pet performance ability otherwise functions identically to bardic performance. Levels in a class with the distraction or fascinate bardic performances stack with carnivalist levels for the purpose of determining bonuses granted by these performances."
