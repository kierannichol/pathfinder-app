    "text": "At 3rd level, an urban bloodrager can attune her spells so they are less likely to impact her allies or innocent bystanders. When the bloodrager casts a spell, she can grant a +2 bonus on the saving throw against that spell to any creatures she is aware of that are targeted by the spell or within the spell\u0027s area. Any creature that receives this bonus and succeeds at its save is unaffected by the spell, as if it hadn\u0027t been targeted or wasn\u0027t in the area."
