    "text": "At 6th level, a storm caller can borrow some of his eidolon\u0027s elemental might. He can gain the flight evolution as though he were using the summoner\u0027s aspect ability, deducting 2 evolution points from the eidolon\u0027s evolution pool. If he does so, his eidolon is unable to take the flight evolution as long as the storm caller has that evolution.\nAt 8th level, the storm caller\u0027s eidolon can have the flight evolution even if the storm caller has that evolution.\nAt 10th level, the storm caller automatically gains the flight evolution without reducing the number of evolution points available to the eidolon. He can use the aspect ability (and at 18th level, the greater aspect ability) to gain additional evolutions."
