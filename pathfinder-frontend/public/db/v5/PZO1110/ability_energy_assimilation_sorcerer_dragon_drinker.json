    "text": "At 7th level, when the dragon drinker drinks true dragon\u0027s blood from a dragon with a breath weapon that deals a different type of energy damage than her chosen energy type, she may adopt the energy resistance of the blood\u0027s source dragon as if it were her selected bloodline. This effect lasts for 1 minute per dose of dragon\u0027s blood, after which the dragon drinker\u0027s energy resistance reverts back to her normal energy type."
