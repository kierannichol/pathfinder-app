ÇAt 8th level, both a crystal tender and her spirit animal gain all of the benefits of any ioun stones worn by one another, as long as they're within 100 feet of each other. The crystal tender's spirit animal can also embed a number of ioun stones equal to the crystal tender's Charisma modifier into its crystalline form. Embedded ioun stones don't gain any additional abilities, save that they don't orbit the spirit animal and can't be separately targeted. A slain or unconscious spirit animal immediately loses all embedded ioun stones, which tumble to the ground beside its body.ª9
