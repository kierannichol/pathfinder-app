    "text": "At 12th level, a dimensional occultist can create a dimensional waypoint by spending 2d4 minutes inscribing a number of equations on a solid surface (such as a wall, tree, stone floor, or structure) with a writing instrument. The exact configuration of these equations is unique to each witch. From that point on, when she uses dimensional travel to travel to that location, she does so without any chance of mishap. Teleport always sends the witch to this spot, and even plane shift, if used to travel to that site, is precisely accurate. Once a dimensional waypoint is set, it remains active for that witch despite the condition of the inscription or even that of the surface upon which it was inscribed--it is the act of inscribing the waypoint, not the waypoint itself, that matters. At 12th level, and then again every two witch levels thereafter, the dimensional occultist can maintain an additional waypoint. She can replace a waypoint she\u0027s already set by simply using that waypoint\u0027s unique equation at a new site."
