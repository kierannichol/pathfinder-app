At 5th level, a spirit master becomes fortified against the effects of energy drain. When the spirit master gains a negative level, he does not take any penalties, his total hit points remain unchanged, and he is not considered lower level for the purpose of level-dependent variables. Once per day when attempting a Fortitude save to remove a temporary negative level, the spirit master may choose to automatically succeed. The spirit master still dies if his number of negative levels equals or exceeds his number of Hit Dice.ª0
