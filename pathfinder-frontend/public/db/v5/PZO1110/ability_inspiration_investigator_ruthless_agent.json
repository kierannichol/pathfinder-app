    "text": "A ruthless agent focuses on reading motivations and using interrogation tactics. She can use inspiration on Intimidate, Knowledge, and Sense Motive checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided she\u0027s trained in the skill. A ruthless agent can\u0027t spend inspiration on attack rolls or saving throws."
