    "text": "Once per day the divine guardian pledges her protection to a willing creature for the day. This is done at the same time she prepares her spells.\nWhen the paladin first selects a creature for divine troth, that creature must be present and agree to receive the paladin\u0027s protection, but if the paladin already has a creature selected for divine troth, she can maintain that selection each day without her charge being present. Once per day, the divine guardian can cast locate creature to find the current target of her divine troth."
