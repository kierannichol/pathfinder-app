ÏA combination of brainwashing and loyalty helps a fearsome defender resist pain and torture, enduring grueling combat or questioning without betraying her dark lord. A fearsome defender gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against pain effects, and the DCs of checks to coerce her or demoralize her with Diplomacy or Intimidate increase by 2. Both the bonus and the increase to DCs increase by 2 when she gains greater rage and again by 2 when she gains mighty rage.ª6
