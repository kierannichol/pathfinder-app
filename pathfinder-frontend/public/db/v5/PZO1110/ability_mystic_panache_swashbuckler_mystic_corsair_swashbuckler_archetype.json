    "text": "A mystic corsair regains panache only when she confirms a critical hit or makes a killing blow with a light or one-handed weapon from the monk weapon group. Additionally, the mystic corsair gains the ability to use a light or one-handed monk weapon for her swashbuckler class features, deeds, and feats, even if the weapon is not a piercing weapon, but she can\u0027t use other light or one-handed weapons with her class features or deeds.\nThis alters panache."
