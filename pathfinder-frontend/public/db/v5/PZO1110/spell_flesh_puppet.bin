ÕYou animate one corpse that has been dead no more than 48 hours. It rises as a zombie (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 288) that is magically tethered to you and obeys your commands. As noted in animate dead, you can't control more than 4 HD per caster level worth of undead in total, nor can a single casting create more than 2 HD per caster level.
