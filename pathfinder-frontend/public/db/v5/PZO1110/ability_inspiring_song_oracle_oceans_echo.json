    "text": "The voice of an ocean\u0027s echo provides inspiration to allies. This ability is identical to bardic performance (using Perform [sing] only), allowing her to inspire courage at 1st level, inspire competence at 3rd level, and inspire heroics at 15th level, as a bard of the ocean\u0027s echo\u0027s level. It is usable a total number of rounds per day equal to her level + her Charisma modifier (minimum 1).\nThis ability replaces the revelations gained at 1st, 3rd, and 15th level."
