    "text": "At 2nd level, an earthshadow can draw upon the power of earth to perform mystical tricks. At the start of each day, an earthshadow gains a pool of earthcraft points equal to half her rogue level plus her Wisdom modifier, and she can spend earthcraft points to use certain spell-like abilities. The caster level of these spell-like abilities is equal to the earthshadow\u0027s rogue level. Earthcraft effects affect only the earthshadow, even if the spell could normally affect others. She can spend 1 earthcraft point to cast blend, even if she is not an elf, but this ability works only in areas of natural earth or unworked stone.\nAt 4th level, an earthshadow can spend 2 earthcraft points to cast meld into stone.\nAt 8th level, an earthshadow can spend 3 earthcraft points to cast dimension door. She must be able to see her destination (or she must be able to otherwise sense its surface, such as with tremorsense), and her current location must be connected to her destination by continuous natural earth or unworked stone.\nAt 12th level, an earthshadow can spend 5 earthcraft points to cast the spell stone tell but can communicate only with unworked stone.\nAt 16th level, an earthshadow can spend 6 earthcraft points to cast statue.\nThis ability replaces evasion and the rogue talents gained at 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th levels.\nRogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement the earthshadow archetype: extra earthcraft (see below), favored terrain, fortified position (see below), major magic, minor magic, resiliency, and trap spotter."
