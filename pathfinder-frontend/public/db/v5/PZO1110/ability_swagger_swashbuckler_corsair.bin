‚At 3rd level, a corsair's confident swagger unnerves her foes and inspires her crew. She gains a +1 bonus on Intimidate checks, and the DC of Intimidate checks made against her increases by 1. She and her allies gain a +1 morale bonus on Profession (sailor) checks. These bonuses and her Intimidate DC increase by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 3rd.
At 7th level, a corsair's swagger gives her an additional benefit when she uses charmed life. If she succeeds at a saving throw against an opponent's attack or ability while using charmed life on that save, she can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize that opponent without using an action.ª+
