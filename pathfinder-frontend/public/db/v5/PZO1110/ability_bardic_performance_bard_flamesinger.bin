©A flamesinger gains the following bardic performance.
Blazing Blades (Su) The flamesinger's song causes allies' weapons to burst into flames. To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard perform and be within 30 feet. An affected creature's successful attacks with manufactured or natural weapons deal 1d4 additional points of fire damage.
These flames do not harm the weapon or its wielder. This damage stacks with other sources of fire damage, such as the flaming special weapon ability. At 5th level and every 6 bard levels thereafter, this bonus fire damage increases by 1d4 (to a maximum of 4d4 at 17th level). This is a fire effect that relies on audible components.ª2
