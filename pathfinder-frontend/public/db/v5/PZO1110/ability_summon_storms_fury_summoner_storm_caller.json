    "text": "A storm caller can summon creatures infused with the power of the storm to help him. This functions as the summoner\u0027s summon monster Iâ€“IX abilities, except the storm caller can summon only the following creatures at the indicated spell levels: I--eagle; II--small air elemental, small lightning elemental; III--dire bat; IV--medium air elemental, medium lightning elemental, pteranodon; V--large air elemental, large lightning elemental; VI--huge air elemental, huge lightning elemental; VII--roc; VIII--elder air elemental, elder lightning elemental; IX--advanced elder air elemental, advanced elder lightning elemental. Any creatures summoned with this ability gain immunity to electricity.\nAlternatively, whenever his eidolon is not summoned, a storm caller can expend a daily use of this ability to summon a magical storm as a standard action.\nThis functions as call lightning with a caster level equal to his summoner level, except as noted below.\nEach bolt of lightning deals 1d6 points of electricity damage. This damage increases by 1d6 at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level. The prevailing weather has no effect on the damage of the lightning bolts. The Reflex save DC is equal to 10 + half the storm caller\u0027s summoner level + his Charisma modifier. If the storm caller uses this ability again before he has used all of his available bolts of lightning (to summon another magical storm, to summon a monster, or to use the gate spell), any unused bolts are expended with no effect.\nThe storm caller adds call lightning to his summoner spell list as a 3rd-level spell and call lightning storm to his summoner spell list as a 5th-level spell, but he does not automatically add them to his list of spells known."
