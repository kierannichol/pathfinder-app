öAt 16th level, a twinned summoner can touch his eidolon as a standard action, enhancing its similarity to the summoner. The eidolon loses any natural weapons or size increases gained from evolutions, and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores change to match the base scores of the summoner. The eidolon can cast any of the summoner's spells known using the summoner's caster level and spell slots. It doesn't gain the benefit of any of the summoner's items, feats, or other effects that affect spellcasting. The eidolon can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to the summoner's class level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.ª6
