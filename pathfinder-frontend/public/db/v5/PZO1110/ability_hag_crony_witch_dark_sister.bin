œAt 12th level, a Dark Sister gains a blessing in the form of an alliance with a night hag. Once per week, the Dark Sister can as a full-round action summon the night hag from the Shadow Plane.
The night hag serves the Dark Sister to the best of its ability as long as the witch's commands are consistent with the night hag's alignment and goals, but flees back to its native plane after a number of rounds equal to the witch's level or upon losing half or more of its hit points. The night hag may provide the Dark Sister with other favors or gifts at the GM's discretion.
At 15th and 18th levels, a Dark Sister can call upon her hag crony an additional time per week.ª*
