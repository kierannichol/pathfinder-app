    "text": "When this spell is cast upon a vessel, the ship is surrounded by a protective bubble of constantly replenishing, breathable air and sinks beneath the waves. For the duration of the spell, the ship can travel beneath the water as easily as it did above. While under the effects of this spell, the ship has magical propulsion that gives it a maximum speed of 120 feet and an acceleration of 30 feet (see the Skull \u0026 Shackles Player\u0027s Guidefor details). The ship\u0027s pilot uses the normal sailing skill to control the ship while under this spell\u0027s effects, and can command it to dive and ascend as part of the vessel\u0027s normal movement. Despite the magical propulsion, the ship still requires its crew to perform its normal functions."
