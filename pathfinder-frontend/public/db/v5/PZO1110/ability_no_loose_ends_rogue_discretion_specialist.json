    "text": "At 4th level, the discretion specialist can prevent opponents from escaping. Opponents damaged by the discretion specialist\u0027s sneak attack are unable to take the withdraw action for 1 round, though they can still move as normal.\nAt 8th level, a creature damaged by the discretion specialist\u0027s sneak attack is hampered in casting spells of the teleportation subschool (such as dimension door) as well as using methods of magical transport such as shadow walk. A target attempting to cast such a spell before the end of the discretion specialist\u0027s next turn must succeed at a concentration check (in addition to any concentration checks required for casting while threatened or other circumstances) or lose the spell. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + half the discretion specialist\u0027s rogue level + her Intelligence modifier.\nThis replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.\nRogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement this archetype: camouflage, charmer, convincing lie, honeyed words, and quick disguise."
