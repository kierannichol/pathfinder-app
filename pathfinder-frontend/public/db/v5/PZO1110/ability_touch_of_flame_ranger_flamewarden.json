    "text": "At 4th level, a flamewarden can cause his weapons to burst into flame. As a standard action, the ranger can grant a single weapon he holds the flaming special ability for 1 minute; while under this effect, the weapon counts as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A flamewarden can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Wisdom modifier. At 12th level, weapons affected by this ability gain the flaming burst special ability instead."
