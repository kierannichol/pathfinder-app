When he confirms a critical hit against a creature against whom his nemesis bonus applies, for 1 minute the target must succeed at a concentration check (DC \u003d 20 + the wild soul\u0027s Wisdom modifier + twice the spell\u0027s level) to cast an arcane spell, create an extract, or use an alchemist\u0027s bomb, and the target can\u0027t spend or gain grit."
