    "text": "An arsenal chaplain must choose War as his blessing, and can do so even if it is a domain not normally granted by his deity. He does not receive a second blessing.\nAt 7th level, an arsenal chaplain gains Quicken Blessing (War) as a bonus feat even if he does not meet the prerequisites, but cannot grant a War blessing to himself as a swift action with Quicken Blessing until he is at least 10th level.\nAt 13th level, an arsenal chaplain can use the War blessing on an ally at a range of up to 30 feet by spending an additional use of the blessing ability.\nAt 16th level, an arsenal chaplain can use the War blessing on a second target with a single use of the blessing ability.\nAt 19th level, an arsenal chaplain can use the War blessing on any number of targets at once with a single use of the blessing ability."
