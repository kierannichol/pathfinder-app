™At 20th level, the hagbound transforms into a true hag, purging all goodness and light from her in exchange for dark power. Her alignment becomes evil if it isn't already. Her type changes to monstrous humanoid, and she gains darkvision 60 feet; immunity to charm, fear, and spell effects; and the ability to join a coven.
She gains spell resistance 31, and she grants this benefit to her other coven members.ª0
