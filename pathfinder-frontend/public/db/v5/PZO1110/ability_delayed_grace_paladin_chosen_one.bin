ÂA chosen one begins her adventuring career without fully understanding her true potential. The chosen one uses the barbarian, rogue, sorcerer column to calculate her typical starting age. She receives the smite evil ability at 2nd level and the divine grace ability at 4th level. This does not affect the rate at which she gains additional uses per day of smite evil, so she still gains her second use at 4th level, her third at 7th level, and so on.ª/
