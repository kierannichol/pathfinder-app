ºYou can view events transpiring along a natural watercourse you touch. You can see anything on or within the river as if you were present at that location, or you can observe anything happening within 15 feet of the river's banks as if peering from the water's surface. Moving your point of view to a different location along the river is a standard action, though your perception can follow something moving along the river as a free action.
