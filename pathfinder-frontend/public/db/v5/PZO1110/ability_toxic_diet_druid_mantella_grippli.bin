Toxic Dietarchetype_featureclass:druid#mantella_grippliclass_feature¢í
èAt 6th level, both the mantella and her animal companion gain immunity to poison. Additionally, as an immediate action when exposed to a dose of poison, a mantella can absorb the toxin and store it internally for up to 1 day. As a swift action, a mantella can secrete this poison; this changes the poison's type to injury and applies the dose of poison to all of the druid's natural attacks. A mantella can use this ability three times per day, plus one additional time per day at 8th level and every 2 druid levels thereafter.™0
