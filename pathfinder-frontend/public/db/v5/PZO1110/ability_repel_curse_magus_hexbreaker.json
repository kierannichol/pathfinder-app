    "text": "At 4th level, a hexbreaker has the chance to protect others from being cursed. As an immediate action when a spell with the curse descriptor or a curse-style effect (such as a witch\u0027s evil eye or misfortune hex or a sea hag\u0027s evil eye) targets a creature within 30 feet of him, a hexbreaker can spend 1 point from his arcane pool to attempt to dispel that effect, as if he had cast remove curse. This ability has no effect on ongoing effects, such as a sea hag\u0027s horrific appearance or a pugwampi\u0027s unluck aura.\nThe magus adds remove curse to his spell list as a 3rd-level spell and adds break enchantment as a 4th-level spell."
