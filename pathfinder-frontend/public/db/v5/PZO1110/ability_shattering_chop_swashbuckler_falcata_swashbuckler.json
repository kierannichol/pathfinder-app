    "text": "At 15th level, while the falcata swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, he can attempt a shattering chop as a full-round action, pooling all of his attack potential into a single melee sunder combat maneuver with a light or one-handed slashing weapon.\nWhen he does, he gains a +4 bonus on her combat maneuver check and ignores half of the hardness of the item he sunders."
