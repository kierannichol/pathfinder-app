×At 5th level, rather than roll for initiative, the wit can treat his roll as if it was a 10 (adding any modifiers as usual). The wit can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and an additional time per day for every 6 bard levels thereafter. At 20th level, when the wit uses this ability, he can instead treat his roll as if it was a 20.ª#
