    "text": "At 2nd level, a vellemancer learns to invest magical aid into a willing creature. Each day, she can implant a number of hexes equal to half her witch level (minimum 1) plus her Intelligence bonus (if any). Any given creature can have only one hex implanted at a given time, and implanting a new hex ends the previous one (the witch still loses the use of this ability she spent on the previous hex).\nOnly beneficial hexes capable of affecting another creature can be implanted with invested hex, and this counts against the uses per day of hexes with limited uses per day or per creature.\nTo implant a hex, the vellemancer must take a standard action and touch a willing creature. The vellemancer can activate the hex as a free action, or the hex can activate automatically when a single predetermined condition is met (decided when the hex is implanted).\nThe subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the witch to trigger the hex, but a predetermined condition can activate the hex regardless of range. An implanted hex lasts until the next time the witch regains her spells.\nOnce triggered, a hex is no longer implanted and can\u0027t be triggered again."
