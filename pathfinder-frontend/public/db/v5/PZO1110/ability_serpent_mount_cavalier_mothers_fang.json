    "text": "Instead of the usual choices for a cavalier\u0027s mount, mother\u0027s fangs ride on giant riding constrictors.\nThese use the statistics of the constrictor snake druid animal companion, except that they are suitable mounts and begin as size Large at 1st level with no other adjustments to their abilities or statistics based on this size change.\nA serpent mount is considered to be a quadruped for the purpose of determining its carrying capacity, and its base land speed is 40 feet (other speeds are unaffected). At 4th level, a giant riding constrictor doesn\u0027t increase in size again, but it does receive all the other usual 4th-level benefits."
