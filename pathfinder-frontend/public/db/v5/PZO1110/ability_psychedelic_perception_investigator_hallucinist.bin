²	In addition to magical extracts, a hallucinist learns to swiftly mix various psychoactive substances, using a fraction of his own power to create a magical hallucinogen that he can imbibe to grant himself powers of psychedelic perception. A hallucinogen follows all the normal rules and restrictions for an alchemist's mutagen as if they were the same substance, just as a cognatogen does.
At 1st level, the effects of a hallucinogen last for 1 minute per investigator level, and the hallucinogen grants low-light vision and a +2 insight bonus on Perception checks, but imposes a â€“2 penalty to his Dexterity. At 3rd level, the duration increases to 10 minutes per the hallucinist's investigator level and the insight bonus on Perception checks increases to +4. At 7th level, the hallucinogen also grants see invisibility and darkvision 60 feet (or if the hallucinist drinking it already has darkvision, it increases the range of the darkvision by 30 feet) and the Perception bonus increases to +6. At 11th level, the hallucinogen also grants aura sight and the Perception bonus increases to +8. At 15th level, the hallucinogen also grants blindsense 60 feet and the Perception bonus increases to +10.ª>
