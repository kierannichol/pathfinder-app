ÛAt 20th level, a spirit master gains DR 10/evil and becomes immune to ability drain and ability damage. Additionally, once per week, the spirit master may bring a dead creature back to life. This ability functions as true resurrection, except the spirit master may not resurrect a creature that has been dead for longer than 1 day per class level.ª0
