ˆA channeler of the unknown can channel entropy as a cleric channels negative or positive energy, releasing a wave of twisting void that harms creatures in the area of effect. The amount of damage dealt is equal to that an evil cleric of her level would deal by channeling negative energy, except it affects living, unliving, and undead creatures alike. This functions in all other ways as a cleric's channel energy class feature, including benefiting from feats that affect channel energy (such as Selective Channeling).ª>
