    "text": "A smuggler adds 1/2 her level on Sleight of Hand checks (minimum +1). A smuggler can use Sleight of Hand to conceal a small item in a container or room, such as the false bottom of a chest or beneath floorboards. Anyone attempting to find an item concealed by a smuggler makes a Perception check opposed by the Sleight of Hand check made by the smuggler when she concealed the object."
