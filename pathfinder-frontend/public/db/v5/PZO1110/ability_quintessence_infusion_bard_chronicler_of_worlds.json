    "text": "This performance infuses allies with planar quintessence. At 9th level, while on a plane other than the Material Plane, the chronicler of worlds can use this performance to target an ally within 30 feet. For every 3 bard levels she has beyond 9th, she can affect one additional creature. Affected allies gain the plane\u0027s basic infusion effect. If the chronicler of worlds is 13th level or higher, affected creatures also gain the plane\u0027s improved infusion. If she is 16th level or higher, affected creatures also gain the plane\u0027s greater infusion. The first time each day a creature benefits from quintessence infusion, the plane infused is set for the day and additional infusions can grant only that plane\u0027s infusions. Infusions that have limited uses per day remain limited in that way, regardless of how many times quintessence infusion is gained. Quintessence infusion relies on audible and visual components."
