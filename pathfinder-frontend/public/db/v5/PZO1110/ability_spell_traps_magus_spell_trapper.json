    "text": "At 4th level, a spell trapper learns how to craft magical traps in exchange for the use of spell slots. These traps work as ranger traps, except they always count as spell-like abilities. A spell trap is always considered magical, and is treated as a spell with a spell level equal to 1/3 the spell trapper\u0027s class level. A magical trap lasts only 1 hour per level or until triggered, whichever comes first. A trap\u0027s DC decreases by 1 for each full hour that passes after it is set. Upon gaining this ability, the spell trapper automatically knows the snare trap.\nSetting a spell trap is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. If attacked during the course of conjuring a trap, the spell trapper must attempt a concentration check, as though damaged while casting a spell. A trap fills a single 5-foot square, and cannot be placed in the same area as another spell trapper trap or a magical trap such as a glyph of warding. Spell trappers need access to a material component pouch to craft spell traps (unless they have the Eschew Materials feat) and must sacrifice a spell slot to create the trap. The DCs for Perception checks to notice the trap, Disable Device checks to disable it, and saving throws to avoid it are equal to 10 + 1/2 the spell trapper\u0027s magus level + the spell slot level sacrificed to create the trap. All spell traps are Trigger location, and Reset none."
