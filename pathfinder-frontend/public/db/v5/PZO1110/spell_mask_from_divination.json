    "text": "As part of the action used to cast this spell, you place the mask used as the focus component on the target\u0027s face, after which it adheres tightly to the target for the spell\u0027s duration and cannot be removed by physical force. Despite lacking eyes, this mask does not impair its wearer\u0027s vision in any way. While in effect, this spell functions like nondetection, except it also foils divination spells that attempt to gather information about the creature, even if they don\u0027t target it specifically. In the case of divination spells that would normally reveal the wearer\u0027s presence, such as see invisibility, the spell works, but the wearer is detected only if the caster succeeds at a caster level check. Likewise, scrying attempts that specifically target the wearer do not work at all unless the caster succeeds at a caster level check. In addition, the DCs of skill checks to learn about the wearer or identify the wearer and its strengths and weaknesses-- including Diplomacy checks to gather information, Perception checks opposed by the target\u0027s Disguise checks, and Knowledge checks--increase by 4."
