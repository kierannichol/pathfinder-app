    "text": "When a totem channeler learns a new rage power, he can select from more than one group of totem rage powers, even though he normally could not do so. Totem rage powers grant benefits related to a theme, are organized in groups of three, and usually have the word “totem\" in their name. When the totem channeler starts an inspired rage raging song, he can add totem rage powers from only one group at a time.\nHe can change the group of added totem rage powers by ending the current inspired rage and starting a new one."
