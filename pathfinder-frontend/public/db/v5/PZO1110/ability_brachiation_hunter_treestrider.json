    "text": "A treestrider can gain a climb speed equal to half her base speed as a free action for 1 minute per hunter level per day. This duration must be spent in 1-minute increments. In addition, she can use her climb speed to move through the canopies of forests or jungles, provided the limbs of the trees are strong enough to support her weight. The treestrider\u0027s companion gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to its climb speed. At 8th level, the treestrider\u0027s climb speed increases to equal her base speed, the duration of her brachiation increases to 10 minutes per hunter level per day (usable in 10-minute increments), and the enhancement bonus to her companion\u0027s climb speed increases to +20 feet. At 15th level, she can use brachiation with no limit on the duration."
