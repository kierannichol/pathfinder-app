    "text": "At 8th level, a toxic herbalist can spend 1 hour foraging for poisonous substances to create a dose of poison (this hour can be integrated with the hour required to prepare spells or poultices). The toxic herbalist rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Intelligence modifier. The DC of this check is equal to the Craft DC of the poison he wishes to create. If he succeeds at this check, the ranger creates 1 dose of the chosen poison. The poison remains potent for a number of hours equal to the toxic herbalist\u0027s level, regardless of the means used in attempts to preserve it, and it can\u0027t be sold. This ability functions only while the toxic herbalist is within one of his favored terrains."
