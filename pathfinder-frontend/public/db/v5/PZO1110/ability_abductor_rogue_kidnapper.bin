ºAt 3rd level, a kidnapper gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple a foe. In addition, the kidnapper treats her combat maneuver bonus as 1 higher when a foe tries to grapple her or when a grappled target attempts to break free of her grapple. These bonuses increase by 1 for every 3 levels beyond 3rd.ª'
