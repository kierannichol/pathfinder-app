    "text": "As daylight, except the object touched sheds bright silvery light in a 20-foot radius. In addition to providing illumination, the area of bright light is painful to creatures that are susceptible to alchemical silver. A creature with DR/silver that begins its turn within the light of this spell is automatically dazzled and becomes sickened unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save. These effects disappear 1 round after the target leaves the silverlight. A creature that leaves the area and then returns must make a new saving throw. This spell provides dim light up to 40 feet away, but only creatures within 20 feet are subject to the above e!ects."
