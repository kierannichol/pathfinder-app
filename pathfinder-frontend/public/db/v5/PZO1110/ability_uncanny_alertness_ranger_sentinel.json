    "text": "At 4th level, a sentinel is always ready to defend against incoming attacks. A sentinel is never flatfooted before acting in combat, even if she is surprised (she can still become flatfooted by any other effect or situation that would render her flat-footed).\nAt 7th level, the sentinel also always acts on the surprise round. If she would have acted on the surprise round anyway, or if there is no surprise round, she gains a bonus on initiative checks equal to half her ranger level."
