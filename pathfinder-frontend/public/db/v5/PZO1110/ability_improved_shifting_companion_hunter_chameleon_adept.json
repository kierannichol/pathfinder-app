    "text": "At 10th level, a chameleon adept\u0027s animal companion improves its ability to change shape. It can use wild shape, as a druid of half the hunter\u0027s level, to gain the effects of beast shape I. Unlike a druid\u0027s wild shape, this ability does not improve to encompass larger or smaller animals or elementals."
