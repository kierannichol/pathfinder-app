™You charge a weapon with a magic rune of fire. When the wielder of the weapon successfully strikes a foe in melee with the weapon, the wielder can discharge the rune as a swift action to deal 1d4+1 points of fire damage to the target. This damage isn't multiplied on a critical hit. If the target has spell resistance, you attempt a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance when the rune is discharged. If the rune is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled; otherwise, the rune deals damage normally.
