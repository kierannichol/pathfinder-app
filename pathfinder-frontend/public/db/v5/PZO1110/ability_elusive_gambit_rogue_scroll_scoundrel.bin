úAt 6th level, a scroll scoundrel's movement can leave a foe off-balance. If a scroll scoundrel provokes an attack of opportunity by moving past an opponent and that opponent then misses with the attack, that foe is considered to be flat-footed against the scroll scoundrel's next melee attack, provided that melee attack comes within 1 round of the missed attack of opportunity.ª4
