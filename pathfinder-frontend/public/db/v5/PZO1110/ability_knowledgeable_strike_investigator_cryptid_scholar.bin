²At 4th level, the cryptid scholar can direct allies to exploit a monster's weaknesses. If the cryptid scholar ends his opportune advice early as a move action, each ally within 30 feet who can hear the cryptid scholar deals additional damage on its next successful unarmed, natural, or weapon attack against that specific kind of monster within 1 round. The additional damage is 1d6 at 4th level and increases by 1d6 for every 4 investigator levels thereafter (to a maximum of 5d6 at 20th level). The damage of knowledgeable strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to knowledgeable strike. Ranged attacks gain this additional damage only against a target within 30 feet. The ally must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. Knowledgeable strike cannot be used against a creature with concealment.ª@
