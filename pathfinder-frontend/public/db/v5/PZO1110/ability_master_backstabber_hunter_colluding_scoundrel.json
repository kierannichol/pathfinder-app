    "text": "At 20th level, a colluding scoundrel is a master at dispatching distracted targets. As a standard action, she can make a single attack against a foe that is taking the penalties of her scapegoat ability and is adjacent to an ally currently designated as the scapegoat.\nIf the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC \u003d 10 + half the colluding scoundrel\u0027s level + her Wisdom modifier) or be slain. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any colluding scoundrel) for 24 hours."
