    "text": "The fey prankster can cause plants to distract nearby creatures. To use this ability, the fey prankster attempts a Bluff check to create a distraction to hide as a swift action or to feint against an adjacent opponent as a move action, so long as the target is adjacent to plants. He gains a bonus on this check equal to half his rogue level (minimum +1)."
