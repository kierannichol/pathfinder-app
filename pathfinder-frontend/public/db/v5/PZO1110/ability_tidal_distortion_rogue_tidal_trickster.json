    "text": "At 8th level, while making a full attack underwater, a tidal trickster can give up one attack to create a tidal distortion. When she creates a tidal distortion, the tidal trickster moves up to 10 feet. If any part of her movement includes a square adjacent to one or more foes, she can choose one of those foes and attempt a Bluff check with a DC of 11 + either the enemy\u0027s Sense Motive or Swim modifier, whichever is higher. Her Bluff check is subject to any penalties the attack roll she sacrificed would have taken, and if she trades an iterative attack gained from having a high base attack bonus, she also takes a penalty based on that attack\u0027s lower base attack bonus (a –5 penalty for the second iterative attack, a –10 penalty for the third iterative attack, and a –15 penalty for the fourth iterative attack, if she manages to gain one). If she succeeds at the Bluff check, the movement doesn\u0027t provoke an attack of opportunity from that foe and the foe becomes off-balance until its next turn. A tidal trickster can give up any number of her attacks in a given full attack to create tidal distortions, but she can\u0027t give up two consecutive attacks."
