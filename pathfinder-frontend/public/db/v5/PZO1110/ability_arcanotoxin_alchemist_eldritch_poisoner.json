    "text": "An eldritch poisoner can blend volatile chemicals and her own personal magic to create deadly poisons known as arcanotoxins. She can use this ability a number of times each day equal to her alchemist level + her Intelligence modifier. An arcanotoxin functions only when used by the eldritch poisoner and becomes inert if not used within 1 minute. Creating an arcanotoxin is a standard action, and it can be applied to a weapon as a move action.\nAt 1st level, an eldritch poisoner must choose whether her arcanotoxin deals Strength or Dexterity damage. At 3rd level and every 2 alchemist levels thereafter, she can enhance her arcanotoxin in one of the following ways. She can\u0027t select the same improvement twice in a row.\nSelect one additional form of ability damage: Charisma, Dexterity, Intelligence, Strength, or Wisdom. Grant an onset time of 1 round, or increase an existing onset time by 2 rounds (maximum 11 rounds). Increase the ability damage die by one step (maximum 1d6). Increase the number of consecutive saves required to cure the poison by 1 (maximum 3). Increase the frequency by 2 rounds (maximum 10 rounds).\nIf an eldritch poisoner can deal different kinds of ability damage, she selects which ability to affect each time she creates a dose of arcanotoxin, and can willingly reduce enhanced aspects of her arcanotoxin, such as the save DC or onset time. Some discoveries apply secondary effects; a dose of arcanotoxin can cause only one secondary effect.\nAlchemist discoveries that affect mundane poisons do not apply to an arcanotoxin.\nThis ability replaces bomb."
