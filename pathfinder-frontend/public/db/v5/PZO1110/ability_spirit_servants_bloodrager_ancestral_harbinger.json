    "text": "At 5th level, an ancestral harbinger adds summon monster I to her class spell list and gains it as a bonus spell known. She also gains summon monster II at 8th level, summon monster III at 11th level, and summon monster IV at 14th level. These spells can be used only to summon types of monsters with strong ties to the ancestral harbinger\u0027s family history, ranging from clan totems to monsters of the same type as those famously killed by her forebears. For each of these spells, the ancestral harbinger selects a number of monsters she can summon equal to her Charisma bonus (minimum 1) to represent these spirits. These monsters are selected from the options on the summon monster creature list or the Expanded Summon Monster list that are appropriate for the spell level.\nAt 7th level and every 2 bloodrager levels thereafter, the ancestral harbinger can swap one selected monster from one of these spells for a new monster from the same level\u0027s summoning lists.\nThe ancestral harbinger has a mystic tie to the spirit servants summoned with this ability. When the ancestral harbinger is in a bloodrage, all of her spirit servants gain a +2 morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. The spirit servants also gain 2 temporary hit points per Hit Die. At 11th level, the morale bonus increases to +3 and the number of temporary hit points per Hit Die increases to 3. At 20th level, the morale bonus increases to +4 and the number of temporary hit points per Hit Die increases to 4. The morale bonus and temporary hit points last until the bloodrage ends."
