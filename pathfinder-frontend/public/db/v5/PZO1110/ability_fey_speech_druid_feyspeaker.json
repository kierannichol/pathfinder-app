    "text": "At 1st level, a feyspeaker\u0027s words carry a tiny fragment of the otherworldly power of the fey\u0027s voices. She gains Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, and Sense Motive as class skills. A feyspeaker also learns Sylvan as a bonus language. In addition, the feyspeaker gains a number of skill ranks at each level equal to 6 + her Intelligence modifier, instead of 4 + her Intelligence modifier. The feyspeaker\u0027s base attack bonus from her druid levels is equal to half her druid level (much like a sorcerer\u0027s base attack bonus is calculated), rather than the usual druid base attack bonus."
