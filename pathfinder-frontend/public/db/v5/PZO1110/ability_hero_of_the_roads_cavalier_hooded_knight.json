    "text": "When on a road, a hooded knight gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks. These bonuses increase by 2 at 9th and 17th level. The speed of any mount a hooded knight rides is increased by 10 feet at 9th level and by an additional 10 feet at 17th level. By spending 1 minute coaxing his allies\u0027 mounts and expending one use of his challenge ability, a hooded knight can grant the same speed increase to the mounts ridden by all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him. This speed increase to his allies\u0027 mounts lasts for 1 hour.\nA hooded knight and his mount can hustle while traveling on a road without taking damage for 2 hours each day, plus an additional 2 hours at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 8 hours at 15th level)."
