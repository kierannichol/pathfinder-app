    "text": "At 2nd level, a construct saboteur can user her arcane prowess to hinder constructs.\nWhenever she uses Arcane Strike to attack a construct, she can activate one of the following sabotage abilities that she has gained. She gains one sabotage ability at 2nd level and can thereafter select any sabotage ability in place of a rogue talent. The DC for any sabotage ability that requires a saving throw is 10 + half the construct saboteur\u0027s level + the construct saboteur\u0027s Intelligence modifier.\nDiminish Senses: A jolt of energy overwhelms the construct\u0027s senses. The construct is blinded for 1 round. A construct saboteur can forgo dealing sneak attack damage to extend the duration of the blindness by 1 round for every 2d6 points of sneak attack damage forgone in this way. A construct can negate this effect with a successful Will save.\nMagic Vulnerability: A field of energy enshrouds the construct, disabling its immunity to magic for 1 round.\nThe construct instead gains spell resistance equal to 15 + its CR. A construct saboteur can forgo dealing sneak attack damage to reduce this spell resistance. The construct\u0027s spell resistance is reduced by 1 for every 1d6 points of sneak attack damage forgone in this way. A construct can negate this effect with a successful Will save.\nOverwhelming Jolt: A sudden burst of power moves over the surface of the construct, giving it the staggered condition for 1 round. A construct can negate this effect with a successful Will save.\nSlowing Pulse: A surge of slowing energy ripples through the construct, reducing its speed by 5 feet for a number of rounds equal to the construct saboteur\u0027s Intelligence modifier. A construct saboteur can forgo dealing sneak attack damage to reduce the construct\u0027s speed by an additional 5 feet for every 1d6 points of sneak attack damage forgone in this way. This ability cannot lower a construct\u0027s movement speed below 5 feet. A construct can reduce the duration of this effect to 1 round with a successful Reflex save."
