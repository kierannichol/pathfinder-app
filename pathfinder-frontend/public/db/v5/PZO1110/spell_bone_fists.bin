ÇThe bones of your targets' joints grow thick and sharp, protruding painfully through the skin at the knuckles, elbows, shoulders, spine, and knees. The targets each gain a +1 bonus to natural armor and a +2 bonus on damage rolls with natural weapons, and they are treated as having armor spikes, with which they are proficient.
