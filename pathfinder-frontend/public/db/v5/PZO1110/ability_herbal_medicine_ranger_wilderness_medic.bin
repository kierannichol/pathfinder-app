âAt 3rd level, a wilderness medic can mimic the effects of stabilize at will in any wilderness area by spending one use of a healer's kit as long as he can see the target.
Additionally, as a standard action a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Wisdom modifier, the wilderness medic can use encouraging words and herbs to lessen the severity of certain conditions affecting a touched target. If the target is exhausted, it becomes fatigued instead. If the target is frightened, it becomes shaken instead. If the target is nauseated, it becomes sickened instead. The duration of the effect is unchanged; the effect is simply reduced to the lesser version.
At 9th level, the wilderness medic can lessen the severity of additional conditions for the target and cure other conditions that the target suffers. If the target creature is blinded, it becomes dazzled instead. If the target is panicked, it becomes shaken instead. If it has any of the following conditions, they are cured: deafened, fatigued, shaken, and sickened. The wilderness medic is able to use this ability on a given touched target once every 24 hours.ª6
