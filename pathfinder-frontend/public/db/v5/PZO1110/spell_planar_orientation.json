    "text": "This spell helps creatures accustomed to the concrete reality of the Material Plane to navigate within the confusing realities of other planes. When cast, it functions as know direction, save that instead of revealing true north, it reveals the direction of the palace or demesnes most associated with that plane or demiplane\u0027s ruling god or demigod, as well as a brief and generic vision of that entity\u0027s appearance or holy symbol. The spell functions only within whatever plane or demiplane you are located in at the time; for instance, if cast within a specific demon lord\u0027s Abyssal realm or on a given layer of Hell, it would point to the seat of power for that demon lord or archdevil, not Lamashtu or Asmodeus. If a plane or demiplane has multiple gods or rulers, such as the Eldest of the First World or Heaven\u0027s various Empyreal Lords and deities, it reveals the directions of the closest three, allowing for triangulation."
