¤A mixologist can infuse potions and extracts he creates with alcohol, increasing their potency. When a mixologist brews a potion, he can spend an additional 10 gp in raw materials to increase his caster level by 1 for the purpose of the potion's effects, but the potion counts as a strong alcoholic drink. When a mixologist creates his extracts, he can spend 1 extra minute doing so to increase his caster level by 1 for the purpose of that extract's effects, but the extract counts as a strong alcoholic drink. A mixologist can prepare one alcoholic extract for each level of extracts he can prepare. A mixologist can't ever gain a mutagen or discoveries that alter mutagens.ª5
