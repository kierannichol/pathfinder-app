    "text": "At 3rd level and every 5 levels thereafter, the wasteland chronicler gains the benefits of the favored terrain ranger class feature, but the wasteland chronicler can choose only cold, desert, mountain, or swamp from the ranger\u0027s favored terrain list. In addition, the wasteland chronicler adds half his level (minimum 1) as a bonus on Diplomacy checks to influence the attitude of wasteland dwellers.\nIf the wasteland chronicler has the favored terrain ability from any other classes, the levels from these different sources stack for the purposes of improving the bonuses of selected favored terrains and choosing new favored terrains."
