‘At 4th level, when a liberty's blade channels energy to heal, the effects of his healing is halved, but all creatures affected by his healing instantly benefit as if from a liberating command spell at the liberty's blade's caster level. When channeling to harm, the liberty's blade harms devils as if using Alignment Channel instead of harming undead, and she deals double the normal amount of damage.ª7
