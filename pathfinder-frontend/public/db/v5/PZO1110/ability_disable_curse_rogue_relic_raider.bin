†At 8th level, a relic raider can attempt to disable a curse as she would a magical trap. This ability acts as remove curse, except instead of a caster level check, the relic raider attempts a Disable Device check (DC = 15 + the DC of the curse). Disabling a curse takes 2d4 rounds, and the relic raider cannot take 10 or 20 on this check. A relic raider can use this ability once per day at 8th level. At 12th level and every 4 rogue levels thereafter, a relic raider can use disable curse one additional time per day.ª/
