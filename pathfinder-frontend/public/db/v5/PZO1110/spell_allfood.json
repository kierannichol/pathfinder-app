    "text": "You can transform one object, weighing up to 5 lbs. per caster level, into an edible substance that any living creature can chew, swallow, and safely digest. This allfood always has a bland taste and slightly gooey consistency when chewed regardless of its original nature. One pound of allfoodprovides enough sustenance to support a Medium creature for an entire day."
