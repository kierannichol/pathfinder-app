îAt 14th level, a shadow scion can spend 1 minute meditating within a patch of dim light or darkness; at the end of the time, she can draw information from the shadows. This functions as commune with nature, except that it functions in any terrain to a radius of 100 feet per rogue level, and it cannot reveal information about any object or subject that is not currently in dim light or darkness. The shadow scion can use this ability once per day at 14th level and twice per day at 19th level.ª0
