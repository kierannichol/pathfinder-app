òAt 5th level, a commando can learn how to create one ranger trap in place of gaining the next level of gun training. A commando can use a known trap a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom bonus (minimum 1). The DC for a commando's trap is equal to 10 + half her commando level + her Wisdom bonus, and it lasts 1 day per 2 levels she has.
A commando can set only extraordinary ranger traps with this ability; as with extraordinary ranger traps, the trap DC for these traps has a â€“2 penalty.ª,
