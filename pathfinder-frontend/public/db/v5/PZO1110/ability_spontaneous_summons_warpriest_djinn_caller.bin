ûA djinn caller is extremely flexible in channeling his stored spell energy. In addition to losing prepared spells to cast â€œcure" or â€œinflict" spells, he can also lose a prepared spell in order to cast any summon monster spell of the same level or lower. He can use this ability only to summon an elemental whose subtype matches his blessing. He can expend one use of his fervor ability to decrease the spell's casting time to 1 standard action and to increase the spell's duration to 1 minute per level.ª9
