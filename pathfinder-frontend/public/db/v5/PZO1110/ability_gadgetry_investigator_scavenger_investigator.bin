ˆA scavenger is a master of mechanical arts rather than alchemical ones, and he gains a competence bonus on Craft (clockwork) checks equal to his class level.
He can use Knowledge (engineering) to identify wondrous items as if using detect magic and Spellcraft. A scavenger does not gain any bonuses to or special uses of the Craft (alchemy) skill.
Rather than prepare his extracts as consumable liquids, a scavenger constructs small, single-use devices infused with bits of his own magic aura to achieve the same effects. Alchemist and investigator discoveries that affect extracts result in identical effects on a scavenger's gadgets (such as the infusion discovery, which would allow another creature to use a gadget, just as it would allow that creature to use an extract).ª;
