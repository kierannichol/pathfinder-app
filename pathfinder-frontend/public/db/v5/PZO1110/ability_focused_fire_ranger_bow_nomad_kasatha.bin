ÉAt 6th level, the bow nomad must select the Manyshot feat as her 6th-level combat style feat. In addition to the normal benefit of Manyshot, the bow nomad can specify the bow in her off hands as the source of the second arrow (precision damage and critical damage are still only added once). The bow nomad takes no two-weapon penalties when using this ability, but she cannot use it and Two-Weapon Fighting in the same round. The nomad can still choose to use Manyshot in the normal manner.
At 11th and 16th level, the bow nomad can apply this ability to each of her iterative attacks.ª4
