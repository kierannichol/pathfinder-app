®	A pact witch chooses one Outer Planes with which to forge a pact. This plane determines the alignment a pact witch must maintain and the type of improved familiar he gains at 6th level. Many pact witches worship specific deities or demigods native to the planes with which they forged their pacts. When a pact witch chooses his plane, his body transforms in minor, cosmetic ways associated with that plane. A pact with Hell might give a pact witch small devil horns, while a pact with the Heaven might cause a pact witch to have a softly glowing golden halo, and a pact with Axis might give a pact witch's skin strange rune patterns. The nature of this cosmetic change varies from witch to witch, but has no mechanical effect. Instead of learning new spells from a patron, a pact witch learns new spells from his planar pact, starting at 2nd level and again every 2 levels thereafter.
2nd Level: Protection from chaos/evil/good/law (choose one appropriate to your plane) 4th Level: Time shudder. 6th Level: Infuse self. 8th Level: Lesser planar ally. 10th Level: Plane shift (as a 5th level spell). 12th Level: Planar ally. 14th Level: Banishment. 16th Level: Greater planar ally. 18th Level: Gate.ª+
