    "text": "At 8th level, a needler learns how to deliver all types of poisons with subtlety. As a standard action, she can deliver an ingested or inhaled poison to a creature within reach by placing a dose of poison on the target\u0027s lips, on the target\u0027s neck, or through other similar contact with the target\u0027s skin as if the poison were a contact poison. Delivering poison in this way requires a successful Sleight of Hand check opposed by the target\u0027s Perception check. The poison is not lost on a failed check, but it must be successfully delivered within 1 minute of the first attempt, or it is wasted."
