    "text": "At 11th level, the woodland sniper gains a climb speed equal to his base speed. In addition, at 13th level, he can move from one tree to another via connecting branches by adding 5 to the DC of an Acrobatics or Climb check to move within the canopy. The woodland sniper cannot end his movement on a branch that cannot support his weight."
