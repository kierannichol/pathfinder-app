    "text": "An alley witch builds a special rapport with a single city. At 1st level, she can select one settlement whose type is large town size or larger. Within this settlement, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks, as well as Knowledge (local), Perception, Stealth, and Sense Motive checks. At 6th level and every 5 witch levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 2. The alley witch can build a rapport with a new city after 30 days of remaining there; this severs her bond to her previous settlement."
