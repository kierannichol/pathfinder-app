    "text": "At 10th level, a scroll scoundrel can discover a weakness in his enemy\u0027s defenses as a swift action. His next successful hit in the same round ignores 5 points of the foe\u0027s damage reduction or hardness.\nAt 15th level, he ignores the first 10 points, and at 20th level, the first 15 points. If the attack deals any sneak attack damage, he ignores all of the foe\u0027s damage reduction or hardness for that attack. He cannot use this ability on foes that are immune to critical hits."
