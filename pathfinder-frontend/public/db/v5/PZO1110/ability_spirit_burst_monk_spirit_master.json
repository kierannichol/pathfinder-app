    "text": "At 7th level, whenever a spirit master destroys an undead creature with a melee attack, he may as a free action expend 2 points from his ki pool to release an 15-foot-radius burst of positive energy centered on the destroyed creature. Undead creatures in the affected area each take a number of points of damage equal the number of Hit Dice of the destroyed creature. Living creatures in the area are healed by the same amount."
