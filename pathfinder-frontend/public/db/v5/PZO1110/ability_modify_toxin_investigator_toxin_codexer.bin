çAt 3rd level, a toxin codexer learns to unlock both the beneficial and detrimental side effects of his poisons. These effects apply even if the target succeeds at her save against the poison, but they still count as poison effects. A modified toxin becomes inert if not used within 1 hour.
As a move action, the toxin codexer can expend one use of inspiration to apply one of the following effects to a poison in his possession, choosing either the benefit or the detriment when an effect has both options. These effects last for a number of rounds equal to the investigator's Intelligence modifier unless otherwise stated.
Grant a +2 alchemical bonus or impose a â€“2 alchemical penalty on saving throws against exhaustion, fatigue, and sleep effects. Grant a +4 alchemical bonus or impose a â€“4 alchemical penalty on saving throws against effects with the pain descriptor.
At 6th level, the toxin codexer can also choose from the following effects:
Affect a target so the first time she takes damage each round, she takes an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. This is a pain effect. Inflict or remove the fatigued condition.
At 9th level, the toxin codexer can also choose from the following effects:
Deal 1 point of bleed damage or cure any ongoing bleed effects. Cure one disease or poison whose save DC does not exceed that of the modified poison. This has no effect on magical curses, diseases, or poisons.
At 12th level, the toxin codexer can also choose from the following effects:
Cure one magical disease or poison whose save DC does not exceed that of the modified poison. Bestow a 30% spell failure chance on a target.ª6
