•At 5th level, a Relentless inspector can learn enough about a suspect through observation that he can deduce the most effective way to deal with the subject. Once per day, if a Relentless inspector finds a creature's tracks using perceptive tracking, he gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against or about that creature, as well as on weapon attack and damage rolls against that creature. These bonuses last until the Relentless inspector selects a new subject for relentless pursuit.ªC
