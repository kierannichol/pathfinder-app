èAt 14th level, a kraken slayer gains a sacred bonus equal to her kraken slayer level on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks to escape a grapple and to her CMD to avoid being grappled. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a sacred bonus equal to half her kraken slayer level on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks to escape a grapple and to CMD to avoid being grappled.
