    "text": "Members of the Order of the Palatine Eye carry themselves with the austerity and import their heavenly aspirations demand. A speaker of the Palatine Eye does not have Acrobatics or Escape Artist as class skills, but he gains Celestial as a bonus language. This does not count toward the number of languages he is otherwise able to learn."
