    "text": "At 8th level, once each day while preparing spells, an Elder Mythos scholar can spend 1 extra hour to brew a tincture of hallucinogens and alien trace minerals. Though it has no effect for others, if he drinks it, the elixir expands his mind and perceptions into transitive dimensions, granting him a +4 alchemical bonus to his Intelligence score and reducing his Wisdom and Constitution scores by 2 for 10 minutes per wizard level he has. While under the effects of this elixir, he adds 1/2 his class level to his Perception checks against aberrations and creatures listed in talisman of revealing, but subtracts the same amount from all other Perception checks. His spells have a 20% failure chance, unless they summon, call, or contact a creature listed in talisman of revealing or otherwise affect only such creatures (for instance, a fireball aimed at 3 gugs but not a fireball aimed at 3 gugs and a gnome)."
