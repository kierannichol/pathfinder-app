úAt 4th level, a season sage can infuse living things with the essence of a season with a touch, causing them to manifest the changes associated with that season--for example, a touch of winter can make some animals grow a thick winter coat, while a touch of summer can make them shed. A touch of autumn would make a deciduous tree's leaves change colors, a touch of winter would make its leaves fall, and a touch of spring would make it put forth new leaves. In addition, a season sage can use the following abilities (in any combination) a total number of times per day equal to 1 + his Wisdom modifier.
Vernal Growth: A touched living creature gains the effects of enlarge person (even if it is not a humanoid) for 1 minute per druid level. A touched non-creature plant likewise doubles in all dimensions for the same duration. Summer Might: A touched creature gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution for 1 minute per druid level. Autumn Rot: A touched creature or object made of plant matter takes 1d6 points of acid damage per 2 druid levels. Winter Frost: A touched creature or object takes 1d6 points of cold damage per 2 druid levels.ª.
