¤At 2nd level, a cult hunter gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against compulsions and poisons. This bonus increases to +2 at 5th level and +3 at 8th level. At 11th level, a cult hunter who fails a saving throw against a compulsion or poison can expend 1 use of his inspiration to reroll the saving throw (and his inspiration die, if added to the save). He must accept the result of this second roll, even if it is worse.ª<
