ˆWhen a totem channeler learns a new rage power, he can select from more than one group of totem rage powers, even though he normally could not do so. Totem rage powers grant benefits related to a theme, are organized in groups of three, and usually have the word â€œtotem" in their name. When the totem channeler starts an inspired rage raging song, he can add totem rage powers from only one group at a time.
He can change the group of added totem rage powers by ending the current inspired rage and starting a new one.ª8
