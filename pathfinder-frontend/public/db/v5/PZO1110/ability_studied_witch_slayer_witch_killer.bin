ÕA witch killer's studied combat bonus applies on Spellcraft checks and saving throws against arcane spells and spell-like abilities and hexes. This bonus is reduced by 1 (minimum 0) if the target is not an arcane spellcaster, or a being called or summoned by arcane magic. He does not gain the increases to the maximum number of studied targets he can have at a time normally attained at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, but his bonuses still increase at those levels.ª0
