    "text": "Starting at 3rd level, a carnivalist receives a bonus equal to 1/2 her rogue level whenever she uses Handle Animal on a Tiny or Small animal. In addition, she can increase the DC by 5 to reduce the time needed to teach an animal a new trick or train an animal for a general purpose to 1 day for every week normally required. She can also train more than one animal at once, although each animal after the first adds 2 to the DC."
