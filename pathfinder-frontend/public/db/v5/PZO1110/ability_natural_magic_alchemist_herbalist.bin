ÀAn herbalist's study of the leshy spirit grants him access to natural magic that eludes other alchemists. Each time he gains access to a new level of extracts (including 1st level), he can add two spells from that spell level on the druid spell list to his alchemist class spell list; these spells must target a creature or creatures or have a range of â€œyou," and he must still add them to his formula book as normal before he can prepare them. As always, the extracts affect the drinker as if she were the target, so offensive touch spells are a nasty trap for the drinker.ª0
