ãSince an unwavering conduit's power is drawn from planar energies aligned with law, all the creatures he summons must be of a lawful alignment.
If a creature would normally be celestial or fiendish, it is instead a resolute creature.
This also causes the unwavering conduit's summoning power to be more set than a standard summoner's. Beginning at 3rd level, each time he uses summon monster to summon multiple monsters, rather than rolling a die to see how many creatures he summons, he receives a specific number (two creatures for 1d3, or four creatures for 1d4+1). If an item, spell, or ability would increase the number of creatures summoned, the set number increases by that amount.
Also, starting at 2nd level, creatures summoned by the unwavering conduit receive a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells and abilities of the conjuration, enchantment, and transmutation schools. This bonus increases to +2 at 6th level, and by an additional 1 every 4 class levels thereafter.ª>
