    "text": "At 2nd level, an oozemaster becomes especially resistant to the abilities of his chosen foes. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against the extraordinary and supernatural abilities of oozes. This bonus increases by +1 at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, to a maximum of +8 at 20th level.\nThis replaces poison resistance and poison immunity."
