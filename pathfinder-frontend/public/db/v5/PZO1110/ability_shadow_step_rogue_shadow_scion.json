    "text": "At 8th level, a shadow scion can walk through the Shadow Plane and reappear elsewhere on the Material Plane as a standard action. The shadow scion can travel up to 30 feet per rogue level per day in this fashion, either in a single round or broken up across multiple shadow steps. This movement must be used in increments of at least 5 feet and does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Travel through the Shadow Plane is imprecise; when the shadow scion arrives back on the Material Plane, she reenters 1 square off target, as per the rules for thrown splash weapons. If this would place her in an occupied square, she instead arrives in the nearest safe location. When the shadow scion arrives on the Material Plane, she is cloaked in shadow and gains concealment as per the blur spell for 1 round."
