ÀWith this spell, you infuse your life force and psyche into your shadow, giving it independent life and movement as if it were an undead shadow (see Pathfinder RPG Bestiary245). Your physical body lies comatose while you are projecting your shadow, and your body has no shadow or reflection while the spell is in effect.
