    "text": "By holding aloft a holy symbol and calling your deity\u0027s name, you take on an aspect of that divinity. When you cast this spell, choose a domain offered by your deity. You gain that domain\u0027s benefits from the list below, along with the listed physical changes; abilities that allow a saving throw use this spell\u0027s DC. At any point during the duration of this spell, you can change which domain benefit you gain by concentrating for 1 round--this provokes attacks of opportunity and reduces the remaining duration of the spell by 10 minutes. If you have less than 10 minutes of the spell\u0027s duration remaining, you cannot change the selected domain in this way. If you change your domain, all ongoing effects from your previously chosen domain end."
