At 8th level, a progenitor can use wild shape to change into a Tiny or Large fey. When she does so, her wild shape functions as fey form II.
At 10th level, a progenitor can use wild shape to change into a Diminutive or Huge fey. When she does so, her wild shape functions as fey form III.
At 14th level, when a progenitor uses wild shape to assume a fey form, her wild shape functions as fey form IV.ª)
