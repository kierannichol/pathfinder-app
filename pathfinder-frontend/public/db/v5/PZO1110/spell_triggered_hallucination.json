    "text": "This spell functions as audiovisual hallucination, except that this spell\u0027s phantasm has no apparent effect until a specific condition occurs. You must overcome the target\u0027s spell resistance to plant the triggered hallucination, but the target doesn\u0027t attempt a Will save to disbelieve the illusion until the condition occurs (at which point it receives an automatic Will save, as with audiovisual hallucination). The phantasm can include auditory, olfactory, visual, tactile, and thermal elements, including intelligible speech."
