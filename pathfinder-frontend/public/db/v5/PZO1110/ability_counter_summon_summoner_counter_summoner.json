    "text": "At 1st level, a counter-summoner can attempt to counter a conjuration spell cast by another creature. He must identify the spell being cast as normal for counterspelling. If he does so, he can attempt to counter the spell as a swift or immediate action. To counter the spell, the counter-summoner must attempt a dispel check as if using dispel magic. If the spell being countered is a summon monster or summon nature\u0027s ally spell, the counter-summoner gains a +5 bonus on the dispel check. The counter-summoner can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier."
