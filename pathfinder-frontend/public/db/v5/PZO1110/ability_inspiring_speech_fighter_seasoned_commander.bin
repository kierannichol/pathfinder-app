¹At 5th level, a seasoned commander can give an inspiring speech as a standard action once per day. If he does, all allies who can hear his speech gain the benefits of inspire courage, granting bonuses 1 lower than those granted by a bard of the seasoned commander's fighter level, lasting 1 round per fighter level + his Charisma modifier (abilities that affect a bardic performance, such as Lingering Performance, have no effect on this ability). At 7th level, he can perform the speech as a move action, and at 13th level, he can perform the speech as a swift action.ª:
