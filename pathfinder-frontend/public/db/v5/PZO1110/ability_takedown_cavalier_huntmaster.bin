‹At 3rd level, a huntmaster's dog can make a free trip or dirty trick (entangled) combat maneuver after a successful melee attack. A huntmaster's bird can make a free dirty trick (dazzled or deafened) combat maneuver after a successful melee attack; if the target is already dazzled, the bird can choose dirty trick (blinded) instead. These combat maneuvers do not provoke attacks of opportunity.ª+
