    "text": "At 11th level, as a standard action, a buckler duelist can make a single melee attack with a falcata. If the attack hits, he may make a sunder combat maneuver against the target of his attack as a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.\nThis ability replaces armor training 3."
