    "text": "At 8th level, the dune rider is at home in the desert. He exists comfortably in hot conditions up to 140ยบ Fahrenheit without having to attempt Fortitude saves.\nHis equipment is likewise protected. He takes no penalties on Perception checks from blowing sand, dust, or heat shimmers, nor do these effects grant concealment to the dune rider\u0027s enemies within 30 feet. Effects that would grant total concealment work normally."
