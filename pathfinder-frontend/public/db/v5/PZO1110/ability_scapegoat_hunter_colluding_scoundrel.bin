îA colluding scoundrel is adept at redirecting a foe's hostility toward another creature, creating openings for her own attacks. A number of times per day equal to her hunter level, as a swift action, she can target one foe within 30 feet and designate one willing ally adjacent to that foe as a scapegoat. For the following minute, the target takes a â€“2 penalty on attacks against any creature other than the designated scapegoat, and the target has a 10% spell failure chance on spells that don't target the scapegoat or include the scapegoat in their area of effect. The penalty increases to â€“4 at 8th level and â€“6 at 15th level.
The colluding scoundrel can designate her animal companion as a scapegoat without it counting against her daily uses of this ability.
This is a mind-affecting effect. The effect ends if the colluding scoundrel falls unconscious or is slain.ª3
