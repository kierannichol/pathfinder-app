    "text": "At 2nd level, a profiler has analyzed the workings of the mind. His caster level to determine the duration of his divination extracts increases by 1, and he gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against divinations. The increases to caster level and bonus on saving throws increase by 1 at 5th level and by another 1 at 8th level. At 11th level, a profiler can expend one use of inspiration to add 1d6 to the result of a concentration check when using a divination extract or investigator spell-like ability."
