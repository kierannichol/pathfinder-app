åA shieldbearer treats shields as sacred weapons (instead of his god's favored weapon), though the shieldbearer can still designate additional weapons as sacred weapons by selecting them with the Weapon Focus feat. The shieldbearer's sacred weapon damage applies only to attacks made with shields.
The shieldbearer does not gain the ability to enhance sacred weapons until 7th level.
For every 3 warpriest levels beyond 7th, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level).ª3
