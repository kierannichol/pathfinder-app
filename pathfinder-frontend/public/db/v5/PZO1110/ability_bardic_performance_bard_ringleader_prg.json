    "text": "A ringleader gains an altered version of inspire competence that grants greater effects at higher levels.\nInspire Competence (Su): At 3rd level, a ringleader can use his performance to help an ally succeed at a task. This ability acts as the inspire competence bardic performance with the following additions.\nAt 8th level, the ringleader\u0027s ally gains a competence bonus on an additional skill (for a total of two skills). In addition, he can end the effect to reroll a check with one of the affected skills (the reroll still applies the bonus from inspire competence). Each ally can only use this latter ability once per day, regardless of the number of skills affected and the number of times they are affected by inspire competence. At 14th level, the ringleader\u0027s ally gains a competence bonus on an additional skill (for a total of three skills). In addition, he can take 10 on the affected skills when stressed or distracted."
