EffectÑAs the ritual begins, the secondary casters each hold one end of their golden threads while the other is tied to the doll. The secondary casters stretch both arms out toward each other and rhythmically chant their common values (this often involves cult or guild members repeating membership vows). The primary caster ties the doll to her wrist with her golden thread. She then approaches each of the secondary casters in turn and touches them on the forehead with the focus doll. Unlike with normal occult rituals, adding more than four secondary casters does not increase the bonus those casters provide to the ritual's required skill checks.
