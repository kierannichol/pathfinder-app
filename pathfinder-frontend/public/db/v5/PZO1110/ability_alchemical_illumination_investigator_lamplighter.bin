ÞAt 2nd level, as a standard action, a lamplighter can cast certain light spells by burning a magic extract, infusion, or potion of a spell of the same or greater level than the light spell in a lit lantern or torch. If the spell has a range of touch, the lantern or torch counts as the object touched. The spell's DC, if any, equals 10 + spell level + the lamplighter's Intelligence modifier.
At 2nd level, the lamplighter can cast light and continual flame (24 hour duration).
At 5th level, the lamplighter can cast daylight and discovery torch.
At 8th level, the lamplighter can cast searing light.
At 11th level, the lamplighter can cast judgment light. The lamplighter need not have an active judgment to cast this spell, can choose what color of judgment light is created, can use his alignment for golden light, and can select any element for copper light.ª?
