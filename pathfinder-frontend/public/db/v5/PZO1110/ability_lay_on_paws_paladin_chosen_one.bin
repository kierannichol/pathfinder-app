£At 2nd level, a chosen one's familiar is able to borrow some of her divine energy to heal itself and others. The familiar can use the chosen one's lay on hands ability, including all of her mercies, but each such use consumes two uses of the paladin's lay on hands ability. Starting at 4th level, the familiar can also channel positive energy, but each such use consumes four uses of the paladin's lay on hands ability.ª-
