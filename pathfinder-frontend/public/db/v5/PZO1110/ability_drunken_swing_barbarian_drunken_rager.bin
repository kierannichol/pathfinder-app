ùAt 12th level, a drunken rager can spend 1 drunken rage point as a swift action before making a melee attack to drastically increase the deadliness of her attack. The critical threat range of her next attack that round increases by 1 (for example, a critical threat range of 20 would increase to 19â€“20). This ability does not stack with any other effect that expands the critical threat range of a weapon. At 16th level and again at 20th level, the barbarian can spend 1 additional drunken rage point to further increase the critical threat range of her next attack (to a maximum critical threat range increase of 3 at 20th level).ª4
