    "text": "At 5th level, a gloomblade gains weapon training, except that he does not select a weapon group; instead, the bonus applies to the shadow weapons he creates. A gloomblade does not select additional weapon groups as he gains levels.\nAt 9th level, whenever a gloomblade creates one or more shadow weapons, he can apply any one of the following shadow effects (chosen upon creation) to one of them.\nDuring the gloomblade\u0027s turn, he can increase his reach with that weapon by 5 feet. The gloomblade can increase a thrown shadow weapon\u0027s range increment (if any) by 20 feet. When he hits a foe with a melee attack with the weapon, he can use it to perform a reposition combat maneuver against the creature hit as a swift action. This does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Attacks made with the weapon ignore hardness equal to or less than the gloomblade\u0027s fighter level.\nFor every 4 levels he has beyond 9th, a gloomblade can apply an additional effect to his shadow weapons, to a maximum of three effects at 17th level; these effects can be split between multiple shadow weapons as a gloomblade desires, but they don\u0027t stack with themselves."
