ÖAt 1st level, a metamorph gains the ability to transform herself into another form. This ability functions like alter self, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per metamorph's alchemist level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to another form or back) is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. The metamorph is fatigued for 1 round each time she changes shape.
A metamorph can use this ability once per day at 1st level, and an additional time per day at 4th level, and every 2 alchemist levels thereafter, for a total of nine times at 18th level. At 20th level, a metamorph can use shapechanger as a free action once per round, either before or after all her other actions, with no daily limit.
This ability can also function as monstrous physique I at 5th level, as monstrous physique II at 9th level, as monstrous physique III at 11th level, as monstrous physique IV or giant form I at 13th level, and as giant form II at 15th level.ª/
