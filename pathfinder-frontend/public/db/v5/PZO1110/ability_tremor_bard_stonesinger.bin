…As part of another bardic performance, a stonesinger can cause the ground within 30 feet to tremble, throwing enemies off balance and causing them to take a â€“1 circumstance penalty to AC as long as the stonesinger continues performing. This penalty increases by 1 at 5th level and every 6 levels thereafter. Creatures levitating or flying above the ground are unaffected by this ability.ª&
