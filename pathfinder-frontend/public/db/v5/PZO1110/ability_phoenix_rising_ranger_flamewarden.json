    "text": "At 16th level, if a flamewarden dies, his body explodes in a conflagration in a 20-foot spread. Each hostile creature in the area takes 10d6 points of fire damage unless it succeeds at a Reflex save (DC \u003d 10 + half the ranger\u0027s level + his Constitution modifier) for half damage. The flames don\u0027t harm the flamewarden\u0027s allies, who instead are healed 5d6 points of damage, and any poisons they are currently suffering are neutralized as per neutralize poison. The flamewarden\u0027s body is reduced to ashes by the explosion.\nAt 20th level, the flamewarden gains immunity to fire, and once per week, the flamewarden rises from the ashes of his own destruction 1 round after dying. The flamewarden\u0027s body re-forms with all his equipment, and he returns to life with half his maximum hit points. Any ability scores that were 0 become 1, and non-magical diseases and poisons are cured. A limited wish, miracle, or wish spell cast before he rises from the ashes prevents him from doing so, as does the area of an unhallow effect."
