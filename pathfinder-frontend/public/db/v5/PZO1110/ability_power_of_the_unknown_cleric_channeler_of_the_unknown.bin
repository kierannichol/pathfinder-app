ÝA channeler of the unknown has lost the benefit of the domains granted by her deity, but the unknown entity that answers her supplications instead grants her the benefits of one domain from the following list: Darkness, Destruction, Luck, Madness, or Void. Instead of a single domain spell slot, the channeler of the unknown gains two domain spell slots per spell level she can cast. A channeler of the unknown cannot select a subdomain in place of the domain available to her.ªC
