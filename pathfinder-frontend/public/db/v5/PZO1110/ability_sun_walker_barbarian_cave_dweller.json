    "text": "At 7th level, a cave dweller gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and on saving throws against effects with the light descriptor or that produce bright or sudden light. Any penalties on attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks because of bright light are reduced by 1. At 10th level and every 3 levels after 10th, the bonus to AC and saving throws, as well as the reduction of light-based penalties, increases by 1.\nThis replaces damage reduction."
