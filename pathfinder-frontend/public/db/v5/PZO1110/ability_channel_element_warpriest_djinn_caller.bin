ÿAt 4th level, a djinn caller gains Elemental Channel as a bonus feat, choosing the elemental subtype that matches his blessing. He doesn't gain the ability to harm undead with channeled energy (if he channels positive energy) or heal undead (if he channels negative energy). Instead, he can channel a blast of elemental matter and energy that buffets his targets. The djinn caller's blessing determines the damage type of this attack, as indicated by the table below. A successful Reflex save halves the damage.ª5
