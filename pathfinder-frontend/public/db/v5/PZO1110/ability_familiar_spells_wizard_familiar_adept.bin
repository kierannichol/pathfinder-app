èA familiar adept stores his spells in his familiar rather than in a spellbook, exactly as a witch does. His familiar can freely trade spells known with a witch's familiar, provided the spells traded are on both casters' class spell lists. The familiar adept's familiar uses the witch rules for familiars, including the increased cost of replacing the familiar.ª4
