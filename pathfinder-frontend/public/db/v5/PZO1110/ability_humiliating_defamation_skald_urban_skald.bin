žAt 10th level, the urban skald can ostracize a foe. The song has one primary target, who the skald must see and name or describe. That target must attempt a Will save. On a failed save, the primary target cannot benefit from any morale bonus or teamwork feats, cannot treat any creature as an ally, and must attempt to save against any spell cast on it (including harmless spells, even if it casts them on itself ). These effects remain as long as the primary target can hear the skald and the skald maintains the performance.
All other foes within 60 feet of the skald are secondary targets. Secondary targets must succeed at Will saves or they cannot treat the primary target as an ally, and cannot target it with spells or abilities that are harmless.
These effects remain as long as the secondary targets are within 60 feet of the skald and the skald maintains the performance. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect.ª7
