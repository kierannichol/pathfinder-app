ÀAt 3rd level, a martyr can apply any of the mercies for which he qualifies based on his paladin level to his lay on hands, even if he didn't select that mercy (or its prerequisites). However, when he uses a mercy he didn't select, he transfers the condition to himself for the remaining duration (ignoring any immunity he might have to the condition), and he can't use this ability if he already has that condition. If he transfers a condition to himself in this way, he can't remove it from himself with a personal-only ability. The martyr can use lay on hands on any ally within 30 feet, rather than needing to touch the ally, but using lay on hands on himself is a standard action, not a swift action.ª+
