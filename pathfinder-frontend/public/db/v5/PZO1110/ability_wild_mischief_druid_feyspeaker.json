    "text": "At 1st level, a feyspeaker can fool an animal into thinking there is food, a potential mate, or a predator nearby. This ability functions just like a Bluff check to deceive a character. To determine the result of the wild mischief check, the feyspeaker rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier. As with Bluff checks, wild mischief checks are modified depending on the believability of the false information. A typical domestic animal is not particularly suspicious of the feyspeaker (no circumstance modifier), whereas wild animals are usually suspicious (–5 penalty on the check).\nTo use wild mischief, the feyspeaker and the animal must be able to study each other, which means they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions.\nGenerally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but as when influencing people, it could take more or less time. A feyspeaker can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –4 penalty on the check."
