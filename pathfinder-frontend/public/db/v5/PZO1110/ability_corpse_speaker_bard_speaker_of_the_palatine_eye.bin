ÔA speaker of the Palatine Eye can make it appear as if a corpse is speaking, similar to ventriloquism.
A creature must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the bard's level + the bard's Charisma modifier) to see through the ruse. A creature that fails the saving throw is convinced that the corpse is speaking of its own volition.ª>
