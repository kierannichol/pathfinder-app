¦At 4th level, a tempest tamer gains the ability to turn herself into a Small water elemental.
This ability functions as per the elemental body I spell except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level or until she changes back. Changing form (to an elemental or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.
At 6th level, a tempest tamer can use tempest wild shape to change into a Small air elemental. At 8th level, a tempest tamer can use tempest wild shape to change into a Medium air or water elemental, as per elemental body II. At 10th level, a tempest tamer can use tempest wild shape to change into a Large air or water elemental, as per elemental body III. At 12th level, a tempest tamer can use tempest wild shape to change into a Huge air or water elemental, as per elemental body IV.
A tempest tamer can use this ability once per day plus an additional time per day at 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter (up to a total of eight times at 18th level). At 20th level, she can use tempest wild shape at will.ª5
