âAt 8th level, a Dark Sister can violently dismiss her curses to counter magical boons and impose her own capricious whims. Once per day, after the Dark Sister has successfully affected a creature within 30 feet with a mind-affecting spell, spell-like ability, or hex with a duration of longer than 1 round, she can choose to dismiss the mind-affecting effect as an immediate action. If she dismisses this effect in response to another creature targeting her victim with a beneficial spell or ability, the witch's effect is dismissed and the caster of the beneficial spell or ability must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the witch's level + her Intelligence modifier) or the spell or ability is wasted to no effect and the targeted victim takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. At 14th and 20th levels, a Dark Sister can use this ability an additional time per day.ª,
