™At 5th level, a clocksmith learns to improve upon his construct familiar. A clocksmith can grant his familiar 1 evolution point worth of eidolon evolutions for every 5 wizard levels he has, though he can't select any evolutions that require a specific base form.
Each time the clocksmith gains a level, he can change his familiar's evolutions. These evolutions stack with those from the Evolved Familiar feat.ª3
