    "text": "At 2nd level, a road keeper travels over roads and paths at an accelerated rate. She and her allies can hustle for 2 hours without taking nonlethal damage, instead of 1, provided they travel along a road or path. Additionally, as long as they travel on a road or path, the road keeper and her allies count as traveling along a highway regardless of the quality of the road or path on which they travel. Allies must remain within 30 feet of the road keeper to benefit from this ability."
