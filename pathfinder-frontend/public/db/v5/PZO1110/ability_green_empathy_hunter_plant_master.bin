ïA plant master can improve the attitude of a plant creature. Green empathy functions like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The plant master rolls 1d20 and adds his hunter level and his Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical wild plant creature has a starting attitude of indifferent.
To use green empathy, the plant master and the plant creature must be within 30 feet of each other under normal conditions. Generally, influencing a plant creature in this way takes 1 minute, but as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.
A plant master can also use this ability to influence an animal, but he takes a â€“4 penalty on the check. He has no ability to influence magical beasts.ª0
