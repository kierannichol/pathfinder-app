µAt 10th level, a solacer can use his performances to protect and heal a target's soul. The solacer can perform for 1 hour (this requires no skill check) and grant several benefits for 24 hours to the creatures that can hear or see his performance, or both, depending on whether the performance has audible or visual components. Affected creatures gain a +3 bonus on saving throws against curses, possession spells and effects (such as magic jar), and domination and mind control spells and effects (such as dominate person). If the target is suffering any or multiple such effects, it immediately can attempt a new saving throw against each; the effect ends if the saving throw is successful. Only one such extra saving throw can be granted against each condition in any 24-hour period. If a creature benefits from the daily performance between saving throws against a corruption (Horror Adventures 14) progressing, it gains a +3 bonus on the next saving throw against that corruption.
The amount of this bonus increases by 1 at 16th and 19th levels (maximum +5 at 19th level).ª1
