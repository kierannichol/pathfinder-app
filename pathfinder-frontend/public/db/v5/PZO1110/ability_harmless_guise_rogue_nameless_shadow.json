    "text": "A nameless shadow gains the dual identity and seamless guise vigilante class features, with the following restrictions. Her social identity must be that of a mundane and nonthreatening member of society, such as a farmer or a merchant. At 6th level, the nameless shadow gains the many guises vigilante social talent. At 8th level, the nameless shadow gains the quick change vigilante social talent. At 14th level, the nameless shadow gains the everyman vigilante social talent. At 18th level, the nameless shadow gains the any guise vigilante social talent.\nAdditionally, when a nameless shadow attacks a foe while in a social or mundane identity, her target takes a â€“2 penalty to AC for the purpose of resolving that attack. This use of harmless guise forces the nameless shadow into her vigilante identity after the attack is completed, and the target (if it survives) then becomes aware of the nameless shadow\u0027s secret. This ability cannot be used on targets that are aware of the nameless shadow\u0027s dual identity."
