    "text": "You bind your power to a specific tree. Any damage to the tree deals the same amount of damage to you, overcoming DR, energy resistance, and immunities. Damage you take in this way cannot be healed by normal or magical means until your bonded tree is healed or destroyed. The damage can reduce you to 0 hit points but not below. If the tree is destroyed, you are considered to be staggered and are unable to cast oracle spells or use supernatural or spell-like class abilities until you bond with a new tree in a ceremony that takes 12 hours to complete. Once per month, you can create a new bond with a different tree in a ceremony at that tree that takes 12 hours to complete. You lose your bond with your previous tree in the process."
