    "text": "A divine paragon is intensely devoted to a single deity, and her alignment must be identical to her deity\u0027s alignment. She gains Deific Obedience as a bonus feat, even if she doesn\u0027t meet the feat\u0027s prerequisites. She gains access to her boons at an accelerated rate (see below) rather than the standard HD-based rate granted by Deific Obedience (and as such cannot benefit from the accelerated rate granted by the Deific Obedience feat).\nWhen the divine paragon selects her domains, she must designate one of the two domains she gains as her devoted domain. She gains all of this domain\u0027s granted powers and domain spells normally. For her other domain, she gains only its domain spells--she does not gain any of the granted powers of that domain. Instead, she must choose from the evangelist, exalted, or sentinel boons granted by her deity. At 5th level, she gains access to the first boon granted by her deity.\nAt 11th level, she gains access to the second boon. At 14th level, she gains access to the third boon.\nIn order to retain access to her domain spells, the domain powers of her devoted domain, and the boons granted by Deific Obedience, the divine paragon must perform her obedience daily. If she fails to do so, she loses access to these abilities until she next performs her obedience (but she can still cast spells, channel energy, and perform other abilities granted by her cleric levels)."
