    "text": "At 11th level, whenever a prowler at world\u0027s end enters a bloodrage, he can apply the effects of beast shape IV to himself instead of using greater bloodrage or mighty bloodrage to apply the effects of a bloodrager spell to himself. He must assume the form of a great cat of the same kind as a channeled spirit (cheetah, leopard, lion, or tiger). This effect lasts for as long as the prowler continues bloodraging, regardless of its normal duration, and using it does not consume a spell slot."
