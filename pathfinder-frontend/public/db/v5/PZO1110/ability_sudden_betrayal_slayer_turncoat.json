    "text": "At 14th level, as a standard action a turncoat can choose a single creature within 30 feet. He gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks against this target. If the target has an attitude of indifferent or better toward him, the first attack roll the turncoat makes against that target is automatically treated as threatening a critical hit. If the target\u0027s attitude is friendly or better, a successful attack is treated as a confirmed critical hit. This ability can be used only once per day.\nAt 19th level, the bonus increases to +6, and the attack is treated as a confirmed critical hit if the target is at least indifferent to the turncoat."
