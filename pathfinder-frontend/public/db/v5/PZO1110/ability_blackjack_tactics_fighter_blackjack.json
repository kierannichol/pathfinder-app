    "text": "At 4th level, two or more Blackjacks can spend 1 minute discussing strategy, then choose a single teamwork feat possessed by at least one of them. For a number of hours equal to the class level of the highest-level Blackjack, the participants each gain the benefits of the selected feat even if they do not meet the feat\u0027s prerequisites. If a creature benefiting from this ability moves more than 30 feet away from any other participant, it loses all benefits of this ability until it is again within 30 feet. Creatures that do not have levels in this archetype can\u0027t benefit from this ability, and no creature can benefit from this ability more than once at any given time."
