    "text": "At 2nd level, a questioner receives a +1 bonus on skill checks for all Knowledge skills in which he is trained. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter, to a maximum of +6 at 17th level. If he has the perceptive tracking investigator talent, he also adds this bonus on Perception checks to find and follow tracks. At 5th level, the questioner gains the eidetic recollection investigator talent as a bonus talent, ignoring its prerequisites.\nThis ability replaces poison lore.\nRestricted Talents: A questioner selects investigator talents as normal, except he cannot select the alchemist discovery investigator talent.\nThis ability alters investigator talents."
