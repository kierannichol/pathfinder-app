    "text": "At 4th level, a turfer gains the benefits of endure elements and a +10-foot enhancement bonus to her base speed, but only in her favored terrains. In addition, she can move through difficult terrain in her favored terrains at her normal speed without taking damage or suffering any other impairment, but she can\u0027t do so through difficult terrain that has been magically manipulated. At 10th and 16th levels, her enhancement bonus to her base speed increases by 10 feet within her favored terrains. The turfer loses this ability if she wears medium or heavy armor or carries a medium or heavy load."
