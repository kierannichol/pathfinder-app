    "text": "At 3rd level, a huntmaster\u0027s dog can make a free trip or dirty trick (entangled) combat maneuver after a successful melee attack. A huntmaster\u0027s bird can make a free dirty trick (dazzled or deafened) combat maneuver after a successful melee attack; if the target is already dazzled, the bird can choose dirty trick (blinded) instead. These combat maneuvers do not provoke attacks of opportunity."
