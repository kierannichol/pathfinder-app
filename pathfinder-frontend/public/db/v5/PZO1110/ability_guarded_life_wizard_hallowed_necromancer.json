    "text": "At 15th level, when a hallowed necrocer fails a saving throw against a death effect, energy drain, a necromantic effect, or a negative energy effect, she can expend 2 uses of positive touch as an immediate action to reroll it. She must accept the result of the reroll even if it\u0027s worse. If she would take hit point damage from such an effect, as an immediate action she can instead expend 1 use of positive touch and sacrifice a prepared necromancy spell of 4th level or higher to reduce the damage she takes by an amount equal to her wizard level + 10 times the spell level."
