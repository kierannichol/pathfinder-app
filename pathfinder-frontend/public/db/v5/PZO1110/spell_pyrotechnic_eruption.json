    "text": "The caster causes jets of flame to erupt from the ground and surround the target. The target takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) unless it succeeds at a Reflex save for half damage. The blaze surrounds the target for the duration of the spell, forcing the creature to attempt a new save each round. Each round, the damage dealt is reduced to half as many d6; the spell expires when it would deal no damage. If the target moves, the pyrotechnic eruption follows, even if the target teleports."
