    "text": "The soul sentinel suppresses the stain of corruption on the spirits of those she heals. At 12th level, whenever she uses her lay on hands ability to heal a living creature (other than herself ) or damage an undead creature, in place of applying one of her other mercies, she can suppress the stain from a corrupted creature\u0027s most recent manifestation for 1 minute. Any gift from that manifestation is unaffected and remains available, unless the manifestation has a special note requiring the gift and stain be taken together, in which case greater reprieve also suppresses the gift."
