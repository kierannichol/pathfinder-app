öAt 2nd level, whenever he casts a spell from the divination school, a fortune-teller can use a fortune-teller's deck, crystal ball, or similar item instead of the spell's material component, as long as the cost of the material component is no more than 100 gp per bard level. If he chooses to cast the spell using such an item and the spell's normal material component (regardless of that component's cost), he casts the spell at +1 caster level. This special focus can't be used with other special foci that have a similar effect, but can be used with spells that normally require a focus component (which must also be provided).ª9
