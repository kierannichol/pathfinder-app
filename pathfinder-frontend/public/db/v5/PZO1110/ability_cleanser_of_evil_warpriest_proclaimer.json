    "text": "At 2nd level, a proclaimer can hold his weapon aloft and shout his deity\u0027s name as a swift action, spending one use of fervor to deal 1d6 points of damage to all evil outsiders within 5 feet. At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage increases by an additional 1d6. This damage has the same alignment as the proclaimer\u0027s deity. At 7th level, the effect expands to include an area within 10 feet of the proclaimer, and it expands by 5 feet every 6 levels thereafter. A proclaimer can\u0027t use fervor to damage undead or to heal."
