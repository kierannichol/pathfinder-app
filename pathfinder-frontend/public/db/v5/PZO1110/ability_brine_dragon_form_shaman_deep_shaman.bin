»When a deep shaman gains access to the true version of the waves spirit, she can assume the form of a Large (or smaller) brine dragon as per form of the dragon II, with a line of acid breath weapon, acid resistance 20, and a swim speed of 60 feet. She can use this ability for 1 hour per shaman level each day, divided any way she chooses in 1 hour increments, though the spell's breath weapon limit applies across the whole day. Time she spends underwater doesn't count against this limit, but every minute (or fraction thereof ) that she spends flying expends 1 hour of her daily uses. At 18th level, she can assume the form of a Huge or smaller brine dragon as per form of the dragon III instead.ª3
