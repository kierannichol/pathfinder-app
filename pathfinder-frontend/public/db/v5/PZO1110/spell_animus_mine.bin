spell:animus_mineAnimus Minespellabjuration_mind_affecting¢Ý
ÚYou implant a mental mine within your psyche that triggers against anyone attempting to manipulate your thoughts. Any creature that uses a mind-affecting effect against you triggers the mine, causing psychic backlash against the offending creature. This backlash deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) and staggers the target for 1d4 rounds. If the target succeeds at a Will saving throw, it takes only half damage and negates the staggered effect. The mine does not disrupt the mind-affecting effect that triggered the spell. You can use a swift action to suppress the trigger of your mine for 1 round to allow someone to use a mind-affecting effect on you. You can have only one mental mine active at a time.
