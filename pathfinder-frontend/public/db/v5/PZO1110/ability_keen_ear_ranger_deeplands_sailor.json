    "text": "At 3rd level, a Deeplands sailor learns how to use sound to compensate for poor visibility when facing threats above and below the water. He gains the uncanny dodge rogue ability when underground and either swimming or aboard a boat.\nAt 8th level, he gains improved uncanny dodge under these conditions, treating his Deeplands sailor level as his effective rogue level for the purpose of denying an enemy\u0027s sneak attacks.\nAt 13th level, he gains blindsense with a range of 30 feet against creatures touching water.\nAt 18th level, his blindsense range increases to 60 feet or equal to the range of his darkvision, whichever is greater. If the Deeplands sailor becomes deafened, he loses all benefits of this ability until his hearing is restored."
