ÍYou repeat a mantra or phrase that reminds you of your duty. You can immediately reroll a failed saving throw against a spell that would force you to take an action against your will, and you gain a +2 bonus against enchantment effects for 1 round. You can use this spell to reroll only a saving throw that you failed within the past round. While subject to this spell, the target cannot be the target of another spell that has the word â€œlitany" in the title.
