    "text": "At 6th level, the divine champion becomes an expert at combating enemies of his faith. He must choose a deity whose alignment is opposed to his own deity\u0027s alignment in at least one way (good versus evil or law versus chaos); preferably, he should choose a deity whose alignment diametrically opposes that of his own deity.\nIf the divine champion worships a deity whose alignment is neutral, he must instead select a deity whose alignment is chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, or lawful good. The choice of this enemy deity is subject to GM approval. At the GM\u0027s discretion, the divine champion may be allowed to choose a philosophy or religious organization that\u0027s not affiliated with a deity, but only if that philosophy or religious organization is an enemy of the divine champion\u0027s deity.\nThe divine champion gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Intimidate, Knowledge, Perception, and Sense Motive checks against followers of the enemy faith, as well as a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls made against them. Additionally, he can attempt Knowledge skill checks relating to the deity and its church untrained, even if the DC is higher than 10.\nEvery 6 paladin levels thereafter (12th and 18th level), the divine champion can select an additional deity to oppose. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against the followers of any one deity he selected previously (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2."
