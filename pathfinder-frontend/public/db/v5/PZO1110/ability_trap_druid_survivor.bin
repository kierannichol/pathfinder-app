µAt 4th level, a survivor learns how to create a snare trap and one other ranger trap of her choice. At 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter, she learns another trap. The survivor can use these traps a total number of times per day equal to 1/2 her druid level + her Wisdom modifier. Once a trap is learned, it can't be unlearned and replaced with a different type of trap. The survivor cannot select an individual trap more than once.ª"
