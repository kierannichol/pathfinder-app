    "text": "You transform the decor of a courtyard, structure, or other edifice to meet your highest standards and personal tastes. Objects and architectural elements remain in the same configuration--a chair remains a chair--but can look, sound, and smell like a different physical material and artistic style. You cannot change the appearance of natural terrain, but landscaped areas such as a garden or orchard can be affected. This spell functions in all other ways as hallucinatory terrain."
