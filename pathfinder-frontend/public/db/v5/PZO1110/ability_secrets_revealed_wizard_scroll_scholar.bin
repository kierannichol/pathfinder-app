›At 5th level, a scroll scholar gains the ability to cast comprehend languages and identify as spell-like abilities. Her caster level is equal to her character level in whatever class she took the scroll scholar archetype for. She can cast these spells once per day each at 5th level, twice per day each at 7th level, and three times per day each at 9th level. At 11th level, one of these spell-like abilities (scholar's choice) becomes a constant spell-like ability, and at 13th level, the second one becomes a constant spell-like ability.ª5
