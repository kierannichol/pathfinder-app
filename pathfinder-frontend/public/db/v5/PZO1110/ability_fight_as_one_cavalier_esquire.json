    "text": "At 20th level, the shared challenge ability increases in power, granting the aide-de-camp full benefit of the esquire\u0027s challenge. In addition, if the esquire and aide-de-camp both confirm a critical hit against the same target within the same round, the target must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 +1/2 the esquire\u0027s cavalier level + the esquire\u0027s Charisma bonus) or be staggered for 1d4 rounds."
