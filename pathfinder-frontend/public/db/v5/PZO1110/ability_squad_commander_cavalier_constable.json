    "text": "At 3rd level, a constable can spend 1 minute laying out a plan to activate the tactician ability without having it count against his number of uses per day. The ability must be triggered within 1 hour of the plan being made, and the benefits last for 1 minute per cavalier level he has. The constable can have only one plan at a time, and if a new plan is made, any old plan is lost."
