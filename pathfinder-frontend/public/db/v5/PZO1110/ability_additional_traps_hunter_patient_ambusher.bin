ªAt 3rd level and every 3 hunter levels thereafter, a patient ambusher can learn a new type of trap, selected from the list of ranger traps. Once a trap is learned, it can't be unlearned and replaced with a different type of trap. The patient ambusher cannot learn an individual trap more than once.ª7
