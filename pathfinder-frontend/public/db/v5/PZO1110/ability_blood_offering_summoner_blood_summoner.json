    "text": "At 4th level, the blood summoner can sacrifice a flask of blood, extracted up to 1 day ago from a living creature or a corpse that\u0027s been dead no longer than 1 minute, to aid and appease an evil outsider within 30 feet as a standard action. This blood can be extracted from a willing or helpless creature as a full-round action that deals 1 point of Constitution damage. The offering grants the outsider a +2 enhancement bonus to the ability score of the blood summoner\u0027s choice and grants the blood summoner a +4 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks and Charisma checks to bargain with it. The bonuses last for 10 minutes. The offering cannot be made to the same fiend twice in the same day."
