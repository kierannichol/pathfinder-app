¤At 4th level, a troll fury can select one creature type from the ranger's favored enemy list and gains a favored enemy bonus against that creature type with an effective ranger level equal to her druid level. This ability never grants the troll fury favored enemy bonuses against a second favored enemy creature type. A troll fury can change her favored enemy type once per week by performing a ritual that takes 1 hour to perform. If a troll fury already has a favored enemy from another class, the levels from the classes that grant favored enemies stack with this one to determine the favored enemy bonuses, and in this case she can gain other favored enemy creature types.ª1
