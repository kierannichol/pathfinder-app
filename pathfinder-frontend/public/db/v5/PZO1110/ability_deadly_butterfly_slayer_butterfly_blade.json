    "text": "At 19th level, a butterfly blade becomes a bloody whirlwind in combat. When he strikes a foe with a butterfly sword, he automatically confirms critical threats. In addition, any butterfly sword he wields is treated as if it has the speed weapon special ability. If the weapon already has the speed weapon special ability, this doesn\u0027t stack."
