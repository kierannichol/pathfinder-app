    "text": "At 1st level, a dragonblood chymist discovers how to create a mutagen that he can imbibe in order to mimic the might of a dragon. While he maintains his original form, his features take on a draconic appearance, becoming scaly and lizard-like. He gains a +2 natural armor bonus and a +2 alchemical bonus to his Strength for 10 minutes per class level.\nAt 2nd level, the dragonblood chymist has learned to concentrate the potency of his dragonblood mutagen such that it grants him two claw attacks and a bite attack. If these are the only attacks the dragonblood chymist makes in a round, they are primary attacks and are made using his full base attack bonus. Otherwise, these natural attacks are treated as secondary attacks. The claw attacks deal 1d4 points of damage (1d3 if he is Small) and the bite attack deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if he is Small). While the mutagen is in effect, he gains a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate checks. At 12th level, the dragonblood mutagen grants a +4 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to his Strength. At 16th level, the dragonblood mutagen grants a +6 natural armor bonus and a +6 alchemical bonus to his Strength. This ability otherwise functions as mutagen."
