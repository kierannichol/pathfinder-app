This functions like the witch class ability of the same name, except the pact wizard automatically adds his patron\u0027s spells to his spellbook instead of to his familiar.\nIn addition, the pact wizard can expend any prepared spell that isn\u0027t a spell prepared using the additional spell slot the wizard receives from his arcane school in order to spontaneously cast one of his patron\u0027s spells of the same level or lower."
