‰A sentinel can spend 1 minute studying the appearance of a target or a likeness of the target in the form of a picture, carving, or visual illusion and memorize it with perfect recall. From that point on, the sentinel gains a +4 bonus on Perception checks to notice the target in disguise or pick him out of a crowd. The sentinel is automatically allowed a Perception check against the target's Disguise check whenever she sees the target, even if the individual isn't doing anything to draw attention to himself.
A sentinel can memorize the appearance of a number of targets equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) at any given time. Once a sentinel has reached her maximum number of memorized appearances, she must forget one of the memorized faces before gaining a new one.ª&
