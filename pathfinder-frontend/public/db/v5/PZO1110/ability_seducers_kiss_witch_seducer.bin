¯At 6th level, a seducer can kiss another creature as a melee touch attack. The target must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + half the seducer's level + her Charisma modifier) or be staggered for 1 round. If the target is (or could be) sexually attracted to the seducer, the save DC is increased by 2. If the seducer and the target have had willing sexual relations in the past 24 hours, the save DC is instead increased by 4. Whether or not the creature succeeds at this save, it cannot be the target of this ability again for 1 day. At 10th level, this ability causes the target to become stunned for 1 round, then staggered for an additional round. This is a mind-affecting charm effect.ª*
