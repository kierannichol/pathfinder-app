    "text": "At 11th level, a tortured crusader can spend an additional use of smite evil when declaring a smite to make it a last stand. The duration of last stand\u0027s benefits is only 1 minute (rather than 24 hours). However, the bonus damage from smite evil is doubled on every attack (this doesn\u0027t stack with the doubling if the smite\u0027s target is an evil outsider, undead, or evil dragon)."
