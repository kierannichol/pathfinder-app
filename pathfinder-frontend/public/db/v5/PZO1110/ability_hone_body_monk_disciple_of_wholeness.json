    "text": "At 5th level, a disciple of wholeness has immunity to supernatural and magical diseases as long as she is undamaged (she loses this immunity when she has hit point or ability score damage). In addition, she can always touch a creature as a swift action and spend 1 point from her ki pool to render it immune to all diseases for 1 day. She cannot grant this immunity if the target is already afflicted with a disease."
