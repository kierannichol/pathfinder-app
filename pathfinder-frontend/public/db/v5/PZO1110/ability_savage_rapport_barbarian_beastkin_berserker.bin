¾At 1st level, a beastkin berserker gains a spiritual connection to a specific kind of creature with the animal type (such as a badger or a triceratops). She adds half her level (minimum 1) on Handle Animal, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks involving the chosen type of animal.
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th levels), the beastkin berserker can select an additional kind of animal to which these bonuses apply.ª:
