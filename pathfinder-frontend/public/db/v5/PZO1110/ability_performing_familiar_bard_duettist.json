    "text": "At 4th level, a duettist\u0027s familiar learns how to create supernatural effects with its performances, just like its master. The familiar can use any of its master\u0027s bardic performances, but only the familiar or the duettist can have a performance active at any given time, not both. If one is performing and the other starts a performance, the previous performance immediately ends. Each round that the familiar performs consumes 2 rounds of the duettist\u0027s bardic performance."
