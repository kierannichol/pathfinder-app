ªAt 7th level, when the dragon drinker drinks true dragon's blood from a dragon with a breath weapon that deals a different type of energy damage than her chosen energy type, she may adopt the energy resistance of the blood's source dragon as if it were her selected bloodline. This effect lasts for 1 minute per dose of dragon's blood, after which the dragon drinker's energy resistance reverts back to her normal energy type.ª:
