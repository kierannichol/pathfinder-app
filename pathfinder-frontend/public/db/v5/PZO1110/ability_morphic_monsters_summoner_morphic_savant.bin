Ü	Since a morphic savant's power is drawn from planar energies aligned with chaos, all the creatures he summons must be of a chaotic alignment.
If a creature would normally be celestial or fiendish, it is instead an entropic creature.
This also causes the morphic savant's summoning power to be less reliable than a standard summonerâ€˜s.
Each time he uses his summon monster spell-like ability to summon multiple creatures, there is a 50% chance he summons one more monster than normal for the summon monster spell he uses, in which case the creatures remain for only 1 round per level (instead of 1 minute per level).
Also, starting at 2nd level, the morphic savant can grant one 1-point evolution to all the creatures he summons with his summon monster spell-like ability. He can't grant an evolution that duplicates the function of, or has the same name as, any ability the summoned creatures already possess (for example, he can't grant a creature with a bite attack another bite attack), nor can he add an evolution that causes the summoned monsters to have more attacks than his eidolonâ€˜s maximum number of attacks. The creatures do not have to be of the correct subtype to gain an evolution, but do have to meet any other prerequisites.ª7
