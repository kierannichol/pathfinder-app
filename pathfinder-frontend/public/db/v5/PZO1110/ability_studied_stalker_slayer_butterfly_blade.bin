’A butterfly blade gains the stalker class feature at 1st level, rather than at 7th level. The butterfly blade doesn't add his studied target bonus on Knowledge or Survival checks.
This ability alters studied target and replaces track.
Bonus Feats: Whenever a butterfly blade would gain a slayer talent, he can instead select a feat from the following list: Cutting Humiliation, Enforcer, Intimidating Prowess, Nerve-Racking Negotiator, or Threatening Negotiator. The butterfly blade does not need to meet the feat's prerequisites.ª5
