    "text": "When a toxin codexer prepares his extracts, he can use his slots to prepare short-lived poisons instead of extracts. The following poisons can be prepared into extract slots: 1st--arsenic, giant wasp poison, medium spider venom; 2nd--black adder venom, id moss, striped toadstool; 3rd-- blue whinnis, lich dust, sassone leaf residue; 4th--dark reaver powder, purple worm poison, third eye; 5th--deathblade, hemlock, witch-hunter\u0027s sword; 6th--black lotus extract, dragon bile, king\u0027s sleep.\nAdditional poison selections can be added to this list with GM approval.\nThe Fortitude save DC of these poisons is 10 + the toxin codexer\u0027s Intelligence modifier + the extract level of the poison. Poisons created in this way are unstable and become inert after 1 day if not used. Once the poison is administered to a target, the duration is as normal for that poison\u0027s type, even if longer than 1 day. These poisons can be applied to weapons (if applicable) only by the toxin codexer, unless he has the infusion alchemist discovery."
