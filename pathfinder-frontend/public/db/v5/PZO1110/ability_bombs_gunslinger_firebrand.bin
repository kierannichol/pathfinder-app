ÀAt 5th level, the firebrand gains the bombs ability as an alchemist of her gunslinger level â€“ 4, using her Charisma modifier in place of her Intelligence modifier to determine her number of bombs per day and the DC to avoid splash damage. The firebrand adds her Charisma modifier to her bombs' damage instead of her Intelligence modifier, even if she has the throw anything class feature. In addition, the firebrand's bombs are always under the effect of the explosive bombs discovery. Firebrand levels do not stack with levels in other classes with the bombs class feature.ª)
