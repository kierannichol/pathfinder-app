®An arsenal chaplain must choose War as his blessing, and can do so even if it is a domain not normally granted by his deity. He does not receive a second blessing.
At 7th level, an arsenal chaplain gains Quicken Blessing (War) as a bonus feat even if he does not meet the prerequisites, but cannot grant a War blessing to himself as a swift action with Quicken Blessing until he is at least 10th level.
At 13th level, an arsenal chaplain can use the War blessing on an ally at a range of up to 30 feet by spending an additional use of the blessing ability.
At 16th level, an arsenal chaplain can use the War blessing on a second target with a single use of the blessing ability.
At 19th level, an arsenal chaplain can use the War blessing on any number of targets at once with a single use of the blessing ability.ª6
