„The venom siphoner chooses either her familiar's bite attack or its claw attacks; once chosen, this selection can't be changed. The chosen natural attack gains the following poison ability:
Siphoner Poison: Natural attack--injury; save Fort DC 10 + half the witch's level + the witch's Intelligence modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex; cure 1 save.
Familiars without an appropriate natural attack instead gain the ability to spit the poison as a ranged touch attack.
This spit attack deals no damage, but it exposes the struck creature to the poison, forcing it to attempt a saving throw to resist the poison as normal. If the familiar already has a poison, the witch can instead empower its poison. An empowered poison's frequency increases by 50%. If the witch ever replaces her familiar, she must choose how this ability applies to her new familiar as soon as she receives it.ª6
