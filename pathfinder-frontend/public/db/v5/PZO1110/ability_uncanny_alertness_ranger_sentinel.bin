åAt 4th level, a sentinel is always ready to defend against incoming attacks. A sentinel is never flatfooted before acting in combat, even if she is surprised (she can still become flatfooted by any other effect or situation that would render her flat-footed).
At 7th level, the sentinel also always acts on the surprise round. If she would have acted on the surprise round anyway, or if there is no surprise round, she gains a bonus on initiative checks equal to half her ranger level.ª0
