    "text": "At 15th level, a terra-cotta monk can turn an opponent to stone with a single strike. He can use this ability once per day, and must announce the attempt before making his attack roll. If the terra-cotta monk\u0027s strike is successful, the creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 the monk\u0027s level + the monk\u0027s Wis modifier) or be petrified for 1 hour per monk level. Incorporeal creatures and creatures immune to petrification are unaffected by this ability."
