®At 2nd level, a spiritslayer manifests an uncanny sixth sense regarding the presence of invisible creatures. He gains Blind-Fight as a bonus feat and ignores the usual +20 bonus to the DC of any Perception check to pinpoint the location of an invisible creature. If the spiritslayer manages to pinpoint an invisible creature's location using a Perception check, he can study that creature with his studied target ability as a swift action.
In addition, whenever the spiritslayer studies a possessed creature, he can automatically switch his studied target from the possessed creature to the possessing entity should that entity be expelled from his studied target. A spiritslayer adds his studied target bonus on attack rolls to all saving throws he attempts against possession effects used by his studied targets.ª/
