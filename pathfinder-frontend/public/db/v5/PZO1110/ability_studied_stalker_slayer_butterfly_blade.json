    "text": "A butterfly blade gains the stalker class feature at 1st level, rather than at 7th level. The butterfly blade doesn\u0027t add his studied target bonus on Knowledge or Survival checks.\nThis ability alters studied target and replaces track.\nBonus Feats: Whenever a butterfly blade would gain a slayer talent, he can instead select a feat from the following list: Cutting Humiliation, Enforcer, Intimidating Prowess, Nerve-Racking Negotiator, or Threatening Negotiator. The butterfly blade does not need to meet the feat\u0027s prerequisites."
