    "text": "At 3rd level, a sly saboteur can move through 5 feet of difficult terrain each round as if it were normal terrain. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, this distance increases by 5 feet (to a maximum of 30 feet at 18th level). This ability allows the sly saboteur to take a 5-foot step into difficult terrain. This ability applies only when she is wearing light armor or no armor and carrying no more than a light load, and it stacks with the Acrobatic Steps and Nimble Moves feats."
