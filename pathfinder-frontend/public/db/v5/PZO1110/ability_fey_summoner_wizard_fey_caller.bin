ÍA fey caller is able to conjure fey creatures. He gains Augment Summoning as a bonus feat. He adds the following creatures to the summon monster list of the same level, allowing him to summon them with the appropriate summon monster spell:
1st--grimple (gremlin), mite, sprite; 2nd--atomie, fuath (gremlin), nixie; 3rd-- leprechaun, nuglub (gremlin), pooka; 4th--kelpie, korred, twigjack; 5th--lampad, lurker in light, swan maiden; 6th--cold rider, oceanid, sangoi; 7th--alp, bogeyman, ijiraq; 8th--banelight, fastachee, rusalka; 9th--ankou, kamaitachi, wild hunt archer.
This ability is a function of the fey caller himself, and it applies even if he uses a scroll, wand, or other magic item to cast a summon monster spell. If he creates such an item and it is used by another character, the spell functions as an ordinary summon monster spell.ª-
