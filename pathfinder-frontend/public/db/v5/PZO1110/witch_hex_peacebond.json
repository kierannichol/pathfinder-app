      "Effect": "A witch can use this hex on a creature to prevent it from drawing a weapon for a number of rounds equal to the witch\u0027s level. This hex has no effect on natural weapons or weapons already in a creature\u0027s hands, but does prevent an archer from drawing arrows. A Will save negates this effect, and whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day."
