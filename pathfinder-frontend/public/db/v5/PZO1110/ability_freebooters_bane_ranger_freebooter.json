    "text": "At 1st level, the freebooter can, as a move action, indicate an enemy in combat and rally her allies to focus on that target. The freebooter and her allies gain a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against the target. This ability applies only to allies who can see or hear the freebooter and who are within 30 feet of the freebooter at the time she activates this ability. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the bonus increases by 1. The freebooter\u0027s bane lasts until the target dies or the freebooter selects a new target.\nFAQ Pirates of the Inner Sea, Freebooter: A freebooter ranger has quarry but not favored enemy. How does a freebooter use quarry? A freebooter\u0027s quarry must be the target of the freebooter\u0027s freebooter\u0027s bane ability, rather than a favored enemy. [Source]"
