    "text": "A stonesinger\u0027s bardic performance is a subsonic vibration that resonates from his body and travels through solid rock. This vibration is subtle enough to not be heard, though creatures with the tremorsense universal monster ability can distinctly hear the stone song out to a range of 100 feet per bard level. All allies within 30 feet of the stonesinger benefit from stone song, perceiving the effect due to proximity. An allied creature with tremorsense benefits from stone song as long as it\u0027s within the extended range, provided that there is an unobstructed path of solid earth between the creature and stonesinger. Natural and manufactured stone does not inhibit stone song\u0027s range. A stonesinger must use Perform (song) or Perform (oratory) for this bardic performance."
