    "text": "As a pact wizard grows in power, his choice of patron begins to affect his physical body.\nAt 5th level, the pact wizard chooses one oracle curse, using 1/2 his character level as his effective oracle level when determining the effects of this curse.\nIf an oracle curse would add spells to the oracle\u0027s list of spells known, the pact wizard instead add those spells to the wizard\u0027s spell list as well as to his spellbook.\nAt 10th level, the pact wizard can invoke his patron\u0027s power to roll twice and take the better result when attempting any caster level check, concentration check, initiative check, or saving throw. He can activate this ability as a free action before attempting the check, even if it isn\u0027t his turn. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 his Intelligence modifier. At 15th level, when the pact wizard invokes his patron\u0027s power to roll twice on a check, he adds his Intelligence bonus to the result as an insight bonus. When he applies metamagic feats to any spells he learned via his patron or curse, he treats that spell\u0027s final effective level as 1 lower (to a minimum level equal to the spell\u0027s original level).\nAt 20th level, whenever the pact wizard invokes his patron\u0027s power to roll twice on a check and his result is a natural 20, he automatically succeeds, regardless of whether or not a check of that type would normally allow an automatic success."
