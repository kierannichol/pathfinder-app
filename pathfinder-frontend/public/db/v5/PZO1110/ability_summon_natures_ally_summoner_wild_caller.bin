ÖA wild caller can cast summon nature's ally as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. At levels where a regular summoner would gain access to a new level of summon monster as a spell-like ability, the wild caller instead gains the equivalent summon nature's ally spell; at 19th level, he can use summon nature's ally IX or gate. When a wild caller gains a summon nature's ally spell as a spell-like ability, he adds it to his class spell list (though he must still select it as a spell known if he wants to gain the ability to cast it as a normal spell).ª7
