çA sapper is able to quickly breach obstacles. Using a combination of engineering, explosives, alchemical reagents, and sheer bloody-mindedness, she can deal up to 10 points of damage per sapper level upon an object once per day, ignoring the object's hardness. She might crack open a stone wall with an explosive charge, or collapse a ceiling by tunneling through its supports. This ability requires 1d4+1 hours of preparation, so it can be used only on immobile and unresisting objects.ª1
