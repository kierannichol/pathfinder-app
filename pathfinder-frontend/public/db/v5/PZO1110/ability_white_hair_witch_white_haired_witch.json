    "text": "At 1st level, a white-haired witch gains the ability to use her hair as a weapon. This functions as a primary natural attack with a reach of 5 feet. The hair deals 1d4 points of damage (1d3 for a Small witch) plus the witch\u0027s Intelligence modifier. In addition, whenever the hair strikes a foe, the witch can attempt to grapple that foe with her hair as a free action* without provoking an attack of opportunity, using her Intelligence modifier in place of her Strength modifier when making the combat maneuver check. When a white-haired witch grapples a foe in this way, she does not gain the grappled condition.\nAt 4th level and every four levels thereafter, a white-haired witch\u0027s hair adds 5 feet to its reach, to a maximum of 30 feet at 20th level.\nThe hair cannot be sundered or attacked as a separate creature.\nIn addition, a white-haired witch further improves her ability to control her hair as she progresses in level, gaining the following abilities:\nConstrict (Ex): At 2nd level, when the white-haired witch\u0027s hair successfully grapples an opponent, it can begin constricting her victim as a swift action*, dealing damage equal to that of its attack. Trip (Ex): At 4th level, a white-haired witch who successfully strikes a foe with her hair can attempt a combat maneuver check to trip the creature as a swift action*. Pull (Ex): At 6th level, a white-haired witch who successfully strikes a foe with her hair can attempt a combat maneuver check to pull the creature 5 feet closer to her as a swift action*. Strangle (Ex): At 8th level, when the white-haired witch\u0027s hair is grappling with an opponent, that creature is considered strangled, and cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components."
