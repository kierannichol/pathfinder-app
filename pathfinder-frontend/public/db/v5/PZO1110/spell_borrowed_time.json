    "text": "A creation of the archmage Nex, this spell allows you to reach ahead in time and draw alacrity from the future at the expense of your own health. For the duration of this spell, you gain an extra swift action you can use only during your turn. You can\u0027t use this swift action to take a second immediate action between turns, but you can use it to take a swift action the turn after you\u0027ve taken an immediate action. Each time you take an extra swift action in this fashion you take 1 point of Constitution damage. If you\u0027re immune to ability damage, you take 5 points of hit point damage instead. When the spell ends, you are staggered for 1d4+1 rounds from the temporal backlash."
