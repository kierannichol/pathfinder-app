    "text": "The temperature of the target creature\u0027s blood (or other similar body fluid) begins to rise over the next 3 rounds during the caster\u0027s turn. Each round starting with the first, the target creature attempts a new saving throw at the start of the caster\u0027s turn to resist that round\u0027s effect. A successful save does not end the spell effect, but does prevent that round\u0027s effect. On the round that this spell is cast, the target becomes fatigued. On the next round, as the blood temperature begins to rise, the target\u0027s capillaries burst, dealing 1d6 points of Constitution damage to the target. On the third and final round, the target\u0027s blood begins to boil; the spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 15d6), and--if the target is still alive--the target becomes exhausted rather than fatigued."
