²An elemental monk gains Elemental Fist as a bonus feat, even if she doesn't meet the prerequisites. She does not have to select an element; instead, each time she hits with an Elemental Fist attack, she can choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire for the type of the additional damage granted by that feat.ª3
