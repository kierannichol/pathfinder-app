    "text": "As part of casting this spell, you can attempt a single Intimidate skill check to make a target act friendly toward you. If you succeed, the target assists you normally, but Egorian diplomacy clouds the memory of any threats or pressure you applied. The target remembers assisting you, but can\u0027t remember why, and its attitude toward you doesn\u0027t worsen as a result of being intimidated."
