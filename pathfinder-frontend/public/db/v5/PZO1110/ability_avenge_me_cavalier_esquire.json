    "text": "At 11th level, whenever the esquire is killed, dying, stunned, dazed, or otherwise unable to take actions, his aide-de-camp gains the full benefits of the esquire\u0027s challenge and order abilities against all creatures that attacked the esquire in the previous round. If the aidede- camp is also a cavalier and challenges the same target, these bonuses do not stack. These benefits last until the esquire regains the ability to take actions, or until the aide-de-camp or the triggering opponents are killed.\nIf his aide-de-camp is killed, dying, or otherwise unable to take actions the esquire may declare one creature of his choice that attacked the aide-de-camp in the past round as his quarry; this functions identically to the ranger class ability. These bonuses last until the aide-de-camp recovers or until the cavalier or the triggering opponents are killed."
