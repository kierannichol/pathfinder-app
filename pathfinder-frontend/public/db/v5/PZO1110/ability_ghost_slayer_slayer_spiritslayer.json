    "text": "At 7th level, whenever a spiritslayer makes an outsider or undead creature with the incorporeal subtype his studied target, his attacks count as magic for the purpose of striking that creature (though this doesn\u0027t give his attacks an enhancement bonus) and he can deal precision-based damage to such creatures (though his precision damage is reduced by 50% unless he has a means to bypass the creature\u0027s reduction in damage from corporeal sources, such as a ghost touch weapon). At 14th level, the spiritslayer\u0027s attacks against outsiders or undead creatures with the incorporeal subtype ignore the 50% reduction in damage from magical corporeal sources that such creatures have and can deal precision-based damage to incorporeal creatures."
