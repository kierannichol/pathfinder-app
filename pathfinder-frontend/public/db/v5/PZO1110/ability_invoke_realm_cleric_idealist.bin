‚When an idealist channels energy, she channels raw essence rather than positive or negative energy, superimposing a portion of her deity's planar realm over her location. This effect extends out to a radius of 10 feet, plus 5 feet for every 2 cleric levels she has beyond 1st, to a maximum radius of 55 feet at 19th level. This effect lasts for 1 round plus 1 round per point of the idealist's Charisma bonus. While this effect is active, the idealist gains a +1 bonus on Diplomacy checks against creatures who worship her deity and a +1 bonus on Intimidate checks against creatures who do not. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.
This channeled energy imposes itself over the current terrain, changing its visual appearance to more thematically suit the energy's associated planar realm, but cannot hide obvious hazards or otherwise allow for a creature to hide any more effectively than the normal terrain would. This is an illusion (glamer) effect with a caster level equal to the idealist's level.
Within the radius of the idealist's channeling, all alignment and magic planar traits are suppressed and replaced with the traits of the plane that matches the idealist's planar bond. This includes alignment, gravity, and magic traits. In the case of the Astral Plane, since the time trait remains unaltered, your spellcasting only feels fast--you gain a +4 bonus on all concentration checks rather than the ability to apply Quickened Spell effects.
This ability is considered channel energy for purposes of feats that grant additional uses of channel energy or allow the cleric to exclude creatures from channel energy's effects.ª+
