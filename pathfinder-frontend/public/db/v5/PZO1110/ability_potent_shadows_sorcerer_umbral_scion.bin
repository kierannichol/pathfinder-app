óAt 7th level, when an umbral scion casts a spell of the shadow subschool or a spell with the darkness or shadow descriptor within an area of dim light or darkness, she treats her caster level as 1 higher. Only the sorcerer herself needs to be in dim light or darkness. This bonus increases by 1 every 4 sorcerer levels beyond 7th she has to a maximum of +4 at 19th level.ª3
