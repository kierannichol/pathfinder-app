ìAt 1st level, a circuit judge chooses a single community. While in that community or within 25 miles of it, she adds half her cavalier level (minimum 1) on Intimidate, Knowledge (local), and Sense Motive skill checks (as well as any other law-related skill checks, at the GM's discretion). Whenever she advances in level, the range within which she gains this bonus expands by another 25 miles--50 miles at 2nd level, 75 miles at 3rd level, and so forth. This bonus on Intimidate checks increases by 2 when she enters a community within this area that she hasn't visited for 1 week or more.
At 9th level and 17th level, the circuit judge can select another community within the range in which she gains this ability's bonus. She can measure from that community (as well as previous communities) to determine whether she gains this ability's bonus on the relevant skill checks.ª-
