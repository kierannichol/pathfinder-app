Stone Gripclass:monk#terra_cotta_monkarchetype_featureclass_feature¢¦
£At 5th level, a terra-cotta monk adds a bonus equal to his class level on all Climb checks. He can move at his full movement rate while climbing with no increase to the check's DC. By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, a monk gains the benefits of spider climb for 1 round.ª/
