    "text": "At 9th level, a tempest druid can redirect nearby electrical attacks. As an immediate action, the druid can shift the area or target of an electricity attack by 5 feet in any direction. If the electricity affects an area, the druid selects one square to be unaffected and an adjacent square to be affected (if this square is already in the area, this has no additional effect in that area). If the electricity affects a target, the druid selects an adjacent target. She cannot redirect electricity damage conducted to her by physical contact with an object or creature (such as a shocking grasp or a shock weapon). She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma bonus. For example, if she were in the line of a wizard\u0027s lightning bolt, she could have the spell skip her square and instead affect an adjacent square, even if this meant the spell did not form a continuous line. If another druid attacked her with call lighting, she could shift the targeted bolt to an adjacent square, hitting a creature in that square (if any)."
