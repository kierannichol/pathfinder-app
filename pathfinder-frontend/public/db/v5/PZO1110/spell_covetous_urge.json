    "text": "You curse the target with insatiable greed, causing it to attempt to steal any item worth 100 gp or more that it can see, each time it enters a new room or area. If it can see multiple items of value in a single room or area, it attempts to steal the item it thinks is worth the most. This covetous compulsion might cause the target to act recklessly where it normally would not (unless acting in this manner would clearly cause it to die, suffer great harm, or get caught)."
