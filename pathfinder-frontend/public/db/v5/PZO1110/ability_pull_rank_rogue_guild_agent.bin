åAt 8th level, a guild agent has attained sufficient rank to call in lesser guild members to assist him with a job. He can call lesser members of a number and level equal to the number of followers he would have if he had the Leadership feat (including the +2 bonus for his guildhouse), to a maximum of a number of lesser members equal to his rogue level. If the guild agent possesses the Leadership feat, he gains twice as many followers as normal. If he spends a favor, he can combine this with the command team organizational influence benefit to gain even more lesser members for a particularly difficult job. Each time the guild agent uses the lesser members recklessly and gets them killed, he loses at least 1 influence with his guild.ª*
