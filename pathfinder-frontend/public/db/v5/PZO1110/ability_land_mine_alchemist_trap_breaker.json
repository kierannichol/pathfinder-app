    "text": "At 6th level, a trap breaker can turn his bombs into land mines. Setting a land mine is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The land mine fills a single 5-foot square, and can\u0027t be placed in the same space as another trap, land mine, or magic trap. The trap breaker can arm the land mine with any bomb he is eligible to use, and the effects of this bomb are immediately transferred to the land mine. Creating a land mine uses up two of the alchemist\u0027s bombs per day. The DCs for Perception checks to notice the land mine, Disable Device checks to disable it, and saving throws to avoid its effects are equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist\u0027s level + his Intelligence modifier. All alchemist land mines are mechanical traps with the qualities Trigger: location and Reset: none. Land mines last for 1 day per alchemist level or until they are triggered, whichever comes first."
