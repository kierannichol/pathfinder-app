    "text": "At 4th level, a charger\u0027s constant training increases his land speed by 10 feet. A charger can also move through up to 10 feet of difficult terrain each round as if it were normal terrain. These benefits apply only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the charger\u0027s speed because of any load carried or armor worn. These bonuses stack with any other bonuses to the charger\u0027s land speed or ability to ignore difficult terrain."
