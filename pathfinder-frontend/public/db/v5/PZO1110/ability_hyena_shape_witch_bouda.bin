»At 10th level, a bouda gains the ability to turn into a hyena or dire hyena and back again a number of times per day equal to her Intelligence modifier. This ability functions as beast shape II, except for the following. The effect lasts for 1 hour per witch level, or until the bouda changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At 20th level, a bouda can change her form at will. If a bouda dies while in hyena shape, she does not revert back to her true form.
The bouda does not lose the ability to speak while in animal form, and can communicate with hyenas and dire hyenas as if under the effects of speak with animals. Furthermore, while in this form, the bouda gains the benefit of the Natural Spell feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.ª&
