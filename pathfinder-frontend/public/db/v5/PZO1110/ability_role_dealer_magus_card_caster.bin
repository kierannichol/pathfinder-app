ôBeginning at 3rd level, whenever the card caster randomly draws and throws a harrow card matching one axis of his alignment, the card's critical threat range increases to 19â€“20. If the card caster draws and throws a harrow card matching his alignment exactly, the attack's critical multiplier also increases to x3 and the magus gains a +4 bonus on his confirmation roll.ª,
