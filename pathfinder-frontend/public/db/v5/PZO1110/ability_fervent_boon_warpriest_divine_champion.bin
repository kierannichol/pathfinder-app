ûBeginning at 9th level, a divine champion can call upon his deity for minor boons. By expending one or more uses of his fervor ability, he can cast one of the spell-like abilities included in his deity's first sentinel boon. By expending one use of fervor, he can cast the spell-like ability that the boon normally grants three uses of per day; by expending two uses of fervor he can cast the spell-like ability that the boon normally grants twice per day; and by expending three uses of fervor, he can cast the spell-like ability that the boon normally grants once per day. These uses don't count against any uses granted by the boon.ª5
