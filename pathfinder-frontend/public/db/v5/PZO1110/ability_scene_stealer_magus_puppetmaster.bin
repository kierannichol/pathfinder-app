‘At 20th level, if a puppetmaster successfully disbelieves an illusion, he can expend 1 point from his arcane pool to try to negate or steal control of the illusion. The puppetmaster attempts a caster level check as if he were dispelling the effect with dispel magic. If he succeeds, he can either end the effect or alter it as if he were the spell's caster. If the spell's duration is concentration, the puppetmaster must concentrate on the new effect (or transfer it to an enchanted target using the show must go on) or it ends.ª/
