    "text": "At 13th level, a cult hunter can grant himself the ability to use dispel chaos, dispel evil, dispel good, or dispel law as a spell-like ability (using his investigator level as his caster level and his Intelligence to determine the DCs) by sacrificing an unused 5th- or 6th-level extract for the day. He is able to use this ability as many times as he likes, but only so long as he continues to have unused 5thor 6th-level extract slots to expend."
