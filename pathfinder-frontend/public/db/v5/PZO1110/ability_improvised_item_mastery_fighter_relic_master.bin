¡At 19th level as a full-round action, the relic master can select one item mastery feat whose prerequisites she meets but that she doesn't already have. She gains access to this feat, though she can't use it as a prerequisite for other feats or options. If she selects a different item mastery feat, she loses access to her previous use of improvised item mastery and any magic effect created with it ends immediately. Any daily uses of a selected improvised item mastery feat count against all improvised mastery feats selected in the same day.ª;
