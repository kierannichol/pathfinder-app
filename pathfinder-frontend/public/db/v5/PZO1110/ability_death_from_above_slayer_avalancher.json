    "text": "At 20th level, an avalancher can take down his foe with a single attack. During a round, if he falls at least 10 feet (the action type depends on how he comes to be falling), he can make a single attack at his full base attack bonus as a standard action, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude save or suffer the additional effect. The save DC is equal to 20 + 1 for every 10 feet the avalancher fell before making the attack (to a maximum of DC 30 for a fall of 100 feet or more). Whether or not the target succeeds, it can\u0027t be targeted by this ability again (by any avalancher) for 24 hours."
