    "text": "At 19th level, a magic warrior learns ancient secrets to using natural magic. She learns seven spells from the druid\u0027s spell list and places them in her spellbook as magus spells of her druid level. She gains one of each of the following druid spells not on the magus spell list: 0-level, 1st-level, 2nd-level, 3rd-level, 4th-level, 5th-level, and 6th-level. She can ignore the divine focus component of these spells.\nThis ability replaces greater spell access."
