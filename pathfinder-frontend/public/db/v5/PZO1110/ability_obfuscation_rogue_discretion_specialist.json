    "text": "A discretion specialist is highly skilled at convincing others not to trust their own senses. At 3rd level as a full-round action, the discretion specialist can convince one living creature within 30 feet that up to 5 minutes of its memories from the past hour are unreliable. If the target fails a Will saving throw (DC \u003d 10 + half the discretion specialist\u0027s rogue level + her Intelligence modifier), the target is convinced that those memories didn\u0027t happen or that it\u0027s confusing the memories with a dream (or is otherwise hazy as to the memories\u0027 reality).\nEach hour after the discretion specialist uses this ability, the target can attempt a new Will saving throw to realize that its relevant memories have been tampered with, although not necessarily that the discretion specialist was the originator of the tampering.\nThe discretion specialist can use this ability once per day, and one additional time per day for every 5 rogue levels she has. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the discretion specialist can obfuscate memories from an additional hour in the past (to a maximum of 6 hours at 18th level)."
