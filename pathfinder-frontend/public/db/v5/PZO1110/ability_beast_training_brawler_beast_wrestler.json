    "text": "At 3rd level, a beast-wrestler selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. The only humanoid subtype the beast-wrestler can select is giant. She gains a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to her CMD against creatures of the type she selected.\nAt 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, the beast-wrestler can select an additional type of creature. In addition, at each such interval the bonuses against any one type of creature she\u0027s chosen (including the one just selected, if so desired) increase by 2. If a specific creature falls into more than one category, the beast-wrestler\u0027s bonuses don\u0027t stack; she simply uses whichever bonus is higher."
