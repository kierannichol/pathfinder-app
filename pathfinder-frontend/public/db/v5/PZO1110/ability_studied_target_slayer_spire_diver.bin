ˆA spire diver does not gain the ability to add her studied target bonus on Bluff and Survival checks against an opponent she has studied.
At 7th level, she cannot add her studied target bonus on Disguise checks. Instead, when using any bow or crossbow against her studied target underwater, the spire diver ignores the normal penalty for shooting underwater and instead treats the weapon as though its range increment were 10 feet. At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the range increment increases by 10 feet, to a maximum of 50 feet.
When using a bow or crossbow that already has an underwater range increment, such as an underwater crossbow (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 39â€“40), the spire diver adds the range increment gained from studied target as a bonus to the weapon's usual underwater range increment, though the combined range increment cannot exceed the weapon's normal range increment.ª0
