    "text": "A deep marshal learns numerous arcane secrets involving the shaping and warding of earth and stone. She adds the following sorcerer/wizard spells to her magus spell list as magus spells of the same level: crafter\u0027s curse, crafter\u0027s fortune, erase, expeditious excavation, fabricate, greater make whole, knock, major creation, make whole, mending, minor creation, move earth, passwall, stone shape, transmute mud to rock, transmute rock to mud, and all 0- through 6th-level sorcerer/wizard spells of the abjuration school. She must still add such spells to her spellbook to prepare them. If a spell appears on both the magus and sorcerer/wizard spell lists, the magus uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. A deep marshal cannot cast spells from the enchantment, illusion, or necromancy school and she cannot activate spell-completion or spell-trigger magic items that use spells from those schools (without making a successful Use Magic Device check)."
