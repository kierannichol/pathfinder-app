    "text": "The target experiences feelings of ennui and lethargy, becoming fatigued for the spell\u0027s duration. While the target is fatigued and is within the spell\u0027s range, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity. On a successful save, the target is fatigued for only 1d4 rounds and you receive no bonus. This spell has no effect if it targets a creature that is already fatigued."
