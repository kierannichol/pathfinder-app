    "text": "At 7th level, an iron-ring striker learns to use magic to grant himself the power of a larger creature. As a standard action, he can expend one non-cantrip prepared magus spell to treat his size as if it were larger for the purposes of determining the size modifier to his CMB and CMD, as well as which creatures he can affect with combat maneuvers. For every level of the spell he sacrifices, his effective size increases by one step, up to a maximum of Colossal. For every two effective size increments he increases, he gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, to a maximum of +6.\nThis does not change the iron-ring striker\u0027s actual size. This effect lasts for 1 minute per level of the spell sacrificed."
