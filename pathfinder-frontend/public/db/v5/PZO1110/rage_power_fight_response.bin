”When a barbarian with this rage power attempts a saving throw against a fear effect, she can enter a rage as an immediate action (as long as she would normally be able to enter rage). This consumes 3 rounds of the barbarianâ€™s daily allotment of rage rounds, but the barbarian can maintain the rage each round on her turn normally. Any benefits from the barbarianâ€™s rage apply immediately, so she gains her bonus on Will saves against the effect that required the initial saving throw. Unlike most rage powers, this rage powerâ€™s effects are useful only when the barbarian is not raging, so a skald canâ€™t grant this rage power to allies with raging song.
