    "text": "An ectoplasm master is able to select the following alchemist discoveries, in addition to general discoveries.\nEctoplasmic Mutagen: Whenever the ectoplasm master imbibes a mutagen, his living flesh transmutes into ectoplasm, causing him to take on a semiliquid form. He no longer gains a natural armor bonus from his mutagen, but instead becomes immune to critical hits and precision damage (such as sneak attacks) while under the mutagen\u0027s effects. An ectoplasm master must be at least 6th level to learn this discovery.\nEctoplasmic Servant: An ectoplasm master who selects this discovery adds all summon monster spells of 6th level or lower to his alchemist formula list as ectoplasmic extracts. Whenever he summons a creature using an ectoplasmic extract, the creature must appear in a square adjacent to his own, and it gains the ectoplasmic creature template. Creatures summoned using ectoplasmic extracts cannot have templates other than the ectoplasmic creature template."
