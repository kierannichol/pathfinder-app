ÿAt 19th level, a skirmisher learns to position his body and conceal his body proportions with clothes so well that it is difficult to hit him. He gains a 20% miss chance on attacks against him. Mobile mastery functions even when the skirmisher is flat-footed, but not when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears medium or heavy armor, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.ª0
