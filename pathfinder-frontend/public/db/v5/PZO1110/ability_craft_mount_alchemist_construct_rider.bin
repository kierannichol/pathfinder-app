°A construct rider assembles a construct mount shaped like a riding animal. A Medium alchemist can select a camel or a horse. A Small alchemist can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if he's at least 4th level.
The GM may approve other animals as mounts.
This construct mount acts in most ways as a druid animal companion, using the character's alchemist level as his effective druid level. A construct mount is a construct, but uses the appropriate animal companion's statistics, gaining Hit Dice, skills, feats, and Strength and Dexterity adjustments as the alchemist advances in level. A construct mount has no Constitution score, and instead gains bonus hit points appropriate for a construct of its size. It has an Intelligence score (and skill points), a lower base attack bonus, and better saving throws than a normal construct of its Hit Dice. The mount has all the immunities of a construct (except immunity to mind-affecting effects, since it has a mind). A construct rider can use Craft (alchemy) instead of Handle Animal for all purposes involving his construct mount, though the check still takes a â€“5 penalty due to the construct mount's unusual nature.
To create a construct with a mind and body that are constantly changing and improving, the construct rider must manufacture vast quantities of clockwork or animating reagents. As such, the construct rider can never gain the mutagen or cognatogen ability, even from a discovery or another class.
At first, his mount is a singular masterpiece created during a momentary stroke of brilliance. At 4th level, the construct rider gains Craft Construct as a bonus feat and can use his extracts instead of spells to meet spell prerequisites when crafting other constructs.
This ability replaces Brew Potion, mutagen, and the discovery gained at 4th level.ª4
