At 3rd level, a butterfly blade gets a +1 bonus on attack rolls with butterfly swords, and the damage die of any butterfly sword he wields increases by one step; at 9th level and again at 15th level, the attack bonus increases by 1 and the damage die increases by an additional step.
At 6th level, the butterfly blade gains the knockout class feature, as per a brawler of his class level â€“ 2.ª5
