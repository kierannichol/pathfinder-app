    "text": "A spire diver gains quarry and improved quarry as a normal slayer, but she does not gain the ability to take 10 or take 20 on Survival checks while moving at normal speed without penalty. Instead, at 14th level, a spire diver can take 10 on Knowledge checks to identify a monster she has selected as her quarry. At 19th level, she can take 20 on these checks without spending extra time to do so. The spire diver must be trained in the appropriate Knowledge skill to use this ability."
