    "text": "A faithful wanderer doesn\u0027t have an aura of good like other paladins do, as this would give her presence away to hostile denizens of the Abyssal wastelands.\nHer other auras likewise don\u0027t reveal her presence. The benefits of her aura of courage, aura of resolve, aura of faith, and aura of righteousness affect only her. At 3rd level, her alignment aura emulates the alignment planar traits of her current location (chaotic evil in the Abyss) for the purposes of alignment-detection effects, though this doesn\u0027t change her actual alignment. At 8th level, she takes no penalties from the mildly chaos-aligned and mildly evil-aligned planar traits and treats all opposed strongly aligned planar traits as if they were only mildly aligned. At 11th level, she takes no penalties even in areas with strongly chaos- and evil-aligned planar traits. At 14th level, she leaves no trail in areas with chaos- and evil-aligned planar traits, can\u0027t be tracked in such terrain, and can use Stealth to hide in such terrain, even if the terrain doesn\u0027t grant cover or concealment. At 17th level, she can use Stealth to hide in areas with these planar traits even while being observed."
