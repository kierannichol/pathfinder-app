ÛAt 9th level, as a standard action, the symbol striker can use a melee weapon to place a rune trap in any adjacent square. Any creature entering a square containing a rune trap takes 1d6 points of damage plus 1 additional point of damage for every 2 bloodrager levels the symbol striker has. This rune deals either acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, which is decided at the rune's creation. The rune is clearly visible and lasts a number of minutes equal to the symbol striker's bloodrager level or until discharged. A symbol striker cannot create a rune trap in a square occupied by another creature. This rune counts as a 1st-level spell for the purpose of dispelling. A creature can disarm the rune by succeeding at a DC 26 Disable Device check. The symbol striker can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 plus his Charisma modifier.ª2
