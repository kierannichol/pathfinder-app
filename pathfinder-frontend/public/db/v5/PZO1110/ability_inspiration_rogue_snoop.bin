žAt 1st level, a snoop gains an ability similar to the investigator's inspiration class ability. The snoop begins with an inspiration pool equal to half her rogue level plus her Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Unlike an investigator, a snoop can only use inspiration on skill checks, not on attack rolls or saving throws. This ability is otherwise identical to the investigator class ability of the same name.ª&
