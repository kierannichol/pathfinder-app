    "text": "This ability functions as the renown vigilante social talent. In addition to improving attitudes, it also improves the agitator\u0027s starting influence and reputation with contacts in the area by one level or step.\nFor the purpose of vigilante social talents, the agitator does not have a vigilante identity and is always considered to be in her social identity, unless she has another identity (such as from the vigilante class). If the agitator has another identity, she does not gain any benefits from renown while in that identity unless she has the renown social talent or a similar ability."
