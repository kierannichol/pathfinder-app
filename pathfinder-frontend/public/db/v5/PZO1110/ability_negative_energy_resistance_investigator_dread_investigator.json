    "text": "At 2nd level, a dread investigator gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against death effects, energy drain, and negative energy. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level and +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, effects created by undead that inflict ability drain, ability damage, or energy drain have only half their normal effect on a dread investigator (minimum 1 point of ability damage or ability drain, or 1 negative level).\nThis ability replaces poison resistance and immunity."
