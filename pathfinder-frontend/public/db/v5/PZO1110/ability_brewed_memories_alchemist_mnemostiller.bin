öA mnemostiller can create several unique extracts from the mnemos he pulls from the minds of others. At 2nd level, he adds mindlink, placebo effect, and thought echo to his formula book as 1stlevel extracts. At 5th level, he adds aura alteration, detect mindscape, and mindscape door to his formula book as 2nd-level extracts. At 8th level, he adds mindwipe and thoughtsense to his formula book as 3rd-level extracts; the range for a mindwipe extract becomes creature touched, and it can be applied only to a helpless or willing creature.™5
