    "text": "At 2nd level, a portal seeker gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against effects that attempt to magically transport her via a teleportation effect. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, to a maximum bonus of +8 at 20th level. The portal seeker also applies this bonus to saving throws against imprisonment, and she never takes a penalty on her save against this spell as a result of the caster knowing her name and facts about her life."
