òAt 3rd level, when a burn rider succeeds at a Reflex save to avoid fire damage, she can spend an immediate action to move up to half her speed. If the burn rider ends this movement outside the area of effect, she takes no damage from the effect. After this sudden movement, the burn rider is staggered until the end of her next turn. If the burn rider is mounted, her mount makes the movement instead, and both the mount and the burn rider are staggered until the end of the burn rider's next turn.ª0
