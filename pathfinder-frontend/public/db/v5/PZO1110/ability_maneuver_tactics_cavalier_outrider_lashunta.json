    "text": "At 1st level, an outrider receives an Improved combat maneuver feat (such as Improved Feint) as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. As a standard action, an outrider can grant this feat to all allies within 30 feet, regardless of whether they can see or hear him or they meet the feat\u0027s prerequisites. Allies retain this bonus feat for 3 rounds, plus 1 round for every 2 levels the outrider possesses. An outrider can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and for every 5 levels thereafter.\nAt 9th level, an outrider gains an Improved or Greater combat maneuver feat (such as Greater Overrun) for which he meets the prerequisites as a bonus feat. The outrider can grant this feat to his allies using the maneuver tactics ability. Using the maneuver tactics ability becomes a swift action.\nAt 17th level, an outrider gains an Improved, Greater, or Strike combat maneuver feat (such as Tripping Strike) as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. An outrider can grant this feat to his allies using the maneuver tactics ability."
