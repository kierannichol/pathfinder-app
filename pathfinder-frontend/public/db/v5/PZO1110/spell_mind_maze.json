    "text": "This spell causes the target to act as though it\u0027s wandering through a maze. While under the effects of the spell, the target can\u0027t make attacks or cast spells and must take at least one move action each round to walk in a random direction determined using the guidelines for missed splash weapons (Core Rulebook 202). The target must move at its maximum speed during this required movement, though additional move actions after the first can cover shorter distances. If this movement takes the target into a dangerous area, such as through a threatened square or off a ledge, the target receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Walking into a harmless obstacle, such as a wall, ends the target\u0027s movement."
