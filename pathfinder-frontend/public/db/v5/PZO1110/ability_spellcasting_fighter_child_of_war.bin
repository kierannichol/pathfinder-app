ÝStarting at 5th level, the spellcasting ability of a child of war increases to allow her to cast a limited number of spells drawn from the bloodrager spell list. She automatically adds to her spellbook a number of 1st-level bloodrager spells equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. Her caster level for these spells is equal to her fighter level, and the bloodrager class spell list is considered to be her class spell list for the purposes of meeting prerequisites and using magic items.
She uses the ranger's spells per day, but uses her Intelligence score to determine her bonus spells and spell saving throw DCs, just as a wizard does. She does not gain any other wizard abilities, such as an arcane bond or school.
Each time she attains a new fighter level, she gains one bloodrager spell of her choice to add to her spellbook. The free spells must be of spell levels she can cast. She otherwise follows the rules for a wizard regarding her spellbook and learning or preparing spells.ª0
