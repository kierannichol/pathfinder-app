    "text": "At 6th level, a filidh can use his performance to create an effect equivalent to divination, using the filidh\u0027s level as the caster level. The filidh and all allies who can hear his performance receive the information provided by the divination as flashes of inspiration and knowledge. Divinatory song takes 10 minutes and uses 6 rounds of bardic performance. Divinatory song relies on audible components."
