    "text": "By wresting a soul from life to death, a twilight sage gains a slightly deeper understanding of mortality, fueling her curiosity and eldritch power. As a full-round action, she can consume the life energy of a helpless living creature, killing it.\nThis creature must have 2 or more Hit Dice and be below 0 hit points. The twilight sage adds 2 points to her arcane reservoir if the creature\u0027s Hit Dice equaled or exceeded the sage\u0027s character level, or 1 point if the creature\u0027s Hit Dice equaled at least 1/2 her character level.\nThis ability is a death effect."
