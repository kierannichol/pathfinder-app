ßAt 4th level, a burn rider gains a loyal mount.
This ability functions like the druid's animal companion ability (as described in the nature bond class feature), except that the burn rider always gains a horse or pony (though she can gain additional options at the GM's discretion) and her effective druid level is equal to her burn rider level â€“ 3.ª)
