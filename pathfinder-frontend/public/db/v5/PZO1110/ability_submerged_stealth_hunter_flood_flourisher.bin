ÅAt 8th level, a flood flourisher learns how to ambush targets from beneath the muck, becoming a silent threat. While in a deep bog, the flood flourisher can use cover from the water to attempt Stealth checks with no penalties from the natural environment.
While in a deep bog, as long as she moves no more than 5 feet in a round, she has tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet against anything that moves within the same body of water. While underwater in a deep bog, she can hold her breath for a number of minutes equal to 6 times her Constitution score before she risks drowning.ª8
