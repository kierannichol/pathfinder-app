    "text": "At 2nd level, a skirmisher becomes more resistant to mental and physical threats that are commonly employed by his enemies or often encountered in the terrain in which he operates. The skirmisher must choose one of the specializations below, gaining a +1 bonus on saving throws of the appropriate type. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 2nd.\nAlpine Training (Ex): A skirmisher operating in mountainous terrain becomes resistant to cold climates and the rigors of long treks at high altitudes. He gains a bonus on Fortitude saving throws against altitude sickness, exposure to cold weather, and other effects that cause fatigue or exhaustion. Counter-Interrogation Training (Ex): A skirmisher undertaking infiltration missions learns to resist interrogation and persuasion. The skirmisher gains a bonus on Will saving throws against charms and divinations. Jungle Training (Ex): Through repeated exposure, a skirmisher operating in jungles and wetlands builds up a tolerance against pathogens and toxins. He gains a bonus on Fortitude saving throws against disease and poison. Light Infantry Training (Ex): A skirmisher fighting in a light infantry unit learns to avoid fire from enemy artillery, siege weapons, and spellcasters. He gains a bonus on Reflex saving throws against attacks that deal half damage on a successful save (such as the fireball spell) but not against traps, natural hazards, or environmental effects."
