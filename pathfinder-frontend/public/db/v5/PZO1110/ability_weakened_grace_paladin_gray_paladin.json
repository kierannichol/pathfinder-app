    "text": "A gray paladin\u0027s loosened code weakens her connection to the power that grants her paladin abilities. She gains her first use of smite evil at 2nd level, instead of 1st, though she still gains further uses of smite evil as normal. She never gains the aura of good or divine grace class features. Her aura of courage does not make her immune to fear, her aura of resolve does not make her immune to charms, and her aura of righteousness does not make her immune to compulsions."
