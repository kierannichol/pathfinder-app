    "text": "A war drummer gains access to the following raging song.\nSiege Drums (Su) At 7th level, the war drummer can shatter massive walls, doors, and other inanimate obstacles using his war drums. This ability works as the shatter spell, except the drummer can increase the amount of damage and size of the object damaged by playing for longer periods. The siege drummer can affect objects weighing up to 10 pounds per level, plus an additional 5 pounds per level for each additional round he plays. The damage dealt increases by 2d6 per round (to a maximum of 20d6 after 10 rounds). The damage is dealt only after the drummer ceases playing."
