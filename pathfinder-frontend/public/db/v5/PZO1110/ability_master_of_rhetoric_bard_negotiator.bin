ÂAt 5th level, the negotiator can take 10 on any Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Knowledge (local), or Sense Motive check if he has ranks in that skill.
A negotiator can choose not to take 10 and can instead roll normally. In addition, the negotiator can take 20 on one of those skill checks (without spending any additional time). The negotiator can do this once per day at 5th level, twice per day at 11th level, and three times per day at 17th level.ª1
