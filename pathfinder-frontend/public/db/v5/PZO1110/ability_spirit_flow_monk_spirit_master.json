    "text": "At 19th level, a spirit master can dramatically alter the flow of his own ki. As an immediate action, the spirit master can expend 3 ki points to alter his ki for a number of rounds equal to his class level. During this time, he is healed by negative energy as if he were an undead creature. The spirit master is still healed by positive energy as normal."
