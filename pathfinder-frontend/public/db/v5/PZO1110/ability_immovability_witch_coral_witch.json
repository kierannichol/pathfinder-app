    "text": "At 8th level, a coral witch can naturally emulate coral\u0027s ability to affix itself in place. At the end of any round in which the coral witch did not move from her space and is standing on solid ground, she adds her class level to her CMD against any bull rush, overrun, and reposition combat maneuvers, grapple attempts to move her, and attempts to pull or push her. This bonus lasts until the start of the coral witch\u0027s next turn.\nThis ability replaces the hex gained at 8th level.\nHexes: The following witch hexes complement the coral witch archetype: evil eye, feral speech, water lung.\nMajor Hexes: The following major hexes complement the coral witch archetype: Beast Eye, hag\u0027s eye, Weather Control."
