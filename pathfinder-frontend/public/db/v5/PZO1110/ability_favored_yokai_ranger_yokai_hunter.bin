A yokai hunter possesses a supernatural ability to sense beings connected to the spirit world, such as kami, oni, and ghosts, and is formidable at fighting them.
At 1st level, a yokai hunter gains a +2 bonus on weapon attacks and damage rolls against one of the following creature types (and subtypes, if applicable), which are considered yokai for the purposes of this archetype: aberration, dragon, fey, magical beast, outsider (native), and undead (incorporeal). (A GM may choose to alter this list for the purposes of her campaign.)
At 5th level and every five levels thereafter, a yokai hunter may select another favored yokai from this list, gaining a +2 bonus on weapon attacks and damage rolls against that yokai.
In addition, whenever a yokai hunter sees a favored yokai that is disguised or has not made its otherworldly essence known, he gains an automatic check to identify the creature as such. To make this check, a yokai hunter rolls 1d20 and adds his yokai hunter level and Charisma modifier (DC 10 + 1/2 the yokai's Hit Dice + the yokai's Cha modifier). A successful check means that the yokai hunter recognizes the creature's ties to the spiritual world. Regardless of whether the check is successful, a yokai hunter gains the bonus on weapon attacks and damage rolls against favored yokai.ª0
