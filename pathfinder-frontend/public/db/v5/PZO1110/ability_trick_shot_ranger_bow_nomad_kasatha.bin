Trick Shotclass:ranger#bow_nomad_kasathaarchetype_featureclass_feature¢ë
èA bow nomad can make a number of trick shots per day equal to 1/2 her ranger level + her Dexterity modifier. Unless otherwise noted, making a trick shot is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
Deflecting Arrow: At 3rd level, as an immediate action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, a bow nomad can deflect a single ranged attack. This ability functions as the Deflect Arrows feat, except the bow nomad need not have a hand free and can deflect an attack targeting any creature within 30 feet. Hampering Strike: At 8th level, a bow nomad can attempt to disarm or trip an opponent within 30 feet in place of a ranged attack, with a â€“4 penalty on the combat maneuver check. Pinning Strike: At 13th level, a bow nomad can attempt to pin a Large or smaller opponent's limb or clothing to the ground or a wall in place of an attack. If the bow nomad's attack roll exceeds her opponent's CMD, the opponent is pinned and cannot move from its current position. As a move action, the opponent can attempt a Strength check to free itself (DC = 10 + 1/2 the bow nomad's ranger level + her Strength modifier). Only creatures adjacent to a solid, anchored, penetrable surface can be affected by this ability. Exploit the Gap: At 18th level, a bow nomad can exploit the natural weaknesses of her foes. When a bow nomad makes a full attack with her twin bows, each arrow that deals damage in that attack also reduces the target's natural armor bonus (if any) by 1 (to a minimum of 0) for 1 round.ª2
