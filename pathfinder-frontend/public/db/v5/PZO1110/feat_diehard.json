      "Benefit": "When your hit point total is below 0, but you are not dead, you automatically stabilize. You do not need to make a Constitution check each round to avoid losing additional hit points. You may choose to act as if you were disabled, rather than dying. You must make this decision as soon as you are reduced to negative hit points (even if it isn\u0027t your turn). If you do not choose to act as if you were disabled, you immediately fall unconscious.",
      "Normal": "A character without this feat who is reduced to negative hit points is unconscious and dying."
