    "text": "At 14th level, a liberator can control her movement, breathing, body temperature, and other physiological signs to confuse the artificial visions of constructs. At will, the barbarian can make herself undetectable to constructs as if she were affected by a hide from undead spell that instead hides the subject from constructs. Intelligent constructs receive a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian\u0027s level + the barbarian\u0027s Constitution modifier) to see through this effect. The barbarian must expend 1 round of rage for each round she uses this ability.\nThis ability replaces indomitable will."
