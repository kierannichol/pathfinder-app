    "text": "At 1st level, once per day, the guide can focus on a single enemy within line of sight as a swift action. That creature remains the Ranger\u0027s focus until it is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points or surrenders, or until the Ranger designates a new focus, whichever occurs first. The Ranger gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls against the target of his focus. At 5th level, and every five levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +2.\nAt 4th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, the Ranger can use this ability one additional time per day."
