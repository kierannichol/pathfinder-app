      "Effect": "The rituals of lost Sarkoris summoned and put to use many of their myriad â€œgods,\" including conjuring powerful spirits into a clan\u0027s soldiers to invest them with bravery and divine grace in an upcoming battle. In this ritual, after an hour of chanting, calling down a spirit, and begging and forcing its service, the primary caster moves among those to be invested with the spirit\u0027s power, anointing the participants\u0027 foreheads with blood. The ritual infuses each anointed warrior with inhuman passion and courage, granting a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, as well as a +4 morale bonus on saves against fear effects, but also renders them vulnerable to spells that forbid outsiders or deal additional damage against creatures of the outsider type (such as magic circle against chaos and chaos hammer). A target of this spell does not become an outsider; it simply gains a temporary vulnerability to these effects."
