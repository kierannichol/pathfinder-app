    "text": "This functions like baleful polymorph, except the target becomes an ooze. A creature of 3 HD or less becomes a gray ooze, 4â€“9 HD becomes a gelatinous cube or ochre jelly, and 10+ HD becomes a black pudding. Alternatively, instead of a creature you may target a quantity of inert flesh (such as that created by the stone to flesh spell) of sufficient mass, which becomes an ooze of your choice."
