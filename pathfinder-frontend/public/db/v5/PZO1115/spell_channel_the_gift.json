    "text": "You channel your magical power to fuel the target\u0027s spellcasting. The next spell the target casts of 3rd level or lower does not expend a spell slot; in effect, you are using your spell slot to power the target\u0027s spell. The target must start casting this spell before your next turn, and the spell cannot have a casting time longer than 1 full round. Your alignment, prohibited wizard school, and other restrictions on your own spellcasting do not affect the target, nor do you suffer any backlash from the target\u0027s choice of spell."
