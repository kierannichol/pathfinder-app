ØYou create a replica within the Akashic Record of each target at the time the spell is cast. Each targeted creature must currently have at least half its hit points. If at any time during the duration of the spell a target is brought below half her maximum hit points, that target can end the spell on herself as an immediate action to absorb strength from her replica and immediately regain a number of hit points equal to 1d8 plus 1 point per caster level (maximum +25).
