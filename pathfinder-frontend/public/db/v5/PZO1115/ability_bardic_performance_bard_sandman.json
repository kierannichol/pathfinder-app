    "text": "A sandman gains the following types of bardic performance:\nStealspell (Su): A sandman can use performance to steal spells from his foes and add them to his list of spells known. Once the performance is started, the bard can steal a prepared spell or a spell known from another creature with a touch attack as a standard action. The target receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard\u0027s level + the bard\u0027s Cha bonus) to negate the effect. The sandman may choose a spell to steal, but if the target does not possess the spell, the bardic performance immediately ends. Otherwise the spell stolen is random, but it is always of the highest level that the bard can cast, if possible. The target loses the prepared spell or spell known and the sandman adds it to his list of spells known for as long as the performance continues, after which it reverts to the original recipient. While stolen, the bard can cast the spell using his available spell slots. This use does not consume the stolen spell. If the bard steals another spell while a spell is stolen, the previous spell immediately reverts to its original owner. This ability requires visual components.\nThis performance replaces inspire courage.\nSlumber Song (Sp): At 6th level, a sandman can use his performance to cause a creature he has already fascinated to fall asleep (as deep slumber, but with no HD limit). Otherwise, this ability functions like suggestion.\nThis performance replaces suggestion.\nDramatic Subtext (Su): At 9th level, a sandman can use bardic performance to cast spells without obvious visual or audible components while retaining the spell\u0027s normal effects. Observers must succeed at a Perception check opposed by a sandman\u0027s Sleight of Hand check to notice that the sandman is the source of the spellcasting (though spellcasting still provokes attacks of opportunity). The bard must use this performance for at least 2 rounds before casting a spell; otherwise he is automatically detected and the performance ends.\nThis ability replaces inspire greatness.\nGreater Stealspell (Su): A sandman\u0027s stealspell power improves at 15th level. When a target fails a save against his stealspell performance, the sandman discovers its spell resistance (if any) and all spells it has prepared or knows. He can then choose which spell to steal. The sandman may forgo stealing a spell and instead reduce the target\u0027s SR by an amount equal to half his bard level and gain that amount of spell resistance for as long as he continues performing. If he steals additional spell resistance, it stacks with previously stolen SR. If he steals a spell or ceases performing, the spell resistance immediately reverts back to its owner.\nThis performance replaces inspire heroics.\nMass Slumber Song (Sp): At 18th level, a sandman can use slumber song to affect any number of fascinated creatures within 30 feet. Otherwise, this ability functions like mass suggestion.\nThis performance replaces mass suggestion.\nSpell Catching (Su): At 20th level, a sandman who saves against a spell or spell-like ability that targets only him (not including area spells) may use bardic performance as an immediate action. He must attempt a caster level check (DC 10 + the spell\u0027s original caster level). If it succeeds, the sandman can absorb the spell effect without harm and immediately recast that spell (using the original caster\u0027s level and save DC) or any spell he knows of that level or lower. Using this ability consumes a number of rounds of bardic performance equal to the spell\u0027s level, even if the check fails."
