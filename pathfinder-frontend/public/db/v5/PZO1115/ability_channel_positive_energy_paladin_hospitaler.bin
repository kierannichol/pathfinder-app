€When a hospitaler reaches 4th level, she gains the ability to channel positive energy as a cleric equal to her paladin level â€“3. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. Using this ability does not expend uses of lay on hands, as it does with other paladins.
This ability replaces the standard paladin's channel positive energy ability.ª9
