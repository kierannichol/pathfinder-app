    "text": "When you are struck by an opponent\u0027s natural attacks, the damage is resolved as if the attack came from a creature one size smaller per 5 caster levels (maximum of four size categories smaller at CL 20th). Refer to Table 3â€“1 in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary to determine an attack\u0027s altered base damage. If the creature\u0027s natural attack deals nonstandard damage, refer instead to the Improved Natural Attack feat on page 315 of the Bestiary. It is not possible to reduce the base damage of a creature\u0027s natural attack below 1d2 with this spell."
