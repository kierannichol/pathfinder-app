žAt 9th level, when a savage warrior attacks with a natural weapon at the end of a charge, he gains a bonus on his natural weapon attack rolls equal to half his fighter level, while suffering a penalty to his AC equal to half his fighter level. These replace the normal attack roll bonus and AC penalty for charging. This bonus also applies to his CMB for a bull rush or overrun combat maneuvers made when charging.ª3
