ÅYou create an illusion that takes the same space as a foe and mimics its movements perfectly. Whenever you cast a spell or throw a weapon, the illusion ceases mimicking the target's actions just long enough to make it look like the target cast the spell or threw the weapon simultaneously with you, such that witnesses who can see both you and the target can't tell with certainty who truly cast the spell or threw the weapon. Witnesses who can see only the target see it as the only apparent source. The subject of this spell doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity from these illusory actions. Each target of the attack or spell counts as interacting with the illusion and thus receives a save to disbelieve.
