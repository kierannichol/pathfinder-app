    "text": "You place a protective ward over your spirit that ensnares creatures attempting to possess you. Should a creature attempt to possess you (such as via magic jaror a similar effect) while you are under the effects of possession trap, that creature must first succeed at a Will save or its possession attempt is ruined and its spirit is shunted into this spell\u0027s focus gem. The trapped creature is contained within the focus gem for 1 round per caster level, acting as though it were trapped in a magic jarfor the duration of this effect. This effect fails if you are not carrying the focus gem during the time of the possession attempt."
