    "text": "This spell functions similarly to plane shift, but instead of transporting the targets to a destination near an intended location on a specific plane, anywhere but here transports affected creatures to a random plane. A creature can be affected by anywhere but here only if it is currently not on its home plane (although targets can, by chance, end up traveling to their home plane as a result of this spell). Subjects always appear in a location that is not inherently harmful, but the exact destination is otherwise random. The specific plane is determined by the table below; the location on the destination plane where the transported creatures arrive is completely subject to the GM\u0027s whim. d% Planar Destination 1-7 Abyss 8-14 Abaddon 15-20 Hell 21-24 Shadow Plane 25-28 First World 29-35 Maelstrom 36-42 Boneyard 43-49 Axis 50-56 Ethereal Plane 57-63 Elysium 64-70 Nirvana 71-77 Heaven 78-84 Astral Plane 85-90 Random demiplane 91-95 Material Plane (random world) 96-100 GM\u0027s choice A creature that is transported by anywhere but here cannot be affected by a subsequent casting of anywhere but here for 24 hours afterward (but can be affected normally by other forms of planar travel)."
