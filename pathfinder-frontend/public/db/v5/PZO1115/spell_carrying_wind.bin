ÿWhen you cast this spell, a wind spirit envelopes you and carries you with it at your direction. You gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to your base speed and fly speed while this spell is in effect. If you don't have a fly speed, you instead gain a fly speed of 10 feet with poor maneuverability. If your caster level is 10thâ€“14th, the enhancement bonus to these speeds is +20 feet (if applicable, your temporary fly speed is 20 feet with average maneuverability). If your caster level is 15th or higher, the enhancement bonus to these speeds is +30 feet (if applicable, your temporary fly speed is 30 feet with average maneuverability).
