    "text": "You inscribe a series of runes upon the surface of a door or around the border of an entryway. They function as a glyph of warding (blast glyph), though unlike a glyph of warding, these runes are always visible. The runes count as a glyph of warding for the purpose of what spells can defeat it, placing multiple glyphs in the same area, and so on."
