    "text": "This spell creates an illusion of a stationary group of people milling about. They can be of any humanoid race or ethnicity you are familiar with, and they speak a language of your choice that you know. To anyone not paying close attention, their conversations sound perfectly normal but are in fact repetitive and essentially meaningless. The crowd appears to be a group of typical citizens, and cannot duplicate any specific group, guild, or military squad."
