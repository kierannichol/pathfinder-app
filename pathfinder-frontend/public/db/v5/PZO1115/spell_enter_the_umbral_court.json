      "Effect": "Before this ritual can be cast, the casters must reach deep into the target\u0027s mind to extract the most personally heinous torture the target could imagine, and then the casters must inflict it upon the target during the casting. This often involves whips, spiked chains, barbed hooks, or other torturous elements usually constructed from the target\u0027s own skin and viscera. While the target endures this torture, it must recite the parable of Nidal\u0027s pact with Zon-Kuthon while the casters alternatingly chant epic poetry vaguely detailing the Midnight Lord\u0027s travels behind reality and the unfathomable horrors that he is capable of inflicting on the target\u0027s soul. If the target does not cower in fear at these descriptions, the ritual fails."
