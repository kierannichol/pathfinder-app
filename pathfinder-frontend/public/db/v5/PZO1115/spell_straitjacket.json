    "text": "You cause a straitjacket to spring into existence to restrain the target creature. You attempt a combat maneuver against the target\u0027s CMD. Your CMB for this check is equal to your caster level + 5 due to the straightjacket\u0027s Strength. This combat maneuver doesn\u0027t provoke an attack of opportunity, and if it succeeds, the target is restrained. This is similar to the grappled condition, except the target is able to move at its normal speed, the restraint doesn\u0027t cause the target to require concentration checks to use abilities that require concentration, and the target can\u0027t take actions that require one or more hands or arms to perform (including casting spells that require a somatic or material component)."
