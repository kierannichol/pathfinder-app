ëThis spell empowers the natural attacks or unarmed strikes of undead creatures, granting a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls made by the target with its unarmed strikes or attacks with one natural attack. This spell can cause an undead creature's unarmed strike to deal lethal damage, but in this case, the attack does not gain an enhancement bonus.
