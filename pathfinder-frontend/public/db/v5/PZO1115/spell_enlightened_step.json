    "text": "Through careful regulation of your body\u0027s mystical energies, thoughtful control of your poise and balance, and the focus in your mind on the surety of each and every step you take, you are able to make your steps lighter than air. This grants you the benefits of air walk, except as noted above. Additionally, at any time during the spell\u0027s duration, you can expend the spell\u0027s remaining duration as a swift action in order to gain a fly speed of 120 feet with perfect maneuverability for 1 minute. After this time, the spell ends."
