      "Effect": "The ritual requires the casters to fill a pool with the required water and diamond dust, then restrain a number of Medium humanoid bodies in the pool. The total number of bodies must equal the number of sinspawn to be created (two Small humanoids count as one Medium humanoid, and one Large or larger humanoid counts as four Medium ones), and the bodies can have been dead for no more than 8 hours. At least seven casters, which must include the primary caster, stand at equidistant points around the pool to invest the pool with the sinfulness of the gem-bound creature\u0027s soul. Upon successful completion of the ritual, the gem dissolves, the bodies melt into slurry, and a number of sinspawn associated with the sin that corresponds most closely with the soul of the creature bound within the gem (envy, greed, gluttony, lust, pride, sloth, or wrath) form out of the churning mass. Sinspawn created in this way are free willed but are initially well disposed toward the primary caster."
