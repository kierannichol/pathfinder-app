    "text": "You create an emotional block in the target\u0027s mind, adding an emotion component to each spell or spell-like ability he uses. This is in addition to any other components the spell already requires, and doesn\u0027t replace the somatic component. The target\u0027s spelllike abilities require this emotion component, even though they normally don\u0027t need spell components."
