    "text": "This spell functions exactly as the spell nightmare. In addition to the effects of that spell, you can cause a second spell to be delivered when the target wakes at the nightmare\u0027s conclusion. You must have this second spell prepared, and it must be cast immediately after vision of Lamashtu (effectively adding the two spells\u0027 casting times). This second spell â€œrides along\" with the nightmare, affecting the target as soon as it wakes from its fitful sleep. Any spell can be sent along with the nightmare, so long as it is of 6th level or lower, affects one target (which is always the nightmare\u0027s recipient), and does not deal hit point damage. The second spell\u0027s range is irrelevant for the purposes of vision of Lamashtu, and even touch attacks can be delivered in this manner (you must still make a successful touch attack in order to affect the target, though, with the act of touching occurring within the context of the victim\u0027s nightmare). The target is allowed to save against the second spell if a save is allowed. For example, a cleric of Lamashtu could send bestow curse along as part of a vision of Lamashtu, but not blade barrier (affects an area), destruction (too high level), or inflict moderate wounds (deals hit point damage)."
