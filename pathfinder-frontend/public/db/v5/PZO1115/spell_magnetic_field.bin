¢You create a spherical magnetic field that surrounds you to a range of 30 feet and follows you for the duration of the spell. Unattended metal objects in range--including weapons, armor, and anything made primarily out of metal--are pulled violently toward you, stopping just short of your space and falling harmlessly to the ground. Objects secured to a nonmetallic fixture remain where they are unless a forceful tug would be enough to detach them. Loose objects weighing more than 500 pounds are not affected. If the magnetic field would cause a dangerous metal object such as a sword or anvil to intersect a square occupied by a creature, that creature must succeed at a Reflex save or take damage as if from an improvised weapon of the object's size (or smaller or larger, at the GM's discretion).
