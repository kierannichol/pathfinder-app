    "text": "When a cutpurse makes a Sleight of Hand check to take something from a creature, the target makes its Perception check before the rogue makes her Sleight of Hand check, and the rogue knows the Perception check result. She can decide whether or not to make the check based on the results of the target\u0027s Perception check. If the rogue elects not to make the check, she can make a Bluff check, opposed by the target\u0027s Sense Motive, to prevent the target from noticing the attempt."
