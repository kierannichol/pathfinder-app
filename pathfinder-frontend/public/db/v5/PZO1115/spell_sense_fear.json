    "text": "You sense the fear of those nearby, feeling it in the air around you. You can detect spooked, shaken, scared, frightened, panicked, terrified, and horrified creatures within 30 feet, and you immediately know what level of fear they are experiencing. You determine the creatures\u0027 approximate direction from you, though you do not sense a given creature\u0027s identity or know which squares the creatures occupy. If you\u0027re within 5 feet of a creature whose fear you sense, you pinpoint that creature\u0027s location, as if using blindsense."
