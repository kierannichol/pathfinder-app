ÆYou become a Medium imperial or primal dragon. Druids can choose from the primal dragon (brine, cloud, crystal, magma, or umbral) forms only. You gain a +4 size bonus to your Strength, a +2 size bonus to your Constitution, a +4 natural armor bonus, a fly speed of 60 feet (poor), darkvision with a range of 60 feet, a breath weapon, and either resistance to one form of energy or some other bonus. You also gain one bite attack (1d8), two claw attacks (1d6), and either a gore attack (1d8) if you assume the form of an imperial dragon or two wing attacks (1d4) if you assume the form of a primal dragon. Your breath weapon, resistance, and any other benefits you gain depend on the type of dragon. You can use the breath weapon only once per casting of this spell. All breath weapons deal 6d8 points of damage unless noted otherwise and allow a Reflex save to halve the normal damage. In addition, some of the dragon types grant additional abilities, as noted below.
