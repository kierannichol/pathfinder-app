‘At 8th level, whenever a trapsmith disarms a trap using Disable Device, she can bypass it even if her check did not exceed the DC by 10 or more. If it is a magic trap that allows specific creatures to pass it without danger, she can modify which creatures it allows to pass, adding her allies and restricting enemies if she desires.
This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.
Rogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement the trapsmith archetype: befuddling strike, cunning trigger, quick disable, and quick trapsmith.ª*
