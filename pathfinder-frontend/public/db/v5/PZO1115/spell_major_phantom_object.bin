ßThis spell functions as the major creationspell, except as noted above and the object created is a semi-real illusion. Any creature that interacts with the object may make a Will save, with success causing the object to cease to exist. A gnome casting this spell may make a Spellcraft check in place of any Craft check required to make a complex item.
