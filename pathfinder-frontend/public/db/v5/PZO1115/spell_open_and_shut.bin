¿You alter the appearance of a door and disguise whether it is open or closed. You can cause the touched door to appear closed regardless of whether it is open or closed, to appear open regardless of whether it is open or closed, or to appear to open or close. After you cast the spell, you can change between these options as a move action. Creatures using a move action to open or shut the door can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the illusion.
