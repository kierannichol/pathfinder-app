      "Effect": "The witch can make an animal or humanoid within 30 feet distrust another creature within line of sight. The target\u0027s attitude toward the other creature decreases by one step. A successful Will save negates this effect. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the witch\u0027s Intelligence modifier. The duration can be extended with the cackle hex. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day. At 8th level, this effect decreases the attitude of the target creature by two steps."
