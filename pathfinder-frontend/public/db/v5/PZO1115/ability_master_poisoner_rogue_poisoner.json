    "text": "At 3rd level, a poisoner can use Craft (alchemy) to change the type of a poison. This requires 1 hour of work with an alchemist\u0027s lab and a Craft (alchemy) skill check with a DC equal to the poison\u0027s DC. If successful, the poison\u0027s type changes to contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury. If the check fails, the poison is ruined. The poisoner also receives a bonus on Craft (alchemy) skill checks when working with poison equal to 1/2 her rogue level.\nThis ability replaces trap sense.\nRogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement the poisoner archetype: distracting attack, lasting poison, surprise attack*, swift poison, and weapon training*."
