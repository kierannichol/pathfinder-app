    "text": "At 17th level, when a creature threatened by a polearm master takes a 5-foot step into a square adjacent to him, he can take a 5-foot step as an immediate action. This 5-foot step must be subtracted from his movement on the next turn. He also gains a +2 dodge bonus to his AC against that opponent until the end of his next turn."
