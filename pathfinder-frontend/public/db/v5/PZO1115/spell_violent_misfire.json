    "text": "This spell creates a chaotic charge within the black powder loaded in a target firearm. The next time the target weapon fires during this spell\u0027s duration, it automatically misfires. If this misfire causes the firearm to explode, the radius of the explosion is doubled and it deals maximum damage to all creatures in the radius. The firearm\u0027s wielder also takes 1d6 additional points of fire damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 10d6) you have."
