½Creatures in the area of this spell are subject to a subtle enchantment that confounds their senses of direction, interferes with recognizing landmarks, and causes them to misjudge distances and angles. Creatures that enter the area must succeed at a new Survival check to avoid becoming lost immediately, whether or not they succeed at their saving throws. Those that fail the save take a penalty on such Survival checks equal to double your caster level, treat all squares they enter as difficult terrain for as long as they are in the area and for 1 hour per caster level thereafter, lose the benefit of all effects that allow them to ignore difficult terrain, and take a â€“4 penalty to Dexterity.
