    "text": "By speaking the name â€œXhamen-Dor,\" you infuse yourself with the essence of the Inmost Blot and gain a +3 profane bonus on Will saving throws for the spell\u0027s duration. When you prepare what grows within for the first time, or the first time you use it via a spell-completion or spell-trigger item, you can thereafter be targeted by Xhamen-Dor\u0027s infected dreams ability (see page 86). As long as you are under the effects of what grows within, your mind-affecting spells carry this supernatural taint within them and can infect those who succumb to those effects. Whenever you successfully affect a creature with one of your mind-affecting spells (this requires the target to fail its saving throw against the spell if the spell allows a save, but automatically affects a target if the spell does not allow a saving throw), that target must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw against what grows within or it immediately becomes afflicted by a lesser version of Xhamen-Dor\u0027s seeded infestation. This infestation does not expose the victim to Xhamen-Dor\u0027s infectious dreams, but it can ultimately result in that creature\u0027s transformation into one of the seeded. Each time you affect a creature with what grows within in this manner, the remaining duration of what grows within is reduced by 1 round. If you affect multiple creatures in a round, you choose the order in which they must save against the effects of what grows within, and reduce the spell\u0027s remaining duration by 1 round each time one of them is affected by the infestation."
