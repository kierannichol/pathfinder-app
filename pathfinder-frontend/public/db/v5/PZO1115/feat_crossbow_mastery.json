      "Benefit": "The time required for you to reload any type of crossbow is reduced to a free action, regardless of the type of crossbow used. You can fire a crossbow as many times in a full attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow. Reloading a crossbow for the type of crossbow you chose when you took Rapid Reload no longer provokes attacks of opportunity.",
      "Special": "Starting at 6th level, a ranger with the archery combat style may select Crossbow Mastery as a combat style feat."
