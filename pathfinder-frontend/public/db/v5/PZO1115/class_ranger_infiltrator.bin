ÄSome rangers study their favored enemies and learn their ways, applying this knowledge to their own abilities and using their foes' strengths against them. Infiltrators are willing to walk a mile in an enemy's shoes so as to learn everything there is to know about their foes in order to more effectively hunt and kill them.º
