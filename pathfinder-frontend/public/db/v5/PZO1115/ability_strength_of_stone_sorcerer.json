    "text": ": At 20th level, your flesh becomes as hard as stone, giving you DR 10/adamantine, and you become immune to petrification. You suffer no penalties while squeezing through tight spaces and are immune to bull rush, drag, grapple, reposition, and trip maneuvers, and to push and pull effects as long as you are standing on the ground."
