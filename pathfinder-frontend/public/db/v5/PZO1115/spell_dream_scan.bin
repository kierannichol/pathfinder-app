ÏThis spell functions as dream, but rather than sending a message to a sleeping target, you can instead read the target's thoughts. The target must be asleep for you to perform a dream scan, though if the target isn't asleep, you can wait in a trance until your target falls asleep. Once the target is asleep, you can concentrate in order to read its surface thoughts as if using detect thoughts. You can continue concentrating for up to 1 minute per caster level.
