ÑAt 11th level, a ki mystic may receive mystic visions when he rests. These visions can come as a dream, an epiphany, or even as the voice of an old friend whispering in the monk's mind. The effect is similar to a divination spell with a caster level equal to the monk's level. The divination has no casting time; it is just part of the normal dreams or visions that occur every night. Using this ability costs 2 ki points that are removed from the next day's total.ª+)
