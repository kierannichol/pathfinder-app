ÆThis spell--a favorite of fey spellcasters--is traditionally bestowed with a kiss, though all that's really required to gift someone with a kiss of the First Worldis a touch. This spell infuses a living creature with a surge of positive energy from the First World, filling the target with the raw energies of life. The exact effects of this spell vary, depending on the nature of the creature touched. Constructs are immune to the effects of this spell.
