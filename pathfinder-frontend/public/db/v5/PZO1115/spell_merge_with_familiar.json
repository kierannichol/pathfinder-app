For the duration of this spell, you and the target can separate or merge at will as a move action. While merged, your familiar or spirit animal can\u0027t be targeted or affected by most attacks and effects, though it still suffers from ongoing effects and their durations continue. It can be the recipient of effects that originate from you."
