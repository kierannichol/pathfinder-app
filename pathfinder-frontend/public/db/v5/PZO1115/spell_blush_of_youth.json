      "Effect": "The caster must gather her intended victims in a circle with a radius no larger than 10 feet around her and restrain them for the duration of the ritual; while they don\u0027t participate in the ritual other than as sacrifices, these victims count as secondary casters for the purpose of determining the caster\u0027s skill bonuses. At the ritual\u0027s start, the caster stands at the center of the circle of victims and chants while holding the onyx aloft. The evil energy emanating from the caster slowly siphons the victims\u0027 blood through their facial orifices; that blood travels in a liquid line from the victims to the primary caster\u0027s onyx. From there, the blood washes over the primary caster. By the end of the ritual, the primary caster\u0027s entire body is bathed in an occluding egg of thick, dripping blood."
