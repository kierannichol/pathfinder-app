 At 4th level, the horse lord forms a bond with an animal he can use as a mount, which becomes his animal companion. A Medium Ranger can select a camel or a horse. A small Ranger can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or dog if he is at least 7th level.
This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability except that the Ranger's effective druid level is equal to his Ranger level â€“ 3. The Ranger gains a +2 bonus on Handle Animal and Ride checks with his animal companion mount.
This ability replaces hunter's bond.ª,*
