    "text": "At 19th level, when a crossbowman confirms a critical hit with a crossbow, the bolt pierces the target and can strike another creature in line behind it. The crossbowman must be able to trace a line starting at his space and passing through both targets to make this additional attack. The secondary attack is made at a â€“4 penalty, in addition to any modifiers for added range. If this attack is also a critical hit, the bolt can continue to hit another target, but the penalties stack."
