      "Effect": "As the primary caster traces warped runes in the air, this ritual twists and reshapes the target giant with arcane energies and etches runes into the giant\u0027s flesh. This agonizing process deals the giant 1d6 points of damage per character level of the primary caster. Upon completion of the ritual, the giant must succeed at Fortitude save or be transformed into an inverted giant. If the giant succeeds at the save, it takes a cumulative –2 penalty on its Fortitude saves against this ritual for the next week."
