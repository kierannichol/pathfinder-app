If the being who summoned it is not present, the creature acts normally according to its last task or instructions. This spell has no effect on called creatures, summoned creatures not brought forth by spells or spell-like abilities (such as a summoner\u0027s eidolon), or bonded creatures not explicitly summoned, such as a paladin\u0027s mount or wizard\u0027s familiar."
