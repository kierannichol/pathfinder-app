      "Effect": "The hexer disrupts the connection between a summoned creature within 30 feet and its master. The summoned creature must succeed at a Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. While it\u0027s confused in this way, during any round in which the percentile die roll to determine the creature\u0027s confusion result is 76â€“100, the affected creature instead acts as if the hexer had summoned it (attacking the hexer\u0027s enemies or performing such other tasks that the hexer can communicate to it)."
