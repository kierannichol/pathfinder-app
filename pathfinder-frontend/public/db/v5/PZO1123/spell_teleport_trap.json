    "text": "Teleport trap wards an area, redirecting all teleportation into or out of the area to a specific point within the area determined by you at the time of casting. The destination must be an open space on a solid surface. The spell\u0027s area overlaps walls and other solid and liquid objects (preventing intruders from bypassing the ward by teleporting into a wall or through similar means). A teleporting creature that is affected by a teleport trap can resist the effect with a Will save--if the save is successful, the creature simply doesn\u0027t teleport at all (but the use of the teleport effect is still consumed)--either to the intended location or the teleport trap\u0027s actual destination. A DC 27 Knowledge (arcana) allows such a creature to recognize the teleport trap\u0027s presence, but does not reveal the trap\u0027s linked destination."
