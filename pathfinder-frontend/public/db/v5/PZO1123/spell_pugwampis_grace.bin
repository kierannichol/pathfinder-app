²Hated by adventurers throughout the Inner Sea region, the gremlins known as pugwampis infect those around them with a malignant form of unluck--an effect that this spell emulates. If the target fails its Will save, it becomes infused with the so-called â€œgrace of the pugwampi." A creature affected by this spell must roll two d20s whenever a situation calls for a d20 roll (such as an attack roll, a skill check, or a saving throw) and must use the lower of the two results generated. As with the aura shed by actual pugwampies, this spell has no effect on animals, gremlins, or gnolls. The effects of this spell are negated as long as a target gains any sort of luck bonus to a d20 roll (such as those granted by a luckstoneor divine favor), but the spell's duration is not impacted by these effects. If the luck bonus goes away before the pugwampi's graceeffect ends, the unluck returns and remains until the spell's normal duration runs out.
