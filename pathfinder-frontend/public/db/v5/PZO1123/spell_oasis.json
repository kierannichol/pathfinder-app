    "text": "This spell functions in any natural terrain on the Material Plane. It redirects the flow of water in the ground toward the surface at the designated point, creating a permanent water source similar to a natural spring. The spring discharges 5 gallons of pure drinking water per caster level each hour. If the shape of the terrain is suitable, a pond forms around the spring. If there is already a natural spring within 1 mile, its water output is reduced by an amount equal to the water produced by this spell\u0027s spring. A spring that has its water output reduced to 0 gallons per hour dries up and ceases to be a spring."
