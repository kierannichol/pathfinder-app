You gain a +5 competence bonus on Appraise checks, can attempt an Appraise check to determine an object\u0027s value as a move action, and can take 10 on an Appraise check even if stress or distractions would normally prevent you from doing so. You know if you fail an Appraise check, and you never determine a wildly inaccurate price."
