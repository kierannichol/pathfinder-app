    "text": "A glamered bubble surrounds the target\u0027s space, rendering her completely invisible underwater by hiding both the target and any water she displaces. Because of the bubble\u0027s size limit, this spell works only on Medium or smaller targets. Other objects and creatures within the bubble\u0027s space are also invisible while they stay in the space, which could reveal the spell\u0027s existence to a canny observer who notices fish disappearing into the bubble and reappearing on the other side. Creatures inside the bubble can see each other, which allows foes who can pinpoint the bubble\u0027s location (such as dragons) to stick their heads into the bubble in order to see the target. Any creature on the inside of the bubble that takes any action that would break invisibility pops the bubble and ends the spell early. On land, the bubble is clearly visible, acting much as invisibility does in the water. Unlike with invisibility, the inside of the bubble blocks light from escaping the bubble, meaning that light sources inside the bubble don\u0027t illuminate past its edges, but also don\u0027t reveal a telltale glow."
