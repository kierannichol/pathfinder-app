¿By touching a single door, gate, or other portal, you create a keyhole where none existed before or double the size of an existing keyhole. A conjured keyhole allows you to peer through the door, though the limited perspective imposes a â€“10 penalty on Perception checks to spot anything beyond. It also allows a sealed door to be locked or picked if it could not be before. Locking or unlocking such a door requires a successful Disable Device check with a DC equal to the barrier's break DC + 10. Enlarging an existing keyhole allows viewers to peer through to whatever lies beyond, even if the preexisting keyhole did not allow it, and it reduces the Disable Device DC to open or lock the door by 5.
