ÅYou can cast this spell immediately after attacking a creature, causing that creature to believe that a different creature that threatens it was responsible for the attack rather than you. You can instead cast this spell immediately after a failed Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check, causing the target of that check to believe that a different creature you designate within spell range was responsible for the content of that failed check. Using the spell in these ways doesn't compel the target to undertake a specific action in response to its belief of where the blame lies.
