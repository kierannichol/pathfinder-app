€You draw forth the ebbing life force of a dying creature or one that has died in the past round, focusing it through a crystal lens focus to transform into a soul gem. If the creature is alive and fails its saving throw, it dies and you capture its soul in the gem. If the creature is dead, it can still resist the spell effect by attempting a Will save as if it were still alive. The value of the soul gem created depends on the nature of the creature it is made from (see page 191). Soul gems created by this spell crumble to dust once the spell's duration expires, releasing the trapped soul to travel on to judgment in the Great Beyond.
