ÜYou shroud a single trap with a powerful illusion to make it more difficult to locate. Spells like detect magic can't locate any magic aura from either the target trap or from undetectable trap. Furthermore, a character under the effect of the find traps spell doesn't receive an automatic chance to locate the target trap when she comes within 10 feet of it, and the bonus on Perception checks from find traps doesn't apply to attempts to notice the target trap. Add 1/2 your caster level to the DC for any creature without the trapfinding class ability to notice the target trap with Perception checks.
