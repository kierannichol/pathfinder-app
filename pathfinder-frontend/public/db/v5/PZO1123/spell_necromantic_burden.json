    "text": "You make an undead creature more difficult for necromancers and clerics to control via effects such as Command Undead or control undead. If the target fails its Will save, the target\u0027s effective number of Hit Dice is doubled for the purposes of determining whether it remains under the control of another creature. Regardless of the target\u0027s actual Hit Dice, its effective HD cannot exceed twice your caster level. (For example, a 12th-level cleric could cast this spell to cause an undead creature with 15 HD to instead effectively have 24 HD for the purpose of controlling it.)"
