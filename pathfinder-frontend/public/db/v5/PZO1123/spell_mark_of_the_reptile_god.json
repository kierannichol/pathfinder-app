    "text": "If you succeed at a ranged touch attack, you burn your handprint onto the flesh of a creature, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage. The mark can be placed on any exposed portion of the creature, typically the head or forearm. The flesh around the handprint becomes rough and scaly, like the hide of a lizard. It also glows with a green radiance (shedding light as a torch) when brought within 60 feet of you. While the handprint glows, the target takes a -2 penalty to AC against your attacks and on saving throws to resist any spell you cast or spell-like ability you use."
