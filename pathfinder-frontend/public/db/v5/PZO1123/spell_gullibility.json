    "text": "You befuddle the target\u0027s mind, making it more willing to believe even the most outlandish tales. The target takes a â€“10 penalty on Sense Motive checks for the spell\u0027s duration. In addition, creatures that attempt to lie to or deceive the target gain a +10 bonus on their Bluff checks, as if the target wanted to believe them and was drunk or impaired simultaneously. Furthermore, the believability of any lie told to a creature under the effects of gullibility increases by one step; an impossible lie seems far-fetched, a far-fetched lie seems unlikely, and an unlikely lie seems believable."
