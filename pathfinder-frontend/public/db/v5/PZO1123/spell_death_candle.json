    "text": "This spell functions like death knell, except instead of using the slain target\u0027s life energy to enhance yourself, you use it to summon a Small fire elemental resembling a burning, howling version of the slain creature. The elemental acts immediately on your turn and otherwise behaves as if you had summoned it with summon monster II. The elemental remains for a number of rounds equal to the Hit Dice of the slain creature."
