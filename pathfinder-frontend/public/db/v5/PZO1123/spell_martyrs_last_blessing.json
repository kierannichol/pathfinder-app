    "text": "You charge your body with healing energy, which erupts from you if you are dying or are killed before 1 hour per level has passed. If you\u0027re brought below 0 hit points or killed (including by effects that kill without dealing damage, such as phantasmal killerand power word kill), the eruption of healing energy acts as mass cure light woundson allies (other than you). Allies with the fewest Hit Dice are affected first. Among allies with equal HD, those closest to you are affected first. If the duration ends, the stored healing energy dissipates with no effect."
