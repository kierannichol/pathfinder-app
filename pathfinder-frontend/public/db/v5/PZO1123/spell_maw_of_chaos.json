    "text": "This spell creates a rip in reality that plunges into the interspatial vortices that constantly churn with the raw destructive chaos of the Abyss. Each round at the beginning of your turn, the maw of chaos attempts a drag combat maneuver check against every creature within 40 feet, using your caster level plus your primary spellcasting ability modifier in place of a CMB. If a creature is dragged into a maw of chaos, the area erupts in a surge of chaotic energy and the creature takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level. Only one such eruption can occur per round."
