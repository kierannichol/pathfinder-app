›You absorb the next object your hand touches into your body. If you are already holding an object, you can attempt to absorb it; otherwise, you may touch an object as a standard action separate from casting the spell. You can absorb any nonmagical, nonliving object weighing no more than 1 pound per caster level. A container and its contents count as a single object. Objects in the possession of another creature receive a Fortitude saving throw to prevent absorption. You may continue to attempt to absorb objects until one is absorbed.
