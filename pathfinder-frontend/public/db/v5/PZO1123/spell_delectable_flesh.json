    "text": "Choose a creature within range as the object of hunger. All other creatures within 15 feet of the target that can see or smell the target\u0027s delectable flesh must succeed at a Will save or spiral into a depraved state from which they gain a single purpose--to consume as much of the target\u0027s delicious flesh as possible. The creature chosen as the target of this spell is not affected by this depravity."
