    "text": "You conjure a herd of aurochs or similar herd animal that immediately stampedes in the direction you indicate. The herd takes up a 20-foot-radius space and moves at a rate of 120 feet per round in a straight line. Any creatures caught in the herd\u0027s path take 4d6+9 points of damage that round as they are trampled beneath dozens of animals\u0027 hooves. A successful Reflex save halves this damage."
