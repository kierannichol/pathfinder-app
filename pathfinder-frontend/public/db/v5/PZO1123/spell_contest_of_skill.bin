›The randomness of critical hits has long vexed certain duelists in the Aldori school who consider luck to be an unwelcome addition to duels, which they view as contests of skill rather than chance. The creature targeted by this spell is infused with magical power, altering the odds of combat to weaken lucky strikes. Critical threats made by the affected creature automatically fail to confirm. Critical threats that automatically confirm due to class features or feats, such as the fighter's weapon mastery, are unaffected by this spell.
