    "text": "You plunge the targets\u0027 minds into a veiled immersive mindscape (see page 235) of your own design. You can affect any number of creatures whose combined total Hit Dice do not exceed 30. A creature of 10 HD or fewer gets no saving throw, one of 11â€“15 HD escapes after 10 minutes per level you possess on a successful save, and a creature of 16 HD or more negates the effect on a successful save. Given time, the bodies of creatures whose minds are trapped in a microcosm can die of starvation and thirst without care. Creatures can neither escape from nor enter a microcosm, even via a mindscape door. Microcosm can be ended only by miracle or wish."
