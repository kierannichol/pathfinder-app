    "text": "If a target weapon is sheathed or slung as the spell is cast, this functions as peacebondUC, locking the target\u0027s weapon in place on its owner\u0027s body or within the weapon\u0027s sheath or holster. Anyone who then tries to draw the weapon must spend a standard action and succeed at a Strength check to do so, provoking attacks of opportunity whether the attempt succeeds or fails. The DC for Strength checks required by this spell is equal to the spell\u0027s save DC."
