    "text": "This spell allows affected creatures to hold their breath freely without negative effects or risk of suffocation. Divide the duration evenly among all creatures touched. A creature that doesn\u0027t need to breathe because of this spell is not at risk of drowning and is immune to effects that require breathing, such as inhaled poisons. This does not grant immunity to cloud or gas attacks that don\u0027t require breathing. While a creature is holding its breath, it can\u0027t speak or cast spells with a verbal component (unless it\u0027s using Silent Spell). This spell does not prevent a creature from breathing normally; it just removes the need for the creature to breathe."
