íYou levitate the target a few inches off the ground, removing solid footing and halving the target's speed. The target also takes a â€“4 penalty to CMD against bull rush, drag, and reposition attempts. A targeted creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a â€“1 penalty on attack rolls, the second â€“2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of â€“5. A full-round action spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at â€“1.
