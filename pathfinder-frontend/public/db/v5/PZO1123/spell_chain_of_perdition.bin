ÚA floating chain of force with hooks at each end appears within an unoccupied space of your choosing within range. This chain is a Medium object that has a 10-foot reach. Physical attacks cannot hit or harm the chain of perdition, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellationaffects it normally. The chain's AC against touch attacks is 10 + your Charisma modifier (sorcerer), Intelligence modifier (wizard), or Wisdom modifier (cleric).
