      "Effect": "Numerous variants of this ritual exist, though the intent is always the same: to lull the rage within a gigantic, rampaging threat. The target is usually a unique creature with a specific Perform check is required to affect it. For example, returning King Mogaru to dormancy requires a successful Perform (sing) check as part of this ritual. Other creatures\u0027 requirements are left to the GM\u0027s discretion."
