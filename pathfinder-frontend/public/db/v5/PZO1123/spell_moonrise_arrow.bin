¼You cause ammunition, including shuriken, to glow with faint silvery light. The ammunition counts as magic and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction, in addition to the properties of any other special material the ammunition has. Incorporeal undead and shapechangers take an additional 1d8 points of damage from such ammunition. The targeted ammunition sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius for 1 round after it is fired or thrown.
