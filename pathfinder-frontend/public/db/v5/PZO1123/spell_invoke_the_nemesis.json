      "Effect": "This ritual conjures forth a restless spirit or otherworldly entity to harass and sabotage a target of the caster\u0027s choice. The ritual must take place in an environment pleasing to the nemesis creature (an allip must be called in an asylum, a gremlin must be called in a clocktower or site of misfortune, etc.). The caster supplicates before a representation-- usually a statue or tapestry--of the nemesis creature, reciting a long litany of the target\u0027s real or imagined sins and how deeply the target deserves to suffer."
