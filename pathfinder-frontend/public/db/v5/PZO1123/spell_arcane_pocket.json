    "text": "With a touch, you conjure an extradimensional space inside a pouch or pocket. The pocket acts as a bag of holding, except it can hold only 10 pounds per caster level. Regardless of what is placed into the pocket, it weighs 3 pounds. Unlike a bag of holding, the pocket created by this ability cannot be overloaded or ruptured--any additional material simply spills out of the top--nor does it have any special interaction with other kinds of extradimensional spaces."
