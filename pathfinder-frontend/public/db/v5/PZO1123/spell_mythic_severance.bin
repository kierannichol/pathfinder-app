˜You restrict the target's access to its mythic power. Each time the target attempts to cast a mythic spell, expend mythic power to activate a path ability, or use any other effect that requires expending uses of mythic power, it must attempt a Will saving throw against the DC of this spell. If it fails this saving throw, the creature loses its action and the ability it was attempting to use has no effect.
