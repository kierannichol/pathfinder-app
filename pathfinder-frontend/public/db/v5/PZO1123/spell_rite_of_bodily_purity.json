    "text": "You energize your body\u0027s immune system, improving your ability to resist toxins and ailments. You gain a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws to resist diseases, drugs, and poisons. Additionally, at any time during the spell\u0027s duration, whenever you fail a saving throw to resist a disease, drug, or poison, you can expend the spell\u0027s remaining duration as an immediate action in order to reroll that saving throw. You must take the second result, even if it\u0027s worse. The +2 resistance bonus granted by the spell applies to the reroll, but after you make this reroll, the spell ends."
