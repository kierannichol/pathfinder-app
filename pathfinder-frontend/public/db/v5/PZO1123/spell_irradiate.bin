÷The spell's area of effect floods with dangerous radiation. The strength of the radiation you create depends on your caster level, as detailed below. The central irradiated area is always a 10-foot-radius spread that expands normally per the rules for radiation areas of effect (see page 55). Creatures within the area are exposed to the radiation only once; the radiation does not linger in the area. The save to resist the radiation effects is set by the spell, not the standard save DC for radiation.
