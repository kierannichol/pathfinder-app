      "Effect": "This ritual allows an established coven to induct a new member, allowing the coven to increase in size beyond the usual limit of three members. The newcomer must be a creature that could normally join a coven, such as a hag or a witch with the coven hex. Under the shadow of the new moon, the entire coven and the prospective member must prepare a bowl of rich red wine as they dance and chant, with each member adding handfuls of rare and expensive herbs. At midnight, the coven consumes the wine together. If the ritual is a success, the newcomer becomes a full member of the coven; see the details of forming a coven under the monster entry for a green hag. Every additional coven member above four increases the ritual skill check DCs by 2. No coven can be larger than 13 members."
