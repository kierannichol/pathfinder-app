×Ithuna Vardsdottir claims to have unearthed this ancient prayer in a ruined temple of Desna, though Pathfinders have reported the use of similar magic in Irrisen among the White Witches. While the name of this spell is sharesister, it works equally well on male or female creatures--both targets of the spell must simply be of the same gender.
