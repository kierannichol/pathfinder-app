òYou summon an illusory swarm of angry wasps that fills a 10-foot-diameter sphere. You can summon it so that it shares an area with other creatures, and you can move it up to 40 feet each round as a move action. Creatures caught inside the swarm's area of effect cannot use skills that require patience or concentration. Additionally, spellcasters within the area must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 20 + level of spell to be cast) in order to cast spells. On a failed caster level check, the spell is lost. While the buzzing is unpleasant, it is not so loud as to drown out other noises or make communication difficult.
