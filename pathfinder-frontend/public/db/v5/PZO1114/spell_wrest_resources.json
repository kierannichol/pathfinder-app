      "Effect": "The ritual teleports a specific natural resource from the ritual\u0027s area and transports it adjacent to the primary caster. The natural resource is the same as the material component used in the ritual (for example, using 500 gp of gold as a material component causes the ritual to teleport all gold in the area). The area must be one the primary caster is familiar with and can clearly visualize, although he need not have line of sight or line of effect to the area at the time the ritual is performed. The sudden removal of these resources can cause the ground in the selected area to shift or collapse."
