¤You send wracking pains through the targets' bodies. Because of the pain, affected creatures take a â€“2 penalty to AC, attacks, melee damage rolls, and Reflex saving throws, and must succeed at a concentration check (DC equal to the DC of this spell) to cast spells. However, if an affected creature spends a move action screaming as loudly as possible, it can act without any other penalties for the remainder of its turn. â€œScreaming," for the purposes of this spell, includes any vocalization of pain or its telepathic equivalent; creatures that cannot scream (such as creatures without the natural ability to communicate or vocalize) suffer the full effect of the spell.
