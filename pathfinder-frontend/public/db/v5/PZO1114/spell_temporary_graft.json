    "text": "You temporarily graft a dismembered body part onto yourself. You must have the body part in your possession or the spell has no effect. The graft must come from a creature the same size category as you. You can have only one graft active at a time. Grafting on a new body part immediately ends the effects of the older casting and causes that body part to fall off. The effect of the graft depends on the type of body part you choose to graft to yourself, as follows."
