ºThis potent curse weighs upon the target's soul, hastening a living creature's journey to the Boneyard upon death or weakening an undead creature's animating force. A living creature that dies during the spell's duration cannot be affected by breath of life or similar effects, and the period during which attempts to restore the target to life can succeed is reduced to 1 hour/level (for raise dead), 1 day/level (for resurrection), or 10 days/level (for true resurrection). Reincarnate and similar effects work normally on a creature killed under this spell's effects.
