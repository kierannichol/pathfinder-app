ÚThis spell functions as entangle, except the plants are coated with an irritating sap that creates a painful, itching rash on creatures that touch them. Any creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened as long as it remains in the area and for 1d4 rounds afterward. This is a poison effect.
