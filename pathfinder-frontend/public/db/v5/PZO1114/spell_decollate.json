    "text": "A thin red line circles the target\u0027s neck. The target\u0027s head becomes detachable so long as she removes it willingly. While the target\u0027s head is detached, she gains DR 2/-- and immunity to decapitation effects and other effects that require their target to have a head or a particular facial feature. The target is blind so long as she has no head, but she gains blindsense to a distance of 15 feet. The target hears normally even without its head."
