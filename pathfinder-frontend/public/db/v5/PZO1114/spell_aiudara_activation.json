      "Effect": "By repairing damaged magical runes and realigning the energies based on the gate\u0027s planetary position, the caster reactivates a dormant aiudara. A reactivated gate automatically reconnects with its linked twin, acting as a two-way gate (as per the spell) between the locations. The caster knows the gate\u0027s password--which might be anything from an Elven phrase to a song\u0027s refrain to a spell--from the research required to learn this ritual. All other creatures who use this gate must also know the password to access the gate\u0027s magic after it has been reactivated."
