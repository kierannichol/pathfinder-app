    "text": "You scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface, similar to the way in which a symbol spell is cast. When inscribed, the rune of Jandelay manifests as a shape that evokes the face of a monstrous elephantine creature--the legendary Oliphant of Jandelay itself. The rune is 5 feet across when created, and the surface on which it is to be inscribed must be large enough to bear it."
