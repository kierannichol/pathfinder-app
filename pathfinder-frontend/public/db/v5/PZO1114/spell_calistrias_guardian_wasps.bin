¬You summon a wasp swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 275) that builds a 10-foot-by-10-foot nest in the place you designate--typically under the eaves of a house, amid the rafters of a tavern, or in another obscured place. The wasp swarm takes the spell's casting time to build its nest; if the swarm is disrupted in any way (such as by being attacked) before you finish casting this spell, the wasps disappear and the spell fizzles.
