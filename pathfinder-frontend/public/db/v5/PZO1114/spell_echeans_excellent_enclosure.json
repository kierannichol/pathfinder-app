    "text": "You call into being around you an invisible barrier of force within which magic cannot persist. Within the area of the spell, effects are suppressed and creatures are affected as by antimagic field. An immobile sphere of impenetrable force surrounds the field, equivalent in all ways to a spherical wall of force, including its immunity to dispel magic and vulnerability to a sphere of annihilation or rod of cancellation. The barrier has hardness 40 and 20 hit points per caster level, and can be damaged by both mundane attacks and spells cast from outside the field. If the bubble of force is destroyed, the spell\u0027s duration ends."
