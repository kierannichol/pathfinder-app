      "Effect": "This ritual must be cast at dawn beneath the open sky on the Material Plane. The ritual must be performed at a site of Sarenite worship (such as a dervish house, shrine, or temple of Sarenrae) that has hosted active worship services for at least 52 consecutive weeks. The primary caster holds aloft the rose-gold scimitar, and the secondary casters stand around him and begin spinning in place. The primary caster recites 23 verses from Sarenrae\u0027s holy text, The Birth of Light and Truth, taking a sip from the potion of cat\u0027s grace between each stanza. After the last verse is completed, the secondary casters whirl around the primary caster, each anointing the rose-gold scimitar with blessed sunflower seed oil. Upon the successful completion of the ritual, all the casters are filled with the spirits of dervish heroes, becoming faster, stronger, tougher, and more skilled in combat. Each caster gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution; a +2 dodge bonus to AC; and a +2 sacred bonus on all saving throws. The caster\u0027s base attack bonus is equal his character level (which may give the caster multiple attacks). If the caster\u0027s base attack bonus is already equal to his character level, he gains one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus when making a full-attack action. In addition, any scimitar wielded by a caster is treated as if it has the keen weapon special ability. In exchange, each caster temporarily loses his ability to cast spells, save for those from the conjuration (healing) school."
