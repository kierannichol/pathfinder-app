    "text": "You compel the target to beg for forgiveness. On a failed save, the target cowers with fear. On a successful save, it is shaken for 1 round. Each round on its turn, a cowering subject may attempt a new save to end the effect. A creature who worships the same god as you takes a â€“2 penalty on its saving throw."
