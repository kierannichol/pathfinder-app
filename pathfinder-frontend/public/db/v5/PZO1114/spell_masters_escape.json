    "text": "You create an extradimensional link between yourself and one summoned creature you control that allows you to switch places. After casting master\u0027s escape, you can teleport to your summoned creature\u0027s space as a swift action, causing your summoned creature to teleport to your former space. If your summoned creature is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points before you can use this spell\u0027s effect, you can teleport to a space that you can see within 30 feet as an immediate action. After using either of these effects, the spell ends. A summoner can target his eidolon with this spell."
