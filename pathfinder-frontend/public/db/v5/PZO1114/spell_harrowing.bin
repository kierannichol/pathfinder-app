ÅYou use a Harrow deck to tell a fortune for yourself or someone else. If you cast harrowing on another creature, you must remain adjacent to the target for the duration of the casting time. A harrowing must describe one set of events or course of action (for example, â€œhunting down the pirate king," or â€œtraveling to Viperwall to search for a magic sword") that the target of the spell intends to undertake at some point during the spell's duration.
