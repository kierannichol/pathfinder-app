    "text": "You imbue a weapon with a faint silvery glow that dimly illuminates a 5-foot square. An affected weapon also easily bypasses the physical defenses of undead creatures, ignoring 5 points of an undead creature\u0027s damage reduction, as long as the damage reduction is not DR/epic. For example, attacks with a weapon affected by this spell completely ignore a zombie\u0027s DR 5/slashing or reduce a lich\u0027s damage reduction to DR 10/bludgeoning and magic."
