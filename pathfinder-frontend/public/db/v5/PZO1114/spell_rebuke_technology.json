If the targeted creature fails to resist the spell, it is rendered inert and unusable (or unconscious in the case of creatures) for the spell\u0027s duration. A creature can attempt a new Fortitude saving throw to end the effect early at the end of its turn after the first full round it is affected by this spell."
