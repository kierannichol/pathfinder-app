    "text": "You create an area that draws out a creature\u0027s emotion aura (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 198). Creatures within this area constantly glow with colors that represent their current overall emotional state and continue to do so for 1d4 rounds after leaving the area. This glow is clearly visible to any creature that can see the creature. Emotionless creatures or creatures unaffected by this spell glow with a dull purple hue while within the area."
