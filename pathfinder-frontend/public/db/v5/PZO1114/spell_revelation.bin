†You gain a brief understanding of the workings of a single puzzle, device, or trap, gaining an insight bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +10) on checks to disable, manipulate or solve the object in question. Your insight is ineffable; you are unable to communicate your understanding to others. At the GM's option, this spell may instead give you a clue or other piece of useful information. In this case you may communicate the clue to others and retain knowledge of it after the spell's duration has expired.
