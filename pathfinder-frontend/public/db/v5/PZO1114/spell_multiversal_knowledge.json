      "Effect": "The ritual allows the primary caster to tap into the multiversal connection shared by all aeons. The primary caster weaves complicated occult patterns around herself with the silver wire; if secondary casters are involved in the ritual, they stand around the primary caster and the primary caster wraps the silver wire around their outstretched limbs to form these patterns. If successfully performed, the primary caster can utilize the envisaging ability as though she were an aeon to communicate with other creatures, can attempt Knowledge checks untrained, and gains an enhancement bonus on Knowledge checks equal to half her character level or twice the number of secondary casters, whichever is greater. Although the primary caster can communicate with aeons themselves across vast gulfs of distance and even planar boundaries, they are unlikely to respond except to profess amusement or mild annoyance."
