    "text": "You call upon the restless souls of those who died at sea. This spell can be cast only on an area of deep water. When a creature enters the area, the haunt manifests, automatically grabbing the creature and dragging it under the water on initiative count 10. Each round, the haunt deals 1d6 points of nonlethal damage as it drags its victim down 10 feet; a successful DC 15 Swim check reduces the descent to 5 feet and negates the nonlethal damage. Each round in the haunt\u0027s clutches reduces the duration the victim can hold her breath by 2 rounds (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 445). A victim can make a single move or standard action each round while in the haunt\u0027s grasp if she succeeds at a Will save; on a failed save, she can only struggle helplessly against the haunt. A victim cannot use her actions to swim toward the surface while the haunt is active. If the haunt reaches the bottom of its body of water, it pounds its victim against the bottom, dealing 2d6 points of nonlethal damage per round to the victim and reducing the duration the victim can hold her breath by an additional round. This continues until either the haunt is neutralized (in which case the victim must still swim to the surface) or the victim drowns."
