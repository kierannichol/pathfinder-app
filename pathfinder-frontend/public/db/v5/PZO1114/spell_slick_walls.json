    "text": "You coat all walls and ceilings within the spell\u0027s area with a slick substance. The DC of all Climb checks for the affected surfaces increases by twice your caster level (maximum +20). Creatures cannot take 10 on Climb checks while scaling the affected surfaces, even if they have a climb speed or other ability that would normally allow taking 10. This spell has no effect on magical walls or surfaces, such as the sides of a hole created with create pitAPG."
