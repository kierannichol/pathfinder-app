    "text": "You cause a weapon to exude a palpable aura of divine fury. While wielding this weapon, a creature gains a +2 morale bonus on Intimidate checks. When an attack made using the targeted weapon hits, the wielder can spend a free action to discharge the effect to inflict agony on the creature the weapon hit. If that creature has spell resistance, it applies against this effect. If the creature fails a Will save, it is nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds. If it succeeds at the saving throw, the creature is instead sickened for 1 round. The sickened condition created by the instrument is a mind-affecting effect."
