    "text": "You curse the target, making it incredibly unlucky. While affected by curse of befouled fortune, the target can\u0027t receive luck bonuses or benefit from effects that grant it the ability to roll multiple times and take the higher result (like the swashbuckler\u0027s charmed life ability). The target also can\u0027t choose a die result, such as taking 10 or 20 in lieu of rolling (as per the bard\u0027s lore master ability). Finally, the first time each turn the target would succeed at an attack, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and use the worse of the two results."
