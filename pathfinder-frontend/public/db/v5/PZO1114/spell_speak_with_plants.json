    "text": "You can communicate with normal plants and plant creatures, and can ask questions of and receive answers from them. A normal plant\u0027s sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won\u0027t be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity. The spell doesn\u0027t make plant creatures any more friendly or cooperative than normal. Furthermore, wary and cunning plant creatures are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones may make inane comments. If a plant creature is friendly, it may do some favor or service for you."
