Effect—A closely guarded practice among the Linnorm Kings, this ritual descended from far more ancient traditions practiced by the Erutaki to survive at the Crown of the World. After hours of singing, woodcarving, and fire-building, the primary caster throws an iron lantern into a raging bonfire, then plucks it from the flames with a bare hand. The ritual imbues the lantern with an inextinguishable yellow flame for a single year. When hung from the prow or mast of a ship, the lantern projects a protective bubble in which the temperature never falls below 50Â° F, rain and snow never fall heavier than a light shower, winds never blow faster than strong, and the light never darkens beyond dim (though outside conditions created by extreme weather, such as ice flows or large waves, may still threaten the ship and crew). Anyone resting inside this space dries easily, and preserved food and water do not naturally spoil.
