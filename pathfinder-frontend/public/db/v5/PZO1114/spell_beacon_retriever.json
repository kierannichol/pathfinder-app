      "Effect": "The caster lights the rare incense and then scribes a complex conjuring diagram on the floor using glowing inks, then must focus on the runes to look through reality into the Abyss while reciting the methods by which a retriever can be shaped into being from raw Abyssal quintessence. If the ritual is successful, a retriever is conjured at the caster\u0027s location. The retriever is loyal to the caster but will perform only one service before it vanishes back to the Abyss. If the service takes longer to perform than a number of years equal to the primary caster\u0027s level, the retriever vanishes at the end of this duration, even if its service is not yet complete."
