    "text": "This potent curse weighs upon the target\u0027s soul, hastening a living creature\u0027s journey to the Boneyard upon death or weakening an undead creature\u0027s animating force. A living creature that dies during the spell\u0027s duration cannot be affected by breath of life or similar effects, and the period during which attempts to restore the target to life can succeed is reduced to 1 hour/level (for raise dead), 1 day/level (for resurrection), or 10 days/level (for true resurrection). Reincarnate and similar effects work normally on a creature killed under this spell\u0027s effects."
