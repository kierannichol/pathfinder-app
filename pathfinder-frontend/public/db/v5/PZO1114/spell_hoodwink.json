    "text": "You befuddle the targets\u0027 senses, preventing the targets from clearly perceiving their surroundings. Instead, hoodwinked creatures see only the roughest shapes and details and hear only muffled noises. However, targets can clearly hear verbal communication from the spell\u0027s caster. This spell does not impart understanding of the caster\u0027s language if the creature can\u0027t already understand it. Other than to hear the caster speak, targets automatically fail Perception checks with DCs greater than 5, and they are too disoriented by the spell to accurately remember the path they took while under its effects."
