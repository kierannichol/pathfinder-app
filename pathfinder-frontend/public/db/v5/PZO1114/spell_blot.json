    "text": "This spell reduces all types of writing and other recognizable symbols found on any sort of surface within range into illegible smears. It affects books, carvings on stone, or even tattoos with equal ease. It does not affect writing that is not actually on a surface, such as an illusion, projection, reflection, or anything similar. Spellbooks and magical items that contain writing (such as scrolls) gain a saving throw to resist the effects of this spell. Against magical writing created by spell effects (such as glyphs of wardingor symbols), blot instead functions as a dispel magicspell capable of targeting all such spell effects in the area. This spell has no effect on writing found on artifacts or similarly unique surfaces."
