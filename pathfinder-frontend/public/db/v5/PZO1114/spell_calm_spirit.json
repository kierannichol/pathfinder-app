    "text": "This spell temporarily calms agitated haunts and incorporeal undead such as ghosts. You have no control over the affected creatures, but calm spirit postpones hostile action by the affected spirits for the duration of the spell. Entities so affected cannot take violent actions or do anything destructive, including triggering persistent haunt abilities, though they can defend themselves. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed spirit or haunt immediately ends the effect."
