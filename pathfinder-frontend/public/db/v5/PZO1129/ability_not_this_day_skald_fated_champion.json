    "text": "At 20th level, the fated champion gains the ability to reweave the strands of fate. As an immediate action, he can expend 10 rounds of raging song to either reroll a saving throw or force an opponent to reroll an attack roll. The decision to use this ability must be made before the results of the initial roll are revealed, and the champion or his opponent must take the result of the reroll.\nThis ability replaces master skald."
