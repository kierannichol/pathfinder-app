    "text": "You take control of a creature\u0027s mind and implant deadly subconscious commands. This spell functions as dominate person, allowing you to control your subject and see through her senses, but also implants a powerful burst of psychic energy in the subject\u0027s mind. At any point during the spell\u0027s duration, you can trigger this burst as an immediate action, dealing 1d8 points of damage per caster level (Fortitude half) to the subject. If this damage is enough to reduce to target to 0 or fewer hit points, the target dies instantly."
