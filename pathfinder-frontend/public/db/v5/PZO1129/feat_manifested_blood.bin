LYou can use the power of your bloodline to surround yourself in its element.°

For a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), you gain resistance 5 to that energy type, and all creatures that attempt a natural weapon attack or an unarmed strike against you take 2 points of damage of that same energy type. If you already have resistance to that energy type, the resistance increases by 5.r
