    "text": "With a thrust of tectonic energy, you split the earth. Each creature standing in the area where the fissure opens must succeed at a Reflex saving throw to avoid falling into the rift. Those standing adjacent to the fissure when it is created must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked prone by tremors. This spell is effective only when cast on an area of dirt, earth, sand, or stone."
