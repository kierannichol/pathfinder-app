    "text": "At 2nd level, a psychic searcher gains an inspiration pool, as the investigator class ability. A psychic searcher uses her oracle level as her investigator level to determine the effects of this ability. She gains free uses of inspiration on Diplomacy, Knowledge (arcana, history, local, nobility, planes, religion), and Sense Motive skill checks without spending a use of inspiration, provided she\u0027s trained in that skill. A psychic searcher\u0027s inspiration pool refreshes each day, usually when she refreshes her spells. A psychic searcher\u0027s inspiration pool is based on her Charisma modifier, not her Intelligence modifier. Wisdom modifier, not Intelligence ."
