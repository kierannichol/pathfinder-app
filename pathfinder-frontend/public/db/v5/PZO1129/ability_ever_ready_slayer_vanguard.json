    "text": "At 7th level, a vanguard is never considered an unaware combatant and is always able to act in the surprise round. The vanguard is still flat-footed in the surprise round until he acts.\nThis ability replaces stalker.\nSlayer Talents: The following slayer talents complement the vanguard archetype: combat trick, finesse rogue, hard to fool, rogue crawl, surprise attack, terrain mastery, and weapon training."
