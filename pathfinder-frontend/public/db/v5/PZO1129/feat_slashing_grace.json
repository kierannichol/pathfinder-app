When wielding your chosen weapon one-handed, you can treat it as a one-handed piercing melee weapon for all feats and class abilities that require such a weapon (such as a swashbuckler\u0027s or a duelist\u0027s precise strike) and you can add your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to that weapon\u0027s damage. The weapon must be one appropriate for your size."
