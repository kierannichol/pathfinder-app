    "text": "At 1st level, a herald of the horn forms a powerful bond with a horn (musical instrument). This functions like an arcane bloodline sorcerer\u0027s arcane bond with an object. Like a weapon, wand, or staff, the horn must be held in one hand when the herald of the horn casts skald spells."
