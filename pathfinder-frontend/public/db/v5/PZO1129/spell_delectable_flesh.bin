’Choose a creature within range as the object of hunger. All other creatures within 15 feet of the target that can see or smell the target's delectable flesh must succeed at a Will save or spiral into a depraved state from which they gain a single purpose--to consume as much of the target's delicious flesh as possible. The creature chosen as the target of this spell is not affected by this depravity.
