¬At 10th level, a stygian slayer can transform into an inky black cloud of mist. This functions as gaseous form, except it also obscures vision as fog cloud. The slayer can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to his level. These minutes need not be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments.
This ability replaces the advanced slayer talent gained at 10th level.
Slayer Talents: The following slayer talents (and rogue talents) complement the stygian slayer archetype: bleeding attack, lasting poison, poison use*, powerful sneak, rogue crawl, slow reactions, surprise attack, and swift poison. (Those with asterisks [*] are detailed in the slayer class.)ª6
