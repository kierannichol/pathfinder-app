    "text": "You create a shimmering javelin of holy energy to hurl at an enemy as a ranged touched attack. The javelin deals 1d6 points of damage to an evil creature on a successful attack; it dissipates harmlessly against creatures of any other alignment. Each time a creature starts its turn while impaled by the javelin, it takes another 1d6 points of damage. For every 4 caster levels you have, the javelin remains in the creature for an additional round (to a maximum of 5 rounds at 18th level). While the creature remains impaled, it takes a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls and skill checks. As a move action, the creature (or another adjacent creature) can attempt to pull the javelin out (causing it to immediately disappear) with a DC 12 Strength check."
