Effect–The primary caster burns the incense in a perimeter around the witchgate to soothe the site, then peels back the dimensional fabric, finds the knotted ley lines, delicately unwinds them, steadies their energies, and closes the rift. If the ritual is successful, the ley lines return to normal, forcing the witchgate that tangled them to collapse. All casters automatically become attuned to the unraveled ley lines, gaining a +5 bonus on skill checks to cast occult rituals until they leave a 1-mile radius of the destroyed witchgate.
