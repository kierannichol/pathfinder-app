EYour spiritual guardians are more powerful than those of most others.ÿ
BenefitóWhenever you cast spiritual weapon, spiritual ally, or a similar spell that grants you a spiritual guardian, that guardian uses your shaman level instead of your base attack bonus to determine its base attack bonus, potentially granting it multiple attacks. Additionally, it gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance as well as on damage rolls.ª
