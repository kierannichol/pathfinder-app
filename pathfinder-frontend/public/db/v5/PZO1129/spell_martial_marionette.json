    "text": "When you cast this spell, you take partial control of an opponent\u0027s limbs, making it difficult for him to attack you. Any attacks made against you by the target of the spell take a â€“2 penalty due to the erratic and random motions the spell forces onto any efforts to strike you. In addition, any creature suffering the effects of this spell cannot flank you and cannot aid other opponents in flanking you."
