ŒAt 5th level, the bloodrider gains the service of a feral mount. This ability functions as the druid's animal companion, using the bloodrager's level â€“ 4 as his effective druid level. This companion must be one he is capable of riding and suitable as a mount. A Medium bloodrider can select a camel or a horse. A Small bloodrider can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or riding dog if he is at least 8th level. Whenever a bloodrider is bloodraging, this feral mount gains a +2 morale bonus to its Strength.ª0
