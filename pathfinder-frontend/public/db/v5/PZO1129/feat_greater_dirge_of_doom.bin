aThe haunting sound of sepulchral intonations chills the most stalwart adversary to its very core.é
BenefitÝThe effect of your dirge of doom lingers with a target for 2 rounds after the creature leaves the dirge's area of effect. If you use your dirge on a creature that is shaken, it becomes frightened. If you use it on a creature that is frightened, it becomes panicked. Once affected by this feat, a creature cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.ò
NormalçFear effects on a creature end immediately once it leaves the area of dirge of doom. A fear effect cannot be made more extreme by dirge of doom and can be changed only to the frightened condition by the Improved Dirge of Doom feat.ª!
