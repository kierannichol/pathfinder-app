    "text": "At 8th level, whenever a hunter uses her animal focus ability, she selects two different animal aspects for herself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to her companion instead of one. As with the companion\u0027s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day a hunter can take on an aspect.If the hunter\u0027s animal companion is dead and the hunter has applied the companion\u0027s animal aspect to herself, that aspect does not count toward her maximum of two aspects at once. The hunter can still apply only one of her dead companion\u0027s aspects to herself, not both."
