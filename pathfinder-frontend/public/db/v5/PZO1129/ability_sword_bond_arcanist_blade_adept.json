    "text": "At 1st level, a blade adept develops a bond with a blade and infuses it with arcane power. This ability works like a wizard\u0027s arcane bond ability save that the blade adept must bond to a one-handed piercing or slashing melee weapon. Additionally, the blade adept gains proficiency with the weapon if it is a simple or martial weapon."
