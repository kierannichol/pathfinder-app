²At 3rd level, a divine commander gains a teamwork feat as a bonus feat. She must meet the prerequisites for this feat. As a standard action, the divine commander can grant this feat to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear her. Allies retain the use of this bonus feat for 4 rounds, plus 1 round for every 2 levels beyond 3rd that the divine commander possesses. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of this bonus feat.
