    "text": "At 6th level, as a swift action a cutthroat can attempt a steal combat maneuver against a dead or unconscious target or a studied target he has just confirmed a critical hit against. A dead or unconscious opponent takes a â€“10 penalty to its CMD against this maneuver.\nThis ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 6th level.\nSlayer Talents: The following slayer talents (and rogue talents) complement the cutthroat archetype: fast stealth, poison use*, slowing strike*, surprise attack, and terrain mastery."
