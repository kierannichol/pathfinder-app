    "text": "The caster conjures into being one of the following drugs: aether, flayleaf, opium, pesh, scour, shiver, or zerk. (At the GM\u0027s discretion, other drugs of similar power can be included on this list.) The drug doses the caster creates with this spell must be used within 1 minute of being conjured, or they dissolve into worthless dust or evaporate into noxious but fleeting vapors, though the effects of the drug may last far longer if taken before it decays."
