    "text": "This spell functions like imbue with spell ability, except you transfer the use of your elemental assault ability to the target. The target must have an Intelligence score of at least 5 to use the ability. The imbued elemental assault functions exactly like yours, except the ability\u0027s duration is based on the target\u0027s level or Hit Dice. Once you cast this spell, you cannot use your elemental assault ability until the duration of the spell is over."
