    "text": "You tap into the awareness and consciousness of a plane with a sentient structure (Planar Adventures 60), allowing it to answer questions. A tangible manifestation of the plane (such as the ground) must be within the spell\u0027s range upon casting. You can ask the sentient plane one question per 2 caster levels. If the plane\u0027s alignment is at least one step away from yours, the plane can attempt a Will save to resist the spell. A plane typically has a +20 bonus on Will saves, and a demiplane typically has a +15 bonus on Will saves. A plane\u0027s traits can further affect these bonuses: a mildly aligned plane receives a +2 bonus, and a strongly aligned plane or a plane with the wild magic trait receives a +4 bonus on its save."
