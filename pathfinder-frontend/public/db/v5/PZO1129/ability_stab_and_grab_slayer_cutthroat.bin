At 6th level, as a swift action a cutthroat can attempt a steal combat maneuver against a dead or unconscious target or a studied target he has just confirmed a critical hit against. A dead or unconscious opponent takes a â€“10 penalty to its CMD against this maneuver.
This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 6th level.
Slayer Talents: The following slayer talents (and rogue talents) complement the cutthroat archetype: fast stealth, poison use*, slowing strike*, surprise attack, and terrain mastery.ª,*
