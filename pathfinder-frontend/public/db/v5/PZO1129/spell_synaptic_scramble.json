    "text": "You scramble the synaptic connections of your target, causing it to lose the ability to coherently communicate and to take unintended actions when it meant to perform others. The target cannot effectively communicate while under the spell\u0027s influence, and thus cannot engage in acts like speaking, attempting Bluff checks to pass secret messages, writing, or using telepathy, although the spell doesn\u0027t prevent verbalizations made for purposes other than communication, such as command words or the verbal component of spellcasting."
