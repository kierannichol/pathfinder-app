•At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and grant it a chaotic blessing. For 1 minute, this weapon glows yellow or purple and deals an additional 1d6 points of damage against lawful creatures. During this time, itâ€™s treated as chaotic for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This blessingâ€™s additional damage doesnâ€™t stack with the additional damage from the anarchic weapon special ability.
