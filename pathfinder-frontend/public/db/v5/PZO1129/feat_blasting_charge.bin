[You funnel the power of your bloodrage into a strike capable of erupting with arcane power.Ð
BenefitÄWhile you are bloodraging, at the end of a charge you can expend a bloodrager spell slot as a swift action to imbue your charge attack with extra power. You deal an additional 1d6 points of damage per level of the spell slot expended. This extra damage is force damage, and it's not multiplied in the case of a critical hit.ª
