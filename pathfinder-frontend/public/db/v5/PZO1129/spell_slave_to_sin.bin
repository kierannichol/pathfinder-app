çThis spell allows you to reach into an evil creature's mind to expose and exploit its susceptibility to whichever of the seven so-called ‚Äúdeadly sins" it is most susceptible to. The targeted creature must succeed at a Will save or it is overwhelmed with an inability to repress urges to indulge in whatever sin most closely mirrors its personality, and a glowing rune appears upon the creature's body (usually the brow), identifying the sin. (The GM adjudicates which rune manifests on the creature's body, as appropriate.)
