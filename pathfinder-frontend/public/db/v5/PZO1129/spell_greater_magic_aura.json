    "text": "If cast on an object, this spell functions as magic aura, except that if you have identified the unique spellcasting signatures of a specific individual with greater detect magic or a similar spell, you can make the magic aura appear to have been created by that individual. Alternatively, you can simply obscure all identifiers, making it more difficult to determine who cast the spell. In either case, if the object is the subject of a greater detect magic spell, any Spellcraft check made to identify the unique spellcasting identifiers of the aura automatically produce the result you chose unless the observer disbelieves the spell with a successful Will save (as with magic aura, however, detect spells don\u0027t grant a save to disbelieve)."
