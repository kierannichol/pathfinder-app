ÚWhen a spirit whisperer chooses an arcane bond, he must choose the familiar arcane bond, and the familiar gains the spirit animal ability of his selected spirit (see spirit link, below). The spirit whisperer does not need a spellbook, but instead stores and prepares his spell by communing with the familiar as the witch's familiar class feature.ª1/
