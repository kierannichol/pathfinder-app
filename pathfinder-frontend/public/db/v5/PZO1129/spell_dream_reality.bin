òYou cause the target to perceive the world as if in a dream. When the spell ends, the target forgets all identifying details of events that transpired while the spell lasted. The memories were not taken from it; rather, its mind never recorded the memories as real in the first place. If modify memory is cast upon it before the spell ends, the target remembers these events. A target under the effect of lullaby before this spell is cast applies its penalty to the saving throw against this spell.
