    "text": "At 4th level, whenever a rageshaper gains a natural attack through the use of a polymorph spell, he can increase the damage done by that attack by one die. If the spell grants multiple natural attacks, the rageshaper must choose one kind of natural attack for the ability to enhance. At 9th level, if the rageshaper\u0027s altered form grants him a new mode of movement, that movement\u0027s base speed increases by 10 feet. This is an enhancement bonus. If the rageshaper\u0027s bloodrage powers already grant natural attacks or alternate modes of movement, then the bonuses granted by bestial aspect also apply to these bloodrage powers."
