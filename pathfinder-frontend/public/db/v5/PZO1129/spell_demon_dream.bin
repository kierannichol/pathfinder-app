´When the target of demon dream is a worshiper of a demon lord or Lamashtu, the caster has the option of making the spell function instead as a dream spell. Otherwise, this spell functions like nightmare (see Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 316), save that the subject matter of the dream always involves demons. Upon waking from a demon dream, the victim must make a saving throw against the spell to resist taking 1d6 points of Wisdom drain from the unsettling, madness- inducing dream--this is in addition to the damage and fatigue normally caused by the nightmare.
