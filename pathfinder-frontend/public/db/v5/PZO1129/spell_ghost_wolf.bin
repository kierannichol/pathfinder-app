ÑThis spell conjures a Large, quasi-real, wolflike creature made of roiling black smoke. It functions as phantom steed, except as noted above. In addition, the creature radiates an aura of fear. Any creature with fewer than 6 Hit Dice within 30 feet (except the ghost wolfâ€˜s rider) must make a Will save or become shaken for 1d4 rounds (this is a mind-affecting fear effect). A creature that makes its Will save is unaffected by the steed's fear aura for 24 hours.
