If you cast harrowing on another creature, you must remain adjacent to the target for the duration of the casting time. A harrowing must describe one set of events or course of action (for example, “hunting down the pirate king,\" or “traveling to Viperwall to search for a magic sword\") that the target of the spell intends to undertake at some point during the spell\u0027s duration."
