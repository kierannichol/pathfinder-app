°A spell specialist can reduce the radius of a spread or burst effect or shorten the length of a cone. All changes must occur in 5-foot increments, to a minimum of 5 feet. Alternatively, the spell specialist can change the area of effect of a cone spell to a line with a length equal to the spell's range.ª1/
