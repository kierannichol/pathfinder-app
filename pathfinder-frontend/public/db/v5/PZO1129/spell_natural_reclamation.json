      "Effect": "This ritual can be cast only during the vernal equinox. The primary caster binds the person to be sacrificed in magically treated ivy and then places the settlement model on top of the person\u0027s body. Next, the primary caster slits the sacrifice\u0027s throat with a knife and then smears the blood all over the ivy. As the casters chant, the ivy grows and destroys the model of the settlement. If the ritual succeeds, tendrils of the ivy lash out at all of the casters before diving into the ground and reemerging throughout the ritual\u0027s area of effect. Vines and other plants appropriate to the region grow over all buildings and structures in the area, dealing damage to them at a rate of 3 hit points every 10 minutes, ignoring their hardness. A typical wooden building can withstand 100 points of damage before being wrecked, while a typical stone building can withstand 150 points of damage before its complete destruction. The plants do not deal damage to creatures directly, though creatures that remain in a building may be injured if it collapses. Heavily fortified stone structures, such as castles and city walls, are sturdy enough to withstand this ritual. Any magical building or room receives a Fortitude save to repel the plants."
