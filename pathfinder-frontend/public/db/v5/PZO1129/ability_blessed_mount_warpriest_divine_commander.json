    "text": "At 6th level, a divine commander\u0027s mount becomes a creature blessed by his deity. The divine commander\u0027s mount gains either the celestial, entropic, fiendish, or resolute template, matching the alignment of the warpriest\u0027s deity (celestial for good, entropic for chaotic, fiendish for evil, and resolute for lawful). If the deity matches more than one alignment, the divine commander can select which of the two templates the mount receives. Once the type of template is selected, it cannot be changed.\nIf the divine commander\u0027s deity is neutral with no other alignment components, the mount receives spell resistance equal to the divine commander\u0027s level + 5, as well as resistance 10 against two types of energy damage of the divine commander\u0027s choice.\nIf a divine commander\u0027s mount dies and the divine commander finds another mount, the new mount becomes a blessed mount the next time the divine commander gains a level."
