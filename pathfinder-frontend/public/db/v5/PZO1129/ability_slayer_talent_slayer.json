Unless otherwise noted, a slayer cannot select an individual talent more than once.Talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to a slayer\u0027s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made."
