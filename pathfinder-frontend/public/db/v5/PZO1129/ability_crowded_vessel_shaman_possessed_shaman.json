    "text": "At 2nd level, whenever a possessed shaman fails a saving throw against a charm or compulsion spell or effect, she can attempt a new saving throw (using the original DC) at the end of her next turn as the spirits inside her attempt to regain control. If the saving throw is successful, the charm or compulsion effect ends. If the saving throw fails, she is affected as normal for the remainder of the duration."
