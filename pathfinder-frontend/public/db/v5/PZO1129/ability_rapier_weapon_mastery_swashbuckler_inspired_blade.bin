ˆAt 20th level, when an inspired blade threatens a critical hit with a rapier, that critical hit is automatically confirmed. Furthermore, the critical threat range increases by 1 (this increase to the critical threat range stacks with the increase from rapier training, to a total threat range of 14â€“20), and the critical modifier of the weapon increases by 1 (Ã—2 becomes Ã—3, for example).ª@
