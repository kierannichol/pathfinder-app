    "text": "At 2nd level, a mountain witch can influence the attitude of mountain-dwelling animals, as the druid\u0027s wild empathy class feature but only on animals native to mountainous environments. The mountain witch uses her witch level as her druid level for this ability.\nThis ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.\nHexes: The following witch hexes complement the mountain witch archetype: beast of ill-omen, crystal sight*, lodestone*, metal curse*, stone stability*, and ward of stone*. (Those with asterisks [*] are detailed in the shaman class.)\nMajor Hexes: The following major hexes complement the mountain witch archetype: Beast Eye, hidden home, hoarfrost, and Weather Control."
