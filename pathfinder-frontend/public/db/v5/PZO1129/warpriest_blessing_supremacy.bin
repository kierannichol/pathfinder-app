ìAt 1st level, as a swift action you can target a creature within 30 feet that has the cowering, frightened, panicked, or paralyzed condition. That condition is suspended for 1 round, and the chosen creature gains the confused condition instead. The confused creature rerolls any result other than â€œattack selfâ€ or â€œattack nearest creature.â€ The round spent confused counts toward the duration of the suspended effect. At the end of the confused round, the suspended condition resumes.
