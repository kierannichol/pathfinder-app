Ø: At 1st level, when you hit a creature with a charge attack, that creature becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your bloodrager level (minimum 1). This effect does not cause an existing shaken or frightened condition (from this ability or another source) to turn into frightened or panicked. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.ª+
