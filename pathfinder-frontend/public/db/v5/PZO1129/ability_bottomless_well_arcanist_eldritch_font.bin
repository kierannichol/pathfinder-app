¬At 20th level, an eldritch font can spend 1 hour studying her spellbook to refuel herself. Doing so allows her to prepare new spells and regain points of arcane reservoir equal to 1/2 her level. She can use this ability multiple times per day, however she still only regains spell slots once per day.ª42
