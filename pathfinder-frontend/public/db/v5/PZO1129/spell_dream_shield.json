    "text": "You ward the target\u0027s mind against intrusion and influence while she is unconscious. While sleeping, the target is protected against divinations such as nondetection and gains spell resistance equal to 10 + your caster level against mind-affecting effects. In addition, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spell or effect that would possess or exercise direct mental control over her. This functions in all respects like the second property of protection from evil but it applies regardless of the alignment of the creature or object that created the possession or mental influence effect."
