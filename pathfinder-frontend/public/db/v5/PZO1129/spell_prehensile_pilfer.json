    "text": "The target\u0027s tail moves and acts more quickly, almost with a mind of its own. When making a full-attack action, the target may use its tail to make a dirty trick or steal combat maneuver as a swift action. For the purpose of this attack, the target\u0027s tail is a natural weapon with a reach of 5 feet. This spell has no effect on creatures lacking a prehensile tail. If the target already has an extra attack from hasteor a similar effect, this spell only allows the tail to make dirty trick and steal combat maneuvers, but does not grant an extra attack."
