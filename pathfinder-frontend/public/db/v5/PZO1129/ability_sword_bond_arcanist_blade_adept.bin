Sword Bondclass:arcanist#blade_adeptarchetype_featureclass_feature¢Ð
ÍAt 1st level, a blade adept develops a bond with a blade and infuses it with arcane power. This ability works like a wizard's arcane bond ability save that the blade adept must bond to a one-handed piercing or slashing melee weapon. Additionally, the blade adept gains proficiency with the weapon if it is a simple or martial weapon.ª.
