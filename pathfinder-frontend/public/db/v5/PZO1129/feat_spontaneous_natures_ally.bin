KInstead of casting a cure spell, you can instead cast summon nature's ally.ñ
BenefitåYou can â€œlose" a prepared spell in order to cast any summon nature's ally spell of the same level or lower, instead of casting a cure spell or an inflict spell as you normally would. For the purpose of this feat only, the summon nature's ally spells of the appropriate spell levels count as being on your spell list at the same spell level as for a druid.ª#!
