ËAt 1st level, you can fill a living creature with lethargy by hitting it with a melee touch attack, causing it to become staggered for 1 round. If the target is already staggered, it falls asleep for 1 round instead. An undead creature thatâ€™s touched is staggered for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).
