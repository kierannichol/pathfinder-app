ÞYou make the affected subjects ready for battle despite their fear. If a target is suffering from a fear effect of any kind, he gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, and a â€“2 penalty to AC. If the subject is frightened, he remains in place and gains the confused condition for the remainder of the fear effect, except he treats all results of â€œattack self " as â€œdo nothing" and treats â€œattack nearest creature" as â€œact normally." If the subject is panicked, he remains in place and gains the confused condition for the duration of the fear effect.
