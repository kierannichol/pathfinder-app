XYou can absorb the magic in your force spells to give you a concentrated burst of speed.ð
BenefitäAs a swift action, you can sacrifice a prepared arcane force spell (or if you are a spontaneous caster, a spell slot of the same level as an arcane force spell you know) to give yourself an enhancement bonus to speed. The bonus gained is equal to 10 feet Ã— the level of the spell sacrificed. The bonus applies to all forms of movement, and it lasts 1 round. If you charge while this bonus is in effect, you do not take the normal â€“2 penalty to AC until the start of your next turn.ª
