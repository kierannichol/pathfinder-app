¾At 11th level, a herald of the horn can use his horn to create a devastating shock wave of energy. Once per day, he can sound a note on the horn that functions like a horn of blasting (DC = 10 + 1/2 the herald of the horn's level + his Charisma bonus). At 17th level, the herald of the horn can use this ability twice per day and it functions like a greater horn of blasting. Unlike an actual horn of blasting, this ability does not carry the risk of destroying the horn.
This ability replaces the second and third daily uses of spell kenning gained at 11th and 17th levels.ª7
