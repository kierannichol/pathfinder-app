PBy forging a temporary bond with a spirit, you gain access to an unfamiliar hex.¨
Benefit†Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes communing with a shaman spirit of your choice. When you do, you gain the temporary use of one hex from its list of hexes. This hex is added to your list of available hexes for the next hour, after which you immediately lose all benefits of that hex.™
