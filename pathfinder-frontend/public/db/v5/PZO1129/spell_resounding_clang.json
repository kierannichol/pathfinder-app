    "text": "You create a loud, resonating clangor that causes metallic objects to vibrate wildly. Affected creatures wielding metal weapons take a –1 penalty on attack rolls, while creatures using metallic tools take a –1 penalty on associated skill checks. Creatures wearing metal armor increase the armor check penalty of their armor by 1. These penalties increase by 1 at 8th caster level and every 4 caster levels thereafter (to a maximum of –4 at 16th level)."
