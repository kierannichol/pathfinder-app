    "text": "You trade places with the other target, teleporting as if you were both affected by dimension door. Both you and the other target arrive in a square you choose in the other\u0027s former space. If the targets are different sizes, they must appear in locations that cover previously occupied squares. As with dimension door, after casting this spell, you can\u0027t take any other actions until your next turn, and the other target is staggered until the end of its next turn due to the transposition."
