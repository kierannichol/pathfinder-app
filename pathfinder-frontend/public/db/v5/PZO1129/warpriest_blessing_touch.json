    "text": "At 10th level, you can make a melee touch attack against an opponent to deliver grim suffering. If you succeed, you inflict 1 temporary negative level on the target for 1 minute. Alternatively, you can activate this ability as a swift action upon hitting an opponent with a melee attack. These temporary negative levels stack. You gain no benefit from imposing these negative levels (such as the temporary hit points undead gain from enervation)."
