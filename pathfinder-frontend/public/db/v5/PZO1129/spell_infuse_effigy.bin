 This spell infuses an effigy with a powerful curse that targets a specific type of creature associated in some way with the effigy itself. When you cast this spell, it remains in effect until it is discharged. Once you cast infuse effigy, you cannot prepare a new 4th-level spell to replace it or cast another spell with its spell slot until you dismiss the infuse effigy spell or until it is discharged against a foe. If the number of 4th-level spells that you can cast decreases, and that number drops below your current number of infuse effigyspells, the more recently cast infuse effigyspells in excess of the number of 4th-level spells you can now cast are dispelled.
