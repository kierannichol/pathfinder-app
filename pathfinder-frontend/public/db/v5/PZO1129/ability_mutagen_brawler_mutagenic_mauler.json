    "text": "At 1st level, a mutagenic mauler discovers how to create a mutagen that she can imbibe in order to heighten her physical prowess, though at the cost of her personality. This functions as an alchemist\u0027s mutagen and uses the brawler\u0027s class level as her alchemist level for this ability (alchemist levels stack with brawler levels for determining the effect of this ability). A mutagenic mauler counts as an alchemist for the purpose of imbibing a mutagen prepared by someone else.\nAt 6th level, a mutagenic mauler gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls when she attacks in melee while in her mutagenic form. This bonus increases to +3 at 11th level, and to +4 at 16th level. At 10th level, a mutagenic mauler learns one of the following alchemist discoveries: feral mutagen or infuse mutagen, preserve organs, spontaneous healing. At 12th level, the mutagenic mauler learns the greater mutagen discovery."
