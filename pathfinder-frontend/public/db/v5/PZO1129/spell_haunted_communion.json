      "Effect": "This ritual must be performed within 60 feet of a haunt. The primary caster rings the silver bell using an object associated with the haunt\u0027s origin or source of power. Once this is done, the primary caster draws an intricate circle adorned with occult symbols around a plate bearing the small, salted pastry."
