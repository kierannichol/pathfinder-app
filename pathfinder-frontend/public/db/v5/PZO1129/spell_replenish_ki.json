    "text": "You attune the target\u0027s internal store of supernatural energy to the cosmos, replenishing its ki pool. If you are the target, you regain 2 ki points. If another creature is the target, it regains 1 ki point. This does not allow the target to exceed its ki pool\u0027s maximum. This spell has no effect if the target does not have a ki pool."
