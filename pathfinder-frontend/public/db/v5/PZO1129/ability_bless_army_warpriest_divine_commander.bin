¦At 15th level, a divine commander can raise her holy symbol high and give a blessing to the army she is leading. The divine commander's army gains a +1 bonus to the army's OM and DV. This is a sacred bonus if the warpriest is good-aligned or able to spontaneously cast cure spells, and it is a profane bonus if the warpriest is evil-aligned or able to spontaneously cast inflict spells. Using this ability requires the divine commander to expend two uses of her fervor ability. This bonus lasts for 1 battle, and it must be performed during the tactics phase of the battle. If this is performed when a mass combat is not imminent, the fervor is spent without granting any bonus.ª4
