    "text": "You polymorph your target to look like an older version of itself. You select how much older (for example, “10 years older\" or “as an adult\"). You can\u0027t otherwise change the target\u0027s appearance other than those details directly associated with aging (for example, a target\u0027s hair might turn gray or the target might develop liver spots). This spell allows children of creatures that are Medium or smaller when fully grown to grow one size category to the normal, adult size of that type of creature, but otherwise the selected age increase doesn\u0027t alter the creature\u0027s size. A change in size doesn\u0027t alter the target\u0027s ability scores. This spell doesn\u0027t affect or cause any age-based modifications to ability scores or other age-related effects like dragon age categories or natural metamorphoses."
