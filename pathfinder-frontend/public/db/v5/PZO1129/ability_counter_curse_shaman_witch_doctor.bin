×At 8th level, the witch doctor can choose to lose any prepared spirit magic spell that is 3rd level or higher in order to spontaneously cast dispel magic or remove curse. This ability can only target a spell effect that is on an ally (including herself ). If she forfeits a spirit magic spell higher than 3rd level, she gains a +2 sacred bonus on her caster level check to dispel the spell or to remove the curse for every spell level higher than 3rd that she sacrifices.ª0
