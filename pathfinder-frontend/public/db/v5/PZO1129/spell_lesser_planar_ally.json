    "text": "By casting this spell, you request your deity to send you an outsider (of 6 HD or less) of the deity\u0027s choice. If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature\u0027s name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway)."
