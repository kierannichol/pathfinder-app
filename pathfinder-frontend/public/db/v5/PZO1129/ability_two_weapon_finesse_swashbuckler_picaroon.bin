¤A picaroon gains the benefits of the Weapon Finesse feat with light or one-handed piercing melee weapons. She also gains the effects of the Two-Weapon Fighting feat as long as she is wielding a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon in one hand and one-handed firearm in the other hand. This ability counts as having both the Weapon Finesse and Two-Weapon Fighting feats for the purposes of meeting feat requirements.ª7
