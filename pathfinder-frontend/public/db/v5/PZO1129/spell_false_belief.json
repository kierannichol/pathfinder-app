    "text": "You temporarily alter the target\u0027s memory (similar to modify memory) to eliminate, change, or implant a memory of up to 1 hour in length. When the duration of this expires, the target\u0027s real memory returns, and the false memory fades to little more than a vague outline, like a dream. This false memory seems true to the target, so effects that detect lies or force the target to speak the truth (as the subject understands it) don\u0027t detect the falsehood."
