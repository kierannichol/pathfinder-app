      "Effect": "By reciting false litanies associated with the various deities represented among the holy symbol foci, the primary caster shakes the unseen spiritual pillars of the mortal world. This ritual has no visible effect to mortal eyes, but it creates a powerful rending cut in the world of spirits. By successfully completing this ritual, the caster can achieve one of two goals: severing a kami from its ward, or untethering a bound companion."
