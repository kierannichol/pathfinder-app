šStarting at 1st level, the naturalist can cast summon nature's ally I as a spell like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. He can only use this ability to summon creatures of the animal, magical beast, or vermin type. This ability otherwise functions as the summon monster I class feature (increasing in level as the naturalist goes up in level and with the same restrictions).ª.,
