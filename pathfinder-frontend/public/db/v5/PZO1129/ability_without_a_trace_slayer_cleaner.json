    "text": "At 4th level, a cleaner is able to study a location, conceal evidence, and hide in or extricate himself quickly from that location. Studying a location takes 1 minute for each 10-foot square. Once he has studied an area, the cleaner can attempt a Disguise check to alter evidence or a Stealth check to conceal evidence (by doing things such as cleaning up bloodstains, obscuring footprints, moving a dead body, and so on). Altering an area takes 1d3 x 10 minutes of work per 10-foot square. Anyone attempting to determine what actually happened in that area must succeed at an opposed Perception check against the result of the cleaner\u0027s Disguise or Stealth check (cleaner\u0027s choice) or accept the altered scene as truth. The cleaner gains a +4 bonus on this check, on Sleight of Hand checks to hide objects from that location on his person, and on Stealth checks to hide within or escape from that location. This lasts as long as the scene remains unaltered (except by the cleaner)."
