    "text": "The wild child has learned a number of tricks to aid his allies and his animal companion, as well as to hinder his opponents.\nAt 5th level and every 6 levels thereafter, the wild child learns one hunter\u0027s trick. He cannot choose any tricks that rely on ranged attacks. The wild child can use these tricks a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his brawler level + his Constitution modifier. This ability otherwise follows the rules of the hunter\u0027s tricks ability, including all action costs."
