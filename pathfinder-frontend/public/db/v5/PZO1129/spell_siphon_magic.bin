¨This spell attempts to transfer a magical effect from a creature you touch to yourself. When you touch the creature, siphon magicattempts to end one ongoing spell that has been cast on that creature, as if via a targeted dispel magic. If you know the specific spell effect you wish to target, you can name that spell effect to target that specific spell; otherwise siphon magic begins with the highest-level spell in effect and works its way down through all spells affecting the target until it dispels one or runs out of effects, as per dispel magic.
