    "text": "You alter the area\u0027s terrain and climate to a new terrain and climate type appropriate to the planet or plane. For example, you might transform a desert to plains. To cast this spell, you must expend 10 uses of mythic power along with the material cost. This magically alters the area\u0027s climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn\u0027t affect creatures or the configuration of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but doesn\u0027t flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment."
