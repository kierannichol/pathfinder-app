ëAt 1st level, the hooded champion gains the swashbuckler's panache class feature. He regains panache through critical hits and killing blows when using a bow of any kind, rather than when using a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon. If the hooded champion has this ability and the panache ability from another class or archetype, the panache points from the two sources do not stack, but the hooded champion regains panache in any way either class feature allows him to. For example, a character with a Charisma score of 16 who has both the hooded champion's and the swashbuckler's panache has a base of 3 panache points, and regains panache from critical hits and killing blows from both bows and light or one-handed piercing melee weapons.ª,*
