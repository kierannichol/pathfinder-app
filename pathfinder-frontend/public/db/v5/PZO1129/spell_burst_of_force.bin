ÃWith a burst of telekinetic force, you deal 1d6 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 15d6 points of damage) to all other creatures in the affected area. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage taken by half. A creature that fails its Fortitude save must also succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked prone.
