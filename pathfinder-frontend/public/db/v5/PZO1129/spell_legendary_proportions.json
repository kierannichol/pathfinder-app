    "text": "You call upon the primordial power of ancient megafauna to boost the size of your target. Because of its connection to living creatures of the distant past, the spell does not function on outsiders, undead, and summoned creatures. Your target grows to legendary proportions, increasing in size by one category. The creature\u0027s height doubles and its weight increases by a factor of 8. The target gains a +6 size bonus to its Strength score and a +4 size bonus to its Constitution score. It gains a +6 size bonus to its natural armor, and DR 10/adamantine. Its carrying capacity changes to reflect its new size. The creature\u0027s equipment and weapons, if any, also increase in size. Any enlarged item that leaves the creature\u0027s possession returns to its original size (though thrown weapons and ammunition deal damage at their enlarged size before returning to their true proportions)."
