    "text": ": At 20th level, you gain immunity to cold, nonlethal damage, paralysis, and sleep. The DR from your damage reduction ability increases to 8. Unintelligent undead don\u0027t notice you unless you attack them. You gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws made against spells and spell-like abilities cast by undead. You have these benefits constantly, even while not bloodraging."
