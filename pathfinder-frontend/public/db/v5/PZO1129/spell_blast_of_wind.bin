äWith a spiraling gesture of your hand and a forceful exhalation, you create a brief but fierce (90 mph) blast of wind. This spell functions as gust of wind, except all creatures within the area are treated as though they were one size category smaller for the purpose of determining how the spell affects them. For every 4 caster levels beyond 7th, creatures in the area are treated as an additional size category smaller (to a maximum of three size categories smaller at 15th level).
