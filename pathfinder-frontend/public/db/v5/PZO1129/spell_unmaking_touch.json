      "Effect": "The primary caster juggles the chaos emerald back and forth between his hands, under his clothing, and between any secondary casters involved in the ritual. As the ritual progresses, the primary caster\u0027s actions with the chaos emerald become increasingly improbable (putting it into his mouth and pulling it out of his ear, for example, or placing it into the cupped hands of one secondary caster and removing it from the cupped hands of a different secondary caster). If the ritual is successful, the chaos emerald disappears entirely, and the primary caster gains the ability to inflict warpwaves like a protean for the ritual\u0027s duration. The primary caster can inflict a warpwave on a creature within 100 feet as a standard action. The target can negate the effects of the warpwave with a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + half the primary caster\u0027s character level + the primary caster\u0027s Charisma modifier). When the duration expires, the chaos emerald reappears in the primary caster\u0027s possession--usually in a hidden place, such as the bottom of a backpack or inside a hat."
