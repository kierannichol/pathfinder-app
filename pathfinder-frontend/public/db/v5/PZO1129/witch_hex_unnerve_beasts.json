      "Effect": "The target becomes offensive to animals (Will negates). Animals become distraught and aggressive in the victim\u0027s presence--horses buck, dogs snap and bark, bulls charge, and so on. The hex lasts a number of hours equal to the witch\u0027s Intelligence modifier. A creature that saves against the hex cannot be affected by the hex for 1 day. The reaction of the animals is a mind-affecting charm effect, but the hex on the target is not."
