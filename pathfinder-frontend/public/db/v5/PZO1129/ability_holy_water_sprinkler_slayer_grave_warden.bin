ØAt 2nd level, a grave warden can draw a flask of holy water as if it were a weapon (and can thus the Quick Draw feat to draw flasks of holy water). As a swift action, he can open a flask of holy water and pour it onto a held or adjacent melee weapon. If the weapon successfully hits an undead creature before the end of the grave warden's next turn, the undead takes damage as if it took a direct hit from the holy water, in addition to the damage from the weapon, if any.ª7
