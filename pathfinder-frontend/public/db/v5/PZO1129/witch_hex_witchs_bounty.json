      "Effect": "Each day at dawn, this blessed bush grows a number of goodberries equal to twice her witch level. Berries on the tree remain until they are picked, but the tree can never manifest a number of berries greater than twice her level at one time. The witch may only have one witch\u0027s bounty active at a time, but can shift her blessing to a new plant with a ritual requiring 1 hour."
