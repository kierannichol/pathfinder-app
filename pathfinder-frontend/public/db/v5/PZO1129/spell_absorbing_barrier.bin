ÒYou ward all creatures and objects in the area from ranged weapons. The spell's area of effect is often a sphere, although you can shape it to be smaller than the maximum area or to exclude certain adjacent areas or objects (for example, if you are warding a specific structure, or if you are roughly warding the front lines of a battlefield). This spell's area is also up to 40 feet in height, so flying creatures benefit as long as they are in this area of effect.
