    "text": "While protected by fastidiousness, your person and your equipment stay clean and dry. Dust and moisture slough off immediately; even when you are completely soiled, your appearance reverts to a pristine state over the course of 1 minute. While this spell offers no protection against most attacks, staying constantly sanitary grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on Fortitude saving throws against inhaled and ingested diseases."
