    "text": "You curse one living creature with a chance of instant and unexpected death. When you cast this spell, your hand seethes with eerie gray fire. You must succeed at a melee touch attack to touch the target, at which time the fire buries itself within the target\u0027s body and disappears. On the round you touch the creature and once per minute thereafter, roll 1d100. On a result of 01–05, the spell is triggered and the creature takes 8d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level; the creature can attempt a saving throw to reduce the damage to 2d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level. On a result of 06–100, nothing happens."
