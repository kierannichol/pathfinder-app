    "text": "You transform the contents of a normal egg into a single dose of small centipede poison (injury; saveDC 11; frequency1/round for 4 rounds; effect1 Dex; cure1 save). The poison reverts to a normal egg at the end of the spell\u0027s duration (the reverted egg substance is harmless unless the poisoned creature is vulnerable to eggs). The egg may be raw or cooked but must be whole and not empty when you cast the spell. When applying the poisoned egg\u0027s contents to a weapon, the wielder has no chance of poisoning herself, as though she had the poison use class feature."
