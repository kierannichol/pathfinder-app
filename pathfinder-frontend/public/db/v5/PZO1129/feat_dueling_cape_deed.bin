CYou can use a simple cape to guard yourself and confound your foes.Ä
Benefit¸As a move action, you can wrap a cape that you're wearing around your arm (removing it if necessary), and treat it as a buckler. If you are using the cape in this way, and an opponent misses you with a melee attack, as an immediate action you can spend 1 panache point to release your cape from your arm and entangle your foe in it. The foe can free it by using a full-round action to escape or by destroying the cape; a typical cape has hardness 1 and 3 hit points. You can use this feat with items similar in shape and weight to a cape, such as a cloak or a curtain.ª
