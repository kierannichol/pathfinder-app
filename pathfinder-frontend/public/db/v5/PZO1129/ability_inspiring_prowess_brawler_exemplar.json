She can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier; this increases by 1 round per brawler level thereafter. The exemplar\u0027s effective bard level for this ability is equal to her brawler level â€“ 2. At 3rd level, the exemplar can use inspire courage. At 11th level, the exemplar can use inspire greatness. At 15th level, the exemplar can use inspire heroics. Instead of the Perform skill, she activates this ability with impressive flourishes and displays of martial talent (this uses visual components).\nThis ability otherwise functions as bardic performance; feats and other effects that affect bardic performance (such as the Extra Performance feat) apply to it."
