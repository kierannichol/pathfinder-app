    "text": "You restore life to a deceased creature. You can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than 1 day per caster level. In addition, the subject\u0027s soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject\u0027s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw."
