ÁYou cast this spell in response to a specific cavalier's challenge (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Advanced Player's Guide 32), inquisitor's judgment (Advanced Player's Guide 38), or smite (such as a paladin's smite evil) declared against you by an enemy creature. It can also be cast if a creature uses a spell that causes you to qualify as the creature's favored enemy when you normally wouldn't, such as instant enemy (Advanced Player's Guide 229).
