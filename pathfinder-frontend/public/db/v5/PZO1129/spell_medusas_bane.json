    "text": "This spell causes your eyes to take on a silvery mirror-like quality, transforming your eyes into metallic-looking orbs that reflect the world you see. Your vision is in no way impaired while this spell is in effect, but you are granted immunity to gaze attacks for the spell\u0027s duration. As an immediate action, you can reflect a creature\u0027s gaze back on itself, forcing the target of the gaze attack to save against its own gaze weapon or be affected by it. This reflection bypasses the typical immunity creatures with gaze attacks have to their own race\u0027s gaze attack, but does not bypass any other resistances or immunities the creature might have. Once you choose to reflect a gaze attack in this manner, the effect of medusa\u0027s bane immediately ends."
