;Your unarmed strike brings a revelation down upon your foe.ê
BenefitÞWhen you gain this feat, choose one revelation that you can use to affect no more than one opponent. If you make a successful unarmed strike against an opponent, in addition to dealing your unarmed strike damage, you can use a swift action to deliver the effects of the chosen revelation to that opponent. Doing so provokes no attacks of opportunity.{
SpecialpYou can take this feat multiple times. Each time you take it, you apply it to a different qualifying revelation.ª
