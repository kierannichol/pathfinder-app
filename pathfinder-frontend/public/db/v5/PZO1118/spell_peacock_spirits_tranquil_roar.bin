abjuration¢œ™
EffectŽThe primary caster begins by using a peacock feather to dust a circle of crushed malachite around a building or sacred site and calls forth hushed whispers--the murmuring chastisement of the secretive Peacock Spirit--to blot out invasive magics that overhear or reveal secrets. Anyone attempting to cast a divination or enchantment spell or spell-like ability that detects thoughts or compels the truth within the area of effect, or that targets the area of effect with a remote sensing spell such as scrying, must first make a successful Will save. Failure indicates the spell is lost and the effect's caster takes 1d6+8 points of damage as the Peacock Spirit turns the invasive magic back upon her. Success indicates the effect occurs normally. A caster who successfully saves is unaffected further by the Peacock Spirit's Tranquil Roar ritual for 24 hours or until she leaves and reenter the area of effect.
