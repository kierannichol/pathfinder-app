    "text": "You reshape the substance of a willing undead creature to resemble a living, breathing creature of the same size. This is a physical change to the undead creature\u0027s bone, flesh, or incorporeal ectoplasm, adding new flesh or bone and even hair, teeth, and blood, all of which demonstrate false signs of life that mimic a living creature\u0027s breathing and other physiological processes. An incorporeal undead creature using daywalker ceases to be incorporeal for the duration of the spell, gaining a physical corpse body. Creatures interacting with the undead can attempt a Perception check (DC \u003d 30 or DC \u003d 21 + the undead\u0027s Disguise modifier, whichever is higher) to realize that the signs of life are false, and a close examination with a Heal check always reveals the truth of the dead flesh."
