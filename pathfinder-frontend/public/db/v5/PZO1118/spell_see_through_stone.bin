¦You gain the ability to see through solid rock as if it were transparent glass. You may see through 1 foot of stone per caster level. You see within the stone as if you were looking at the area in normal light, even if there is no illumination, though low-light vision and darkvision have no effect on your ability to see through stone. Metal at least 1 inch thick or wood or dirt at least 3 feet thick blocks your vision.
