    "text": "You affect the local gravity field in a 30-foot-radius sphere around the spell\u0027s designated point of origin. Creatures in the affected area can be weighed down by high gravity, lightened by low gravity, or left to float in an area with no gravity, depending on the effect you choose for your gravity sphere. See page 18 for rules on the effects of high, low, and no gravity."
