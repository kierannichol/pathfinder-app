    "text": "The twisted druids of the Uskwood forsook fire in ages past for the glory of Zon-Kuthon. Despite this aversion, these servants of Nidal know well the sting of flame, and have learned to turn it back on those that wield it. This spell creates a zone where magical fire effects twist and lash out against those who create the effects. A zone of foul flameslooks unremarkable to the casual observer, but a Perception check (DC \u003d 20 + the caster\u0027s level) reveals a faint rippling effect in the area, as if of heat distortions in the air."
