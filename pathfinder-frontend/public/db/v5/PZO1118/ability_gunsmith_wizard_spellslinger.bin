ÄThe spellslinger gains the Gunsmithing feat and a battered gun that is identical to the gun a Gunslinger gains at first level. If the spellslinger chooses the ability to attune two arcane guns, he still only starts out with one gun. Like a Gunslinger, a spellslinger can use the Gunsmithing feat to restore his battered gun.ª+
