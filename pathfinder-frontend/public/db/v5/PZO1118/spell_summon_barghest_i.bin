¿This spell summons a barghest from the Abyssal realm of Basalfeyst to serve the caster, functioning similarly to summon monster save that it may only be used to summon a single barghest. Although the summoned barghest does not have the feed ability, if you are at least caster level 9th the summoned barghest appears with 2 growth points (and with it the appropriate bonuses to its attacks, CMB, saves, skill checks, hit points, and caster level).
