    "text": "This spell sanctifies an area with heavenly power. The DC to resist spells or spell-like abilities with the good descriptor or channeled energy that damages evil outsiders (as when using Alignment Channel) increases by +2. In addition, evil outsiders take a â€“1 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, and they cannot be called or summoned into a sacred space. If the sacred spacecontains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity, pantheon, or good-aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are doubled. You cannot cast sacred spacein an area with a permanent fixture dedicated to a deity other than yours."
