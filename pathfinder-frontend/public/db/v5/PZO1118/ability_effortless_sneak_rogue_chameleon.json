    "text": "At 3rd level, the chameleon chooses a single terrain from the ranger\u0027s favored terrain class feature. While she is within that terrain, she can take 10 on any Stealth check she can make within that terrain. When the chameleon reaches 6th level, and every three levels thereafter, she chooses a new type of terrain from the ranger\u0027s favored terrain list. She gains this ability with the newly picked terrain.\nThis ability replaces trap sense.\nRogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement the chameleon archetype: camouflage, fast stealth, quick disguise, and terrain mastery."
