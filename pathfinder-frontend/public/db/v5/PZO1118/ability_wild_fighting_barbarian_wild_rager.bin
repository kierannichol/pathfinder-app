ºAt 2nd level, even when not raging, wild ragers often fight with reckless, savage abandon. A wild rager using the full-attack action can make one extra attack per round at her highest base attack bonus. Until the beginning of her next turn, however, she takes a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls and â€“4 penalty to AC.ª0.
