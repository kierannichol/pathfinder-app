    "text": "Upon casting this spell, choose a specific variety of monster (red dragon rather than dragon) and one of its special attacks that you have successfully identified with a Knowledge check or otherwise researched, such as a cockatrice\u0027s petrification ability or a spider swarm\u0027s poison. You gain a +4 insight bonus on saving throws against the selected special attack. The bonus does not apply to saves against other monsters\u0027 abilities of the same name, spell-like abilities, or special attacks derived from class levels or equipment. If you use a trophy from a monster of the exact same variety as an optional material component, the bonus increases to +6."
