òSome rangers devote their lives to the woods, becoming hunters, protectors, and wilderness guides among its diverse terrain types. The deep walker is instead a master of the strange terrain of the deep earth, exploring its caverns and caves, becoming a master of the dark corridors most surface dwellers fear to explore--and perhaps the reason they fear to explore them.ºÛ
