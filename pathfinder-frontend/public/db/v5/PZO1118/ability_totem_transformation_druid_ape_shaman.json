    "text": "At 2nd level, an ape shaman may adopt an aspect of the ape while retaining her normal form. She gains one of the following bonuses:\nmovement (climb speed 20 ft., +4 racial bonus on Climb checks) senses (low-light vision, scent) natural weapons (2 slams [1d6 for a Medium shaman], +2 on combat maneuver checks to grapple) toughness (+2 natural armor bonus to AC, Endurance feat)\nWhile using totem transformation, the ape shaman may speak normally and can cast speak with animals (primates only) at will. Using this ability is a standard action at 2nd level, a move action at 7th level, and a swift action at 12th level. The ape shaman can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her druid level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be used in 1-minute increments. This is a polymorph effect and cannot be used while the druid is using another polymorph effect, such as wild shape."
