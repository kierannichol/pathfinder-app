    "text": "At 15th level, once per day, after a battle scout and his allies roll initiative, the battle scout can arrange his and his allies\u0027 initiative rolls any way he wishes. If he has already taken 3 rounds to scout out the terrain with his advantageous terrain ability and both he and his allies are within the effect area, they gain a +2 bonus to initiative checks. Using this ability is not an action.\nThis ability replaces the ranger\u0027s fourth favored enemy."
