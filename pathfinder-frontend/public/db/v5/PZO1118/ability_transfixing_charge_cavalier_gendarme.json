    "text": "At 20th level, a gendarme represents the epitome of Mounted Combat. Whenever he makes a charge attack while mounted, he deals triple the normal damage (quadruple if using a lance); this damage includes all increases from the Spirited Charge feat and from the use of a lance. In addition, if the gendarme confirms a critical hit on a charge attack while mounted, the attack deals maximum damage for the weapon wielded. Additional damage from weapon properties, magic effects, precision-based bonuses, or other increases are rolled normally."
