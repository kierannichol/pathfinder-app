At 9th level, once a day, a wanderer can step within a tree and then teleport from that tree to another one in a manner similar to the tree stride spell. She gains an extra use of this ability each day at 12th level, and a third use of this ability at 15th level. Furthermore, a world walker of 13th level or higher can use this ability to teleport to any other tree of its type up to 100 miles away.ª.,
