    "text": "Upon drinking an extract created with this formula, you make a significant change to your magical reserve that modifies the nature of all bombs you create and throw during this extract\u0027s duration. This effect on your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (formulae with the word â€œbomb admixture\" in its title) active at a time. If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and those of the new one become active."
