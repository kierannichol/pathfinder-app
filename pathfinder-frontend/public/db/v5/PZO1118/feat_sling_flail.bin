CYou can use your loaded sling to effectively strike at nearby foes.•
Benefit‰You can make melee attacks using your loaded sling, using that weapon's normal statistics but treating it as a flail. Using a sling in this way does not expend mundane ammunition, but magical or masterwork ammunition loses its special properties after a single hit.w
SpeciallAny feats you have that apply when you use a flail also apply when you use a loaded sling as a melee weapon.ª
