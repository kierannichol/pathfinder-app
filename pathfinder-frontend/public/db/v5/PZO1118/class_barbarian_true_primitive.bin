ĞIsolated and xenophobic tribes that dwell in areas untouched by civilization often see anything from cities and organized settlements as strange, dangerous, and decadent. They gain power from their truly primitive nature; their bodies and spirits are hardened by the wild and untainted existence far from the pathetic softness of so-called civilization. Even when forced to mingle with civilization, the true primitive stays apart in both traditions and trappings.º
