    "text": "When you cast this spell, you instantly know the direction of north from your current position. The spell is effective in any environment in which â€œnorth\" exists, but it may not work in extraplanar settings. Your knowledge of north is correct at the moment of casting, but you can get lost again within moments if you don\u0027t find some external reference point to help you keep track of direction."
