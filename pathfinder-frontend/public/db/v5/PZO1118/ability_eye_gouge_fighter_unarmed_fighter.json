    "text": "At 13th level, if an unarmed fighter confirms a critical hit with his unarmed strike or begins his turn grappled, he may attempt a dirty trick maneuver to blind his target as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A target more than one size category larger is unaffected.\nThis ability replaces weapon training 3."
