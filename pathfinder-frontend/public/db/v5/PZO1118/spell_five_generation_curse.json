      "Effect": "This ritual inflicts a terrible curse upon an entire family line. The casters use a sample of the victim\u0027s hair or blood to infuse a ruby with dark magic and a shred of their target\u0027s soul. If successful, the ritual functions as bestow curse, affecting the primary target, as well as the primary target\u0027s siblings, children, grandchildren, parents, and grandparents, no matter their location. Each target can resist the curse with a successful Will saving throw; success means the negative effects of the curse do not affect that individual, though they may still pass the curse on to their descendants. Children born into the curse manifest its effects and attempt their saving throws upon reaching maturity."
