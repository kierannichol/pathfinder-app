¨All rangers have a bond with the wilderness, but the warden may have the strongest. This protector sits guard in the middle of the wilderness, keeping a lookout for any dangers that might spill from the deeper wilderness beyond, and protecting civilization from the savagery of nature--and vice versa. His long weeks, months, and sometimes years of isolation cause him to â€œhear" what the land is saying. Not all are crazy.ºn
