Benefit¾You can pronounce a single judgment and extend its effects to one adjacent ally instead of pronouncing a second judgment. Similarly, once you have the third judgment class feature, you can pronounce a single judgment and extend its effects to two adjacent allies instead of pronouncing a second and third judgment. Alternatively, once you have the third judgment class feature, you can pronounce two judgments and extend the effects of one judgment to one adjacent ally instead of pronouncing a third judgment. Once an ally has gained the effects of your judgment, he need not remain adjacent to you to continue gaining that benefit. You can spend a free action to end this benefit for one or both allies. If your judgment bonus is suspended for you, it is suspended for all allies, but when it resumes, it does so for all allies.ª
