·At 20th level, an emissary learns to ride through the thick of combat, striking and then moving away with blinding speed. Whenever the emissary is mounted and takes the charge action, he can first move 10 feet and make a melee attack. This first attack is not a charge, but a regular melee attack, and the movement counts toward the total allowed movement for the round. After making this attack, the emissary must still move in a straight line to reach the target of his charge, and he takes a â€“5 penalty on the attack roll for the attack at the end of his charge.ª/
