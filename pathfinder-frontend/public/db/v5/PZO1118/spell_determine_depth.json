    "text": "With a touch, you can determine the exact thickness of a wall, ceiling, or other solid barrier, measuring from the point you are touching to the direct opposite side of the barrier in a straight line. You can only detect depths or widths of up to 10 feet per caster level (maximum 200 feet at 20th level); amounts in excess of this limit are detected as being the maximum you are able to detect. So, for example, a 5th-level wizard using this spell on a 60-foot-thick wall would detect that the wall is 50 feet thick."
