You can dismiss this spell as an immediate action when you are caught within the area of someone else\u0027s damaging area spell; if you do, you\u0027re immune to that particular casting of that spell as well. If you have the blood casting class feature, you can cast this spell as a swift action instead of a standard action while you\u0027re in a bloodrage."
