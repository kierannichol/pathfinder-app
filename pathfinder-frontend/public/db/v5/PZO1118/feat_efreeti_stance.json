While using Efreeti Style, you gain fire resistance equal to your base attack bonus or your monk level plus any base attack bonus gained from levels in classes other than monk, whichever is higher. While denied your Dexterity bonus to AC you are also denied this resistance. Creatures that take fire damage from your Elemental Fist attack must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) or catch on fire."
