ˆAt 7th level, a brawler constantly harries and distracts his enemies. While adjacent to the brawler, enemies take a â€“1 penalty on attack rolls and a â€“4 penalty on concentration checks. These penalties increase by 1 for every four levels after 7th level (to a maximum of â€“4 on attack rolls and â€“7 on concentration checks at 19th level). Creatures do not take these penalties if the brawler is dazed, helpless, staggered, stunned, or unconscious.
This ability replaces armor training 2, 3, and 4 and armor mastery.ª-+
