      "Effect": "The primary caster draws the symbol of the Peacock Spirit--a peacock feather with an open eye in the middle--on the floor as the secondary casters stand in a circle around him. The secondary casters join hands around the primary caster, who must perform the praises of the Peacock Spirit (traditionally, hymns and dances that focus on tripartite union of mind, body, and soul). The secondary casters can lend their voices, but they must be in perfect harmony."
