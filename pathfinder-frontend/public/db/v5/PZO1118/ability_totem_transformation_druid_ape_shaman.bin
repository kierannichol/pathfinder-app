˜At 2nd level, an ape shaman may adopt an aspect of the ape while retaining her normal form. She gains one of the following bonuses:
movement (climb speed 20 ft., +4 racial bonus on Climb checks) senses (low-light vision, scent) natural weapons (2 slams [1d6 for a Medium shaman], +2 on combat maneuver checks to grapple) toughness (+2 natural armor bonus to AC, Endurance feat)
While using totem transformation, the ape shaman may speak normally and can cast speak with animals (primates only) at will. Using this ability is a standard action at 2nd level, a move action at 7th level, and a swift action at 12th level. The ape shaman can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her druid level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be used in 1-minute increments. This is a polymorph effect and cannot be used while the druid is using another polymorph effect, such as wild shape.ª4
