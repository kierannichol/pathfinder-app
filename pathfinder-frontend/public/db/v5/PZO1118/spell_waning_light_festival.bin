EffectŒAt the completion of the festival, the primary and secondary casters are charged with magical energy. For the next 2 hours, any creature they touch gains a resistance bonus on their next 5 saving throws equal to 1 for every 5 Hit Dice the primary caster possesses. It's considered auspicious if it rains during the festival, even more so if thunder and lightning crack through the sky. If the ritual is performed in these conditions, the benefit is doubled, instead granting the bonus on saving throws for the next 10 saves.
