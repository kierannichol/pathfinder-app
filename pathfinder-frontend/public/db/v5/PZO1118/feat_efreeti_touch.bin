œYour knowledge of the secrets of the burning wind and blazing sun allows you to collect flames into your hands and unleash them in a gout of elemental fire.­
Benefit¡While using Efreeti Style, as a standard action, you can spend two Elemental Fist attempts to unleash a 15-foot cone-shaped burst of flame. Creatures caught in the cone take your unarmed strike damage plus the fire damage from your Elemental Fist and catch on fire. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from catching on fire.ª
