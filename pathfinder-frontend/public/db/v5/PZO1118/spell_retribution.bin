ˆRetributionblasts those who have the temerity to assault your person. You may target anyone who has just struck you with an attack within the previous round, whether with a melee, ranged, or natural weapon, or a spell that requires an attack roll. The target is wracked with shooting pains that impose a â€“4 penalty on attack rolls, skills checks, and ability checks. On a successful Fortitude save, the penalty only lasts for 1 round. A target who worships the same god as you takes a â€“2 penalty on its saving throw.
