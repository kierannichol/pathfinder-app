ÌAt 5th level, an unbreakable gains the Heroic Recovery feat as a bonus feat, if he does not have it already. If he already has this feat, the unbreakable can choose any combat feat instead. In addition, he may use this feat one additional time per day for every four levels after 5th (to a maximum of 4 times per day at 17th level).ª2
