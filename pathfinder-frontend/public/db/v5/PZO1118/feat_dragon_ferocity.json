      "Special": "Taking this feat allows you to qualify for the Elemental Fist feat even if you do not meet that feat\u0027s prerequisites. If you do not meet that feat\u0027s prerequisites, you must choose one of the damage types that feat offers, and you can use only that damage type with your Elemental Fist attacks until you meet the feat\u0027s normal prerequisites. A monk with this feat can use Elemental Fist as if he were a monk of the four winds."
