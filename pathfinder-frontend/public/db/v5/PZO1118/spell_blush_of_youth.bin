Effect¢The caster must gather her intended victims in a circle with a radius no larger than 10 feet around her and restrain them for the duration of the ritual; while they don't participate in the ritual other than as sacrifices, these victims count as secondary casters for the purpose of determining the caster's skill bonuses. At the ritual's start, the caster stands at the center of the circle of victims and chants while holding the onyx aloft. The evil energy emanating from the caster slowly siphons the victims' blood through their facial orifices; that blood travels in a liquid line from the victims to the primary caster's onyx. From there, the blood washes over the primary caster. By the end of the ritual, the primary caster's entire body is bathed in an occluding egg of thick, dripping blood.
