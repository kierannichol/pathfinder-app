>Aiming outsized siege weapons poses little difficulty for you.Ë
Benefit¿You take no size penalty for aiming a direct-fire siege weapon larger than yourself. If you operate an indirect-fire siege weapon and miss, you misdirect fire by 1 square per range increment.å
NormalÚDirect-fire weapons impose a â€“2 attack roll penalty per size category by which the weapon is larger than the creature aiming it. An indirect-fire weapon that misses misdirects fire by 1d4 squares per range increment.ª
