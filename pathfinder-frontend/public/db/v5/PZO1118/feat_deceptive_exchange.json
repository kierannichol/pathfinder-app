      "Benefit": "If you successfully feint an opponent, you can trick that opponent into accepting a one-handed object you are holding instead of denying that opponent its Dexterity bonus to AC against your next attack. The opponent must have appendages capable of holding the object you offer, and it must have one such appendage free to take the object.",
      "Special": "An alchemist who has the delayed bomb alchemist discovery can use this feat to hand an enemy a delayed bomb. Such a delayed bomb detonates at the end of the alchemist\u0027s turn. If the bomb is in a creature\u0027s square at the end of the alchemist\u0027s turn, the bomb deals that creature a direct hit."
