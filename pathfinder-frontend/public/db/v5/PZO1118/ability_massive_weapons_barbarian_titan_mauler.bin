™At 3rd level, a titan mauler becomes skilled in the use of massive weapons looted from her titanic foes.
She can use two-handed weapons meant for creatures one size category larger, but the penalty for doing so is increased by 4. However, the attack roll penalty for using weapons too large for her size is reduced by 1, and this reduction increases by 1 for every three levels beyond 3rd (to a minimum of 0).ª5
