    "text": "This spell creates a vertical wall of skeletal arms that attaches itself to any solid surface. The wall of bone works identically to wall of stone except as noted above and in this spell description. The wall of bone is 1 inch thick per 4 caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. The wall created must be vertical, and must rest upon a firm foundation. It cannot be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or to act as a ramp. Each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 4 and 7 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall whose hit points drops to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC of the Strength check is equal to 15 + 2 per inch of thickness."
