    "text": "At 13th level, a tetori can negate a polymorph effect by touch with a Wisdom check, adding a bonus equal to his monk level, against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the effect (or HD of the creature, for supernatural polymorph effects). This is a standard action requiring 2 points from the tetori\u0027s ki pool, or an immediate action if a creature the tetori is grappling attempts to use a polymorph effect."
