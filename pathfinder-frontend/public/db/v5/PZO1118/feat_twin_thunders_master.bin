TWith thunderous simultaneous strikes, you can batter a mighty giant into submission.½
Benefit±Whenever you deal an opponent extra damage with the Twin Thunders feat, that opponent is shaken for 1 round. You also force that opponent to succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + half your level + your Str modifier) or become staggered for 1 round. If you use this feat to render staggered an opponent that is already staggered, you daze that opponent instead. In a similar way, you can stun an opponent that is already dazed.ª
