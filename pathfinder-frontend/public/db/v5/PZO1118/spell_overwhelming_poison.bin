ÂThis spell increases the virulence of the targeted dose of poison, making the poison more difficult to resist. The poison is unaffected by delay poison, and the DC to remove it with neutralize poison is increased by 5. Additionally, the poison uses its own saving throw DC or overwhelming poison's DC, whichever is higher.
