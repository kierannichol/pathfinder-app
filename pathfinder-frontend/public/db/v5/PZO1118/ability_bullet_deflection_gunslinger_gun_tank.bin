üA gun tank is adept at modifying and using her armor to stop firearm attacks. Starting at 2nd level, a gun tank wearing medium or heavy armor gains half the armor's bonus plus the armor's enhancement bonus (if any) as a deflection bonus against any non-siege firearm or splash weapon attack (including the alchemist's bomb class ability; Advanced Player's Guide 28). This ability has no affect on spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities that make a touch attack.
This ability replaces nimble.ª4
