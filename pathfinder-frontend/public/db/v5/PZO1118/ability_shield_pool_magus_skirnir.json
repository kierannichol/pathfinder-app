    "text": "At 4th level, as a free action, a skirnir may spend 1 point from his arcane pool to add his shield bonus to AC (not including enhancement bonuses) on a concentration check to cast defensively. He may also use a touch attack or shield bash with his shield in conjunction with any pool strike magus arcana.\nThis ability replaces spell recall."
