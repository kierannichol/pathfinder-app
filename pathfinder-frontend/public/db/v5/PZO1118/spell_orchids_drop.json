    "text": "Alchemists have tried for centuries to recreate Artokus Kirran\u0027s feat of genius that created the sun orchid elixir. Although they have yet to unlock the elixir\u0027s exact formula, their efforts have not been entirely wasted. One by-product of their experiments was the orchid\u0027s dropformula. This extract, distilled from a much-diluted drop of the nectar of a sun orchid flower, can transform an alchemist\u0027s mutagen into a potent healing tonic."
