    "text": "This spell has two different applications, both of which control water in different ways. The first version of this spell causes water in the area to swiftly evaporate or to sink into the ground below, lowering the water\u0027s depth. The second version causes the water to surge and rise, increasing its overall depth and possibly flooding nearby areas."
