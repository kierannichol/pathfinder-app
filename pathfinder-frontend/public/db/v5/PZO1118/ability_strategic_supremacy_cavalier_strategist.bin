¤At 18th level, a strategist gains the ability not only to improve his allies' abilities, but also to disrupt the teamwork of his enemies. Whenever the strategist uses the tactician ability, he can choose to cancel out the effects of one teamwork feat employed by any of his opponents within 30 feet instead of granting the use of a teamwork feat to his allies.
This ability replaces the cavalier's 18th-level bonus feat.ª53
