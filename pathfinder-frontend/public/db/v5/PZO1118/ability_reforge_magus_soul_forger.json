    "text": "At 11th level, as a standard action, a soul forger can restore a number of hit points equal to his magus level to a damaged object by touching it and spending 1 point from his arcane pool. Repairing a destroyed object takes 1 minute and materials equal to 1/4 the item\u0027s sale value, and restores the object to 1 hit point.\nRestoring the enchantments of a destroyed magical item requires additional points from the soul forger\u0027s arcane pool equal to the item\u0027s caster level. The soul forger gains one temporary negative level if the item\u0027s caster level is lower than his own, two negative levels if equal or greater (or none if the item is his bonded weapon); the save DC to remove these negative levels is equal to 10 + the item\u0027s caster level."
