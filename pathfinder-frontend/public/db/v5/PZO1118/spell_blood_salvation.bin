²While under the effect of this spell, you're immune to any damaging area spells you cast. You can dismiss this spell as an immediate action when you are caught within the area of someone else's damaging area spell; if you do, you're immune to that particular casting of that spell as well. If you have the blood casting class feature, you can cast this spell as a swift action instead of a standard action while you're in a bloodrage.
