      "Effect": "This ritual is cast as part of constructing a campsite. The primary caster and any secondary casters work to secure a 30-foot perimeter around a central campfire. The fire is ringed with ritualistic warding stones, which are required as foci to complete the ritual. These warding stones can be used only once every 7 days, though the primary caster can purchase additional sets of stones if she wishes to create multiple campsites during that time. If the ritual is successful, several effects occur for the duration of the ritual or until the primary caster decides to dispel the ritual (a full-round action)."
