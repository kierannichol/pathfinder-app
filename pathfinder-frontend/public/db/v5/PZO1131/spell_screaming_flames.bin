ÛA sheer wall of flame appears and rushes away from you. Tendrils of fire reach out of it, shaped into skulls screaming in agony. When the wall passes through a creature's space, that creature must succeed at a Reflex save or take 1d8 points of fire damage for every 2 caster levels you have (maximum 5d8). Any creature taking fire damage must also succeed at a Will save or take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage. Deaf creatures receive a +4 circumstance bonus on their Will saves.
