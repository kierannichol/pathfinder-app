    "text": "All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell, except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like effects are unraveled and destroyed completely (ending the effect as a dispel magic spell does), and each permanent magic item must make a successful Will save or be turned into a normal item for the duration of this spell. An item in a creature\u0027s possession uses its own Will save bonus or its possessor\u0027s Will save bonus, whichever is higher. If an item\u0027s saving throw results in a natural 1 on the die, the item is destroyed instead of being suppressed."
