If the subject is affected by a poison effect while under the effects of this spell, instead of the poison\u0027s normal effect, she feels intoxicated as if she\u0027d just had a very strong drink and takes a â€“2 penalty on attacks, saves, and checks for the duration of the spell. When the spell\u0027s duration expires, the penalty ends and the poison\u0027s normal effects apply. Pick your poisondoes not affect any poison effects that occurred before the spell was cast."
