    "text": "Any creature of chaotic, neutral, or evil alignment who targets you with a spell must succeed at a Will save or take a –4 penalty on Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks for the spell\u0027s duration. Creatures with only neutral alignment components receive a +4 bonus on their Will saves against this spell. The penalties for alignment components stack (therefore, a chaotic evil spellcaster would take a –8 penalty)."
