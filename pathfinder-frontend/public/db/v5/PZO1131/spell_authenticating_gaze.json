    "text": "Your understanding of the written word becomes analytical and discerning. You gain an insight bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +10) on Appraise checks to determine the value of books and scrolls and on Linguistics checks to detect forgeries, and you can attempt a Linguistics check to detect a forged document at a glance, rather than taking the normal 1 round of examination per page. In addition, you immediately detect whether written works within 30 feet and within your line of sight have a magical aura and the strength of any such auras, as though you had concentrated on each written work for 1 round using detect magic."
