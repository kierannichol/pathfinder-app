Fey Blightspelltransmutation_curse_ruse¢Þ
ÛThe target is cursed, gaining the bane of the caster's fey race (see below for details on each specific fey race's bane and duration). A creature that succeeds at its saving throw is immune to further castings of fey blight from the same type of fey for 24 hours. Fey blight cannot be dispelled, but effects that remove curses function against it.
