    "text": "The targets of this spell become angrier as they fight, the pain of their wounds fueling their strength. An affected creature gains a cumulative +2 morale bonus to Strength and a cumulative –1 penalty to AC for every 5 points of damage it takes (maximum +10 Strength, –5 AC) for the duration of the spell. These bonuses last until the spell expires or the target falls unconscious."
