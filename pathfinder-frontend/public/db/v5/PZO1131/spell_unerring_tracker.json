This trail can\u0027t be more than 24 hours old. You can follow the trail at any speed, provided you have line of sight to the trail. You can distinguish the trail of the particular creature followed even if it joins and splits with other trails. Once you have selected a trail to follow using this spell, it can\u0027t be changed."
