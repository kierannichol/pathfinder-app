  "description": {
    "text": "You conjure a sizable symbol into being, a rune suggestive of bloated bodies, flung food, and flowing wine. This spell functions as symbol of death, except that all creatures within 60 feet of the symbol of debaucheryare instead filled with lust for the nearest conscious creature. This effect lasts for 1 round per caster level, even after creatures leave the symbol\u0027s area of effect. Affected creatures are compelled to rush to the nearest creature in order to caress and kiss it, and may take no other actions. Each creature receives a single Will save when the symbol of debaucheryis triggered to negate the effect. If no other creatures are visible, an affected creature may act normally."
