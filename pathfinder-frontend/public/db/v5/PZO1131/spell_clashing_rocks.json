    "text": "You create two Colossal-sized masses of rock, dirt, and stone and slam them together against a single creature between them. The clashing rocksappear up to 30 feet away from the target on opposite sides and rush toward it with a mighty grinding crash. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target with the rocks. The clashing rocksignore concealment and cover, and if there is a solid barrier between the target and either of the clashing rocks, the spell has a +28 bonus on the Strength check to burst through the barrier and continue unimpeded to the target. A creature struck by the clashing rockstakes 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. If the target fails a Reflex saving throw, it is also buried under the resulting rubble as if by a cave-in (see Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook415)."
