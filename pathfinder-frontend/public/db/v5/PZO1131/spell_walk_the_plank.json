    "text": "This spell functions as per create pitAPG, except as noted here. All but the top 10 feet of the hole is filled with saltwater, reducing the fall damage for anyone falling into the pit to 1d3 points of nonlethal damage and allowing Huge or larger creatures at the water\u0027s surface to simply pull themselves out of the pit as part of a normal move action, without a Climb check. Additionally, the pit contains a single advanced shark (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 294, 247) for every 4 caster levels you have (maximum four advanced sharks). If desired, when you cast the spell, you can substitute two of the summoned sharks for one great white shark (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 241). These sharks immediately attack any creature that falls into the pit, even you. If multiple creatures fall in the pit, the sharks attack randomly. When the spell ends, creatures inside the hole rise up with the bottom of the pit, as normal for create pit, but the conjured water and sharks vanish."
