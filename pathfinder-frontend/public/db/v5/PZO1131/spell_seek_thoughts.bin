°Similar to detect thoughts, seek thoughtsallows you to sift through the surface thoughts of those around you. You may scan for either the answer to a simple question (such as â€œWhere is the hidden lair of the wererats?") or for information on a general topic (such as the beliefs of an evil cult). You detect the number of creatures who are thinking about this question or topic within range, as well as their location if they are visible to you. Seek thoughtsdoes not let you read actual surface thoughts, only if a given creature is thinking about the topic you are concentrating on. A successful Will save prevents you from sensing a creature's thoughts for the duration of the spell.
