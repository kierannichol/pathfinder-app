    "text": "Drawing upon positive energy, you emulate some of a paladin\u0027s power to smite undead. Choose one undead creature as your target. Your melee attacks against that target gain a bonus equal to your Charisma or Wisdom modifier, whichever is higher, on your attack rolls, and a bonus equal to your caster level on damage rolls. Your melee attacks also bypass the target\u0027s damage reduction. These bonuses do not stack with the bonuses from a paladin\u0027s smite."
