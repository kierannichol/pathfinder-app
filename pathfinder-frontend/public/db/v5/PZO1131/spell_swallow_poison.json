    "text": "A special gland grows on the inside of your throat, which absorbs any poisons that you ingest, and can be used to expel them in a toxic spray. Any time you consume ingested poison during the spell\u0027s duration, you can roll a caster level check against the poison\u0027s save DC in order to harmlessly absorb the poison, ignoring its effects. The spell can absorb up to 1 dose of poison per 3 caster levels, after which the gland is unable to process any more poison, and any further doses of ingested poison affect you normally."
