  "description": {
    "text": "You change one of the extremities of the creature touched--arms or legs only--into another shape of approximately the same size and mass. You can choose a tentacle, a hoof, or a wing. The subject must take approximately 10 minutes to familiarize itself with the function and movement of the new extremity to use it properly. These new forms do not allow the subject to fly, run faster, or swim better; however, they do act as natural weapons of the appropriate type, and the subject can use them to make secondary attacks while making attacks with weapons as a full-attack action. The secondary attacks are made using the creature\u0027s base attack bonus â€“5 and adding only 1/2 the creature\u0027s Strength bonus on damage rolls. The subject cannot hold a weapon or use any item that would ordinarily fit into the slot of the changed extremity. The subject can receive the benefits of this spell multiple times."
