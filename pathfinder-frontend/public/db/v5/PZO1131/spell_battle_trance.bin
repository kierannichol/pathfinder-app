æYou are transformed into a single-minded force of destruction. You gain the ferocity monster special ability, a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your caster level (maximum +10), and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. You cannot use the withdraw action or willingly move away from a creature that has attacked you.
