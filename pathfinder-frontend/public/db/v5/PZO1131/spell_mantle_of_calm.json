    "text": "You surround yourself with a mantle of calm serenity. You take a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls, and opponents gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells you cast. Any creature affected by a rage effect (barbarian\u0027s rage, bloodrager\u0027s bloodrage, blood rage monster ability, rage spell, skald\u0027s inspired rage raging song, and so on) that strikes you with a melee attack must attempt at a Will saving throw, without the rage effect\u0027s bonus to Will; failure means the rage effect ends (as if it were dispelled or the creature voluntarily ended it, as appropriate)."
