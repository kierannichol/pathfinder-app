¸If the target takes hit point damage while within range of this spell, it immediately teleports to your space (or adjacent to your space) after the damage is applied. If the target is killed, its corpse teleports instead. Optionally, you can specify a number of points of damage for your familiar to take before the spell takes effect, but you must do so when the spell is cast. Once the familiar has teleported back to you, the spell ends.
