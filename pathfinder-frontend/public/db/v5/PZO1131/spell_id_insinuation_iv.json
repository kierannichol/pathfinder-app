    "text": "This functions as id insinuation I, except as noted above. In addition, on the first round of the effect, you can select the result of each creature\u0027s confused condition without having to roll, but this doesn\u0027t allow you to make any decisions about how that result is applied. On the following rounds of the effect, the targets of this spell must roll twice to determine their confused effect. You select which roll is used. This spell can be undercast."
