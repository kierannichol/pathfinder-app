Upon completion of the spell, swirling mists part and deposit you and any creatures you touched on a nearby stretch of the Dead Roads, a network of extraplanar roadways. You can take up to one creature per level, but all targets must be touching each other. You must specify a location known to you or one of your travelers as your destination when casting this spell."
