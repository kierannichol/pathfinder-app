ÆYou send out a burst of luck with a 30-foot radius centered around you. While the beacon of luck is in effect, you gain a +2 sacred bonus on all saving throws. As an immediate action before a saving throw is made, allies within the area can choose to benefit from this luck, rolling twice for a saving throw and taking the better result. Once a creature benefits from the beacon of luck in this way, it cannot gain the benefit of this spell for 24 hours.
