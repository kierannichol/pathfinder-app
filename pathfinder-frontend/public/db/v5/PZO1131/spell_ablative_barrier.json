    "text": "Invisible layers of solid force surround and protect the target, granting that target a +2 armor bonus to AC. Additionally, the first 5 points of lethal damage the target takes from each attack are converted into nonlethal damage. Against attacks that already deal nonlethal damage, the target gains DR 5/--. Once this spell has converted 5 points of damage to nonlethal damage per caster level (maximum 50 points), the spell is discharged."
