    "text": "You open the minds of all creatures near you and enhance their sensory receptors. All living creatures other than you in the area gain a +5 bonus on Perception checks. Sighted creatures gain low-light vision, and creatures with a sense of smell gain scent. In addition, the first time each round that a creature in the area takes damage, it takes an additional 2d6 points of damage of the same type. Despite being within the area, the caster does not take this extra damage."
