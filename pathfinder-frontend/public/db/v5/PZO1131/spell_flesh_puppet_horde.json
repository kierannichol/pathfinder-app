    "text": "This spell functions as flesh puppet, but can animate multiple zombies. As noted in animate dead, you can\u0027t control more than 4 HD per caster level worth of undead in total, nor can a single casting create more than 2 HD per caster level. A separate string attaches to each zombie in your horde. Severing a zombie\u0027s string reverts that zombie to a corpse, but doesn\u0027t end the spell for other zombies. Because commanding a flesh puppet requires a swift action, you can issue commands to only one zombie per round, though zombies you previously commanded continue to follow their orders. Likewise, you can command only one zombie to speak per round."
