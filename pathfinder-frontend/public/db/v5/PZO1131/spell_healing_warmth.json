    "text": "This spell grants you temporary immunity to fire damage as protection from energy. As a standard action, you may sacrifice 12 points of remaining energy absorption from the spell to heal a touched creature of 1d8 points of damage. Healing a creature provokes an attack of opportunity. When the spell has absorbed 12 points of fire damage per caster level (to a maximum of 120 points at 10th level), it is discharged."
