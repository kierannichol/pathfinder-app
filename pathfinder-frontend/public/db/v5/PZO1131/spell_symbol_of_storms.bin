ŸThis spell functions as symbol of death, except that when triggered, a 30-foot-radius centered on the symbol fills with hurricane-force winds (75 mph). Each round, a bolt of lightning that deals 10d6 points of electricity damage strikes a random creature within the area. A successful Reflex save halves this damage. Unlike symbol of death, symbol of storms has no hit point limit. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 30 feet from a symbol of storms can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once triggered, a symbol of storms remains active for 1 minute per caster level.
