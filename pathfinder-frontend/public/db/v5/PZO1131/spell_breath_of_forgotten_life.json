      "Effect": "The primary caster channels the experiences of her previous lives into a vessel of her current life, gaining meaningful insight from her forgotten past. The breath of forgotten life ritual must be cast within a location of great significance to the primary caster, such as her childhood home or marriage shrine. The primary caster meditates on her current life by focusing on the mirror and recalling her past deeds in reverse chronological order, while any secondary casters act out the scenes she describes. After the casting time, the primary caster\u0027s reflection in the mirror changes to an image of one of her past forms. This image describes its own deeds, which are relevant to the primary caster\u0027s immediate future and grant her a +2 insight bonus to her Armor Class and on initiative checks for the ritual\u0027s duration. The primary caster also gains the ability to cast legend lore as a spell-like ability once within the following week."
