EffectÀThrough a ceremony of meditation and recitation, the casters of this ritual become psychically attuned. Casters who don't have levels in an occult class gain the following benefits. Each caster can choose one knack from the psychic class's spell list and an additional knack for every 5 character levels that caster possesses (to a maximum of 5 knacks at 20th level). The casters can cast these knacks at will. If a caster is trained in a skill with an occult skill unlock, she can use that skill's occult unlock. Casters who do have levels in an occult base class gain the following benefits. If a caster is trained in a skill with an occult skill unlock, she gains a +4 insight bonus on checks with that skill when using its occult skill unlock. If a caster is untrained in a skill with an occult skill unlock, she can still use that skill's occult unlock. Each of the ritual's casters can choose to dismiss this ritual's effects for themselves individually.
