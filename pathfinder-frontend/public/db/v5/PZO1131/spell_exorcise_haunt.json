      "Effect": "The caster reads aloud from her chosen lexicon while standing amid a circle of candles, reciting passages that fill her with dedication and conviction. Upon the completion of the ritual\u0027s casting time, she steps into the target haunt\u0027s area, causing her to forge a psychic connection with the haunt that pulls her mind into a binary mindscape (Occult Adventures 235) of the haunt\u0027s creation and that is strongly reminiscent of the haunt\u0027s anguish and themed along the lines of the haunt\u0027s destruction method."
