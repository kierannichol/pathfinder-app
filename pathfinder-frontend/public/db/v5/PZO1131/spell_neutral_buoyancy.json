    "text": "The target\u0027s buoyancy becomes and stays neutral, regardless of how dense the target and its gear are. Among other effects, the target neither sinks nor rises when it doesn\u0027t attempt a Swim check, making it easier to stay put while performing demanding actions or when helpless or disabled, and the target can swim up and down with equal ease."
