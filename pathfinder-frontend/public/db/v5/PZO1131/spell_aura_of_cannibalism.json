    "text": "You emanate an aura that saps the strength of others of your kind and channels their energy into you. Each round that a creature starts its turn in the spell\u0027s area and shares both your creature type and at least one subtype you possess (if any), that creature must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of damage. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage you deal with this spell (maximum 10 + your caster level). These temporary hit points go away when the spell ends."
