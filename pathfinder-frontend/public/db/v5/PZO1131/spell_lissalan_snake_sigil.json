    "text": "There are seven variants of this spell, one for each of the Thassilonian schools of magic. Each functions like sepia snake sigil(and counts as that spell for the purpose of combining other spells that hide or garble text), except instead of trapping the subject, the triggered sigil\u0027s effect depends on this spell\u0027s school. This effect lasts for 1 day/level. This is a curse effect that can be removed via remove curse."
