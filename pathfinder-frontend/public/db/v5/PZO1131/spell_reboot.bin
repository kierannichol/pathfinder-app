¨Whispering in the dense, information-rich machine language of the First Ones, you bring a destroyed construct back to operational status for a short time, restoring it to 1 hit point. The construct can be further healed with spells like make whole, but it returns to its destroyed state as soon as this spell's duration expires or it is brought to 0 hit points, whichever comes first. As long as the construct is active, it obeys your commands to the best of its ability, fighting on your behalf and carrying out tasks that it is capable of performing.
