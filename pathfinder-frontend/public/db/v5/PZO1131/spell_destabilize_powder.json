Increase the misfire range by 1 + 1 per five caster levels (maximum +5) for the ammunition currently loaded into that firearm. If aware of this spell\u0027s effect prior to firing the altered ammunition (a DC 17 Spellcraft check to identify the spell being cast or similar effect), the firearm\u0027s user can spend a standard action to clear the altered ammunition from the firearm. Doing so destroys that ammunition."
