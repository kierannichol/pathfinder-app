      "Effect": "Effect The witch can corrupt bodies of water with foul energies. This functions as the blight hex, except it affects only either an area of standing water or a creature with the aquatic or water subtype. a creature of any type that drinks water from a polluted area must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or become nauseated for 1d3 rounds and afflicted as if blighted with the blight hex curse. A creature that succeeds at this saving throw is immune to the effects of polluted water from this area for 24 hours. Polluted water does not quench thirst."
