ÍAt 8th level, a summoner can use his maker's call ability to swap locations with his eidolon. If the eidolon occupies more squares than the summoner, the summoner can appear in any square occupied by the eidolon. The eidolon must occupy the square that was occupied by the summoner if able, or as close as possible if it is not able.ª.,
