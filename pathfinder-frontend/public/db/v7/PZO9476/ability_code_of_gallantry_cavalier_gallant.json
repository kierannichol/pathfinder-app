A gallant must also be of lawful good or neutral good alignment. A gallant who ceases to be lawful good or neutral good, or who violates his order\u0027s edicts, loses all class features except armor and weapon proficiencies until he restores his alignment or atones for his violation (see the atonement spell), as appropriate."
