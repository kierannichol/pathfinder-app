    "text": "At 1st level, a hunter can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. She must select one type of animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and her hunter level. The hunter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. The hunter can emulate only one animal at a time.The hunter can also apply one of these aspects to her animal companion. Unlike with the hunter herself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to her animal companion. An aspect applied in this way does not count against the hunter\u0027s minutes of duration per day--it remains in effect until the hunter changes it. The companion\u0027s aspect can be the same aspect the hunter has taken on or a different one. The hunter can select or change the animal foci on both herself and her animal companion as part of the same swift action.If the hunter\u0027s animal companion is dead, the hunter can apply her companion\u0027s animal focus to herself instead of her animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one she can choose, and (as with a companion\u0027s focus) remains in effect until the hunter changes it instead of counting against her minutes per day."
