This animal becomes the skald\u0027s personal totem animal and influences his later abilities. He gains the following rage power.\nSong of the Beast (Su): The totemic skald grants the animal focus abilities of his totem animal (as the hunter\u0027s animal focus ability) to all allies affected by his raging song. He treats his skald level as his hunter level for determining the abilities of the animal focus (such as the improvements gained at 8th and 15th level)."
