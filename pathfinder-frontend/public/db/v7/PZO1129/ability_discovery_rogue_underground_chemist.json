    "text": "At 10th level, an underground chemist can select one of the following alchemist discoveries in place of a rogue talent: concentrate poison, dilution, enhance potion, extend potion, mummification, nauseating flesh, poison conversion, preserve organs, spontaneous healing, or sticky poison. She uses her rogue level as her alchemist level for determining the effects of her discoveries and whether she is able to select one.\nThis ability alters advanced talents.\nRogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement the underground chemist archetype: black market connections, fast fingers, lasting poison, sniper\u0027s eye, and swift poison."
