  "effect": "The target may make a Will save to resist this hex. These scars do not interfere with the target\u0027s senses or prevent it from using abilities, but may affect social interactions. The witch can use her hexes on the scarred target at a range of up to 1 mile, and she is considered to have a body part from the target for the purpose of scrying and similar divination spells. They persist through disguises and shapechanging.",
  "description": "This hex curses a single target touched with horrible scars of the witch\u0027s choosing, whether something as simple as a single letter on the target\u0027s forehead or blotchy, burn-like scars on his body.",
