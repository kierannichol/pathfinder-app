  "description": "You enhance a creature\u0027s ability to harm an opponent based on the number of times it has already injured that opponent with a natural attack. Each time the creature successfully strikes an opponent with a natural attack, the subject gains a cumulative +1 bonus on damage rolls made against that opponent when making natural attacks (maximum +5 bonus). If an attack misses, the bonus to damage for all attacks resets to +0.",
