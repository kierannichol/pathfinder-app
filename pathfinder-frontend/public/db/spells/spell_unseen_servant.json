  "description": "An unseen servant is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can\u0027t perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can\u0027t be used untrained. This servant cannot fly, climb, or even swim (though it can walk on water). Its base speed is 15 feet.",
