  "description": "This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon or above a door or other opening measuring no more than 20 square feet/level in size. When the casting is completed, the symbol immediately triggers, glowing visibly and sealing the door or opening with an invisible barrier of force equivalent to a wall of force. Destroying the symbol ends the effect, though destroying it once the symbol has been activated requires destroying the wall of forcefirst. Once triggered, the wall remains for 10 minutes per caster level.",
