Creatures who fall into the pit take falling damage as normal, plus 2d6 points of piercing damage from the spikes. Any creature or object coming into contact with the spikes along the walls, such as a creature trying to climb out, or rope or other typical aids to climbing, takes 1d6 points of piercing damage each round they are in contact with the walls. For those willing to accept the damage incurred while climbing, the pit\u0027s walls have a Climb DC of 20.Walk the Plank",
