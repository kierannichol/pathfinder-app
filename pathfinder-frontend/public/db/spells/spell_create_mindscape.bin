You choose whether the mindscape is overt or veiled, and whether it's harmless or harmful. You can choose any shape and size trait, as well as any gravity trait (though you can't make it so the gravity is so strong it harms creatures within). The mindscape has normal time, no alignment traits, and normal magic.z
