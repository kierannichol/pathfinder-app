  "description": "The target becomes temporarily immune to disease. Any disease to which it is exposed during the spell\u0027s duration does not affect the target until the spell\u0027s duration has expired. If the target is currently infected with a disease, you must make a caster level check against the disease\u0027s DC to suspend it for the duration of the spell; otherwise, that disease affects the target normally. Delay disease does not cure any damage a disease may have already done.",
