The spell can only be cast on a single tree at a time; while liveoak is in effect, you can\u0027t cast it again on another tree. Liveoak must be cast on a healthy, Huge oak. A triggering phrase of up to one word per caster level is placed on the targeted oak. The liveoak spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant.",
