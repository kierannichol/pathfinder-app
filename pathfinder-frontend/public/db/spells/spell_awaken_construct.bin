To do so, you must succeed at a Spellcraft check (DC = 15 + the construct's current Hit Dice). If the construct's master (if any) is present, this is an opposed Spellcraft check. You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken--it is a free-willed creature. Golems previously under another creature's control, either as shield guardians or a golem crafter's creations, break all connections with that creature.z
