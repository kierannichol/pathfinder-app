The reflection is harmless and mimics the target's motions perfectly; no one else can see this illusion. The first time the target sees the Red Mantis reflection, it must succeed at a Will save be or shaken and take a â€“2 penalty on saves against fear effects for as long as it can see the altered image and for 3 rounds thereafter. A new save must be attempted each time the creature views its reflection during the spell's duration. Once a creature successfully saves, it becomes immune to being shaken by the caster's mirror mantis spell for 24 hours, though it will still see the Red Mantis reflection until the spell ends.z
