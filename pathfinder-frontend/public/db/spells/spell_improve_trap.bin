The caster can improve the trap in any of the following ways (each one raises the trap's CR by +1). Increase DC of the Perception check required to locate the trap by +5. Increase DC of the Disable Device check required to disarm trap by +5. Increase the trap's attack bonus or saving throw by +2. To cast this on a trap, you must know that the trap exists and its precise location. A trap can only have one improvement from this spell at a time. A second casting changes the improvement on the trap, but does not add another improvement.z
