Upon the ritual's completion, the dead body is restored to life, as per true resurrection. Unlike that spell's limitation, there is no limit as to how long the body has been dead before it can be restored to life in this manner, but bodies whose souls have been judged and sent on to the afterlife (GM's discretion) cannot be restored to life via this ritual. A creature can be restored to life via an ouroboros blood ritual only once through all time.Rinstantaneous
