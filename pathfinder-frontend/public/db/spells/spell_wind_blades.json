  "description": "You harden the air around the target into jagged invisible blades that deal damage based on how fast the target moves. On its turn, the target takes 1d6 points of slashing damage if it moves at least 5 feet, plus 1d6 points of slashing damage for each additional 10 feet of movement. Movement that doesn\u0027t pass through air (such as burrowing, swimming, or teleportation) doesn\u0027t cause this damage.",
