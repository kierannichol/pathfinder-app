  "description": "You implant a false psychometric reading into an object, imbuing the item with misleading information that might be learned from the object reading spell or through the psychometry occult skill unlock (see page 196). This information might fool enemies, create a false history, or pass on secret messages through objects to psychically attuned allies. You can implant any information you wish that could be implanted by the charge object spell, as well as up to one piece of information per 3 levels that could be attained using psychometry or the object reading spell. You can detail this information in any way you see fit, either making up a previous owner and circumstances involving the object from whole cloth, or attempting to emulate the biographical information and fictional accounts of a specific individual\u0027s experience with the object."
