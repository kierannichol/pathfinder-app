  "description": "This spell extracts the air from the target\u0027s lungs, causing swift suffocation. The target can attempt to resist this spell\u0027s effects with a Fortitude save--if he succeeds, he is merely staggered for 1 round as he gasps for breath. If the target fails, he immediately begins to suffocate. On the target\u0027s next turn, he falls unconscious and is reduced to 0 hit points. One round later, the target drops to –1 hit points and is dying. One round after that, the target dies. Each round, the target can delay that round\u0027s effects from occurring by making a successful Fortitude save, but the spell effect continues for 3 rounds, and each time a target fails his Fortitude save, he moves one step further along the track to suffocation. This spell only affects living creatures that must breathe. It is impossible to defeat the effects of this spell by simply holding one\u0027s breath--if the victim fails the initial saving throw, the air in his lungs is extracted.Suffocation, Mass",
