  "description": "You mark the target with a black marking on its skin; the mark\u0027s exact appearance determined by you, but can be no larger than your hand. The black markfunctions as a mark of justice, and when the mark is activated, the target becomes shaken anytime it is on or in the water more than a 5 feet from shore. In addition, as long as the black markis active, the target is affected as if subject to nature\u0027s exile, but all creatures with the aquatic or water subtype or with a swim speed are made hostile, even those not of the animal type, though non-aquatic animals are not.Mythic Black Mark",
