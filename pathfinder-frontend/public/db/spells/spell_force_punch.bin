Your successful melee touch attack deals 1d4 points of force damage per level (maximum 10d4) and causes the target to be pushed away from you in a straight line up to 5 feet per two caster levels. For every size category of the target above Medium, reduce the distance pushed by 5 feet (â€“5 feet for Large, â€“10 feet for Huge, â€“15 for Gargantuan, and â€“20 feet for Colossal) to a minimum of 0 feet. A successful Fortitude save negates the movement but not the damage.Mythic Force Punchz
