  "description": "You levitate the target a few inches off the ground, removing solid footing and halving the target\u0027s speed. The target also takes a –4 penalty to CMD against bull rush, drag, and reposition attempts. A targeted creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a –1 penalty on attack rolls, the second –2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of –5. A full-round action spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at –1.",
