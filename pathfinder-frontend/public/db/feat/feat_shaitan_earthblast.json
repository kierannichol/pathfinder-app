  "benefitText": "While using the Shaitan Style feat, as a standard action, you can spend two Elemental Fist (Advanced Player\u0027s Guide 158) attempts to unleash a 20-foot column of acid that has a 5-foot radius and erupts from a point of origin within 30 feet of you. Creatures caught in the column take your unarmed strike damage plus the acid damage from your Elemental Fist and are staggered for 1 round. A successful Ref lex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modif ier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from being staggered."
