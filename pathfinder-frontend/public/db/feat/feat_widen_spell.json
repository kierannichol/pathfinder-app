  "benefitText": "You can alter a burst, emanation, or spread-shaped spell to increase its area. Any numeric measurements of the spell\u0027s area increase by 100%. A widened spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell\u0027s actual level. Spells that do not have an area of one of these four sorts are not affected by this feat."
