  "benefitText": "Once per round, when wielding a bludgeoning weapon in each hand against a creature with the giant subtype, if you hit the creature with your off-hand weapon after you hit with your primary weapon, roll the damage dice for your off-hand weapon twice and add the results together before adding any bonuses. Such extra weapon damage dice are not multiplied on a critical hit."
