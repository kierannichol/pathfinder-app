  "benefitText": "You gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks with divinations to overcome spell resistance or effects that impede divination (for example, nondetection). When using a divination spell that requires concentration, you gain information from the spell 1 round sooner than normal (so you gain information from the first 2 rounds with 1 round of concentration, and information from the third round in the second round of concentration)."
