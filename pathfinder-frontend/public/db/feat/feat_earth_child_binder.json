  "benefitText": "You can trip a creature of the giant subtype no matter its size. While you are using Earth Child Style, when a prone creature of the giant subtype stands up and provokes an attack of opportunity from you, if you make an unarmed strike, you can declare you are making a Stunning Fist attempt after the attack hits. You gain a +4 bonus to the DC of any Stunning Fist effect you deliver in this way.",
