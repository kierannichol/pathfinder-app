Whenever you wield a weapon that has \"orc\" in its name, you gain the benefit you chose so long as you are actually proficient with that weapon. Bully: Gain a +1 bonus on damage rolls against creatures at least one size smaller than you. Defender: Gain a +1 shield bonus to your AC (or +2 if wielding a two-handed weapon). Disrupter: Add +3 to opponents\u0027 concentration checks to cast a spell within your threatened area. This only applies if you are aware of the enemy\u0027s location and are capable of taking an attack of opportunity. If you have already used all of your available attacks of opportunity for the round, this increase does not apply. Killer: Gain a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls made to confirm critical hits. Thug: Deal +1 point of nonlethal damage with the weapon. Trickster: Gain a +2 bonus on a single type of combat maneuver check that you can perform with that weapon. This feat has no effect if you are not proficient with the weapon you\u0027re using.",
