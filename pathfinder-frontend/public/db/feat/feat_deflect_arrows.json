  "benefit": "You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged weapon, you may def lect it so that you take no damage from it. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to def lect a ranged attack doesn\u0027t count as an action. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects can\u0027t be def lected.",
