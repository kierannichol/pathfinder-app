  "benefitText": "Your melee attacks ignore the miss chance for less than total concealment. You may still reroll your miss chance percentile roll for total concealment. If you successfully pinpoint an invisible or hidden attacker within 30 feet, that attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you with ranged attacks. That is, you don\u0027t lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn\u0027t get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible.",
  "specialText": "The Improved Blind-Fight feat is of no use against a character who is the subject of a blink spell."
