When you wish to cast a gnome magic spell-like ability for which you have no daily uses remaining, you can expend this independent use to do so. Further, while you are under the effect of haunted fey aspect (page 230), you can discharge that spell as a free action after you hit an opponent with a charge attack or score a critical hit against an opponent. If you do, that opponent becomes shaken for 1 round.
