  "types": ["FEAT_TYPE_COMBAT"],
  "description": "When wielding a monk weapon, your attacks can be extremely precise.",
  "prerequisites": "Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8.",
  "prerequisitesFormula": "@dex_score \u003e\u003d 13 AND @wis_score \u003e\u003d 13 AND @feat:improved_unarmed_strike AND @bab \u003e\u003d 8",
  "benefit": "You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). You must use one of the following weapons to make the attack: kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, and siangham. You can roll your attack roll twice and take the higher result. If one of these rolls is a critical threat, the other roll is used as your confirmation roll (your choice if they are both critical threats). You may attempt a perfect attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round.",
  "special": "A weapon master monk or zen archer monk receives Perfect Strike as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A monk may attempt an perfect strike attack a number of times per day equal to his monk level, plus one more time per day for every four levels he has in classes other than monk.",
