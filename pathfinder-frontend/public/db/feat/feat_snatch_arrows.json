  "description": "Instead of knocking an arrow or ranged attack aside, you can catch it in mid-flight.",
  "prerequisites": "Dex 15, Deflect Arrows, Improved Unarmed Strike.",
  "prerequisitesFormula": "@dex_score \u003e\u003d 15 AND @feat:deflect_arrows AND @feat:improved_unarmed_strike",
  "benefit": "When using the Def lect Arrows feat you may choose to catch the weapon instead of just def lecting it. Thrown weapons can immediately be thrown back as an attack against the original attacker (even though it isn\u0027t your turn) or kept for later use. You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat.",
