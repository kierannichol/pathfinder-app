  "name": "Sympathetic Rage",
  "types": ["FEAT_TYPE_COMBAT"],
  "description": "Seeing an ally rage fills you with your own fury.",
  "prerequisites": "Half-orc or orc, nonlawful.",
  "prerequisitesFormula": "(@race:half_orc OR @race:orc) AND (@alignment:ng OR @alignment:cg OR @alignment:n OR @alignment:cn OR @alignment:ne OR @alignment:ce)",
  "benefit": "Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who is raging, you may choose to enter a similar but less powerful rage as a free action on your turn. This weaker rage gives you all the benefits and penalties of a barbarian\u0027s rage, except your morale bonus to Strength and Constitution is only +2. There is no limit to how long you can rage, as long as you remain adjacent to a raging ally (for example, you could take a 5-foot step away from one raging ally toward another raging ally and maintain your rage). As with a barbarian\u0027s rage, when this weaker rage ends, you are fatigued. You cannot use this feat if you are fatigued.",
