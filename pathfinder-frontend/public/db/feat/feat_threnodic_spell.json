  "benefit": "This feat only works on mind-affecting spells. A threnodic spell affects undead creatures (even mindless undead) as if they weren\u0027t immune to mind-affecting effects, but has no effect on living creatures. A threnodic spell uses up a spell slot two level higher than the spell\u0027s actual level.",
