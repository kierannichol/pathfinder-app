  "benefitText": "Targets affected by a disruptive spell must make concentration checks when using spells or spell-like abilities (DC equals the save DC of the disruptive spell plus the level of the spell being cast) for 1 round. Targets that avoid the spell\u0027s effects avoid this feat\u0027s effect as well. A disruptive spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell\u0027s actual level."
