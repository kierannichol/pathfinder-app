Roll the weapon's damage dice for the attack four times and add the results together before adding bonuses from Strength, weapon abilities (such as flaming), precision-based damage (such as sneak attack), and other damage bonuses. These extra weapon damage dice are not multiplied on a critical hit, but are added to the total.
