  "types": ["FEAT_TYPE_GENERAL"],
  "description": "You know the principles of arcane dueling, and when fighting other spellcasters, you have learned to hide the true nature of your spells until the last possible moment.",
  "prerequisites": "Bluff 5 ranks, Spellcraft 5 ranks.",
  "prerequisitesFormula": "@skill:bluff \u003e\u003d 5 AND @skill:spellcraft \u003e\u003d 5",
  "benefit": "If another spellcaster tries to counterspell your casting, she adds +4 to her Spellcraft DC when trying to determine your spell. Because you have studied how to mask the recognizable elements of your spellcasting, you gain a +2 bonus on your Spellcraft checks to identify and counter an opponent\u0027s spell if it is a spell you know or have in your spellbook.",
