  "prerequisitesFormula": "@feat:critical_focus AND @feat:weapon_specialization#selected_piercing_melee_weapon AND @bab \u003e\u003d 11",
  "benefit": "Whenever you score a critical hit with the selected piercing melee weapon, you can impale your opponent on your weapon. While your opponent is impaled in this way, each time he starts his turn, you deal damage equal to your weapon\u0027s damage dice plus the extra damage dice from your weapon\u0027s properties. As an immediate action, you can pull your weapon out of your opponent. If your opponent is ever outside your reach, you must spend a free action to let go of your weapon or pull it out of him. Your opponent can also spend a move action to pull your weapon out. When the weapon comes out, your opponent takes damage as if starting his turn impaled. While you impale your opponent with your weapon, you cannot use it to attack, and you must hold on to it.",
