  "benefitText": "Whenever an opponent misses you with a melee attack, you may move 5 feet as an immediate action so long as you remain within that opponent\u0027s threatened area. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If you take this step, you cannot take a 5-foot step during your next turn. If you take an action to move during your next turn, subtract 5 feet from your total movement."
