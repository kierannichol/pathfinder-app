If you make a successful unarmed strike against an opponent, in addition to dealing your unarmed strike damage, you can spend a swift action to deliver the effects of the chosen bloodline power to that opponent. Doing so provokes no attacks of opportunity.ÂuYou can take this feat multiple times. Each time you take it, you apply it to a different qualifying bloodline power.
