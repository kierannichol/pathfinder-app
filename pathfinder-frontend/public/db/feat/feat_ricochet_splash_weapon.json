  "benefitText": "Whenever your splash weapon misses and the misdirection roll indicates it lands in a square occupied by a creature, you may make an attack roll (at a -5 penalty) as if you had thrown the splash weapon at that creature. If this attack roll succeeds, the splash weapon hits and the creature takes full damage instead of splash damage. Squares adjacent to this creature still take splash damage as normal.",
