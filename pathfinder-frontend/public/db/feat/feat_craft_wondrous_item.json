  "benefitText": "You can create a wide variety of magic wondrous items. Crafting a wondrous item takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its price. To create a wondrous item, you must use up raw materials costing half of its base price. See the magic item creation rules in Chapter 15 for more information. You can also mend a broken or destroyed wondrous item if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the raw materials and half the time it would take to craft that item."
