  "description": "You can sacrifice multiple attacks to make a single devastating strike.",
  "prerequisites": "Improved Unarmed Strike, Tiger Style, base attack bonus +6 or monk level 5th.",
  "prerequisitesFormula": "(@feat:improved_unarmed_strike AND @feat:tiger_style AND @bab \u003e\u003d 6) OR @class:monk \u003e\u003d 5 AND  !@feat:tiger_claws",
  "benefit": "While you are using the Tiger Style feat and have both hands free, you can use a full-round action to make a single unarmed strike with both hands. Use your highest base attack bonus, rolling unarmed strike damage for each hand separately and multiplying both if you score a critical hit. If you use Power Attack in conjunction with this attack, can add half your Strength bonus to one of the damage rolls. If you hit, you can attempt a bull rush maneuver with a +2 bonus on the combat maneuver check. This bull rush attempt provokes no attack of opportunity from your opponent, but you cannot move with that opponent if your bull rush is successful.",
