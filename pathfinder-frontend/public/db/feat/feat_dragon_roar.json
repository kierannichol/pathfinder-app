  "benefitText": "You gain one additional Stunning Fist attempt per day. While using Dragon Style, as a standard action you can expend two Stunning Fist attempts to unleash a concussive roar in a 15-foot cone. Creatures caught in the cone take your unarmed strike damage and become shaken for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from being shaken.",
  "specialText": "If you have the Elemental Fist feat (Advanced Player\u0027s Guide 158), you can expend a daily use of that feat to deal your Elemental Fist damage to those caught in the cone. This damage is not halved even on a save."
