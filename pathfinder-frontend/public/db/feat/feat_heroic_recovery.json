  "benefitText": "Once per day as a standard action you may attempt a new saving throw against a harmful condition or aff liction requiring a Fortitude save that is affecting you. If this save against the aff liction fails, there is no additional effect, but a successful save counts toward curing an aff liction such as poison or disease. You cannot use this feat to recover from instantaneous effects, effects that do not allow a saving throw, or effects that do not require a Fortitude save."
