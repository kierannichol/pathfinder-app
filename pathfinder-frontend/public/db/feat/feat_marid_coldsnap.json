  "benefit": "While using Marid Style, as a standard action, you can spend two Elemental Fist (Advanced Player\u0027s Guide 158) attempts to unleash a 30-foot line of frigid water. Creatures caught in the line take your unarmed strike damage plus the cold damage from your Elemental Fist attack and are entangled in ice as per the Marid Spirit feat. A successful Ref lex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from becoming entangled.",
