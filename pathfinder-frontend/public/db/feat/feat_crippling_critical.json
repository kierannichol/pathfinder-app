  "name": "Crippling Critical",
  "types": ["FEAT_TYPE_COMBAT"],
  "description": "You are able to maim a target and hinder its movement.",
  "prerequisites": "Critical Focus, base attack bonus +13.",
  "prerequisitesFormula": "@feat:critical_focus AND @bab \u003e\u003d 13",
  "benefit": "Whenever you score a critical hit against an opponent, its speed is halved for 1 minute. A successful Fortitude save reduces this duration to 1d4 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. Against creatures with multiple types of movement, you must choose which movement type to affect. A flying creature hit by this attack must make a DC 10 Fly check to remain airborne, and has its maneuverability reduced by one step.",
  "special": "You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess Critical Mastery.",
