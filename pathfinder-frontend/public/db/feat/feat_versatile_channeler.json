  "types": ["FEAT_TYPE_GENERAL"],
  "description": "You can choose to channel positive and negative energy.",
  "prerequisites": "Channel energy class feature, necromancer or neutrally aligned cleric (see below).",
  "prerequisitesFormula": "(@ability:channel_energy#warpriest OR @class:necromancer OR (@class:cleric AND (@alignment:ng OR @alignment:n OR @alignment:ne)))",
  "benefit": "You may make a choice whenever you use your channel energy class feature. If you normally channel positive energy, you may choose to channel negative energy as if your effective cleric level were 2 levels lower than normal. If you normally channel negative energy, you may choose to channel positive energy as if your effective cleric level were 2 levels lower than normal. Having this feat means you qualify for feats and abilities that have \"channel positive energy\" or \"channel negative energy\" as a prerequisite (for example, you qualify for the Command Undead feat and the Turn Undead feat).",
