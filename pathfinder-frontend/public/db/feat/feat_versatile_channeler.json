  "benefitText": "You may make a choice whenever you use your channel energy class feature. If you normally channel positive energy, you may choose to channel negative energy as if your effective cleric level were 2 levels lower than normal. If you normally channel negative energy, you may choose to channel positive energy as if your effective cleric level were 2 levels lower than normal. Having this feat means you qualify for feats and abilities that have \"channel positive energy\" or \"channel negative energy\" as a prerequisite (for example, you qualify for the Command Undead feat and the Turn Undead feat)."
