    "text": "At 13th level, as a standard action, a cad can use a dirty trickmaneuver against any two adjacent opponents that he can reach, making a separate combat maneuver check against each opponent. He must use the same dirty trick maneuver against each opponent. At 17th level, the cad can use this ability as a full-round action to attempt a dirty trick maneuver against a number of enemies equal to 2 + his Dexterity bonus (if any).\nThis ability replaces weapon training 3 and 4."
