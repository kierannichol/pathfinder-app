    "text": "These short matching swords come in pairs, cleverly nested together to appear as a single blade. Both weapons can be drawn at the same time, and they can be separated as a free action and wielded in both hands to make wickedly effective chops and slashes. Their thin, broad blades extend just 1 foot in length. A butterfly sword has a hardwood grip covered with braided cord, and a metal D-shaped guard to protect the wielder\u0027s hand. The listed price is for a pair of butterfly swords. Masterwork butterfly swords cost 320 gp for the pair. If you add magical enhancement bonuses or properties to a butterfly sword, treat each sword in the pair as a separate weapon (for example, adding a +1 magical enhancement bonus to a pair of masterwork butterfly swords costs 4,000 gp)."
