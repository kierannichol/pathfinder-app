    "text": "Also called a three-section staff, this weapon is divided into three 2-footlong segments chained together, allowing the wielder greater flexibility than a normal staff and allowing the weapon to be swung rapidly to create a defensive block, wrap and catch weapons, or harness momentum via a whipping motion for powerful strikes."
