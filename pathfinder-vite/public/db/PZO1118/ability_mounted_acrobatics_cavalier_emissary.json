    "text": "At 9th level, an emissary is even more adept at hopping on and off his steed, and even dropping alongside its flanks mid-gallop. He gains Trick Riding as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. The emissary can employ this feat even when wearing medium armor.\nThis ability replaces greater tactician."
