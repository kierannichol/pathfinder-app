    "text": "The shotel is a downward-curving sword designed to reach over or around an opponent\u0027s shield. You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls with a shotel against opponents using bucklers, light shields, or heavy shields. The curve of a shotel\u0027s blade varies from sword to sword, and some models are double-edged, while others are single-edged, with the back edge able to be braced against a shield for additional power. Shotels are particularly useful for hooking mounted combatants and ripping them from their steeds.",
