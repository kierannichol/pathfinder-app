    "text": "At 15th level, as a swift action, a tactician can grant his Intelligence modifier as an insight bonus on the attack rolls made by a single ally within line of sight that can both see and hear the tactician. That ally gains the bonus until the end of the tactician\u0027s next turn. The tactician can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier."
