    "text": "At 4th level, when a kensai hits with his chosen weapon, he can spend 1 point from his arcane pool in order to maximize his weapon damage. Don\u0027t roll for damage--the weapon deals maximum damage. This affects only the weapon\u0027s base damage dice, not additional damage from sneak attack, magical weapon properties, spellstrike, or critical hits. If the kensai confirms a critical hit, he can instead spend 2 points from his arcane pool to increase his weapon\u0027s critical multiplier by 1.\nThis ability replaces spell recall."
