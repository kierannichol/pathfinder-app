    "text": "At 8th level, once per day, a sanctified rogue can peer into the immediate future and predict the results of a specific action as if she had cast an augury spell. The caster level of this spell is equal to the sanctified rogue\u0027s rogue class level.\nThis ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.\nRogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement the sanctified rogue archetype: esoteric scholar, major magic, and minor magic."
