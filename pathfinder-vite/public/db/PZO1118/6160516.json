    "text": "The lightest of armors typically favored by samurai, do-maru wraps around the wearer\u0027s body like a short armored coat. It consists primarily of lamellar and lacks a solid breastplate or sleeves, leaving the shoulders and upper body somewhat exposed, but permitting the wearer greater flexibility than do the majority of heavier armors."
