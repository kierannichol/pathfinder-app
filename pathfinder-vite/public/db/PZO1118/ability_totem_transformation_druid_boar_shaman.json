    "text": "At 2nd level, a boar shaman may adopt an aspect of the boar while retaining her normal form. She gains one of the following bonuses:\nmovement (+10 enhancement bonus to land speed) senses (low-light vision, scent) natural weapons (gore [1d8 for a Medium druid], +2 on combat maneuver checks to overrun) toughness (+2 natural armor bonus to AC, Endurance feat)\nWhile using totem transformation, the boar shaman may speak normally and can cast speak with animals (boars and related animals only) at will. Using this ability is a standard action at 2nd level, a move action at 7th level, and a swift action at 12th level. The boar shaman can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her druid level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be used in 1-minute increments. This is a polymorph effect and cannot be used while the druid is using another polymorph effect, such as wild shape.\nThis ability replaces woodland stride."
