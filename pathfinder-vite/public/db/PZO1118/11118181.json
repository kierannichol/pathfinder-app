    "text": "Ammunition in the target firearm generates less of an explosive charge when fired. With such ammunition, the firearm\u0027s range increment is halved and the firer takes a â€“2 penalty on damage rolls. If aware of this spell\u0027s effect prior to firing the altered ammunition (a DC 16 Spellcraft check to identify the spell being cast or similar effect), the firearm\u0027s user can spend a standard action to clear the altered ammunition from the firearm. Doing so destroys that ammunition."
