    "text": "All melee is up close and personal, but some warriors bring it as close as they can get. Brawlers can be found anywhere, among all races and societies. A brawler could be hired muscle in a tavern, a local crime syndicate enforcer, or a hotheaded recruit among the ranks of a baron\u0027s guard. Often brawlers\u0027 in-your-face attitudes are as powerful as their tactics."
