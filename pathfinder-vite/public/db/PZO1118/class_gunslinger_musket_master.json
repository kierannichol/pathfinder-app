    "text": "Pistols and other one-handed firearms are often easy to conceal and faster to load than other firearms, and do sufficient damage for most situations. But some gunslingers want a little more firepower and range. These are the musket masters; the best of these gunslingers can reload a musket with dazzling speed, potentially putting even their pistol-wielding brethren to shame."
