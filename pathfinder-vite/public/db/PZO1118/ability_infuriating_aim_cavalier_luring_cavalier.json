    "text": "At 11th level, when a luring cavalier confirms a critical hit with a ranged attack made at his highest base attack bonus against the target of a far challenge, the target becomes infuriated for 1 round. While infuriated, the target must spend its turn moving closer to the cavalier, making move, run, or charge actions only (challenged creature\u0027s choice). This is a mind-affecting effect.\nThis ability replaces mighty charge."
