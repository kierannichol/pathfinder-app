    "text": "At 11th level, a tactician can expend two uses of her weal\u0027s champion ability at once to enhance its effects. This functions as weal\u0027s champion, except the bonus she provides to her allies lasts until each creature she strikes is slain, her weal\u0027s champion ability expires, or the paladin herself is slain or knocked unconscious, whichever happens first.\nThis ability replaces aura of justice."
