    "text": "This weapon is used to augment unarmed martial techniques. It consists of an 8- to 10-inch-long, dual-pointed steel spike set on swivels and mounted on a ring, so that it can be spun around at high speeds when slipped over the wielder\u0027s ring finger. The ring prevents the wielder from being disarmed and turns unarmed strikes into piercing attacks."
