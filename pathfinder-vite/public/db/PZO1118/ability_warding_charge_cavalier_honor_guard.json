    "text": "At 11th level, an honor guard can flash across the battlefield to protect his ward against the target of his challenge. Whenever the target of the honor guard\u0027s challenge makes an attack against his ward, the honor guard can move up to his speed and make a single melee attack against the target of his challenge as an immediate action. This movement and attack can be made as a charge if the movement qualifies.\nThis ability replaces mighty charge."
