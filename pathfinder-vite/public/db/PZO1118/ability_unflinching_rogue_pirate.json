    "text": "Pirates are a salty and steadfast lot. At 3rd level, a pirate gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against fear and mind-affecting effects. This bonus increases by +1 for every three levels, to a maximum of +6 at 18th level.\nThis ability replaces trap sense.\nRogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement the pirate archetype: black market connections, combat trick, finesse rogue, firearm training, hold breath, rope master, and strong stroke."
