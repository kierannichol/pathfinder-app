    "text": "The rigor and care required by arcane guns is so great that a spellslinger forsakes four schools of magic. These opposition schools are chosen at 1st level and cannot be changed later. A spellslinger who prepares a spell from his opposition school must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. In addition, the spellslinger takes a â€“4 penalty on any skill checks made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition schools as a prerequisite."
