    "text": "This small, curved pull dagger has a metal loop at the base of its handle, allowing it to be secured with a pinky or worn on a string tied in the hair. While relatively small, the curved blade can create brutal wounds. Easily concealed (you gain a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a kerambit on your body), it is a favorite weapon of ninja and assassins."
