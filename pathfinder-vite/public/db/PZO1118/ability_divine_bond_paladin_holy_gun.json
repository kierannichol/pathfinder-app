    "text": "At 5th level, a holy gun forms a bond with her deity. This functions as the paladin\u0027s divine bond ability, except the bond must always take the form of a firearm. In addition to the listed abilities, a holy gun can add the distance, reliable, or seeking special abilities to her weapon, but she cannot add the defending or disruption special abilities."
