    "text": "At 4th level, a warden forms a bond with the land itself, enabling him to direct others in such terrain. When in his favored terrain, the warden grants all allies within line of sight and that can hear him a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks. Also, as long as they travel with him, the warden\u0027s allies leave no trail and can\u0027t be tracked. The warden can choose for the group to leave a trail, or even for specific members of the group to leave a trail if he so desires."
