    "text": "At 9th level, a tetori can spend 1 point from his ki pool to suppress his opponents\u0027 freedom of movement and magical bonuses to Escape Artist or on checks to escape a grapple. At 13th level, this ability also duplicates the effect of dimensional anchor. At 17th level, the tetori\u0027s unarmed strike gains the ghost touch special ability, and an incorporeal creature that he strikes gains the grappled condition (Reflex negates, DC 10 + 1/2 the wrestler\u0027s level + his Wisdom modifier). Inescapable grasp is a swift action and lasts until the beginning of the wrestler\u0027s next turn."
