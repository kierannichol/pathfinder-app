    "text": "The target is suddenly beset with unexplainable doubts about the effectiveness of its actions and the righteousness of its cause. The creature takes a â€“10 penalty on its ability checks, skill checks, and concentration checks, until the duration ends, or until it spends its entire turn doing absolutely nothing (it spends a full-round action gaining focus). Spending an entire turn doing nothing discharges the spell."
