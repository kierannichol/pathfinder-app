    "text": "This spell works like mirror image, except the illusory doubles it creates discharge an electric shock when destroyed. An opponent that uses a melee attack to destroy one of your images takes 2d6 points of electricity damage. You must overcome a target\u0027s spell resistance the first time you deal this electricity damage to it. Failure renders the target immune to damage from this spell."
