    "text": "At 5th level, a wild rager who fails a saving throw against any mind-affecting effect can attempt a new saving throw at the beginning of her next turn. If the save succeeds, that effect ends and she instead rages and becomes confused as noted above.\nThis ability replaces improved uncanny dodge."
