    "text": "The front of this buckler is fitted with a small, double-barreled gun that can be shot while wearing the buckler. Unlike with a double-barreled pistol, you can shoot only one barrel at a time. You must remove the buckler to reload the gun. Each barrel of a buckler gun uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. Because of its awkward construction, a buckler gun is always considered an off-handed weapon. This is an early firearm.",
