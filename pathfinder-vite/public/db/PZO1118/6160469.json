    "text": "This twin-barreled shotgun can be shot one barrel at a time, or both together as one attack. A double shot that fires bullets is inaccurate, and takes a â€“4 penalty on both attacks. A double shot that fires bullets targets only a single creature and increases the damage of each barrel to 2d6 points (Small) or 2d8 points (Medium) for a total of 4d6 or 4d8 points of damage. A doublebarreled shotgun uses metal cartridges (loaded with either a bullet or pellets) as ammunition. This is an advanced firearm."
