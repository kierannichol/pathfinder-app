    "text": "At 3rd level, an honor guard learns to better disrupt the attacks of his enemies. He gains Bodyguard as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisite. In addition, whenever the honor guard uses the aid another action to increase an ally\u0027s Armor Class, the bonus to Armor Class granted by the aid another action increases by +1.\nThis ability replaces cavalier\u0027s charge."
