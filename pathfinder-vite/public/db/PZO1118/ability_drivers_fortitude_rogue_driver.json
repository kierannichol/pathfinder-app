    "text": "At 3rd level, the driver learns to keep driving and maintain control of her vehicle, even when mortally wounded. If the driver drops below 0 hit points but is not dead, she can attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save each round to remain conscious and in control of her vehicle, though she may take no other actions.\nThis ability replaces trap sense.\nRogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement the driver archetype: firearm training and getaway artist."
