    "text": "The strange rituals needed to empower all forms of siege engines takes a level of dedication and perseverance that limits a wizard\u0027s time to unlock other arcane mysteries. At 1st level, the siege mage forsakes three schools of magic. Once chosen, these opposition schools cannot be changed. A siege mage who prepares spells from his opposition school must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. In addition, the siege mage takes a â€“4 penalty on any skill checks made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition schools."
