éThe unbreakable is a warrior of indomitable will, unstoppable and implacable once he has set his mind upon a course of action. The unbreakable endures any trial to do what must be done, and when his mind is set toward a goal, nothing can stop him from achieving it, though many may try. He is a juggernaut and a zealot, supremely confident in his own abilities.ªÃ
