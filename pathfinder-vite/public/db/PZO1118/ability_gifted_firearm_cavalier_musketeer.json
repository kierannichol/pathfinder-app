    "text": "At 1st level, a musketeer is gifted by his order with a firearm (either a pistol or a musket). This weapon is both a symbol of the cavalier\u0027s duty and a focus for much of his talent. He cannot sell this weapon. He also gains the Gunsmithing feat. Beginning at 8th level, the musketeer can focus himself when wielding his gifted weapon. As a standard action, he can focus himself to gain a number of benefits for 1 minute per cavalier level. The musketeer can use this ability twice per day, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 8th, to a total of five times per day at 20th level.\nAt 8th level, the cavalier gains the benefit of the Improved Critical feat. At 11th level, he can reduce the misfire chance of his weapon by 1 (to a minimum of 1, and at 17th level, the musketeer can double the range increment of his weapon. These abilities do not stack with the magical weapon special abilities that they duplicate. Finally, at 20th level, during a period of such focus, the musketeer can engage in a flurry of gunfire. The cavalier can expend one of his daily challenges to make a full attack with his firearm. The musketeer ignores the normal load times for his weapon, but must still expend enough doses of powder and enough bullets to complete each attack.\nIf the musketeer\u0027s gifted firearm is destroyed, the cavalier loses this ability for 30 days while a replacement weapon is crafted for him. During this 30-day period, the musketeer takes a â€“1 penalty on weapon and damage rolls."
