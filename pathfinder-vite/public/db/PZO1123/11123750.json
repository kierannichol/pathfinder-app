    "text": "This +1/+1 quarterstaff is hollow, drilled through with numerous tiny holes, and whistles when swung and spun. Once per day as a standard action, the wielder may spin the hurricane quarterstaff and create a gust of wind (DC 13 Fortitude negates). A monk or ninja wielding a hurricane quarterstaff can also spend 1 ki point to activate the staff\u0027s gust of wind power; the save DC when activating this power with ki is equal to 12 + the wielder\u0027s Wisdom modifier."
