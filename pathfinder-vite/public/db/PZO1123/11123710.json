    "text": "This 4-foot-by-6-foot framed painting is a detailed portrait of a particular intelligent creature, animated to show movement or action within the painted scene. The image reacts when questioned, with the creature turning to face the viewer and responding appropriately. The image is a magical effect with no actual intelligence, but is programmed with up to ten 25- word verbal responses and can respond to questions if these responses seem appropriate. For example, if one of the programmed responses is the name of the person shown in the portrait, it can answer questions such as \"who are you?\" and \"what is your name?\" If the item crafter is familiar with or has the cooperation of the creature depicted in the painting, the illusory image has the voice and mannerisms of that creature."
