ÕArmor and shields with this special ability excel at blocking the attacks of certain types of creatures, similar to a bane weaponâ€™s excelling against certain foes. Against the designated foe, the itemâ€™s enhancement bonus to AC is +2 better than its actual bonus and provides DR 2/â€” against attacks from that foe. This increase in enhancement bonus applies only to the armor or shieldâ€™s enhancement bonus, not to temporary bonuses (such as the magic vestment spell). To randomly determine the armor or shieldâ€™s designated foe, use the table for the bane weapon special ability (page 136).
