    "text": "This +3 Large returning warhammer deals 2d6 points of damage on a successful hit. In the hands of a wielder who wears a belt of giant strength and knows the weapon is a hammer of thunderbolts (not just the +3 warhammer it appears to be), it becomes a +5 Large giant-bane returning thundering warhammer with the following two properties.\nFirst, when the bearer makes a successful thrown attack with the hammer, the hammer emits a powerful clap of thunder, causing all creatures within 90 feet to be stunned for 1 round (Fortitude DC 15 negates); the wielder is not immune to this effect. Second, the hammer\u0027s range increment increases to 30 feet.",

      "Destruction": "A hammer of thunderbolts is destroyed if heated in a fire giant\u0027s forge and quenched in the blood of a good-aligned humanoid, which causes the iron of the hammer to become so brittle it shatters the next time it is used to strike. Only bathing it in a fire giant\u0027s blood can reverse the hammer\u0027s brittleness; once the hammer is shattered, though, not even this can repair it. If it is bathed in the blood of a fire giant king or queen, it temporarily gains two additional powers for the next 9 days: the bearer gains resistance 30 against fire and sonic damage, and gains immunity to the stunning effect of the hammer\u0027s clap of thunder."
