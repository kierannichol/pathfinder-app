    "text": "These bejeweled and shining bracers initially appear to be bracers of armor +5 and actually serve as such until the wearer is attacked in anger by an enemy with a Challenge Rating equal to or greater than her level. At that moment and thereafter, the bracers bestow a â€“5 penalty to AC. Once their curse is activated, bracers of defenselessness can be removed only by means of a remove curse spell."
