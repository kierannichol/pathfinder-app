When used in this way, the buckler\u0027s enhancement bonus increases by +2 against that attack. The buckler\u0027s user must decide to use this ability before the attack roll is made. When the shield\u0027s user blocks a melee attack in this way, it cannot use its arrow deflection special ability for 1 round."
