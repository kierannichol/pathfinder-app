    "text": "A corrosive burst weapon functions as a corrosive weapon that explodes with searing acid upon striking a successful critical hit. The acid does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra acid damage from the corrosive special ability, a corrosive burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of acid damage on a successful critical hit. If the weaponâ€™s critical modifier is x3, add an extra 2d10 points of acid damage instead, and if the modifier is x4, add an extra 3d10 points. Even if the corrosive ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra acid damage on a successful critical hit."
