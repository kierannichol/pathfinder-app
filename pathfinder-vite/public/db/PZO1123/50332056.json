As long as he wears the gloves, creatures conjured by the wearer can understand him as if they shared a common language. This communication is not two-way and does not grant the wearer the ability to understand the creature.\nThree times per day, the wearer can attempt to take control of a summoned creature within 50 feet as if using control summoned creature (Will DC 16)."
