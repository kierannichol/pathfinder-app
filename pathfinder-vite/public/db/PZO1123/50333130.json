    "text": "When staked down with eight pitons (four on each side of the gap), this rope and slat bridge can support up to 1,500 pounds and span a 30-foot gap. It rolls up into a parcel that can be carried slung over the back or by a pack animal. Convincing an animal to cross a portable bridge requires the come or heel trick."
