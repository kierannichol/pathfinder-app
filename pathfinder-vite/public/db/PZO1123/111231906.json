    "text": "This normal-appearing garment is attuned to one of three types of alignment. It can be white (01–45 on d%, good alignment), gray (46–75, neither good nor evil alignment), or black (76–100, evil alignment). To most wearers, the robe offers no powers or has no effects unless the wearer\u0027s alignment doesn\u0027t match that of the robe (see below). Only an arcane spellcaster can fully realize this potent magic item\u0027s powers once the robe is donned. These powers are as follows."
