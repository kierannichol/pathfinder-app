±This platinum key can open nearly any lock or door with a mere touch. With a touch of the key, a lock of DC 40 or lower unlocks. When a creature holding the key attempts to break down a door with a break (locked) DC of 28 or lower, the door is broken and opened. In all other cases it grants the creature possessing Perfection's Key a +10 bonus on Disable Device checks to pick locks, and a +10 bonus on attempts to break down doors.û
DestructionëSomewhere in the planes there is said to be an Impossible Lock â€”a mechanism so perfect that only this key can thwart it. If Perfection's Key is inserted into the Impossible Lock, the key is destroyed, but unlocks the Impossible Lock.
