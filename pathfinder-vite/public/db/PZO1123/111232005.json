    "text": "This long, loose-fitting coat grants a +4 armor bonus to AC and a +2 luck bonus to the wearer\u0027s touch AC against firearm attacks. If the wearer is a gunslinger or has the Amateur Gunslinger feat (see Ultimate Combat), she begins each day with 1 additional grit point. This extra point does not increase her maximum grit total. When the wearer uses the gunslinger\u0027s dodge deed, the deed\u0027s dodge bonuses to AC increase by +1. If the wearer is not a gunslinger, she may use the gunslinger\u0027s dodge deed once per day."
