    "text": "Wearing this animal-hair cloak grants a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws. Furthermore, the wearer can force its teeth to grow rapidly up to five times per day as a swift action. The oversized teeth last for 1 round, during which time the wearer can make a bite attack. Treat this attack as a primary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (or 1d4 if the wearer is Small). If the wearer already has a bite attack, the damage of that bite attack increases by one step (Bestiary 302)."
