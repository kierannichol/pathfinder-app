    "text": "An allying weapon allows the wielder to transfer some or all of the weapon’s enhancement bonus to one weapon being used by an ally of the wielder. The wielder must have line of sight to the intended ally. As a free action, at the start of her turn before using her weapon, the wielder chooses how to allocate her weapon’s enhancement bonus. The bonus to the ally’s weapon lasts until the allying weapon’s wielder’s next turn. The enhancement bonus from the allying weapon does not stack with the enhancement bonus on the ally’s weapon (if any)."
