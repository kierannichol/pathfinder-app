    "text": "Horseshoes of crushing blows grant an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls made with hoof attacks; this bonus varies based on the item\u0027s price. Alternatively, as described for the amulet of mighty fists, they can grant hooves melee weapon special abilities so long as they can be applied to unarmed attacks. Horseshoes of crushing blows cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +5. Horseshoes of crushing blows are crafted as sets of four, with each shoe in the set bearing the same enhancements. All four shoes must be worn by the same animal to be effective.\nHorseshoes of crushing blows may be crafted out of special materials, gaining the usual benefits. For purposes of pricing, they count as a single one-handed weapon weighing 4 pounds (for example, adamantine horseshoes of crushing blows would cost an additional 3,000 gp). The materials needed to make cold iron horseshoes of crushing blows add no extra costs in and of themselves, but enhancing cold iron horseshoes of crushing blows increases the price by the usual 2,000 gp."
