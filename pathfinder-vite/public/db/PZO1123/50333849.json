    "text": "This armor or shield is brightly polished, and its mirror-bright surface is magically endowed with the ability to bring comfort to the wearer’s companions. Allies within 30 feet of the wearer gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. If the wearer has an ability that grants a morale bonus on saving throws against fear (such as a paladin’s aura of courage, a bard’s countersong, or a cavalier’s banner ability), the morale bonus increases to +6."
