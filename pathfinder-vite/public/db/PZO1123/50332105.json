    "text": "This thin, bleached cloth covers the wearer\u0027s entire torso. Some also cover the wearer\u0027s face, but don\u0027t interfere with the wearer\u0027s vision. The morbid burial shroud grants the wearer some affinity with the spectral dead. The wearer can discern invisible or ethereal creatures as though using see invisibility. Once per day, the wearer can become incorporeal for 10 rounds and gain a fly speed equal to half his base speed with perfect maneuverability. The wearer can\u0027t attack while incorporeal, but can dismiss the effect as a move action."
