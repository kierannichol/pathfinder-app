    "text": "These horseshoes are made of blackened steel and are typically stamped with infernal symbols or, less subtly, horrific images of terrified and tortured steeds of the darkest hues. They typically give off a slight smell of brimstone, as though they had been crafted in some hellish forge. On command, the mount\u0027s rider may grant it the smoke supernatural ability (Bestiary 216). The horseshoes can be used for 10 rounds per day, split up as the mount\u0027s rider chooses (minimum 1 round per use). While this power is activated, the mount\u0027s eyes, hooves, mane, and tail burst into flame, and its hooves deal an extra 1d4 points of fire damage."
