    "text": "This charm resembles an orrery composed of small, freely orbiting orbs circling a candle-sized flame. The device functions as an ioun stone, and when released, the flame perches above the user\u0027s head, remaining stationary relative to the user as the smaller planetary orbs take up elliptical transit around it. When in use, the flame grants the user a natural armor bonus of +4, the fire subtype, immunity to fire, and vulnerability to cold. If within 3 miles of the celestial lens, the user can control the horizontal orbital direction of the item, but cannot make the lens stop or move it vertically from its standard position of 100 feet from the ground.",
