    "text": "This belt functions as a serpent belt, except it grants the wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn. When the wearer animates the belt as a venomous or constrictor snake, she may speak a second command word to give the snake the advanced, celestial, entropic (Bestiary 2), fiendish, or resolute (Bestiary 2) simple template. Adding a planar template changes the snake\u0027s alignment to that of the corresponding planes."
