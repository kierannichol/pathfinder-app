    "text": "Finely laid gold filigree lines these ornately worked talons. Once worn, the talons of Leng grant the wearer two natural claw attacks, both with a +3 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage. A hit from one of the talons deals 1d4 points of damage. On a critical hit, the talons deal ×3 damage and force the victim to make a DC 20 Will save. Failing this save renders the target permanently insane (as per the spell insanity), while success leaves the target confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect.\nThe wearer of the talons of Leng is immune to the spells confusion and insanity, as well as to any spell or any ability that produces similar effects. For as long as he wears the talons, however, his Wisdom is reduced by 2, as alien voices constantly whisper through his head. The talons of Leng do not interfere with spellcasting, the use of handheld items, or wielding other weapons (though a wielder cannot make an attack with a claw that\u0027s holding another weapon or item). If the wielder attacks only with the talons, they are treated as a primary attack, but if he attacks with a weapon or other natural attack, the claws are treated as secondary attacks and take a –5 penalty on their attack roll."
