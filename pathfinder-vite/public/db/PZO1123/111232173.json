    "text": "Undead controlling armor and shields often have skeletal or other grisly decorations or flourishes to their decor. They let the user control up to 26 Hit Dice of undead per day, as the control undead spell. At dawn each day, the wearer loses control of any undead still under his sway. Armor or a shield with this ability appears to be made of bone; this feature is entirely decorative and has no other effect on the armor."
