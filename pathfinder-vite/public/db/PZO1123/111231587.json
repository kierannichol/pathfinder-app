    "text": "These sandals are woven from grass, lengths of pliant vine, living leaves, and supple bark. In forest terrain, the wearer leaves no tracks or scent and gains a +2 competence bonus on Stealth checks. The wearer can move through natural undergrowth without impediment or harm as a druid using woodland stride (Core Rulebook 51), and once per day she may step inside a tree and remain there for up to 9 hours, or teleport to a similar tree within range, as tree stride but allowing only a single teleport."
