¬An allying weapon allows the wielder to transfer some or all of the weaponâ€™s enhancement bonus to one weapon being used by an ally of the wielder. The wielder must have line of sight to the intended ally. As a free action, at the start of her turn before using her weapon, the wielder chooses how to allocate her weaponâ€™s enhancement bonus. The bonus to the allyâ€™s weapon lasts until the allying weaponâ€™s wielderâ€™s next turn. The enhancement bonus from the allying weapon does not stack with the enhancement bonus on the allyâ€™s weapon (if any).
