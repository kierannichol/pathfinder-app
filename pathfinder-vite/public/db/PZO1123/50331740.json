    "text": "This rod has functions that are spell-like, and it can also be used as a magic weapon of various sorts. In addition, it has several more mundane uses. The rod of lordly might is metal and thicker than other rods, with a flanged ball at one end and six studlike buttons along its length. Pushing any of the rod\u0027s buttons is an action equivalent to drawing a weapon, and the rod weighs 10 pounds.\nThe following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per day."
