äA dispelling burst weapon functions like a dispelling weapon but may store dispel magic or greater dispel magic. In addition, these spells can be discharged as a free action when the wielder of a dispelling burst weapon confirms a critical hit. When the wielder does so, the bonus to the check made to dispel (including from dispelling strike, spell sunder, or sunder enchantment) increases by an amount equal to the weaponâ€™s enhancement bonus or the weaponâ€™s critical multiplier (whichever is higher). If a dispelling burst weapon confirms a critical hit while it is not currently storing a dispel magic or greater dispel magic spell, yet if the wielder has either spell prepared (or is a spontaneous caster able to cast either spell), she may cast either spell into the weapon as a swift action and then immediately discharge it into the target as a free action.
