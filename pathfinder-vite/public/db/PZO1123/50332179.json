    "text": "Fashioned from a scrap of a blind beggar\u0027s clothing, a blind man\u0027s fold is often used by explorers who must traverse caves inhabited by invisible creatures, or those drawn to sources of light. A blind man\u0027s fold fully obscures normal vision while worn, but grants the effects of the Improved Blind-Fight feat (Advanced Player\u0027s Guide 162). Creatures which are unable to see normally gain no benefit from wearing a blind man\u0027s fold."
