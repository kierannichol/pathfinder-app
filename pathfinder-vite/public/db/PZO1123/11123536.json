    "text": "Usually fashioned from brightly colored silk, a mummer\u0027s ruff is a favored accoutrement of performers and con artists alike. The wearer of a mummer\u0027s ruff gains a +10 bonus on Bluff skill checks when attempting to imitate another\u0027s voice. In addition, once per day, the wearer of the mummer\u0027s ruff can throw his voice as if using ventriloquism for up to 5 minutes."
