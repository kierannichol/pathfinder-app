“This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A seaborne weapon functions easily in watery environments. With the weapon in hand, the wielder gains a bonus on Swim checks equal to twice the weaponâ€™s enhancement bonus. In addition, the wielder does not take the normal penalties to attack and damage rolls imposed by being underwater, as if he were subject to the spell freedom of movement.
