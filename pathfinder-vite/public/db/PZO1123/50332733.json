    "text": "These steel and brass pauldrons feature two brass lion heads, one on each shoulder. Twice a day as an immediate action when a creature successfully makes an Acrobatics check to move through the wearer\u0027s threatened area or its space without provoking an attack of opportunity, a shadowy lion can animate from one of the pauldrons and attack that creature. The attack uses the wearer\u0027s base attack bonus + Dexterity modifier and attacks the target\u0027s touch AC. On a hit, the lion deals 2d6 points of piercing damage (Ã—2 critical)."
