    "text": "This item consists of a pair of wooden poles with a footrest halfway up. By standing on the footrests and holding the tops of the poles you can avoid certain ground-based threats to your feet. For example, you can use stilts to cross water without getting wet, but you would still activate a trap that triggers when you walk in a certain area. Using stilts reduces your base speed from 30 feet to 20 feet, or from 20 feet to 15 feet. You can hop off your stilts as a move action, or as a free action with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check.\nYou must use both your hands to walk with stilts. Walking with stilts requires a DC 5 Acrobatics check for each move. Failing this check means you do not move for that move action; failing by 5 or more means you fall off the stilts. If you want to use one hand for something else while standing on stilts, you must succeed at a DC 10 Acrobatics check or lose the action; if you want to use two hands, the DC increases to 20.\nStilts for a Medium creature raise you 2 feet above the ground; stilts for a Small creature raise you 1 foot from the ground. You can use taller stilts, but each additional foot of elevation increases the Acrobatics DCs of using stilts by +5. A stilt has hardness 5 and 10 hit points. If you only have one stilt, your speed drops to 5 feet because you can only hop rather than walk.\nMasterwork Stilts: These stilts strap to your feet and legs, allowing you to use your hands for other tasks without penalty. Walking on masterwork stilts requires a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Attaching or removing a masterwork stilt is a full-round action."
