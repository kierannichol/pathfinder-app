    "text": "This 6-foot-long silver rod is capped with a copper ball at one end, and a multipronged iron spike at the other. Three times per day, the spiked end can be driven into sand, mud, or loose earth as a move action, into dense soil or loose gravel as a standard action, or into stone or harder materials as a full-round action. Once anchored, the rod emits a field that inhibits electrical charges within a 40-foot radius. All creatures within this radius gain resistance 5 to electricity, and anyone attempting to cast a spell with the electricity descriptor must make a caster level check (DC 16) or lose the spell.\nRemoving the rod from the ground and deactivating it requires the same type of action as anchoring it."
