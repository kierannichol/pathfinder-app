    "text": "Invincible armor shifts between three different appearances, but always weighs the same and protects as +2 impervious moderate fortification full plate. As an immediate action, the wearer can change the armor into heavy plate that blocks slashing attacks (DR 10/bludgeoning or piercing), thickly layered chainmail that blocks piercing attacks (DR 10/ bludgeoning or slashing), or overlapping metal scales that block bludgeoning attacks (DR 10/piercing or slashing). In addition, invincible armor provides the wearer with 5 points of resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic, and is itself unharmed by damage from any of these energy types.",
