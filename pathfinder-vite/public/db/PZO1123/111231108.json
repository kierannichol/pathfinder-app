    "text": "These heavy leather boots contain a layer of brick dust that protects your feet from heat. You gain fire resistance 2 against fire attacks directed at or under your feet, such as walking across hot coals. Repeat or prolonged exposure to fire damage eventually burns the outer leather of the boots, ruining them (typically after about 1d10+20 rounds of exposure)."
