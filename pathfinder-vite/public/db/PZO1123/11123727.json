    "text": "This green-and-brown vest has pockets sewn along its length, each with a tiny lodestone button. The wearer feels a surge of heroism when she tracks down prey. She gains a +1 morale bonus on the first attack and damage rolls made with weapons against creatures she has successfully tracked within the previous 24 hours. If her target is flat-footed, this bonus increases to +2. If her target is also her favored enemy, she gains a +4 bonus on critical hit confirmation rolls against the target."
