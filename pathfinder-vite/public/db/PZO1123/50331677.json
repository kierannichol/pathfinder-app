    "text": "These heavy leather gloves ripple and flows at the wearer\u0027s command, reshaping to fit any hand, claw, tentacle, or alien limb. The wearer\u0027s melee touch attacks with that hand deal 1d6 points of acid damage. If the wearer uses that hand to wield a weapon or make an attack with an unarmed strike or natural weapon, that attack gains the corrosive weapon special ability.\nThe wearer\u0027s gloved hand is protected from the acid ability of oozes, allowing him to use that hand to attack oozes with unarmed strikes or natural attacks without risk of harm from contact with the ooze. These unarmed strikes and natural attacks never cause an ooze to split."
