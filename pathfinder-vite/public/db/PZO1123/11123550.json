    "text": "This simple pair of leather shooting bracers are designed to protect the wearer\u0027s wrist from being snapped by bowstrings. They appear similar to a set of bracers of archery, but a wearer notices the difference as soon as she dons them.\nThe wearer of these bracers gains damage reduction 5/ magic against ranged weapons, as well as a +1 deflection bonus against ranged attacks. In addition, once per day, as a swift action, the wearer can grant herself a +20 insight bonus on her next ranged attack roll before the end of her next turn."
