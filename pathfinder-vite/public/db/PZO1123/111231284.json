The haft is engraved with the circling image of a dragon in flight. The head of this +2 dragon bane halberd glows when a creature of the dragon type is within 100 feet of the weapon. Three times per day, when the halberd hits a dragon, the wielder can have that attack ignore the dragon\u0027s DR as a free action."
