    "text": "This mottled gray cloak looks like granite or some other light gray stone. The wearer can pull a minor stone cloak tight around herself and freeze in place as a move action, which causes the cloak to harden like the stone it resembles. When she does this, the wearer can take no actions other than free actions and is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC but gains DR 5/adamantine. She also gains a +5 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks while protected in this manner. This effect can be dismissed as a free action."
