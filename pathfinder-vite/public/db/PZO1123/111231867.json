    "text": "This weapon consists of a wooden haft and a heavy, metal head. The head may be single (like a carpenter\u0027s hammer) or double (like a sledgehammer). The haft is long enough that you may wield it one- or two-handed. Though heavy and relatively slow to wield, warhammers are capable of delivering immense blows, crushing armor and flesh alike.",
