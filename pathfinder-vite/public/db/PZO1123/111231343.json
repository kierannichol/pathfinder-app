    "text": "These massive pauldrons take the shape of a pair of clenched fists made of beaten bronze. They bestow a +4 bonus on CMD, and grant the wearer the ferocity ability (Bestiary 300). On command, the wearer can increase its size, as though subject to an enlarge person spell, and can revert to regular size with another command. Three times per day, as an immediate action after the pauldrons\u0027 wearer kills an opponent, the wearer gains the benefit of the deadly juggernaut spell (Ultimate Combat) for 1 minute."
