    "text": "This heavy cloak is made of blue scaled leather and has a pointed hem that hangs near the ground. The cloak provides the wearer a +4 resistance bonus on Will saves, a continuous feather fall effect (as the spell), and the ability to use fly once per day. At will as a swift action, the wearer can form the hem into a stinger, granting her a sting natural weapon. This sting deals 1d6 points of damage plus poison (as the spell; DC 16). Reverting the stinger to its normal, inconspicuous shape is a free action."
