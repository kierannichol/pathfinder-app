    "text": "Appearing to be a wide leather belt that functions as a belt of mighty constitution +4, this belt in fact saps the wearer\u0027s health rather than supplement it. A belt of weakness confers a â€“4 penalty to its wearer\u0027s Constitution score. Furthermore, when the wearer rolls a natural 1 on any Fortitude save, the belt constricts, dealing 2d8 points of damage."
