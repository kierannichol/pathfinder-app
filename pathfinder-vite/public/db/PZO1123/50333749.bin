µ€FuriousFurious(:ñ€0¢í
êThis special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A furious weapon serves as a focus for its wielderâ€™s anger. When the wielder is raging or under the effect of a rage spell, the weaponâ€™s enhancement bonus is +2 better than normal. If the wielder has a rage power that gives a skill bonus while raging (such as raging climber, raging leaper, or raging swimmer), the wielder gains an enhancement bonus to that skill whenever the weapon is wielded or held in her hand, even when she is not raging. This bonus is equal to the enhancement bonus of the weapon (and also includes the +2 if the wielder is raging).
