Dispelling(:ñ€0¢İ
ÚA dispelling weapon functions like a spell storing weapon, but it may only store dispel magic; however, the caster level check to dispel gains an additional bonus equal to the weaponâ€™s enhancement bonus. This bonus also applies to a magusâ€™s dispelling strike arcana or a barbarianâ€™s spell sunder or sunder enchantment combat maneuver check.
