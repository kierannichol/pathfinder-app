    "text": "This +1 bashing heavy steel shield burns with an internal fire upon its boss, gaining the flaming weapon special ability when used to make shield bash attacks. On command, the wielder can make the shield belch forth smoke as a smokestick, but this smoke does not impair the shield user\u0027s vision. Once per day, the wielder may cause the volcanic shield to erupt in a cascade of brimstone as the flaming hands spell."
