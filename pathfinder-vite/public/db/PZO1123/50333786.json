    "text": "Requirement: This ability can only be placed on composite bows. An adaptive bow responds to the strength of its wielder, acting as a bow with a strength rating equal to its wielderâ€™s Strength bonus. The wielder can fire it with a lesser Strength bonus (and cause less damage) if desired."
