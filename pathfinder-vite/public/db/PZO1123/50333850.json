    "text": "This armor pushes back against anything that threatens to knock its wearer to the ground. The wearer gains a +4 bonus to his Combat Maneuver Defense against combat maneuvers made to overrun or trip and on Acrobatics check made to maintain balance. Dropping prone while wearing balanced armor is a move action instead of a free action. The balanced ability can be applied to light or medium armors, but not heavy armors or shields."
