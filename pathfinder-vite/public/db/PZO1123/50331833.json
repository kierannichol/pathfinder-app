    "text": "Magical analysis indicates that this armor is a normal suit of +3 full plate. The armor works normally with regard to melee attacks but actually attracts ranged weapons. The wearer takes a â€“15 penalty to AC against ranged weapons. The true nature of the armor does not reveal itself until the character is fired upon in earnest."
