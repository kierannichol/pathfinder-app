    "text": "This +1 arrow makes no sound on release or as it flies through the air. A creature struck by a hushing arrow must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be affected by silence (as the spell) for 5 rounds. The silence effect is not triggered by arrows that miss or those that strike an inanimate object.\nA greater hushing arrow functions just like a normal hushing arrow, except the target must succeed at a DC 16 Will save to avoid being silenced. Hushing bolts and greater hushing bolts can also be made; they share the same statistics as hushing arrows and greater hushing arrows, except they weigh 1/10 of a pound per bolt."
