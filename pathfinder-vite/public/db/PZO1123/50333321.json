    "text": "This slender silver bracelet is worked in an intertwined design of three flowers. A DC 20 Knowledge (nature) check identifies the flowers as acacia, apocynum, and bilberry, symbolizing concealment, treachery, and falsehood.\nThe bracelet grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks, and a +5 resistance bonus on Will saves against enchantment effects. If the wearer makes a successful Will save against an enchantment, the caster of that spell incorrectly senses the effect has succeeded. Additionally, the bracelet\u0027s wearer knows an enchantment targeted him and the enchantment\u0027s source. Seducer\u0027s bane creates an aura on its wearer, visible to detect magic, matching the failed enchantment spell or effect, and lasting as long as the intended enchantment\u0027s duration. However, if the bracelet\u0027s wearer attacks the caster or its allies, or otherwise acts in a way that\u0027s contradictory to the failed spell\u0027s effect, the caster of that spell immediately realizes the enchantment was ineffective."
