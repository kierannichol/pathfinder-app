    "text": "A talisman of reluctant wishes appears the same as a stone of controlling earth elementals, a rugged rock that seems to pulse with an inner power. Its powers are quite different, however, and are dependent on the Charisma of the holder. Any character touching a talisman of reluctant wishes must make a DC 15 Charisma check.\nIf the check fails, the talisman acts as a stone of weight (see page 351). Discarding it results in 5d6 points of damage to the character and the disappearance of the talisman.\nIf the check succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6 hours, or until a wish is made with it, whichever comes first. It then disappears.\nIf the check roll is a natural 20, the talisman remains for a number of months equal to the character\u0027s Charisma score, resisting any effort to get rid of it by reappearing in the character\u0027s possession, in a back pocket, at the bottom of his pack, or the like.\nThe artifact grants one wish for every 6 points of the character\u0027s Charisma (round down). It grows warm and throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or magic trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses are of no avail.)\nRegardless of which reaction results, a talisman of reluctant wishe s disappears w hen its time expires, leaving behind a large diamond in its stead, valued at 1,000 gp per point of the character\u0027s Charisma.",

      "Destruction": "A talisman of reluctant wishes can be destroyed by wishing it so, using either one of the stone\u0027s wishes or a wish spell from another source. The stone then explodes, causing 5d6 points of damage to the holder."
