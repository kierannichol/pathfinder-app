    "text": "Silver circles and conjuring runes decorate this black robe. Three times per day when the wearer uses a summoning spell or spell-like ability to summon a variable number of creatures, he can choose to summon the maximum number of creatures possible. Creatures summoned in this way step from the shadowy folds of the robe, and appear adjacent to the wearer. If there isn\u0027t sufficient room for all the creatures to appear, the extra creatures are wasted and do not appear.\nIf the wearer is a summoner, he can call upon the robe to summon his eidolon as a standard action once per day. It must appear adjacent to the summoner when called this way."
