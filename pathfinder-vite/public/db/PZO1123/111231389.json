    "text": "This stylized bird mask consists of a pair of goggles attached to a ceramic beak that covers the nose and mouth. The goggles are not magic and can be replaced with other goggles or eye slot items. It grants the wearer a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against disease. Once per day on command, the user can remove disease (as the spell) on a single creature touched."
