    "text": "A stanching suit of armor helps stop the flow of blood from the wearer’s wounds, automatically tightening like a tourniquet in the appropriate places while also magically reducing the severity of the wound. Stanching armor reduces hit point damage, ability damage, or ability drain by an amount equal to its enhancement bonus if the damage or drain was from a bleed effect. The wearer also adds the armor’s enhancement bonus to Constitution checks to become stable."
