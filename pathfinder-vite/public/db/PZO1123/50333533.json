    "text": "A candle lamp is a small lanternlike device with glass panels and a slot to hold a candle. It protects the candle from drafts and catches wax drippings. It provides the same light as a candle, but can be shuttered such that it only illuminates 1 to 3 adjacent squares. You can use a candle lamp to keep your hands warm."
