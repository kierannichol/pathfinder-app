    "text": "This special ability can only be placed on ranged weapons or ammunition. Each time a ranged weapon or ammunition with this ability hits a creature, its magic designates the target. Allies gain a +4 morale bonus on melee attack rolls and a +6 morale bonus on melee damage rolls against the designated target for 1 round. Multiple successful shots fired at the same target do not increase the bonuses or their duration."
