    "text": "This strange, featureless mask seems to have the powers of a headband of alluring charisma +4, but instead of granting a bonus to Charisma, the mask melds to the wearer\u0027s face, making him seem uglier and his words come off as crude and insulting. The wearer takes a â€“4 penalty to Bluff and Diplomacy checks but gains a +2 bonus to Intimidate checks."
