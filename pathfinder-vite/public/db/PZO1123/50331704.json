    "text": "This torch is made of pale yellow wood and inscribed with holy runes. When lit, it burns as a regular torch, but only lasts for 5 minutes. When held by a lawful good creature, it functions as an archon\u0027s aura spell. The magical aura ends if a lawful good creature isn\u0027t holding it, and resumes automatically if a lawful good creature holds it again."
