¹This special ability allows a weapon to find chinks in a foeâ€™s defenses using the wielderâ€™s knowledge of the target. Whenever the weaponâ€™s attack is a critical threat, the wielder gains a +4 bonus on the confirmation roll if she has 5 or more ranks in a Knowledge skill that would be used to identify the targetâ€™s creature type (such as Knowledge [planes] for an outsider opponent), or a +6 bonus instead if she has 15 or more ranks.
