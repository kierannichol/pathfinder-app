    "text": "This magic instrument comes in four varieties. Each appears to be a normal, scarred old horn used for hunting or signaling during battle. When someone speaks its command word and blows the horn, however, the horn summons a number of human barbarians to fight for the character who summoned them. Each horn can be blown just once every 7 days. Roll d% and refer to the table above to see what type of horn is found. The horn\u0027s type determines what barbarians are summoned and what prerequisite is needed to use the horn. Any character who uses a horn of Valhalla but doesn\u0027t have the prerequisite is attacked by the barbarians she herself summoned.\nSummoned barbarians are constructs, not actual people (though they seem to be); they arrive with the starting equipment for barbarians. They attack anyone the possessor of the horn commands them to fight until they or their opponents are slain or until 1 hour has elapsed, whichever comes first."
