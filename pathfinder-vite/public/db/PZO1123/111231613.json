    "text": "This amethyst stone strung on a coarse iron chain protects the wearer from curses. Three times per day, whenever the wearer rolls a saving throw against a curse (such as a witch\u0027s hex, or a bestow curse spell), he may reroll the saving throw as an immediate action. The wearer must decide to use this ability before the results of the saving throw are revealed. He must take the second roll, even if it is worse."
