¤A glorious weapon glows with a dazzling light equal to a daylight spell when drawn. The wielder cannot suppress this light, though it can be temporarily suppressed by any effect that can suppress daylight. A glorious weapon flashes with light, and any creature the wielder attacks in melee is automatically dazzled until the beginning of the wielderâ€™s next turn. When a glorious weapon confirms a critical hit, the target is blinded until the beginning of the wielderâ€™s next turn (DC 14 Will negates); if the weaponâ€™s critical multiplier is greater than x2, this blindness lasts 1 additional round per multiple over x2. Only a melee weapon can have the glorious ability.
