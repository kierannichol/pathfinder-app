†This special ability can only be placed on ranged weapons or ammunition. Each time a ranged weapon or ammunition with this ability hits a creature, its magic designates the target. Allies gain a +2 morale bonus on melee attack and melee damage rolls against the designated target for 1 round. Multiple successful shots fired at the same target do not increase the bonuses or their duration.
