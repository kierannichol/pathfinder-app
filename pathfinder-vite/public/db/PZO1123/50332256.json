    "text": "This hollow metal or wooden tube contains slow-burning powder. When you light the fuse (a move action), it creates a 3-foot-long, blazing fountain of red-hot fiery sparks. You wield this fountain of sparks as if it were a heavy mace. Attacks with the fountain are melee touch attacks. The fountain deals 1d8 points of fire damage (your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage).\nThe fountain sheds light as a torch and can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth. Once ignited, it lasts for 1 minute. If extinguished before this time, the remaining duration is wasted. Crafting this item is a DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
