    "text": "This +2 ghost touch tower shield is engraved with funerary runes depicting the peaceful rest of the contented dead. The wielder of an elysian shield is immune to the create spawn ability of undead, and once per day as an immediate action can negate a single energy drain, ability drain, or ability damage attack by an undead creature. In addition, once per day as a standard action, the wielder can release a wave of positive energy that panics undead, as the Turn Undead feat (Will DC 20 negates)."
