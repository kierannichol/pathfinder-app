    "text": "This armor or shield seems almost translucent. Both its enhancement bonus and its armor bonus count against the attacks of corporeal and incorporeal creatures. It can be picked up, moved, and worn by corporeal and incorporeal creatures alike. Incorporeal creatures gain the armor’s or shield’s enhancement bonus against both corporeal and incorporeal attacks, and they can still pass freely through solid objects."
