    "text": "This artifact was crafted ages ago, weaving together wispy strands of shadow into a twisted black staff. The Shadowstaff makes the wielder slightly shadowy and incorporeal, granting him a +4 bonus to AC and on Reflex saves (which stacks with any other bonuses). However, in bright light (such as that of the sun, but not a torch) or in absolute darkness, the wielder takes a â€“2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks. The Shadowstaff also has these powers.",
