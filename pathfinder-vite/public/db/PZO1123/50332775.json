    "text": "This exquisitely forged katana is the result of painstaking attention and craftsmanship by one who is dedicated to mastering swordplay in its highest form.\nA blade of the sword-saint is a +3 ki intensifying katana. In the hands of a monk, it becomes an instrument of deadly utility. In addition to its more common properties, this weapon can be employed as though the wielder were unarmed: the wielder benefits from feats such as Deflect Arrows or Snatch Arrows (although he can redirect attacks but not catch them if he has no hands free), and a monk treats the blade as a monk weapon for use in his flurry of blows."
