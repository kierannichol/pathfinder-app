    "text": "This ring is made of black steel and is eerily cold to the touch. Once per day as a swift action, when the wearer hits a living creature with an unarmed attack, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or take 1d4 point of Strength damage in addition to the attack\u0027s normal damage. If the target of the attack takes any Strength damage from this attack, the ring\u0027s wearer gains a +2 enhancement bonus to her Strength for 1 minute."
