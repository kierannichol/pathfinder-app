    "text": "A dispelling weapon functions like a spell storing weapon, but it may only store dispel magic; however, the caster level check to dispel gains an additional bonus equal to the weapon’s enhancement bonus. This bonus also applies to a magus’s dispelling strike arcana or a barbarian’s spell sunder or sunder enchantment combat maneuver check."
