    "text": "This curved blade of golden metal, a +1 keen heartseeking spellstealing scimitar, is the bane of spellcasters. Inscribed with flowing magical script that purports to reveal the inner secrets of magic, the scimitar of the spellthief grants the wielder a +2 bonus on Spellcraft and Use Magic Device checks. The scimitar also reveals magical auras by touch; this functions as detect magic but affects only a single object or creature at a time, which must be touched with the blade while the wielder concentrates on detection, and the magical auras revealed are clearly visible to all."
