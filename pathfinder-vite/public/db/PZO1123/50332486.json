    "text": "This weapon consists of a foot-long double-edged blade, with another smaller, curved hook-blade sticking out the side like a rooster\u0027s spur. The blade is strung to a large iron hoop with a 10-foot length of rope. The blade can be used as an off-handed melee weapon or thrown like a dagger, while the rope and circlet can be whipped around and swung at opponents as a bludgeoning reach weapon."
