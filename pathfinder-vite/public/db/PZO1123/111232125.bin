åThis special ability can only be placed on a weapon that can be thrown. A returning weapon flies through the air back to the creature that threw it. It returns to the thrower just before the creatureâ€™s next turn (and is therefore ready to use again in that turn). Catching a returning weapon when it comes back is a free action. If the character canâ€™t catch it, or if the character has moved since throwing it, the weapon drops to the ground in the square from which it was thrown.
