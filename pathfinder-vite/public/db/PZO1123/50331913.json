    "text": "These gauntlets perform according to their appearance until the wearer finds herself under attack or in a lifeand- death situation. At that time, the curse is activated. The wearer becomes fumble-fingered, with a 50% chance each round of dropping anything held in either hand. The gauntlets also lower the wearer\u0027s Dexterity score by 2 points. Once the curse is activated, the gloves can be removed only by means of a remove curse spell, a wish, or a miracle."
