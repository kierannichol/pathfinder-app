    "text": "Two times per day on command, the wearer of this ring can produce a horrific smell affecting all living creatures other than the wearer within a 10-foot radius. Once created, the smell remains, centered on the wearer, until she dismisses it as a free action. This is a poison effect.\nAny creature affected by the disgusting aroma produced by the ring must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw when it starts its turn in the ring\u0027s stench radius. Those that fail a saving throw become sickened for 1 round. If they are already sickened, they become nauseated for 1 round instead."
