    "text": "A jailer\u0027s dungeon ring is worked gold, set with carnelians. The ring is magically attuned to one or more iron prisoner\u0027s dungeon rings. When the wearer of a jailer\u0027s ring places a prisoner\u0027s ring on a subject, the prisoner cannot remove the ring without the use of a remove curse, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell. The wearer of the jailer\u0027s ring can also remove a linked prisoner\u0027s ring at any time.\nThe jailer is aware of any wearer of a linked prisoner\u0027s ring as per a constant status spell. Additionally, all wearers of linked prisoner\u0027s rings count as familiar to the jailer for the purposes of spells such as scrying and teleport."
