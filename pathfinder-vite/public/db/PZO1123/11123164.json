    "text": "These sturdy goggles have a mirror sheen on the outside of their lenses, a wrapping of leather holding them snugly in place. This tint blocks a considerable amount of natural light. Twice per day, the goggles\u0027 wearer can emit bright light on command to a range of 30 feet. Any creature within that area must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude saving throw or be blinded for 1 hour. In addition, the wearer also gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against visual effects."
