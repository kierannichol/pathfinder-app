    "text": "This version of a standard holy symbol is oversized and has a watertight compartment that can hold 1 pint (the same volume as a flask of holy water). Adventurers normally use the compartment to hold holy water or alcohol. A holy symbol flask is not meant for you to throw at enemies and is not fragile like a flask or vial. Like using holy water on incorporeal opponent, you unstopper the flask and pour the contents onto an adjacent target. Detecting the compartment requires a successful DC 10 Perception check."
