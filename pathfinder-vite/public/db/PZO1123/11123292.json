    "text": "This bone ring is the shape of an elongated rat biting its own tail. The wearer gains a bite attack as a primary natural attack. This attack deals 1d4 points of piercing damage for a Medium wearer or 1d3 points of damage for a Small wearer. After about a week of wearing the ring, the wearer\u0027s appearance becomes more ratlike, though she still looks like a member of her original race (for example, a human might gain prominent teeth)."
