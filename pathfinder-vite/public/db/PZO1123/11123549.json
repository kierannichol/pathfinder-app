    "text": "Sounding a horn requires a DC 10 Perform (wind instruments) check and can convey concepts such as \"Attack!\", \"Help!\", \"Advance!\", \"Retreat!\", \"Fire!\", and \"Alarm!\" The report of a signal horn can be clearly heard (Perception DC 0) up to a half-mile distant. For each quarter-mile beyond, Perception checks to hear the horn take a â€“1 penalty."
