    "text": "This +1 arrow is keyed to a particular type or subtype of creature. If it strikes such a creature, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 50 points of damage. Note that even creatures normally exempt from Fortitude saves (undead and constructs) are subject to this attack. When keyed to a living creature, this is a death effect (and thus death ward protects a target). To determine the type or subtype of creature the arrow is keyed to, roll on the table below.\nA greater slaying arrow functions just like a normal slaying arrow, but the DC to avoid the death effect is 23 and the arrow deals 100 points of damage if the saving throw is failed."
