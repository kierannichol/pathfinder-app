    "text": "This simple headband of braided hide grants a +5 competence bonus on Survival checks and inures the wearer to the strain of long travel, as the tireless pursuit spell (Advanced Player\u0027s Guide). If the wearer is a ranger, the hunter\u0027s band increases his favored enemy bonus on attack rolls by +1 for all his favored enemies. If the ranger has the hunter\u0027s bond (companions) class feature, this increase also applies to the attack roll bonus his allies gain from that ability."
