    "text": "This band of reddish fox fur is marked on the front with a distinctive symbol that constantly shifts into a different character. The headband grants the wearer an enhancement bonus to one mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) of +2, +4, or +6. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is worn. This bonus is chosen when the headband is created and cannot be changed. If the headband grants a bonus to Intelligence, it also grants skill ranks as a headband of vast intelligence.\nIf the wearer is a creature who uses magic to change form, she gains the following additional benefits.\nShifter\u0027s headband +2: The wearer treats her caster level as if it were one level higher when casting spells or creating extracts of the polymorph subschool.\nShifter\u0027s headband +4: Once per day while under the effect of a polymorph spell or extract, the wearer can assume another form allowed by that effect. This is a standard action.\nShifter\u0027s headband +6: Whenever the wearer changes her shape with a polymorph effect, she gains DR 5/silver for 1 minute (this ends if she returns to her natural form).\nThese additional shapeshifter abilities are cumulative. For example, a creature wearing a shifter\u0027s headband +4 gains the extra transformation ability and treats her caster level as 1 higher than normal for polymorph spells and extracts."
