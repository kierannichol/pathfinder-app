    "text": "The call of this hollowed-out animal horn rallies nearby creatures to battle. When the horn is blown, all creatures within 60 feet who have not yet acted in combat are no longer considered flat-footed. The horn has no effect on other conditions or abilities that treat a creature as flat-footed.\nA barbarian who sounds a horn of battle clarity may spend 2 rounds of rage to act as if she had the superstition rage power for the remainder of that battle."
