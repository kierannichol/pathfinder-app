    "text": "Often etched with images of spider webs or swampy vines, this sickly green +1 seeking bolt transforms into sticky goo when it hits, entangling its target and becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. In addition to the bolt\u0027s damage, the target is entangled as if it had been hit by a tanglefoot bag."
