    "text": "These silver bracers are polished to a mirrored sheen, but otherwise shift their appearance to match whatever suit of armor they are worn with.\nIf the wearer has levels in a class that grants a smite ability (such as a paladin, or a cleric with the destruction domain), her smite damage is treated as though she were a member of that class four levels higher. If the wearer is not a member of such a class, once per day she may make one smite attack, gaining a bonus on the attack roll equal to her Charisma bonus, and a +5 bonus to the damage roll on a hit."
