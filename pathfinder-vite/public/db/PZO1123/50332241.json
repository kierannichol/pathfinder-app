    "text": "When you apply this thin gel to your skin, armor, or clothing, it creates a resistant barrier that protects you from cold damage. You gain cold resistance 5. The gel flakes away as it absorbs cold damage; when it absorbs a total of 20 points of cold damage, it is discharged. Frost ward gel counts as protection from energy for the purpose of stacking multiple cold protection effects. Applying frost ward gel takes 1 minute, and it lasts for 1 hour before losing its potency. Multiple applications of frost ward gel do not stack; applying more while a dose is active merely resets the potential amount of cold damage absorbed to 20 points."
