    "text": "The price of a tattoo depends on the quality, size, and number of colors used. A coin-sized tattoo in blue ink that will blur over a decade costs 1 cp, a hand-sized one in black ink that won\u0027t fade costs 1 sp, and a tattoo covering an entire back takes several sessions and costs 10 gp. Each additional color costs as much as a single tattoo of its size. While these prices represent the baseline, tattoos—like any other artwork—can be worth far more depending on the prestige of the artist."
