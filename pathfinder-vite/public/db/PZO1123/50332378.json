    "text": "These polished steel vambraces grant a +1 deflection bonus to AC. Once per day, as an immediate action, if the wearer has at least one hand free, when he would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged weapon, he may deflect it with the bracers, taking no damage from it, as if he had the Deflect Arrows feat."
