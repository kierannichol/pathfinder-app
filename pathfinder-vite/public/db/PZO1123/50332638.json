    "text": "This enchanted apple appears to be made of solid gold. When dropped or thrown, it draws the attention of the nearest hostile creature within 20 feet. The creature must make a DC 13 Will save or be paralyzed as if by hold person as it focuses its undivided attention on the golden apple. If the creature makes its save on a later round, it realizes it has been affected by magic and the apple is not actually gold. While focusing on the apple, the target takes a â€“2 penalty on Perception checks. The apple is consumed upon being dropped or thrown."
