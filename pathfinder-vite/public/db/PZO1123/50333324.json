    "text": "The device of this +1 bashing heavy steel shield features a magical image of the trackless seas, complete with rolling waves and crashing whitecaps. When used to make a shield bash attack, the shield\u0027s wielder can make a trip attack as a free action against the same target without provoking an attack of opportunity from the creature being tripped. On command, the wielder can make the shield produce a gallon of fresh drinkable water. Once per day on command, the wielder can use the maelstrom shield to emit a stream of water as the hydraulic push spell."
