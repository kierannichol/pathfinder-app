    "text": "Wearing these form-fitting fingerless black gloves makes the wearer\u0027s arms and body more flexible. As a swift action, the wearer can lengthen his arms for up to 10 rounds per day, gaining an additional 5 feet of reach. These rounds need not be consecutive. Attacking with these extended arms is unwieldy, and the wearer takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, increasing to –4 if he is using two-handed weapons. Even when his limbs aren\u0027t extended, the wearer gains a +5 enhancement bonus on Escape Artist checks and Acrobatics checks to avoid falling damage. The wearer is still able to use hand-based natural attacks such as claws while wearing the gloves."
