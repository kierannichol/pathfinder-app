    "text": "These thick brass and leather bracers allow the wearer to tear through bone and muscle like paper. Once per day, as part of a melee attack, the wearer can activate the bracers to inflict a horrific injury on an opponent. If the attack hits, the target must make a DC 14 Will save. If the save fails, the Wand reduces the target\u0027s Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution (wearer\u0027s choice) by â€“6. This penalty cannot reduce the target\u0027s ability score below 1. The injury heals over time, reducing the penalty by 1 for each day that passes since the time of the injury, and is immediately removed by heal, regenerate, restoration, or any magic that can break a curse."
