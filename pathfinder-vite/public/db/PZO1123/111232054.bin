´This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A neutralizing weapon thrust into up to 1 gallon of non-magical corrosive liquid transforms it into harmless water. When used against a creature of the earth subtype, it deals an extra 1d6 points of damage. The wielder of a neutralizing weapon receives a +2 competence bonus on saving throws against acid- and earth-based effects, and the weapon itself is immune to acid damage.
