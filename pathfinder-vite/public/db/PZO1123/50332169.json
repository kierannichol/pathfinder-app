    "text": "This sword appears to be a +2 greatsword. However, whenever it is used in battle, its wielder goes berserk (gaining all the benefits and drawbacks of the barbarian\u0027s rage ability). He attacks the nearest creature and continues to fight until unconscious or dead or until no living thing remains within 30 feet. Although many see this sword as a cursed object, others see it as a boon."
