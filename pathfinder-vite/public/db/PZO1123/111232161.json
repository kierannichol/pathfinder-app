    "text": "Armor with this special ability is often engraved or enameled with lawful religious symbols. Once per day on command, the wearer can invoke an effect, as per the spell righteous might, except the wearer gains DR 5/chaotic instead of DR/evil or DR/good. This lasts for 10 rounds. Vigilant armor bestows one permanent negative level on any chaotic creature attempting to wear it. The negative level remains as long as the armor is worn and disappears when it is removed. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the armor is worn."
