    "text": "This unguent appears at first to be unguent of timelessness. When it touches the skin of a living creature or matter that was once alive, however, it accelerates the aging of that creature or item. Living creatures that touch the unguent age by 30 years. Once living matter—such as wood, paper, or a dead body—crumbles to dust and is destroyed. One flask contains enough unguent to affect eight Medium or smaller creatures or objects. A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects and a Huge creature or object counts as four Medium creatures or objects."
