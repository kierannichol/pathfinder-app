    "text": "Commonly known as a whip sword, this deadly weapon is fashioned from one to four 5-foot-long, razor-sharp blades of flexible steel, almost like a metal cato\u0027- nine-tails. The weapon is wielded by whipping the blades at one\u0027s opponent. The coiled blade is fine and flexible enough to be worn as a belt, and its wielders often carry the blades wrapped around themselves in this fashion.",
