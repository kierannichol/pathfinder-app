    "text": "This necklace consists of a fine gold chain from which hangs a small sealed crystal vial containing preserved liquid blood. Each ampoule is attuned to a specific sorcerer bloodline. If a sorcerer (or other creature with sorcerer bloodline powers, such as from the Eldritch Heritage feat in Ultimate Magic) wears the ampoule for at least one day, she loses her existing bloodline powers and gains the bloodline powers of the ampoule\u0027s bloodline, using her sorcerer level to determine the powers gained. The ampoule has no effect on the sorcerer\u0027s bonus spells, bloodline arcana, or bonus feats from her original bloodline (which remain unchanged).\nThe sorcerer can only use these bloodline powers as long as she wears the necklace. Removing the necklace leaves the sorcerer unable to access any bloodline power, either her own or those of the ampoule, until one hour has passed.\nAs a full round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, the wearer can break open the ampoule and drink the blood within. This destroys the item, and gives her the sickened condition for 1d4 hours. If the drinker is a sorcerer, her bloodline permanently changes to match that of the ampoule. In this case, the sorcerer\u0027s bonus spells, bloodline arcana, and bloodline powers all permanently change to match those of the ampoule\u0027s bloodline. Bonus feats previously selected due to the sorcerer\u0027s bloodline are unaffected, but new feats must be selected from the new bloodline\u0027s bonus feat list."
