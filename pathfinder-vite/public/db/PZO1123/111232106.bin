·This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A guardian weapon allows the wielder to transfer some or all of the weaponâ€™s enhancement bonus to his saving throws as a bonus that stacks with all others. As a free action, the wielder chooses how to allocate the weaponâ€™s enhancement bonus at the start of his turn before using the weapon. The bonus on saving throws lasts until his next turn. Only the weaponâ€™s own enhancement bonus can be sacrificed, not any enhancement bonus provided by other effects such as a greater magic weapon spell. However, the total of such effects is still diminished by the amount allocated to improving saving throws. If a weapon has both the defending and guardian abilities , allocating a single point of enhancement bonus increases either AC or saving throws, but not both.
