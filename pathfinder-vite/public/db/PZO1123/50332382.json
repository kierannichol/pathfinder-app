    "text": "These ceremonial clothes are worn when performing priestly functions within a church or temple, and aren\u0027t well suited to adventuring. A cleric\u0027s vestments typically include a cassock, stole, and surplice. The colors usually correspond to the deity worshiped, and while some priests may choose elaborate embroidery with ecclesiastical themes, others find merit in humble simplicity."
