    "text": "This belt is worked with images of horses stampeding across a barren, windswept plain. The belt\u0027s wearer automatically succeeds at any check to guide with the knees, stay in the saddle, fight with a combat-trained mount, control a mount in battle, or make a fast mount or dismount, as long as the belt\u0027s wearer is wearing medium, light, or no armor. Furthermore, the belt grants a +4 competence bonus on all other Ride checks, including ones made while the wearer is in heavy armor."
