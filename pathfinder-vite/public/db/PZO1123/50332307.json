    "text": "This thimble-sized clay container of thick, moist face paint has enough material to paint streaks and whorls of any color on one creature\u0027s face. Once applied, the wearer can, as a swift action, make the paint rearrange itself into a ghastly m√©lange of colors, making her appearance momentarily disturbing and hideous. The wearer chooses one creature who can see her painted face within 30 feet to be affected by cause fear (DC 11). Once the paint is used in this fashion, it loses all magic and becomes normal face paint. Once applied, the wearer has 24 hours to use the paint\u0027s magic; otherwise it fades away."
