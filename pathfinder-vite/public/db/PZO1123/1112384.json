    "text": "This elixir forces the drinker to say nothing but the truth for 10 minutes (Will DC 13 negates). She must answer any questions put to her in that time, but with each question she can make a separate DC 13 Will save. If one of these secondary saves is successful, she doesn\u0027t break free of the truth-compelling enchantment but also doesn\u0027t have to answer that particular question (if she does answer, she must tell the truth). No more than one question can be asked each round. This is a mindaffecting compulsion enchantment."
