    "text": "This unassuming +1 buckler has an array of small tools and implements embedded into the backside of its rim, able to be folded and snapped out for use at a moment\u0027s notice to attack, defend, or accomplish roguish tasks. A burglar\u0027s buckler grants the wielder a +2 competence bonus on Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks, combat maneuver checks made to perform dirty tricks, and to CMD against dirty tricks.\nOnce per day on command, the wielder may transform a burglar\u0027s buckler into any mundane tool weighing 1 to 5 pounds, such as a crowbar, hammer, saw, small shovel, grappling hook, artisan\u0027s tools, or thieves\u0027 tools. The burglar\u0027s buckler retains its normal hardness and hit points in this form and can be converted back into shield form on command."
