¦This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A grounding weapon can safely touch electrically charged surfaces without harm to its wielder. When used against a creature of the air subtype, it deals an extra 1d6 points of damage. The wielder of a grounding weapon receives a +2 competence bonus on saving throws against air- and electricity-based effects, and the weapon itself is immune to electricity damage.
