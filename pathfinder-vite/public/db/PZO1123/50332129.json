    "text": "This bracelet is adorned with seven coral beads carved in intricate designs. When a critical hit or sneak attack is confirmed on the wearer, as an immediate action before damage is rolled, he can choose to convert the critical hit into a normal hit. Each time the wearer negates a critical hit or sneak attack in this manner, one bead shatters. When all seven are used up, the bracelet itself crumbles into powder."
