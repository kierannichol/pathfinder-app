    "text": "You draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch. Loading a heavy crossbow is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A heavy crossbow fires crossbow bolts.\nNormally, operating a heavy crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a heavy crossbow with one hand at a â€“4 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a heavy crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two one-handed weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing."
