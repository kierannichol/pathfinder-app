    "text": "These eight rune-engraved dragon bones may be used as a divine focus for augury. They add 5% to the chance to successfully cast augury and divination. The bearer of the set gains a +3 luck bonus on one type of saving throw (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will), determined randomly each day. If a creature carries multiple sets of dragonbone divination sticks, all of them provide a bonus on the same saving throw."
