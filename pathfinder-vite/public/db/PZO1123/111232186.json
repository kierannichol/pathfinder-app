    "text": "The polished surface of a mirrored shield or armor gleams and shines, and can be used as an ordinary mirror. Furthermore, it aids in battling creatures with gaze attacks. If the wearer averts his eyes, he can roll the miss chance twice, selecting the better result. The wearer can deal sneak attack or other precision-based damage to the target even though it has concealment against him. This provides no benefit if the wearer closes his eyes, wears a blindfold, or otherwise can’t see the target at all. The mirrored armor or shield also adds it enhancement bonus to the wearer’s touch AC against rays. it. This special ability may only be added to metallic armor or shields."
