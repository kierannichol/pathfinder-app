The magic weapon serves as a channel for the wielder’s ki, allowing her to use her special ki attacks through the weapon as if they were unarmed attacks. These attacks include the monk’s ki strike, quivering palm, and the Stunning Fist feat (including any condition that the monk can apply using this feat)."
