    "text": "This small metal rod has a tiny sharp wheel on one end and a bulb on the other. You score the glass with the wheel and tap it with the bulb to break it. If you succeed at a DC 15 Sleight of Hand check, you can break the glass very quietly (DC 15 Perception check to hear). Most thieves use glue paper with a glass cutter to reduce noise and capture glass fragments."
