    "text": "A robe of powerlessness appears to be a magic robe of another sort. As soon as a character dons this garment, she takes a â€“10 penalty to Strength, as well as to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, forgetting spells and magic knowledge accordingly. If the character is a spellcaster, the robe targets the character\u0027s primary spellcasting score, otherwise it targets Intelligence. The robe can be removed easily, but in order to restore mind and body, the character must receive a remove curse spell followed by heal."
