A successful Will save negates the suggestion effect but not the contact itself. The demand, if received, is understood even if the subject\u0027s Intelligence score is as low as 1. If the message is impossible or meaningless according to the circumstances that exist for the subject at the time the demand is issued, the message is understood but the suggestion is ineffective."
