    "text": "This tool is perfect for its intended job. It grants a +2 circumstance bonus on a related skill check (if any). The bonuses provided by multiple masterwork items do not stack.\nSeveral common items already count as masterwork tools for particular skills. These are the alchemist\u0027s lab, climber\u0027s kit, disguise kit, healer\u0027s kit, masterwork musical instrument, and masterwork thieves\u0027 tools. Therefore, there is no masterwork climber\u0027s kit, masterwork healer\u0027s kit, and so on—those items are already the best available for general checks with the relevant skill.\nSome skills have no appropriate tool or masterwork tool— no nonmagical item exists that grants a bonus for all uses of that skill. For example, just because a certain perfume is favored by local nobles (granting a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks to influence them) doesn\u0027t mean that perfume has the same effect on a member of the thieves\u0027 guild, a foreign berserker, or a medusa. Likewise, just because a fake beard woven by dwarves out of the beards of famous dwarves may grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Use Magic Device checks to emulate the dwarven race doesn\u0027t mean the beard has any effect on using that skill to activate elven items or paladin items, or to decipher a written spell.\nIndividual GMs may want to allow masterwork tools for other skills at the listed cost. The circumstance bonus for such a tool should never be more than +2. The tool should either have a limited number of uses (such as the disguise and healer\u0027s kits) or only apply to certain aspects of the skill (such as the balancing pole\u0027s bonus on Acrobatics checks to traverse a narrow surface or the magnifying glass\u0027s bonus on Appraise checks for detailed items)."
