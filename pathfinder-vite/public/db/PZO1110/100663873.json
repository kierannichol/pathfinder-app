    "text": "This trumpet adapts itself to its owner, so it produces either a good or an evil effect depending on the owner\u0027s alignment. If the owner is neither good nor evil, the horn has no power whatsoever. If she is good, then blowing the horn has the effect of a magic circle against evil. If she is evil, then blowing the horn has the effect of a magic circle against good. In either case, this ward lasts for 1 hour. The horn can be blown once per day."
