    "text": "All four kinds of rings of elemental command are very powerful. Each appears to be nothing more than a lesser magic ring until fully activated (by meeting a special condition, such as single-handedly slaying an elemental of the appropriate type or exposure to a sacred material of the appropriate element), but each has certain other powers as well as the following common properties.\nElementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can\u0027t attack the wearer, or even approach within 5 feet of her. If the wearer desires, she may forgo this protection and instead attempt to charm the elemental (as charm monster, Will DC 17 negates). If the charm attempt fails, however, absolute protection is lost and no further attempt at charming can be made.\nCreatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned that attack the wearer take a â€“1 penalty on their attack rolls. The ring wearer makes applicable saving throws against the extraplanar creature\u0027s attacks with a +2 resistance bonus. She gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls against such creatures. Any weapons he uses bypasses the damage reduction of such creatures, regardless of any qualities the weapon may or may not have.\nThe wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane to which her ring is attuned. These creatures recognize that she wears the ring, and show a healthy respect for the wearer if their alignments are similar. If alignments are opposed, creatures fear the wearer if she is strong. If she is weak, they hate and desire to slay her.\nThe possessor of a ring of elemental command takes a saving throw penalty as follows.\n"
