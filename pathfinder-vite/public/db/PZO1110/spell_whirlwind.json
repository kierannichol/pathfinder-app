    "text": "This spell creates a powerful cyclone of raging wind that moves through the air, along the ground, or over water at a speed of 60 feet per round. You can concentrate on controlling the cyclone\u0027s every movement or specify a simple program. Directing the cyclone\u0027s movement or changing its programmed movement is a standard action for you. The cyclone always moves during your turn. If the cyclone exceeds the spell\u0027s range, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds and then dissipates. (You can\u0027t regain control of the cyclone, even if it comes back within range.)"
