    "text": "A gnome hooked hammer is a double weapon—an ingenious tool with a hammer head at one end of its haft and a long, curved pick at the other. The hammer\u0027s blunt head is a bludgeoning weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage (critical multiplier ×3). Its hook is a piercing weapon that deals 1d4 points of damage (critical multiplier ×4). You can use either head as the primary weapon. Gnomes treat hooked hammers as martial weapons."
