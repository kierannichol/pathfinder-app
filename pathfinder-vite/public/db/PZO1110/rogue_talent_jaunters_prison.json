    "text": "As a move action, the rogue can expend a mote of movement to create an extradimensional prison for one day per rogue class level where the rogue can store a helpless or wiling creature (without gear) touched in stasis. This is often done when a foe is granted an option between this type of imprisonment and death, a subject will submit to this effect. Willing targets cannot be tricked or magically compelled. This places the subject into a state of suspended animation."
