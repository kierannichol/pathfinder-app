    "text": "This beetle-shaped pin enables its wearer to detect any golem within 60 feet, although he must concentrate (a standard action) in order for the detection to take place. A scarab enables its bearer to combat golems with weapons, unarmed attacks, or natural weapons as if those golems had no damage reduction."
