    "text": "This spell causes instant growth of a humanoid creature, doubling its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This increase changes the creature\u0027s size category to the next larger one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, a –2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1), and a –1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to its increased size."
