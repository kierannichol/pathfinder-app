    "text": "Once per day, when flanked by at least two opponents, a rogue with this talent can, as an immediate action when any of the threatening opponents attacks her, attempt an Acrobatics check against the highest CMD of the threatening creatures plus 2 per threatening creature beyond the second. If successful, the rogue may take a 5-foot step in any direction, so long as she remains within the reach of the attacker triggering the movement. The rogueâ€™s final position is used to determine whether the attacker benefits from flanking. On a failed check, the rogue falls prone in her original position and the attack resolves as normal (the opponent gains a +4 bonus for attacking a prone target)."
