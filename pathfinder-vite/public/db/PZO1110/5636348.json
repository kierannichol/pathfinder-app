    "text": "This longsword performs well against targets in practice, but when used in combat its wielder takes a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls.\nAll damage dealt is also reduced by 2 points, but never below a minimum of 1 point of damage on any successful hit. The sword always forces that character to employ it rather than another weapon. The sword\u0027s owner automatically draws it and fights with it even when she meant to draw or ready some other weapon."
