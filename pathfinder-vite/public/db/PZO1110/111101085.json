    "text": "This device negates the spell or spell-like function or functions of magic items. The wielder points the rod at the magic item, and a pale gray beam shoots forth to touch the target device, attacking as a ray (a ranged touch attack). The ray functions as a greater dispel magic spell, except it only affects magic items. To negate instantaneous effects from an item, the rod\u0027s wielder needs to have a readied action. The dispel check uses the rod\u0027s caster level (15th). The target item gets no saving throw, although the rod can\u0027t negate artifacts (even minor artifacts). A rod of negation can function three times per day."
