Any non-dwarf who grasps the Axe takes 4 points of temporary Charisma damage; these points cannot be healed or restored in any way while the Axe is held. The current owner of the Axe gains a +10 bonus on Craft (armor, jewelry, stonemasonry, traps, and weapons) checks. The wielder of the Axe can summon an elder earth elemental (as summon monster IX; duration 20 rounds) once per week.",
