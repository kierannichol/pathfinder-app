    "text": "You can draw a hand crossbow back by hand. Loading a hand crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A hand crossbow fires standard crossbow bolts, like those used by light and heavy crossbows.\nYou can shoot, but not load, a hand crossbow with one hand at no penalty. You can shoot a hand crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons."
