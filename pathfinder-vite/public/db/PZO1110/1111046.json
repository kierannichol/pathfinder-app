    "text": "This spell grants you a sixth sense. Once during the spell\u0027s duration, you may choose to use its effect. This spell grants you an insight bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +25) on any single attack roll, combat maneuver check, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. Alternatively, you can apply the insight bonus to your AC against a single attack (even if flat-footed). Activating the effect doesn\u0027t take an action; you can even activate it on another character\u0027s turn. You must choose to use the moment of prescience before you make the roll it is to modify. Once used, the spell ends. You can\u0027t have more than one moment of prescience active on you at the same time."
