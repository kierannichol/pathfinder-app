    "text": "You preserve the remains of a dead creature so that they do not decay. Doing so effectively extends the time limit on raising that creature from the dead (see raise dead). Days spent under the influence of this spell don\u0027t count against the time limit. Additionally, this spell makes transporting a slain (and thus decaying) comrade less unpleasant."
