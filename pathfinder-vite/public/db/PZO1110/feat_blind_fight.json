      "Benefit": "In melee, every time you miss because of concealment (see Combat), you can reroll your miss chance percentile roll one time to see if you actually hit.",
      "Special": "The Blind-Fight feat is of no use against a character who is the subject of a blink spell.",
      "Normal": "Regular attack roll modifiers for invisible attackers trying to hit you apply, and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC. The speed reduction for darkness and poor visibility also applies."
