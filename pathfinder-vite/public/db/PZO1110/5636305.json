    "text": "When worn, a pair of these slippers enables movement on vertical surfaces or even upside down along ceilings, leaving the wearer\u0027s hands free. Her climb speed is 20 feet. Severely slippery surfaces—icy, oiled, or greased surfaces—make these slippers useless. The slippers can be used for 10 minutes per day, split up as the wearer chooses (minimum 1 minute per use)."
