    "text": "When you successfully hit a target with a sneak attack in melee, you can choose to forgo your additional sneak attack damage to make the target more vulnerable to one of your allies adjacent to it. The first melee attack that ally makes against the target before the beginning of your next turn treats the target as flanked, even if your ally is not flanking the target. This has no effect on creatures you could not flank with that ally, even if the ally was properly positioned."
