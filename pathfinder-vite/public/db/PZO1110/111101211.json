    "text": "A whip deals no damage to any creature with an armor bonus of +1 or higher or a natural armor bonus of +3 or higher. The whip is treated as a melee weapon with a 15-foot reach, though you don\u0027t threaten the area into which you can make an attack. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes).\nUsing a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just as if you had used a ranged weapon.\nYou can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a whip sized for you, even though it isn\u0027t a light weapon. You can\u0027t wield a whip in two hands in order to apply 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier to damage rolls.",
