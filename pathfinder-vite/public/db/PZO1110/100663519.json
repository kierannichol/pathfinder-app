    "text": "Scale mail is made up of dozens of small, overlapping metal plates. Similar to both splint mail and banded mail, scalemail has a flexible arrangement of scales in an attempt to avoid hindering the wearer\u0027s mobility, but at the expense of omitting additional protective layers of armor. A suit of scale mail includes gauntlets."
