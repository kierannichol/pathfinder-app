    "text": "When affixed to an animal\u0027s hooves, these iron horseshoes increase the animal\u0027s base land speed by 30 feet; this counts as an enhancement bonus. As with other effects that increase speed, jumping distances increase proportionally. All four shoes must be worn by the same animal for the magic to be effective."
