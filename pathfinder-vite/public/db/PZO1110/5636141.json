    "text": "A 1-pint flask of oil burns for 6 hours in a lantern or lamp. You can also use a flask of oil as a splash weapon. Use the rules for alchemist\u0027s fire, except that it takes a fullround action to prepare a flask with a fuse. Once it is thrown, there is a 50% chance of the flask igniting successfully.\nYou can pour a pint of oil on the ground to cover an area 5 feet square, provided that the surface is smooth. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 1d3 points of fire damage to each creature in the area."
