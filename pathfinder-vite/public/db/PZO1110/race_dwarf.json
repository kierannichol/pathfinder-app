    "text": "These short and stocky defenders of mountain fortresses are often seen as stern and humorless. Known for mining the earthâ€™s treasures and crafting magnificent items from ore and gemstones, they have an unrivaled affinity for the bounties of the deep earth. Dwarves also have a tendency toward traditionalism and isolation that sometimes manifests as xenophobia."
