Your sorcerer levels stack with any wizard levels you possess when determining the powers of your familiar or bonded object. This ability does not allow you to have both a familiar and a bonded item. Once per day, your bonded item allows you to cast any one of your spells known (unlike a wizard\u0027s bonded item, which allows him to cast any one spell in his spellbook)."
