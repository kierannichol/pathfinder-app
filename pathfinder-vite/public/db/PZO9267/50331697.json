    "text": "A hand-sized clay rebus of the Master of Masters (see the sidebar on page 86 for more information on Irori\u0027s rebus), sometimes inlaid with copper or tiny gemstones, hangs from this braided hair necklace. It is normally worn under clothing against the skin, and grants the wearer a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against disease and poison. Once per day, the wearer can use purify food and drink, cleansing 1 cubic foot of food and water."
