    "text": "This brilliant red cloak bears a golden symbol of an upright winged sword. The wearer can use bless once per day.\nIf Iomedae is the wearer\u0027s patron, the wearer gains a +1 enhancement bonus to her natural armor. As a standard action, the wearer can create an illusory image of Iomedae\u0027s banner, which floats 2 to 5 feet above the wearer\u0027s head and remains in place as long as the wearer is conscious. If the wearer has the banner class feature, she can use this battle standard as her banner."
