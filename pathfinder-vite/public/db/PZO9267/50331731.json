    "text": "This +1 dagger is etched with spiderweb designs and its hilt is shaped like a skeleton that has been laid to rest. Pharasmin priests sometimes use these daggers during ceremonies sacred to the Lady of Graves, such as to cut umbilical cords of newborns or to lay beside the corpses of honored Pharasmins as their spirits travel to their resting place in the Great Beyond. A fate blade counts as a silver weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At will, the wielder can use disrupt undead."
