    "text": "This ugly +1 chainmail resists polishing and easily acquires bent links and other cosmetic damage from everyday use, though such blemishes never impair its function as armor. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can afflict one target within 30 feet with bad luck, giving it a â€“2 penalty to Armor Class, on attack rolls, or on saving throws (wearer\u0027s choice) for 1 minute. In addition, once per day, the wearer can use protection from good."
