    "text": "The blade of this +1 short sword appears to be nothing more than a shadow, but is quite solid and as sharp as steel. Five times per day, the wielder can as a move action create a featureless black \"mask\" of illusory cloth on the face of a willing target he touches. This mask obscures the wearer\u0027s identity and lasts for 10 minutes. Once per day, the wielder can activate the sword as a swift action; 1 minute afterward, the sword completely erases the wielder\u0027s memory of the previous minute (as if using modify memory)."
