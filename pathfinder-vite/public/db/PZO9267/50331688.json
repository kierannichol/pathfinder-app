    "text": "This wicked-looking +1 greatsword is engraved with glowing Ulfen runes that spell out a Gorumite battle song. When wielded, the blade sheds light as a candle. Once per day, the wielder can use rage (self only). The runes shine with a murderous red light, equivalent to a torch, whenever the rage ability is active and for 1 round whenever the weapon is used to deal damage to a living creature."
