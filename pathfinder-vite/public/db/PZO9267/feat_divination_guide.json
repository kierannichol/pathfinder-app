You gain a +1 sacred bonus if your worship a good deity or a +1 profane bonus if you worship an evil deity (if you worship a neutral deity the type of bonus is either determined by the type of energy you channel with the channel energy class feature or, if you don\u0027t have that class ability, your choice upon taking this feat) on all saving throws for 1 minute per caster level of the augury or divination spell you cast."
