    "text": "Three colorful silk ribbons tied at the base of this elegant, ornately chased +1 glaive flutter gracefully with every movement and never seem to get dirty. The glaive grants a +4 sacred bonus on one Perform skill (chosen when the weapon is created). The wielder retains this bonus so long as the weapon remains within 10 feet, which allows two-handed instruments to be played. Additionally, once per day the wielder may use color spray."
