    "text": "This spell allows you to add a creature\u0027s stolen face to or remove such a face that you\u0027ve already applied from your own. Before casting this spell, you must remove the face and eyes of a creature that has been dead no longer than 1 minute per caster level and place it over your own. Once you cast transplant visage, the creature\u0027s stolen skin magically melds with your own, making the expressions and eye color on your new face seem perfectly natural. Your new appearance grants you a +10 bonus on Disguise checks. Because the alteration made by transplant visageis permanent, there is no residual magical aura, and your new appearance is not recognized by detect spells. Transplant visagemay be cast innumerable times, allowing a single caster to wear layers upon layers of stolen faces. However, only the topmost face is visible at any one time."
