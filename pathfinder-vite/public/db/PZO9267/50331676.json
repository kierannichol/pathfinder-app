    "text": "This black leather tricorne hat is weather-beaten and salt-stained. It grants its wearer a +2 competence bonus on Profession (sailor) and Swim checks.\nIf Besmara is the wearer\u0027s patron, once per day the wearer can speak a command word to transform the hat into a small ship\u0027s boat such as a cutter, jolly boat, or longboat (Skull \u0026 Shackles Player\u0027s Guide 25). The boat is 20 feet long, has two pairs of oars and a single mast with a square sail, and can carry up to 12 passengers and crew. Upon command, or after 8 hours, the boat returns to its hat form, dumping out any occupants."
