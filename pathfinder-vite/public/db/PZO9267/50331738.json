    "text": "Shelyn\u0027s association with harmony and music inspires many composers to pen glorious songs in the Eternal Rose\u0027s honor, and numerous tools have been devised by her church to improve the performances of such melodies. The perfect tuning fork provides the ideal pitch to quickly begin an inspirational tune. When holding a perfect tuning fork in the hand, the wielder can strike the fork as part of the action of beginning a bardic performance. If the wielder can start a bardic performance as a standard action, she can do so as a move action instead. If the wielder can start a bardic performance as a move action, she can do so as a swift action instead. A perfect tuning fork loses its magic after one use, but it can be used as an ordinary tuning fork thereafter."
