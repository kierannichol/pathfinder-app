    "text": "This +1 leather armor usually looks like heavy protective work clothing, such as the garb of a professional blacksmith, butcher, or woodcutter. Once per day when an adjacent ally falls unconscious, the wearer can use cure light wounds on that ally as a swift action; if the wearer falls unconscious and this ability has not already been expended for the day, it automatically triggers on the wearer."
