The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on Acrobatics and Climb checks.\nIf Besmara is the wearer\u0027s patron, the wearer automatically floats to the surface of any body of water (at a speed of 30 feet) unless she desires otherwise; this does not prevent the wearer from falling safely into water or interacting with water in any other way."
