    "text": "A vurra is a carving of a giant\u0027s head, usually a god but sometimes a hero, loved one, or historical figure. This hand-sized gray stone is carved to resemble a bearded, wise-looking man with a squarish skull. It has a leather strap threaded through a hole in the top, and is strangely heavy for its size. The wearer gains a +2 bonus on Craft (sculpting) checks. Once per day, the wearer can use magic stone, and this ability can affect even the small boulders favored by giants. The carved face grows stern and angry when worn by a creature with a chaotic alignment, only returning to its normal expression when removed or in the hands of a nonchaotic creature.\nIf the giant god Minderhal is the wearer\u0027s patron, once per day the wearer may use owl\u0027s wisdom."
