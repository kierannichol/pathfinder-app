    "text": "This clear resin protects a weapon from harmful attacks made by oozes and rust monsters, as well as from similar effects that corrode or melt weapons, rendering the weapon immune for 24 hours. One pot can coat one two-handed weapon, two one-handed or light weapons, or 50 ammunition items. Applying it takes 1 full round per pot. Immersing the weapon in water or similar liquid washes it off."
