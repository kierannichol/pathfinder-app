    "text": "At 3rd level, all of the inquisitor\u0027s allies are treated as if they possessed the same teamwork feats as the inquisitor for the purpose of determining whether the inquisitor receives a bonus from her teamwork feats. Her allies do not receive any bonuses from these feats unless they actually possess the feats themselves. The allies\u0027 positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat for the inquisitor to receive the listed bonus."
