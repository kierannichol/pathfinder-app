    "text": "A blight druid can improve the attitude of vermin as a normal druid can with animals. Vermin have a starting attitude of unfriendly. The blight druid can also improve the attitude of animals and mindless undead creatures that were formerly animals, but she takes a â€“4 penalty on the check unless the animal or undead has a disease special attack.\nThis ability replaces wild empathy."
