    "text": "At 15th level, can spur his mount on while readying an attack. If a roughrider\u0027s mount takes a single move, the roughrider can make a full-attack, taking his attacks at any point during his mount\u0027s movement. If he has the Trample feat, he may substitute an overrun combat maneuver for each of his attacks. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity against the roughrider but not his mount."
