    "text": "You borrow one of the target\u0027s known skills. After touching the subject, you can make a single check with the chosen skill using the subject\u0027s skill ranks, but modified by your own key ability. If you take longer than the spell\u0027s duration to make the check or the check requires more time, then it fails and you must use your own skill ranks (if any). If the borrowed skill is a class skill for you, you gain the +3 bonus on checks using that skill."
