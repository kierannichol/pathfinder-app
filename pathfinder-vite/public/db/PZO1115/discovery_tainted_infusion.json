    "text": "When you prepare an extract with the infusion discovery, you can lace the extract with one of your bombs as long as the extract has a duration greater than instantaneous. You can reduce the duration of the extract to 1 round. As soon as the extractâ€™s duration expires, it detonates, dealing 150% of the normal bomb damage to the drinker. This effect does not produce a splash radius. Producing a tainted extract consumes both an infusion slot and a daily bomb use."
