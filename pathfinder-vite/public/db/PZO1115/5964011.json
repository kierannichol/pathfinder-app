    "text": "This small wooden box has many tiny compartments filled with items useful if you want to feign a sickness, as well as a handy reference book outlining common indicators for some of the more feared virulent diseases. The kit includes such things as false pustules, pills that cause the person chewing them to foam at the mouth, and herbal concoctions designed to induce fevers or vomiting. Using a symptom kit grants you a +5 circumstances bonus on Disguise checks made for the purpose of simulating illness. A symptom kit is exhausted after 10 uses."
