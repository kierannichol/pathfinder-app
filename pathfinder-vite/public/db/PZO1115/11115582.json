    "text": "The pommel of this ornate +2 longsword is made to look like a coiled golden dragon with six small diamond scales running down its back. When made, this sword holds 6 hero points. The wielder can use these points at any time, and they do not count against the wielder\u0027s maximum. As the hero points are used, the small diamonds on the dragon\u0027s back turn into coal. After the last hero point has been used, the hero\u0027s blade remains a +2 longsword."
