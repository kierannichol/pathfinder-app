    "text": "This polearm consists of two curved metal bands that close around a target when you attack, allowing you to bind an opponent. A mancatcher is built to capture a creature of a particular size category (such as Small or Medium) and doesn\u0027t work on creatures of the wrong size. Make a touch attack to hit an opponent and a combat maneuver check to grapple him (without the â€“4 penalty for not having two hands free); success means you and the target are grappled. Once the target is grappled, you can perform a move or damage grapple action against him. The mancatcher has hardness 10 and 5 hit points; breaking it requires a DC 26 Strength check. If you drop the mancatcher, the target can free himself as a standard action.",
