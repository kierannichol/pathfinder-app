    "text": "At 2nd level, a sandman adds +1 to the save DC of spells and bardic performance against opponents who are denied their Dex bonus. This increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 18th level. In addition, at 6th level he gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance against such foes, and this bonus increases to +4 at 14th level.\nThis ability replaces versatile performance."
