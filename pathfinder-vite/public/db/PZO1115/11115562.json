    "text": "A bow spiritis a shapeless force that hovers about you, taking ammunition from your quiver and firing it. For as long as the bow spiritlasts, you can spend a swift action to direct the bow spiritto fire an arrow or a bolt at a target of your choice, as if thebow spiritwere firing the necessary ranged weapon. The bow spirituses your base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier, as well as any bonuses and effects from feats you have that affect ranged attacks, or bonuses from the ammunition it uses. A bow spirit\u0027sattacks do not provoke attacks of opportunity. There must be ammunition available for the bow spiritto use, and it expends ammunition as if used by you."
