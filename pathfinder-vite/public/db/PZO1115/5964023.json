    "text": "This potent preparation causes a creature who drinks it to fall madly in love with the first creature he or she perceives after consuming it. The drinker\u0027s attitude toward that creature becomes helpful. If a romantic attraction is possible toward the first person viewed, the drinker falls in love with that person. Otherwise, the drinker\u0027s love is a platonic adoration. The effects of the philter are permanent unless removed by a break enchantment, dispel magic, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish."
