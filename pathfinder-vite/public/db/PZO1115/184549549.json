    "text": "This +1 flaming arrow continues to burn its target each round, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage on the attacker\u0027s turn for the next 3 rounds. Removing the arrow requires a successful DC 10 Heal check and prevents any further damage from the arrow (the DC increases to 15 if the target tries to remove the arrow from himself). Removing the arrow destroys it, and it burns up once the 3 rounds pass."
