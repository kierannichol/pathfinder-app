    "text": "The alchemist can develop special pigments and combine them with his alchemical reagents to create unique dyes that cling to the empty space around him, allowing him to paint images in the air to fool his enemies. By expending two daily uses of his bombs, he can use the dyes to create an image in a space adjacent to him, as silent image, using his alchemist level as the spellâ€™s caster level. The image he creates remains for a number of minutes equal to his alchemist level. He can dismiss this image as a standard action."
