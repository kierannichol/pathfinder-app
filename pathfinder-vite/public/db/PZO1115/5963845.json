    "text": "The black blade of this +2 keen unholy scythe reflects faint images of the souls of those it has claimed. Whenever the scythe is used to drop a creature to â€“1 hit points or less, the creature must immediately make a DC 14 Will save or be instantly slain. If the reaver\u0027s scythe kills a creature, either through damage or because the creature failed its Will save, the wielder immediately receives 1 hero point. This hero point must be used within 1 hour or it is lost. The wielder cannot gain another hero point from the scythe until the first is used or lost."
