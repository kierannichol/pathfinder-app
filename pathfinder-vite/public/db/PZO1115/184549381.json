    "text": "These thick leather cords wrap around the wearer\u0027s biceps and shoulders. When worn, they make the wearer\u0027s muscles appear larger than normal. The wearer treats his Strength score as 8 higher than normal when determining his carrying capacity. This bonus does not apply to combat, breaking items, or any other Strength-related rolls, it only contributes to the amount of equipment or material the wearer can carry."
