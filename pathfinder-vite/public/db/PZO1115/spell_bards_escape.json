    "text": "You whisk yourself and willing allies out of a tight jam, or instantly transfer yourselves to another location to achieve greater strategic positioning. You can move any allies within range to any other space of your choosing within range. Those spaces need not be in line of sight or line of effect from your original position, but must be open locations on surfaces able to support the creatures teleported. Except as noted above, this spell otherwise functions as dimension door."
