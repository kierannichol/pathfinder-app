    "text": "You cause an earthen or sandy surface to shift and churn within the area. The shifting sandobliterates tracks and is considered difficult terrain. Acrobatics checks in the area take a penalty equal to your caster level (maximum +10). Creatures entering or beginning their turn in the shifting sandmust make a Reflex save each round or become entangled until the beginning of their next turn. If they attempt to move while entangled, they must make a second Reflex save or fall prone. Creatures with the stability racial trait (like dwarves) may apply it as a bonus on their saving throws."
