    "text": "At 15th level, the penalties for fighting with two weapons are reduced by an additional â€“1 for a two-weapon warrior. This benefit stacks with improved balance. If he is using a one-handed weapon in his off hand, treating it as a light weapon, he uses the normal light weapon penalties."
