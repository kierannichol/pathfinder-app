    "text": "Entreating your deity for aid, you make a temporary oath of peace, granting you superior defenses but means you can\u0027t attack for the duration of the oath. For as long as you are subject to this spell, you gain a +5 sacred bonus to AC and on saving throws, as well as DR 10/evil. If you make a direct or indirect attack or any show any hostility toward any creature, the spell immediately ends."
