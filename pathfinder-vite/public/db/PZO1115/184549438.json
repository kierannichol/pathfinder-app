    "text": "This silvery cape furls and ripples like a flag with every step its owner takes. As a swift action, the wearer can order the cape to transform into a faint sphere of force that surrounds him on all sides. The field grants the wearer concealment (20% miss chance) against ranged attacks and lasts for 1 minute or until the wearer is missed by a ranged attack due to the power of the cloak, whichever comes first. When the field is used, all magic is lost from the cloak, leaving only a mundane silvery garment."
