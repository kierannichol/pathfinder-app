    "text": "This 2-foot-long metal tube has right angles at each end with mirrors inside; if you look in one end, you can see out the other end, allowing you safely peer over obstacles, around corners, or into small spaces your head where wouldn\u0027t fit. When using a periscope, the end of the tube counts as a Diminutive object, making it much less likely that an observed creature notices you; if you have total concealment from the creature except for the end of the periscope, use the tube\u0027s Diminutive size modifier on your Stealth check instead of your own size modifier. Distortion from the mirrors gives you a â€“4 penalty on Perception checks while looking through the periscope. Though the tube is fairly sturdy (hardness 5, 2 hit points), the mirrors inside are fragile (hardness 1, 1 hit point), and any damage that gets through the tube\u0027s hardness applies to the tube and the mirrors."
