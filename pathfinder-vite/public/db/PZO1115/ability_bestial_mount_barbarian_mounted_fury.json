    "text": "At 5th level, the mounted fury gains the service of a feral mount. This ability functions as a druid\u0027s animal companion, using the barbarian\u0027s level â€“4 as her effective druid level. This companion must be one that she is capable of riding and is suitable as a mount. A Medium barbarian can select a camel or a horse. A Small barbarian can select a pony or a wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if she is at least 8th level. Whenever a barbarian is raging while mounted on her bestial mount, the mount gains a +2 morale bonus to its Strength.\nThis ability replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge."
