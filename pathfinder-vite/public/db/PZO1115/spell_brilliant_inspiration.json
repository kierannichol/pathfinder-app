    "text": "You open a link between your mind and the subject\u0027s mind, giving advice and encouragement for as long as the spell is in effect. Each time the subject of the spell makes an attack roll, ability check, or skill check, it rolls two d20s and takes the better result. If any roll is a natural 20, the spell\u0027s effect ends--your brilliant advice is spent."
