    "text": "A protective spiritis an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that hovers about you, defending you against unexpected attacks. When a creature makes an attack of opportunity against you, the protective spiritmakes an immediate attack using your base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier. On a successful hit, the spirit does no damage, but it causes the attack of opportunity to automatically miss. A protective spiritcan defend against a number of attacks of opportunity equal to your Dexterity bonus (minimum 1) per round."
