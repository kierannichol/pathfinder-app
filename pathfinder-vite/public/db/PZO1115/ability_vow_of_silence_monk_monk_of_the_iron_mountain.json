    "text": "At 17th level, a monk of the iron mountain becomes as impassive as stone, making a vow of silence in exchange for greater abilities. The monk gains a +2 insight bonus to AC and CMD and a +4 bonus on Sense Motive, Stealth, and Perception checks. The monk does not lose the capacity for speech, but if he ever speaks, he loses this feature for 24 hours."
