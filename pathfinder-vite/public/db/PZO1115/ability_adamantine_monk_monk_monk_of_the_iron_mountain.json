    "text": "At 9th level, a monk of the iron mountain has muscles so strong and skin so resilient that he gains DR 1/--. This DR increases by 1 for every three levels thereafter. As a swift action, the monk can spend 1 ki point to double his DR until the beginning of his next turn.\nThis ability replaces improved evasion."
