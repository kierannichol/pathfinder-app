    "text": "At 15th level, as a move action, you can extend roots into the ground. Your speed is reduced to 5 feet, but you gain a +4 bonus to natural armor and a +10 bonus to CMD against bull rush, overrun, reposition, and trip maneuvers. You also gain tremorsense 30 feet and fast healing 1. You can use this power for a number of minutes per day equal to your sorcerer level. This duration need not be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments."
