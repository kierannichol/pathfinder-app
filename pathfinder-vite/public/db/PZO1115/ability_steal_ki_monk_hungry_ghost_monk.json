    "text": "At 5th level, a hungry ghost monk can steal ki from other creatures, though this ability is controversial in some circles of monks, who see it as nothing less than a form of vampirism. If the monk scores a confirmed critical hit against a living enemy or reduces a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, he can steal some of that creature\u0027s ki. This ability replenishes 1 spent ki point to the monk\u0027s ki pool, as long as the monk has at least 1 ki point in his pool. He cannot exceed his ki pool\u0027s maximum. At 11th level, each time the monk successfully steals ki, he can make an immediate saving throw against one disease he is suffering from. There is no penalty for failing this saving throw. The monk gains a bonus equal to his Wisdom modifier on the saving throw.\nThis ability replaces purity of body."
