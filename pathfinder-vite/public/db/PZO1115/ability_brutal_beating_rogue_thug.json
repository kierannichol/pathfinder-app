    "text": "At 3rd level, whenever a thug deals sneak attack damage, she can choose to forgo 1d6 points of sneak attack damage to make the target sickened for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 her rogue level. This ability does not stack with itself--only the most recent duration applies.\nThis ability replaces trap sense.\nRogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement the thug archetype: offensive defense, powerful sneak, strong impression, and weapon training."
