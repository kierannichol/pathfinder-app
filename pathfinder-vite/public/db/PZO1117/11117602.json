    "text": "You make yourself--including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment--appear translucent like a ghost. Any mundane or magical disguise on you is affected by this illusion as well; for example, if you are disguised as the king or a sahuagin, you look like a ghostly version of the king or a sahuagin. Your ghostly form may have a pale green, blue, or violet coloration, or a muted version of your normal appearance."
