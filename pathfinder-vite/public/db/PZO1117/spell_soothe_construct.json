    "text": "You soothe the elemental spirit of a targeted construct, reducing its chance of going berserk by 1d4% per four caster levels (maximum 5d4%). If cast on a construct that has already gone berserk and you are its master, you may immediately roll d% to end the construct\u0027s berserk state, it returns to normal functioning, and its berserk chance returns to 0%."
