    "text": "At 5th level, a shark shaman may use summon nature\u0027s ally I to summon a stingray and summon nature\u0027s ally II to summon a manta ray. She may cast summon nature\u0027s ally as a standard action when summoning rays and sharks, and summoned rays and sharks gain a number of temporary hit points equal to her druid level. This ability otherwise functions as the dragon shaman\u0027s totemic summons ability."
