    "text": "You alter the target\u0027s voice to something else. For example, you could make the target\u0027s voice high-pitched, husky, or nasal, or change its accent to an accent you are familiar with. If this spell is used as part of a disguise, the target gets a +10 bonus on the Disguise check when trying to fool a listener."
