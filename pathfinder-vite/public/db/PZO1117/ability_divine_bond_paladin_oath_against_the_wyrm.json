    "text": "This works like the paladin\u0027s normal divine bond ability, except as follows. If the paladin\u0027s bond is with a weapon, she cannot use that ability to add the brilliant energy, disruption, or merciful weapon properties, but she can add the bane weapon property (but only against dragons). If the paladin\u0027s bond is with her steed, the steed gains the paladin\u0027s aura-based immunities and her aura does not affect allies.\nThis replaces the standard divine bond ability."
