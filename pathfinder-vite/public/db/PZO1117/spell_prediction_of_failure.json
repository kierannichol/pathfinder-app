    "text": "You wrack the target\u0027s body and mind with the anguish and suffering of every bitter failure it will ever experience, rendering it permanently shaken and sickened. A successful Will save reduces the duration to 1 round per level. If the target is a spellcaster, failing this saving throw means it also gains a random minor spellblight (see Ultimate Magic)."
