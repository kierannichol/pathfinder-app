    "text": "By bringing forth the primeval ancestry of the target animal, you awaken a savage engine of destruction. The animal immediately gains the advanced creature simple template. It gains a +2 bonus on all rolls, including damage rolls and special ability DCs, a +4 bonus to AC and CMD, and +2 hit points per HD. The animal\u0027s primal instincts take hold for the duration of this spell--if the animal knows tricks granted by the Handle Animal skill, it loses access to all of those tricks save for â€œattack.\" This spell has no effect on animals that already have the advanced creature template."
