      "Effect": "The witch curses the target so he is doomed to die (Will negates). As long as the curse persists, the target takes a â€“4 penalty to his armor class and on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks. While the curse persists, the witch may end it by bringing its full force upon her victim all at once. Doing so gives the victim a penalty equal to the witch\u0027s caster level to his armor class or on any single attack roll, combat maneuver check, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw."
