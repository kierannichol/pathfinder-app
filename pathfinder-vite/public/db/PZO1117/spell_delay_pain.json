    "text": "You override the target\u0027s ability to feel pain. Pain effects (such as pain strikeand symbol of pain) do not affect the target until this spell\u0027s duration has expired. This does not negate any physical damage, ability damage, or ability drain that a pain effect has already done, but it does negate ongoing penalties from pain while the spell lasts."
