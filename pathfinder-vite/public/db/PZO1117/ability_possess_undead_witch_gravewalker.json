    "text": "A gravewalker may take direct control of one of her undead minions within her aura of desecration, as if using magic jar; the witch\u0027s poppet acts as the soul receptacle for this ability. The minion gets no saving throw against this ability.\nThis replaces the witch\u0027s hex gained at 8th level.\nHexes: The following witch hexes complement the gravewalker archetype: beast of ill-omen, evil eye, misfortune.\nMajor Hexes: The following major hexes complement the gravewalker archetype: ice tomb, infected wounds, waxen image."
