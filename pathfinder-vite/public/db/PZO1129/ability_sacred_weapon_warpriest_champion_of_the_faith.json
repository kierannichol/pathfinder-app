    "text": "At 1st level, a champion of the faith gains the sacred weapon class feature as normal. However, this ability does not grant the 4th-level ability to enhance the champion of the faith\u0027s weapon with divine power, nor does it grant any subsequent increases to that ability. Instead, at 4th level, any sacred weapon wielded by a champion of the faith counts as having his chosen alignment for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.\nAt 12th level, once per day as a swift action, a champion of the faith can enhance any one sacred weapon with a weapon special ability based on his chosen alignment (anarchic for chaos, unholy for evil, holy for good, and axiomatic for law). This effect lasts for 1 minute. He can use this ability one additional time per day at 16th and 20th levels."
