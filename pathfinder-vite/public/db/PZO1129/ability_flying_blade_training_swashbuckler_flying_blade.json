    "text": "At 5th level, a flying blade gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using daggers or starknives in combat. When a flying blade wields a dagger or starknife, she gains the benefit of the Improved Critical feat with those weapons. Additionally, a flying blade increases the range increment of a thrown dagger or starknife by 5 feet. The increase of range increment stacks with that of precise throw.\nEvery 4 levels thereafter, the bonus on attack and damage rolls increases by 1, and the range increment increases by 5 feet."
