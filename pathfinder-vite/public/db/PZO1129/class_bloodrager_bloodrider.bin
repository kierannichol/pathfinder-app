¼In the world's wild lands, a mount is an advantage in both everyday life and the dealing of death. In many barbarian tribes, the true stature of a warrior is determined by his skill and ferocity on horseback. Other tribes measure it in skill atop whatever terrible mounts their people employ. A number of bloodragers are not only skilled in the art of mounted combat, but have learned to channel their arcane energies directly into their mount.ª½
