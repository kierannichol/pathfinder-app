    "text": "Starting at 6th level, whenever a feral hunter casts a summon nature\u0027s ally spell to summon one or more animals, she summons one additional animal of the same type. The summoned creature or creatures must be animals and must be of the same type as the hunter\u0027s current aspect or of a similar type (bears for bear aspect, dogs or wolves for wolf aspect, great cats for the tiger aspect, and so on). The additional creature immediately vanishes if the hunter chooses a different aspect or ends his feral focus ability. She can increase the duration of any one summon nature\u0027s ally spell affected by this ability to 1 minute per level. She can have only one spell with a duration increased by this ability active at a time."
