    "text": "This bottle looks like it\u0027s made of glass, but is more fragile and doesn\u0027t cause damage when it strikes a creature or object. Highly prized by theater performers, sugar glass bottles grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Perform checks involving the creation of seemingly realistic fights."
