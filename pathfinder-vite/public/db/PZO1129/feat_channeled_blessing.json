      "Benefit": "When you channel energy to heal, you can instead deliver a warpriest\u0027s blessing to a single willing creature (including yourself ) in the area that otherwise would have been healed by your channeled energy. The blessing must be one that requires a standard action and affects one or more creatures. If the blessing would normally affect multiple targets, you affect only a single target. The target receives the blessing in place of the healing and any other effects of the channeled energy. (This application doesn\u0027t count toward your uses of blessings per day.)"
