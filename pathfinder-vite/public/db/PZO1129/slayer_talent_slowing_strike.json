      "benefit": "An opponent damaged by the slayerâ€˜s sneak attack has its speed halved for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude saving throw negates this effect (DC \u003d 10 + 1/2 of the slayer\u0027s level + the slayer\u0027s Intelligence modifier). Against creatures with multiple types of movement, the slayer must choose which movement type to affect. If the slayer affects a creature\u0027s flight movement, its maneuverability is reduced by one step; if it\u0027s airborne at the time, it falls unless it succeeds at a DC 10 Fly check. If the slayer targets a creature already affected by this ability, its speed and maneuverability are not further reduced; the slayer may either extend the duration of that effect by 1d4 rounds or choose another movement type to affect (keeping track of the duration of each affected movement separately)."
