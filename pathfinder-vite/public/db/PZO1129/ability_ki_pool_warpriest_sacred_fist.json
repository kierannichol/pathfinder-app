    "text": "At 7th level, the sacred fist gains a ki pool. This functions as the monk class feature, using the sacred fist\u0027s level â€“ 3 as his monk level when determining the number of points in his pool and bonuses granted to his unarmed strike. Additionally, the sacred fist can as a swift action spend 1 point from his ki pool to grant himself a +1 insight bonus to his AC for 1 minute. (This is in addition the normal ki ability to gain a dodge bonus to AC.) This insight bonus increases by 1 for every 3 levels above 7th (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level)."
