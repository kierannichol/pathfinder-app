    "text": "This dark burgundy cloak shifts its hue and pattern to blend in against its surroundings, granting the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks. The cloak holds a concealed scabbard in which a light blade (as defined in the fighter weapon group) can be hidden. The wearer can draw the blade as if from a normal scabbard, but anyone searching the wearer for the item must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check, as if he were looking for a secret door.\nIf a swashbuckler is wearing the cloak, she can spend 1 panache point to vanish, as the spell."
