    "text": "This spell functions as rage, except it affects only undead creatures and bolsters them with necromantic energy rather than emotion. Each affected creature gains a +2 profane bonus to Strength and Charisma, a +1 profane bonus on Will saves, and a â€“2 penalty to AC. The effect is otherwise identical to a barbarian\u0027s rage."
