    "text": "At 10th level, a grave warden can slay a studied undead opponent. This functions as the assassinate slayer talent, except it requires a successful Will saving throw instead of a successful Fortitude save, affects only undead, and destroys the target instead of killing it. If the target succeeds at its saving throw, it becomes immune to that grave warden\u0027s dustbringer ability for 24 hours.\nThis ability replaces the advanced slayer talent gained at 10th level.\nSlayer Talents: The following slayer talents (and rogue talents) complement the deliverer archetype: fast stealth, finesse rogue, surprise attack, swift poison, terrain mastery, trap spotter, and unwitting ally."
