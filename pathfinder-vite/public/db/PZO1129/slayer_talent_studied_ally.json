The slayer gains a +1 bonus on checks and attack rolls to use the aid another action to help with that ally\u0027s skill checks, attacks, or AC. This bonus increases at the same rate as a slayer\u0027s studied target bonus. At 7th level, a slayer can study an ally as a move or swift action. A slayer\u0027s studied ally counts against the number of studied targets he can have active at once."
