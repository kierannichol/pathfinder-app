    "text": "At 5th level, as a swift action a steel-breaker can observe a creature or object to find its weak point by succeeding at a Wisdom check, adding her brawler level against a DC of 10 + the object\u0027s hardness or the target\u0027s CR. If it succeeds, the steel-breaker gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls until the end of her turn, and any attacks she makes until the end of her turn ignore the creature or object\u0027s DR or hardness.\nA steel-breaker can instead use this ability as a swift action to analyze the movements and expressions of one creature within 30 feet, granting a bonus on Sense Motive checks and Reflex saving throws, as well as a dodge bonus to AC against that opponent equal to 1/2 her brawler level until the start of her next turn."
