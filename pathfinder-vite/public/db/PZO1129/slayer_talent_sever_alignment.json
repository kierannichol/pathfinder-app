      "benefit": "When making a sneak attack against an opponent with an alignment subtype, a rogue (or slayer) with this talent can forgo her sneak attack damage to scramble the creature\u0027s metaphysical nature. If the attack succeeds, the rogue deals weapon damage as normal, and the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC \u003d 10 + half the rogue\u0027s level + the rogue\u0027s (or slayer\u0027s) Intelligence modifier) or lose all damage reduction overcome by aligned weapons (such as DR 10/good), lose all regeneration overcome by aligned sources (such as regeneration 10 [good]), and lose the ability to cast spells and use spell-like abilities with alignment descriptors for 1 round for every 2d6 points of sneak attack damage the rogue (or slayer) would have dealt (minimum 1 round)."
