    "text": "Applying this herbal salve to a bleeding wound cures 1 point of damage and prevents additional damage from bleeding for 1 hour per application. After an hour, if the bleed effect hasn\u0027t been properly treated, the injury resumes bleeding and more salve must be applied. Though blood-clotter salve can be applied successively to the same injury, applying multiple doses doesn\u0027t cure additional damage."
