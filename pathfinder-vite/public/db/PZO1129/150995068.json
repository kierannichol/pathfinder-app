    "text": "This thin, black canvas belt is typically tied loosely about the waist to secure a robe, kimono, or martial artist\u0027s dobok. Three times per day as a free action, the wearer can select a combat maneuver and receive an enhancement bonus of +1 to +5 on combat maneuver checks for this combat maneuver and a +1 to +5 bonus to CMD when defending against this maneuver for 1 round. Additionally, when worn by a brawler, the belt grants one additional use of her martial flexibility class feature each day."
