    "text": "The reddish brown bark of this charred manzanita branch shows only in patches. The staff is a mere 3 feet long and balanced for use as a masterwork club.\nWhen casting produce flame from the staff, its wielder can choose to set the end of the staff alight instead of producing the flame in her hand. This does not damage the staff, and the spell\u0027s damage is added to any melee attacks made with the staff."
