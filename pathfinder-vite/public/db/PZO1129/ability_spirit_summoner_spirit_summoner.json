He gains the spirit ability of that spirit and uses his summoner level as his shaman level for determining its effects. The spirit summoner can select spells granted by that spirit as summoner spells known, using the shaman level of the spell as the summoner spell level. The summoner cannot select spirit spells that are above 6th level.\nAt 9th level, the summoner gains the abilities listed in the greater version of his selected spirit.\nAt 17th level, the summoner gains the abilities listed for the true version of his selected spirit."
