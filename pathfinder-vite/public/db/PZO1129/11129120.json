If the wearer can cast summon nature\u0027s ally spells, the wearer adds forest drake and shadow drake to the 4th-level list of monsters he can summon with those spells, adds flame drake to the 5th-level list, adds frost drake to the 6th-level list, and adds desert drake to the 9th-level list. Also, once per day on command the wearer can use this ring to summon a shadow drake, as if by the summon nature\u0027s ally IV spell."
