    "text": "At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch\u0027s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman\u0027s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced."
