    "text": "You coat the targets in thick, sticky mud. The mud acts as a slow spell and also blinds the targets. A creature can use a standard action to remove the mud from its eyes or the eyes of an adjacent creature, ending the blinded condition for that individual. Removing enough mud to end the slow effect is a full-round action. Jumping into a lake or being subject to an effect that creates a lot of water (such as create water or hydraulic push) removes all the mud in 1 round."
