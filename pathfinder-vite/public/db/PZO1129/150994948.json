    "text": "Wax and resin seal this smoked glass bottle. When the bottle is opened or shattered, a shrill scream erupts in a 20-foot-radius burst. Any bardic performances with audible components immediately end. Any spellcaster concentrating on or casting a spell must succeed at a concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) or lose the spell. In addition, the scream dispels any silence spells that overlap its area. The bottle can be thrown as a splash weapon or opened by hand. If the bottle is opened, its burst is centered on the opener\u0027s space."
