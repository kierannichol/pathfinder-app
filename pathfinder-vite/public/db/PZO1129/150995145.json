    "text": "This silver band is cast to resemble a pack of hunting wolves. On command, the wearer can gain the scent ability with a range of 10 feet (20 feet upwind, 5 feet downwind) as the wolf aspect of the hunter\u0027s animal focus class feature. If the wearer is a hunter with that aspect, this headband instead increases the wearer\u0027s effective hunter level for the wolf aspect by 8 levels."
