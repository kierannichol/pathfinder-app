    "text": "This leather mask is vaguely animalistic, and is inlaid with various primitive designs. Three times per day on command, the wearer gains the benefit of a single aspect of an animal attuned to the mask, as if by the hunter\u0027s animal focus class feature. Each mask is attuned to one type of animal from the animal focus list, chosen when the mask is created."
