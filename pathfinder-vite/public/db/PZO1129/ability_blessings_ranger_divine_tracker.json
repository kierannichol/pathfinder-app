    "text": "At 4th level, a divine tracker forms a close bond with his deity\u0027s ethos. He selects two warpriest domains from among the domains granted by his deity, and gains the minor blessings of those domains. A divine tracker can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that domain. If a divine tracker isn\u0027t devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two blessings to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities, subject to GM approval. The restriction on alignment domains still applies. A divine tracker uses his ranger level as his warpriest level to determine the effect of the blessing. At 13th level, a divine tracker gains the major blessing from both of his domains."
