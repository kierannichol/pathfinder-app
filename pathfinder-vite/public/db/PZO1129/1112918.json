    "text": "This quick-drying cast is perfect for preserving a set of footprints in order to examine them later. By spending 1 minute setting the cast and waiting for it to dry, you can copy footprints, allowing others to examine them without traveling to the scene, and preventing the DC of the Survival check to analyze them from increasing because of time or weather."
