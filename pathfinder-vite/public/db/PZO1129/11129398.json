    "text": "The original color of these supple, calfskin gloves is obfuscated by layers of brown bloodstains that persist through any amount of cleaning. If the gloves are soaked in the blood of a recently killed creature, the wearer gains a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against creatures of the same type (or subtype for humanoids or outsiders, per the ranger\u0027s favored enemy class feature) for 1 hour. If the gloves are worn by a slayer, the bonus on damage rolls is equal the slayer\u0027s studied target bonus. Creatures that lack blood, such as skeletons, golems, or clockwork creatures, cannot activate the gloves\u0027 ability."
