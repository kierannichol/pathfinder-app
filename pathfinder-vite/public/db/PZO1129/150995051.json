    "text": "This set of bulky wooden rings is the key to a substitution code set at the rings\u0027 creation. A base set comes with two identical rings. Additional rings can be made for 4 gp apiece. Using the cipher rings\u0027 code enables you to create or decode a written message (no check required). Deciphering the message without the correct ring requires a DC 25 Linguistics check."
