On any round in which deliverer attacks an opponent whose alignment is at least two steps away from his own (such as a lawful good deliverer fighting a chaotic good or lawful evil foe, or a neutral foe with no other alignment components), he gains a +2 bonus on Will saving throws against that opponent\u0027s abilities, as well as the benefit of the Diehard feat until the end of his next turn."
