While the opponent is impaled, as an attack action you may make a grapple check on your turn at a -4 penalty to damage the opponent with your weapon, even if your weapon cannot normally be used in a grapple.",
      "Normal": "You can only attack with an unarmed strike, natural weapon, or light weapon against opponents you are grappling."
