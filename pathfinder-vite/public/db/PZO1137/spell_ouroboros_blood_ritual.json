      "Effect": "The caster uses the ouroboros blood to paint complex mathematical equations on the ground surrounding a dead body (or if lacking a body, in the area where the body was slain). Upon the ritual\u0027s completion, the dead body is restored to life, as per true resurrection. Unlike that spell\u0027s limitation, there is no limit as to how long the body has been dead before it can be restored to life in this manner, but bodies whose souls have been judged and sent on to the afterlife (GM\u0027s discretion) cannot be restored to life via this ritual. A creature can be restored to life via an ouroboros blood ritual only once through all time."
