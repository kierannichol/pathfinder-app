    "text": "Szuriel\u0027s weapon is Lamentation of the Faithless, a black-bladed +5 speed unholy greatsword. When using the blade to attack, Szuriel regains 1d6 hit points with each successful hit. If Szuriel presents her sword as a standard action, all creatures within 60 feet that view it are blinded and affected by crushing despair for 1d4+1 rounds unless they succeed at a DC 30 Will save. Creatures with the good subtype and divine spellcasters take a â€“4 penalty on this save. As a standard action, Szuriel can call the sword to her hand from any distance, including across planar boundaries.",
