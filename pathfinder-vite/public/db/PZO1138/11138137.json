    "text": "Shortly after the Eye of Abendego began, the Storm Kindlers created enchanted masks to aid in the navigation of the often storm-lashed swamps. Today, many of these distinctive masks remain, now worn by humanoid chieftains and Koboto witch doctors. The masks are often defaced, with their original appearance twisted into monstrous or demonic visages. Their new owners refer to them as goz masks.\nA goz mask allows the wearer to see through fog, smoke, and other obscuring vapors as if they did not exist. This ability functions underwater as well, allowing the wearer to see through thick silt and other aquatic precipitates. Additionally, the wearer is treated as one size category larger and gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws made to resist the effects of wind. A goz mask allows its wearer to breathe water for 60 minutes per dayâ€”these minutes need not be consecutive, but must be expended in 10-minute increments."
