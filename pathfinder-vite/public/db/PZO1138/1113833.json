Easily recognized by its eagle\u0027s-head pommel and golden quillons crafted like upswept eagle wings, a talonstrike sword\u0027s defending special ability also protects the wielder\u0027s mount. Once per day when the wielder confirms a critical hit with a talonstrike sword, the wielder can cast dimensional anchor on the target as a free action."
