In addition, you can choose up to two teamwork feats you have when entering the Sisterhood Style stance. As a swift action, you can grant one of those feats to two allies within 20 feet until the beginning of your next turn, or you can grant both feats to one ally within 20 feet until the beginning of your next turn."
