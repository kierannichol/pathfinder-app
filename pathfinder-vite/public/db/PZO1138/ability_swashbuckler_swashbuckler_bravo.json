    "text": "A bravo gains Exotic Weapon Proficiency (dueling sword) as a bonus feat.\nThe bravo is not proficient with bucklers, and does not gain Climb or Swim as class skills.\nThis ability alters the swashbuckler\u0027s class skills and armor proficiencies.\nDeeds: A bravo\u0027s training and personality set her apart from the typical swashbuckler, and as a result of these differences (as well as the impact of her training), she gains the following deeds. These deeds function only when the bravo is wielding just a dueling sword."
