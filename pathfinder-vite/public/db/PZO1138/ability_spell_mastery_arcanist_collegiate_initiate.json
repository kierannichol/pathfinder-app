    "text": "At 5th level, a Collegiate initiate gains Spell Mastery as a bonus feat. Her arcanist levels count as wizard levels for the purpose of satisfying feat prerequisites, both when selecting this bonus feat and when selecting feats gained from character advancement. If she uses her arcanist level to satisfy the prerequisites for Spell Mastery, she can prepare spells selected with this feat as arcanist spells without referring to a spellbook, but not as wizard spells. The Collegiate initiate can also select Spell Mastery as a feat gained from character advancement, allowing her to select the feat multiple times.\nIn addition, if the Collegiate initiate gains levels in the collegiate arcanist prestige class, her prestige class levels stack with her arcanist levels when determining the number of points in her arcane reservoir (though not the effectiveness of arcane exploits based on class level). A Collegiate initiate who takes levels in collegiate arcanist and gains the spontaneous spell Mastery class feature can use that ability to instantly lose one of her prepared spells and immediately prepare a different arcanist spell of the same level or lower that she has mastered with Spell Mastery, rather than spontaneous spell mastery\u0027s normal effect. She is still limited to the same number of times per day she can use spontaneous spell mastery."
