    "text": "This clear glass jar has a stone lid held fast against a leather sealing ring by a hinged metal clamp. A marble-sized orb of crackling electricity flits within the jar. A jar of lightning can be activated only once in one of two waysâ€”it can be thrown, or it can be opened. In either case, once activated, the jar of lightning is expended.\nIf the jar is thrown, it behaves as a splash weapon that deals 5d6 points of electricity damage on a direct hit, and deals 1d6 points of electricity damage to adjacent targets as splash damage.\nWhen the jar is merely opened, the trapped sphere of lightning floats up and out of the jar to hover in the space in which it was released. When a creature or metal object enters the square in which the ball of lightning is floating, the ball detonates. If it detonates on the first round after its release, the ball of lightning deals 2d6 points of electricity damage to the creature or metal object that detonates it. This damage increases by 2d6 for each additional round after its release, until it reaches its maximum damage potential of 10d6 points of electricity damage on the fifth round. Creatures in adjacent squares take half this damage. If the ball of lightning hasn\u0027t detonated by the end of the fifth round, it fades away harmlessly. Any creature damaged in this way can attempt a DC 15 Reflex save for half damage. An arrow shot into or through the square in which the ball hovers is sufficient to detonate the sphere."
