    "text": "Investigations into the ancient and mysterious traditions of the seven virtues of rule of the lost human empire of Azlant, which were later corrupted by the runelords into the more familiar seven deadly sins, inspired the Cyphermages to develop the runes of rule. This spell allows you to place a rune upon another creature that can then be used to aid it at a later time. You determine the spell\u0027s effect at the time of casting by using your finger to paint a specific rune on the recipient\u0027s body with a dose of specially prepared paint worth 25 gp. The inscribed rune lasts for 24 hours or until the spell is activated. Unless otherwise noted, the creature upon which the rune of rule has been inscribed can activate it at any time as a swift action. If the spell effect isn\u0027t used, all markings associated with the rune disappear and the effect fades. You can never place the spell upon yourself--it must be bestowed on someone else. The seven runes of rule, along with their specific effects when the user activates them, are listed below. A creature can bear only one rune of rule at a time."
