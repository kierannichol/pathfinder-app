    "text": "This Gray Maidenâ€“style helm has an ornate crown-like pattern sculpted into its brow. The first such helms were created in the final days of Queen Ileosa\u0027s reign for use by commanders in the organization, but her loyalists have had additional copies made in her honor since her fall from power, and many of the Erinyes Company proudly wear such helms today.\nA helm of the Fanged Crown allows its wearer to use heroism on herself once per day as a standard action. However, the spell\u0027s bonuses act as penalties instead on attack rolls and skill checks against devils, devilbound creatures, and creatures with the infernal sorcerer bloodline, and on saving throws against effects generated by such creatures. Once activated, the effects last for 3 hours or until the helm is removed."
