    "text": "At each class level, she chooses one spell from the druid spell list or one spell with the good descriptor from the cleric spell list. The spell must be of a spell level that she can cast, and cannot be a spell that already appears on her arcanist spell list. A Collegiate initiate can cast a spell that she has chosen with this ability as if it were on her spell list and prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to half the spell\u0027s level (minimum 1) and expending a spell slot of the spell\u0027s level. At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Collegiate initiate can choose to lose a spell that she has chosen with this ability in exchange for a new spell of the same spell level that meets the same requirements."
