    "text": "This gum has alchemical properties that allow it to soak up magical energy and release it when the gum is chewed. As a standard action, a stick of tiller\u0027s gum can be imbued with a spell of up to 3rd level with a casting time of less than 1 minute and that targets one or more creatures, as if the gum were the target of the spell. The gum holds the spell\u0027s charge for 1 hour, during which time a creature capable of casting the stored spell can chew the gum as a standard action to gain the spell\u0027s effects, expending the stored spell and destroying the gum. The stored spell uses the original caster\u0027s level to determine its effects. If the spell-imbued gum isn\u0027t used before an hour passes, it is ruined. Crafting a stick of tiller\u0027s gum requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
