    "text": "At 4th level, a toxic talon can use secret alchemical techniques to enhance a poison as he applies it to a weapon, increasing the save DC of the poison by 1 (this bonus increases to +2 at 12th level). This increase to the save DC lasts for 1 minute or until the poison is used up, whichever comes first. A toxic talon can use catalyst once per hour."
