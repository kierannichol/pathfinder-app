    "text": "This iridescent +3 Hellknight plate is cold to the touch, and the fiendish features that swirl across the plates shed gouts of cold mist. The wearer of this armor gains cold resistance 10. Any creature that ends its movement within 5 feet of the wearer must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw or be staggered for 1 round, numbed by the cold emitted by the armor. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw is immune to the effects of that gelugon plate for 24 hours. The wearer of a suit of gelugon plate can suppress or reactivate this effect as a standard action.\nA Hellknight (or Hellknight signifer with heavy armor proficiency) wearing this armor can cast wall of ice three times per day."
