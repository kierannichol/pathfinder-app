    "text": "This crimson cloak is trimmed with feathers taken from erinyes devils. Three times per day on command, the cloak transforms into a pair of black-feathered wings that grant the wearer a fly speed of 30 feet (average maneuverability) for 10 minutes. If the wearer is wearing Gray Maiden plate, its armor check penalty does not apply to the wearer\u0027s Fly checks. In addition, the wearer gains a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws."
