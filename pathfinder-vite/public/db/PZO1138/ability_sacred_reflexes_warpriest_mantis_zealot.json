    "text": "At 7th level, a mantis zealot can emulate the Mantis God\u0027s grace and move with a supernatural fluidity. As long as he is wearing light or no armor, as a swift action he can gain uncanny dodge as per the rogue class feature. He can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to his warpriest level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. If he already has the uncanny dodge ability from another source, he instead gains improved uncanny dodge while this ability is active. At 10th level, when he uses this ability, he also gains evasion as per the monk class feature (or improved evasion if he already has evasion from another source). At 13th level, he gains improved uncanny dodge instead of uncanny dodge. At 16th level, he can activate this ability as part of making an initiative check, before rolling the die. At 19th level, he gains improved evasion instead of evasion."
