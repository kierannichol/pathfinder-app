    "text": "At 8th level, the argent voice learns how to mimic aspects of the magical Song of Silver with his performance, enhancing his allies\u0027 ability to combat devils and similar fiends. To be affected, a creature must be able to hear the argent voice\u0027s singing and be within 30 feet of him. Natural and manufactured weapons wielded by affected allies are treated as though they were silver for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. At 14th level, allies\u0027 natural and manufactured weapons also gain the benefit of the evil outsider bane weapon special ability."
