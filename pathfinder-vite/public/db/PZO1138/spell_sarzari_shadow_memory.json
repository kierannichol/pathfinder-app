    "text": "While casting this spell, you slowly destroy a piece of art bearing your victim\u0027s likeness and beseech Achaekek to grant you access to the knowledge and lore contained within the innermost sanctum of the Crimson Citadel, the Sarzari Library. This endows you with information that could facilitate the target\u0027s assassination by your hands. This information must be chosen from one of the three following categories--back doors, character, or weakness."
