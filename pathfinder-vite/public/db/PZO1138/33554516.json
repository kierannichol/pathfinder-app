    "text": "This garment is intended for a horse or similar quadruped, but it can change size and shape to fit any four-legged creature ranging from Small to Huge in size. When worn, a caparison of resistance offers the wearer magic protection in the form of a +1 to +5 resistance bonus on all saving throws (Fortitude, Reflex, and Will). This bonus on saving throws also applies to a single rider who is mounted on the creature (in the case of multiple riders, the resistance bonus is not shared at all and applies only to the mount)."
