    "text": "At 3rd level, a horselord gains favored terrain (desert) as per the ranger ability of the same name. At 8th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the granted bonus on initiative and skill checks increases by 2, but the horselord never selects additional favored terrains. Additionally, his mount gains all the benefits of the favored terrain ability."
