    "text": "At 2nd level, a brazen deceiver has mastered the art of using magic without being detected. The brazen deceiver gains Spellsong as a bonus feat. Observers do not automatically recognize his bardic performances as anything other than ordinary speech or performance. Those specifically looking for abnormal effects must succeed at a Sense Motive check (DC \u003d 10 + half the brazen deceiver\u0027s bard level + the brazen deceiver\u0027s Charisma modifier) to detect his performances."
