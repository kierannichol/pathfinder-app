    "text": "These stylized red gloves are often employed by agents of the Red Mantis for stealthy assassinations. If the wearer successfully pins an opponent with a grapple combat maneuver, she can perform a special coup de grace attack the next round with the gloves, treating them as if they were sawtooth sabres (1d8 points of slashing damage, critical threat range of 19â€“20) for the purpose of this attack. Should the wearer of these gloves slay her opponent with this attack, the target\u0027s head erupts in a geyser of blood, preventing life-restoring spells that require an intact body. A creature that survives this coup de grace attack is immune to subsequent attempts from any mantis embrace for 24 hours."
