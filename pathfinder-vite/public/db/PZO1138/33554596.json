    "text": "Each of these silver-and-gemstone rings is attuned to a specific aiudara, or elf gate. The ring must be created at the aiudara in question, and its gemstone always matches the gate\u0027s portal-key. On command once per week, the ring teleports its wearer back to that gate, as per word of recall. Theoretically, a ring of retreat could be crafted instead to transport the wearer to a specific site of import, such as a temple or stronghold, but to date, these rings have been crafted only with elf gates in mind."
