    "text": "When inhaled, this incense causes creatures to see dazzling auras around light sources, drawing their attention to such illumination as the moon or stars and away from other nearby creatures. Any creature inhaling sparkle smoke that fails a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw takes a â€“4 penalty on Perception checks to notice creatures smaller than itself in areas of at least dim light for 1 hour. Crafting a dose of sparkle smoke requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check."
