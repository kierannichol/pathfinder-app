    "text": "At 2nd level, once per day as a swift action, a Scion of Peace can halve her bonus on saving throws from divine grace (minimum +1) to grant the resulting bonus to herself and to all allies within 30 feet. This shared bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the scion\u0027s Charisma modifier, after which her divine grace is suppressed for 1 hour before returning to normal."
