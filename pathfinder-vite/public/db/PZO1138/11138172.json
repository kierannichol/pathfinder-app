    "text": "This striped conch shell appears to be nothing more than a piece of flotsam idly picked up by a beachcomber. Once per day when held to the lips, the conch shell absorbs a whispered message of 25 words or fewer and stores the spoken words indefinitely. When pressed to the ear and prompted by the command word, the shell repeats its message as a whisper that cannot be heard by anyone except the creature holding the conch shell. A whispering shell can only hold one such message at a time, but can replay its message as often as a creature issues the command to do so."
