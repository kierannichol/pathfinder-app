    "text": "A caparison is a sizable cloth covering laid over a mount or other four-legged creature. It serves many of the same purposes a cloak does for a humanoid creature, occupies the shoulder slot, and can be enchanted in the same manner. Caparisons are sometimes made of precious materials or crafted with delicate artistryâ€”this does not increase their practicality, but can significantly increase their price as art objects."
