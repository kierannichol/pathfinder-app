    "text": "There are instances where wearing full plate armor can jeopardize a Hellknight\u0027s life. Primarily worn by Hellknight sailors, this studded leather armor includes heavy gloves and a helm of sculpted leather designed to look like a skullâ€” either a human\u0027s or that of some aquatic creature. Hellknight leather\u0027s statistics are identical to those of studded leather, except it costs 5 gp more and weighs 5 pounds more.",
