    "text": "This coarse-grained salt is flecked with bands of silver running through each crystal. A spellcaster can include this salt as a material component when casting a spell, even if the spell does not normally require material components. Any bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage dealt by a spell enhanced by sterling salt is treated as good and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and suppressing regeneration, in addition to its normal type. If a creature that is adversely affected by silver (such as a devil or lycanthrope) is affected by a spell augmented by sterling salt, that creature takes a â€“1 penalty on its saving throw to resist or negate the effects of the spell (if a saving throw is allowed)."
