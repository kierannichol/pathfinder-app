    "text": "This spell targets an area of earth, metal, stone, or wood, causing long, serrated blades to shoot out from random points within the area of effect. Any creature in the area when the spell is first cast must attempt a Reflex save to avoid taking 3d8 points of piercing damage from the blades and an additional 2d6 points of bleed damage. A creature that fails the save also has its speed reduced by half for 24 hours or until the injured creature benefits from a â€œcure\" spell (which restores lost hit points as normal). Another creature can remove the penalty by succeeding on a Heal check against the spell\u0027s save DC as a standard action."
