    "text": "A blossoming light forsakes her deity\u0027s deeper mysteries to focus on benevolence, healing, and bringing light to darkness. A blossoming light still selects domains and retains access to domain powers, but does not gain domain spell slots.\nBlossoming lights are beacons of goodness, guiding others to follow their own best natures. A blossoming light adds half her level on Diplomacy checks against good creatures or to convince an evil creature to take an action against its evil nature.\nA blossoming light\u0027s channel energy is usable a number of times per day equal to 5 + her Charisma modifier. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the blossoming light gains an additional use per day of channel energy.\nAt 3rd level, when a blossoming light channels energy to harm undead, her channeled energy also harms chaotic evil outsiders, worshipers of chaotic evil deities, and evil creatures with light sensitivity or light blindness as if they were undead.\nAt 7th level, when a blossoming light channels energy, she can expend an additional use to fill the affected area with bright light (as per daylight) for a number of rounds equal to her cleric level.\nAt 10th level, a blossoming light can use atonement once per day as a spell-like ability, but only to offer redemption to others (as per the spell). Using the spell in this way does not require a focus or material component."
