    "text": "A raven master casts spells as do most rangers, but her spell list is somewhat expanded from the normal options most rangers can choose from, for her association with the bards and other talented performers among the Silver Ravens allows her to add a limited number of bard spells to her spell list. These spells function as divine spells, and are cast and prepared in the same manner as her other ranger spells.\nAt 6th level, the raven master selects one 1st-level bard spell of her choice and adds it to her spell list as a 1st-level ranger spell. At 9th level she does the same but for a 2nd-level bard spell. She adds a 3rd-level bard spell at 12th level, and adds a 4th-level bard spell at 15th level."
