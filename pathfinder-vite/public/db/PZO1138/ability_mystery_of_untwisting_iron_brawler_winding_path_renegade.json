    "text": "At 2nd level, metal weapons and armor in the winding path renegade\u0027s possession are treated as masterwork unless they have the broken condition. At 8th level, the winding path renegade gains a bonus equal to half her level on Craft checks involving metal, and she gains the benefits of the Master Craftsman and Craft Arms and Armor feats when crafting items made of metal. At 14th level, any weapon the winding path renegade wields is treated as adamantine."
