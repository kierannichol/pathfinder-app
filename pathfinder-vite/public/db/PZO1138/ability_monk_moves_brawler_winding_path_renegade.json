    "text": "At 4th level, a winding path renegade can use her martial flexibility ability to gain the benefits of certain monk abilities as well as combat feats. Each ability counts as one Combat feat for this purpose, and the winding path renegade is treated as a monk of a level equal to her brawler level for the purpose of determining the effects of these abilities. The winding path renegade gains access to these abilities at the levels listed on the Monk Moves table above. She does not gain a ki pool, and she can\u0027t use powers that require ki. The winding path renegade must be wearing light or no armor to benefit from this ability."
