    "text": "A dashing thief eventually becomes truly irresistible. At 15th level, when a dashing thief successfully dazes a creature using her dazing charm deed, she can instead charm the target for 1 day (as per charm monster). Only one creature can be charmed this way at a time; if the dashing thief charms another creature this way, the first charm effect immediately ends."
