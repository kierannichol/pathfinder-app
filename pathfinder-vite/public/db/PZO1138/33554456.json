    "text": "Among the varied items crafted by the earliest Storm Kindlers were these potent rods. Very few Storm Kindler\u0027s rods have been recovered, and today\u0027s Storm Kindlers suspect that many of these potent magical rods have been lost forever, for when they are wielded by those not of the Storm Kindler sect, they grow fragile. The current generation of Storm Kindlers have been unsuccessful in determining how their predecessors created these powerful minor artifacts, making the discovery of existing Storm Kindler\u0027s rods all the more important to the society.\nA Storm Kindler\u0027s rod acts as a +4 shocking burst spell storing club, but its spell storing capabilities can store only druid spells. While carried in one hand, the rod grants its wielder immunity to cold and electricity. The rod\u0027s other powers are as follows.",
