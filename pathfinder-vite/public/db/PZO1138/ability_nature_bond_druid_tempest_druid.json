    "text": "As a result of his beliefs, a tempest druid has little connection to the spirituality of animals or plants. He can\u0027t choose an animal companion, and must instead select a domain or subdomain from the following list when he gains the nature bond ability: Air, Aquatic, Cloud, Storm, Swamp, Weather, or Wind."
