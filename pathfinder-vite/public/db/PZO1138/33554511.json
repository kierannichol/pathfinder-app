    "text": "This +1 net is made from fine silvery cords rather than simple rope. The net prevents extradimensional travel, affecting any creature entangled by it as per dimensional anchor for as long as it remains entangled. Additionally, any invisibility effects targeting a creature entangled by the net are suppressed so long as it remains entangled. Devils take a â€“4 penalty on Strength checks and Escape Artist checks to free themselves from a devil catcher."
