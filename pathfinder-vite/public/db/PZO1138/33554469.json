    "text": "Originally invented by shamans of the Kellid tribes of the Realms of the Mammoth Lords, zoic fetishes have spread throughout the Inner Sea region and are much sought after in any area where dangerous animals dwell. Each zoic fetish looks different, but is essentially a small fetish made from bone, branches, grass, and twine crafted into one of several shapesâ€”a mammal, a bird, a reptile, an amphibian, or a fish.\nAs long as a creature carries a zoic fetish, it is somewhat protected against attacks from animals, gaining a +1 insight bonus to AC against all animals. In addition, possession of a zoic fetish grants a +4 insight bonus on wild empathy checks. Finally, once per day, the wielder can present a zoic fetish to an animal of the same classification as the fetish (amphibian, bird, fish, mammal, or reptile) to use dominate animal on that creature."
