    "text": "This 3-foot-long strip of extremely thin hide can be cut into different lengths. When moistened and applied across surfaces or between objects, it creates a bond requiring a DC 15 Strength check to pull apart. Once applied, an adhesive strip takes 1 minute to set. If applied to an item with the broken condition, it suppresses the effects of that broken condition for as long as the item remains repaired by the stripâ€”though the item does not regain hit points and is still broken. The uses for an adhesive strip are many; it can be used to bind prisoners, mend clothing, patch holes, and so on."
