    "text": "At 4th level, a stormwalker can wreathe his weapon in lightning. As a standard action, he can grant a single weapon he holds the shock special ability for 1 minute; while under this effect, the weapon counts as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A stormwalker can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Wisdom modifier. At 12th level, weapons affected by this ability gain the shocking burst special ability."
