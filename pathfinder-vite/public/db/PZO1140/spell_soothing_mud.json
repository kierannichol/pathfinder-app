    "text": "You create an area of healing mud. Water, earth, sand, and dust thicken into a wet mud. The mud functions as difficult terrain and does not sink if created in water unless weighed down by more than 100 pounds per caster level you have. Each round a creature begins its turn in or on the mud, the mud restores 1 hit point to it; this healing is unaffected by effects that increase a creature\u0027s healing. A creature that rests partially or completely submerged in this mud for 1 full minute is also healed of 1d4 points of ability damage to an ability score of its choice. A creature can be healed of ability damage this way only once per day."
