    "text": "At 3rd level, a summit sentinel must select mountains as her favored terrain, and she does not gain additional favored terrains at higher levels. Every 5 levels beyond 5th, the bonus from this favored terrain increases by 2.\nAt 8th level, a summit sentinel draws strength from the earth. When she and her target are both in contact with the ground or an earthen floor, the summit sentinel gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against the target. At 18th level, the bonus on attack and damage rolls increases to +2."
