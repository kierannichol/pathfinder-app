When rubbed on your skin, liniment relieves pain, allowing you to ignore the effects of 2 points of ability damage caused by a single disease you have. The benefits of the liniment last for 30 minutes, and it does not cure, prevent, or otherwise protect you from the effects of diseases. You cannot benefit from the effects of liniment more than once in a 24-hour period."
