    "text": "The end of this fishing lure is colored in bright greens and shaped like a comical goblin face. The lure\u0027s ridiculous coloration and unique shape attract all sorts of fish. Using this lure grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Profession (fisher) checks, as per a masterwork tool. Each time such a check is attempted, there is a 25% chance the lure is lost. You reduce the chance of losing the lure by 2% for every rank of Profession (fisher) you have."
