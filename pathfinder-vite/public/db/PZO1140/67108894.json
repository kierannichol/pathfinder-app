    "text": "These fine, supple slippers are made from giant cowslip petals. The wearer cannot be tracked or otherwise detected by scent. When standing with one foot in one terrain and the other in another terrain (such as at a cave mouth, a shore, or a forest\u0027s edge), a gathlain wearer can speak a command word to move to either the Material Plane or the First World, as per plane shift, twice per day."
