    "text": "Twice per day, when thrown into the air as a standard action, this palm-sized, tufted, purple seed drifts at a rate of 60 feet per round toward a spot clearly visualized by the thrower. It can be grabbed out of the air with a successful combat maneuver check against a CMD of 20, which ends its flight. The seed flies for up to 12 miles (taking 2 hours) before it settles to the ground. A gathlain thrower can choose to speak a message of up to 25 words when throwing the seed; in this case, the seed repeats the message in the thrower\u0027s voice when its flight ends.\nIf the thrower speaks a command word as part of the action to throw it, the herald seed flies back to where it was last thrown, even if the thrower can\u0027t visualize the location."
