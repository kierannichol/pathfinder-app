    "text": "At 20th level, a dune rider can use the desert\u0027s heat to finish off his foes. As a standard action, he can make a single attack at his full base attack bonus while in warm desert, hills, or mountains, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude save or suffer the additional effect. The DC of this save is 20 + the dune rider\u0027s Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds, it can\u0027t be targeted by this ability again for 24 hours."
