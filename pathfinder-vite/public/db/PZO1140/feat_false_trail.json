    "text": "You create a false trail to throw off pursuers, enabling you to increase your lead on those following you or make them lose your trail entirely.",

      "Benefit": "You can create a false trail in the wilderness via a combination of misleading footprints, discarded items, torn scraps of clothing, and other signs. When you create a false trail, you determine the direction it leads. A creature tracking you must succeed at a Perception or Survival check (DC \u003d 10 + half your character level + your Wisdom modifier) to determine the trail is fake when first encountering it. On a success, the creature can continue to track you as normal. The effect of a failure to identify the trail as false depends on the time and effort spent making it."
