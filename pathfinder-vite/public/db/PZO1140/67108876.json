    "text": "This alchemical fertilizer boosts the growth of plants. As a standard action, a plant creature can absorb the fertilizer by rubbing it on its body in order to gain 1 temporary hit point per Hit Die; these temporary hit points last for 1 hour. A plant creature can only benefit from 1 dose of fortifying fertilizer every 24 hours. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
