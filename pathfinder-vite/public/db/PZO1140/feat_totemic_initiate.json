For the purpose of determining that rage power\u0027s effects, your barbarian level is equal to your base attack bonus. You do not gain any other benefits or penalties of rage. You can gain these benefits for a number of rounds per day equal to your base attack bonus plus your Constitution modifier; these rounds do not need to be consecutive."
