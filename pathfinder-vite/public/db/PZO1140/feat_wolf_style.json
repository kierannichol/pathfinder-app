      "Benefit": "While using this style, whenever you deal at least 10 points of damage to a foe with an attack of opportunity, that foe\u0027s base speed decreases by 5 feet until the end of its next turn. For every 10 points of damage your attack deals beyond 10, the foe\u0027s base speed decreases by an additional 5 feet. If the penalty meets or exceeds the total base speed of the foe, you can attempt to trip the foe as a free action after the attack of opportunity is resolved."
