      "Benefit": "As a move action while climbing, you can cling to your climbing surface with your legs by succeeding at a Climb check with the same DC as that of climbing the surface as a move action. If successful, you can make attacks with a two-handed ranged weapon and reload ranged weapons until you resume climbing. The GM can rule that this feat doesn\u0027t work on certain climbing surfaces."
