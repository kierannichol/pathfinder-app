    "text": "A greensurge bomb is a small, magically and alchemically treated plant bulb with a root growth that forms a handle. The bomb can be thrown like a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. When the bomb strikes the ground, it bursts open, scattering weeds in a 10-foot radius. At the beginning of the thrower\u0027s next turn, the weeds rapidly grow into thick undergrowth, creating an area of difficult terrain. The weeds flourish regardless of the surrounding natural terrain (even in urban settings or on hard rock floors) but don\u0027t grow on damaging surfaces, such as pools of lava or acid. The new vegetation lasts for 5 minutes before it turns brown and crumbles to dust."
