    "text": "This chest can contain up to 4 cubic feet of goods, and it has a lining of insulating material between two sheets of wood. As long as the chest is partially filled with a cold substance— such as cold water or ice—items stored within decompose at half their regular rate. Ice melts on a consistent basis (typically four to six times in a 24-hour period) and must be regularly replenished to maintain the effectiveness of this chest."
