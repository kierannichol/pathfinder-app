    "text": "At 3rd level, a brutish swamper resists any attempts to change her attitude or compel her to action. Diplomacy and Intimidate checks against her take a â€“2 penalty, and no result can shift her attitude more than one step in a 24-hour period. These penalties increase by 2 for every 3 levels the brutish swamper has beyond 3rd."
