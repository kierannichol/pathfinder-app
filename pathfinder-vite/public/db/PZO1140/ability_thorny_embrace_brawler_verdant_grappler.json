    "text": "At 5th level, when a verdant grappler uses green grasp to tie up a creature, she can have the roots and vines grow vicious thorns that automatically damage the tied-up creature each round at the start of the verdant grappler\u0027s turn. The thorns deal damage equal to the base unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower than the verdant grappler."
