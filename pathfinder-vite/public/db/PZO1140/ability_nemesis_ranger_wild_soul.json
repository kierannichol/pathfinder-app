    "text": "A wild soul gains a +2 bonus on Intimidate, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Survival checks against creatures that wield advanced technology, alchemical weapons (including an alchemist\u0027s bombs), or firearms and against those that cast arcane spells (this does not apply to creatures that use spell-like abilities). Likewise, he gains a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against such opponents. The wild soul can attempt Craft (alchemy), Knowledge (arcana), and Spellcraft checks untrained when attempting to identify enemy magic or advanced technology.\nAt 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level)."
