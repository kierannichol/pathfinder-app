      "Effect": "The primary caster must prepare for this ritual by walking a path along the outer edge of the desired area--an act that likely takes longer than the ritual casting time. As the primary caster walks this path, she must periodically mark the area with tiny runes. Once the primary caster returns to her starting point, and assuming the area she outlined is less than 2 square miles per character level she has, the actual casting of the ritual can begin. At this point, all casters cross the threshold to enter the region and then begin following a series of erratic paths, each using the material component divining runes as they wander aimlessly. Completing this ritual creates a powerful obfuscating effect, affecting creatures entering the area surrounded by the primary caster\u0027s initial walk."
