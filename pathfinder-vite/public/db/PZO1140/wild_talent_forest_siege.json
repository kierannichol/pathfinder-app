    "text": "You can transform available plant life into a besieging army. This functions as greater siege of trees, except you need to concentrate or the effect ends, and you can change targets as a free action. If you accept 1 point of burn, you can prolong the effect without the need for concentration until the next time you recover burn, but you do need to spend a standard action to change targets."
