If you have 10 or more ranks in Perception, this bonus increases to +4 (or +8 when determining whether you can act during a surprise round). This bonus does not stack with that granted by the Alertness feat, though Wilding Senses counts as the Alertness feat for the purpose of fulfilling feat prerequisites and prestige class requirements."
