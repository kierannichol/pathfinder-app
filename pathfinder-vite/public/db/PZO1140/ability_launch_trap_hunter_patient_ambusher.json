    "text": "At 10th level, a patient ambusher can affix a magical ranger trap to an arrow, a crossbow bolt, or a thrown weapon, allowing her to set the trap remotely or use it as a direct attack. Attaching the trap to the projectile is part of the full-round action to create a new trap. The trapped projectile is fired or thrown in the normal manner. If fired at a square, the trap is treated as if the hunter had set the trap in that square, except the DC is 5 lower than normal. If the trap is fired at a creature, the target takes damage from the ranged weapon and is treated as if it had triggered the trap (attempting a saving throw, if any). The attack has a maximum range of 60 feet, and penalties from range increments apply on the attack roll. The duration of the trap starts when it is created, not when it is triggered."
