The DC increase and the bonus on Perception checks increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum increase of 8 and a maximum bonus of +6 at 18th level).\nThis replaces trap sense.\nRogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement the desert raider archetype: fast stealth, getaway artist, ledge walker, rogue crawl, stand up, surprise attack."
