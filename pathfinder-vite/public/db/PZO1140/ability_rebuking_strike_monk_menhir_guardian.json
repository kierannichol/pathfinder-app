    "text": "At 1st level, a menhir guardian can channel his ki into a devastating strike that repels his enemies. A menhir guardian must declare that he is using rebuking strike before making a natural attack with his claws. On a hit, a foe damaged by the menhir guardian\u0027s claws must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC \u003d 10 + half the menhir guardian\u0027s level + his Wisdom modifier) or be pushed back 5 feet directly away from the menhir guardian, plus an additional 5 feet for every 4 levels the menhir guardian has beyond 1st. If this movement would be blocked by a solid object, the target of rebuking strike takes 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet moved and falls prone at the end of the movement.\nAt 5th level, a creature that fails its save against a menhir guardian\u0027s rebuking strike also has its speed reduced by half for a number of rounds equal to the menhir guardian\u0027s level.\nAt 15th level, a creature that fails its save is also affected by aversion, making it avoid the menhir guardian\u0027s current location for 1 round per level the menhir guardian has.\nThe menhir guardian can attempt a rebuking strike a number of times per day equal to his monk level but only once per round."
