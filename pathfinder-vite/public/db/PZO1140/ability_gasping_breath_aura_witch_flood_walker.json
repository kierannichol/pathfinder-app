    "text": "A creature attempting to hold its breath within 30 feet of a flood walker is treated as having taken a standard or full-round action when determining how long it can hold its breath, regardless of the number and type of actions it takes in a round. At 5th level, increase the DC of Swim checks attempted within 30 feet of the flood walker by 5, and creatures actively engaged in combat or a similarly strenuous activity use air twice as quickly within the aura. The flood walker can exempt creatures within this aura from these increased penalties."
