    "text": "At 3rd level as a standard action, a chameleon adept can cause her companion to assume a humanoid form of the same race as herself. This functions as alter self, except it is used on an adjacent animal companion to have it assume a humanoid form. The companion always assumes the same form, selected when the hunter reaches 3rd level. The hunter can change this form when she gains a new level, but the companion loses the old form and can\u0027t resume it unless the chameleon adept chooses that form when she reaches a new level. The companion is no more intelligent or less savage than normal; the hunter still needs to control it as normal, and it still can\u0027t activate magic items or wield manufactured weapons. The hunter can use this ability for 10 minutes per day per hunter level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 10-minute increments."
