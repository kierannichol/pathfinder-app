    "text": "These tattered and ragged garments extend the duration of a shifter\u0027s bestial transformations, allowing her to shift into her aspects\u0027 minor forms for 5 additional minutes per day. Each set of bestial rags is also tied to a specific aspect, typically being made of the hide of that creature and embossed with crude pictograms of it, allowing a shifter to assume that aspect\u0027s minor and major form, as appropriate for her level. If the shifter already has the ability to shift into that form, that aspect\u0027s major form functions as if she were 2 levels higher."
