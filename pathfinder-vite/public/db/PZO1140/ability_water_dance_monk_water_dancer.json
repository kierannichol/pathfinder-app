    "text": "At 4th level, a water dancer can move across any liquid surface as though it were solid ground up to a maximum distance of 20 feet before falling through the liquid\u0027s surface as normal. This distance increases by 10 feet at 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter, to a maximum of 90 feet at 18th level. Additionally, at 10th level the water dancer can even move vertically up water surfaces (such as a flowing waterfall) as though under the effects of spider climb. If he runs out of movement before reaching a solid surface when climbing a vertical water source, he immediately falls."
