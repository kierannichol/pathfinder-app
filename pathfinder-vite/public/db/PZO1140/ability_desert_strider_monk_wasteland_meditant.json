    "text": "At 4th level, a wasteland meditant ignores movement penalties for difficult terrain when in desert terrain. Additionally, he kicks up dust around his body whenever he performs a double move action in desert terrain. This dust grants the wasteland meditant concealment. The miss chance granted by this concealment starts at 10% at 4th level and increases by 10% at 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter, to a maximum of 80% at 18th level. This concealment lasts until the start of the meditant\u0027s next turn and stacks with any concealment provided by movement, such as from the Wind Stance feat."
