    "text": "Pack hunter barbarians team up to hunt dangerous prey to feed, to protect their camps, and as a rite of passage. Often, a tribe of pack hunters looks to a specific species of animal (such as wolves) who themselves hunt in packs, and view these animals as sacred manifestations of their people\u0027s traditions and values."
