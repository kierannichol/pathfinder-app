    "text": "This ability has been added based on this FAQ entry.At 6th level, a shifter gains the ability to make several ferocious attacks with the same natural weapon. Instead of attacking with all her natural weapons, the shifter can choose a single natural weapon and make a full attack with that natural weapon, gaining a second iterative attack at a –5 as if it was a manufactured weapon. When she does so, all her other natural attacks count as secondary attacks and don\u0027t benefit from shifter\u0027s claws.At 11th level, she gains a third iterative attack at a –10 and at 16th level, she gains a fourth iterative attack at –15."
