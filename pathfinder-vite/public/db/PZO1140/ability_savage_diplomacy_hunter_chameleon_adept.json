    "text": "At 2nd level, while in humanoid form, a chameleon adept\u0027s animal companion grants its master a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks. Savage diplomacy functions only as long as the creature being influenced can see both the companion and the master. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of +6 at 17th level."
