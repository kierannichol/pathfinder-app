    "text": "At 1st level, a river rat gains a bonus equal to half her rogue level on Swim checks (minimum +1).\nA river rat ignores difficult terrain caused by light undergrowth and shallow bogs, and it costs her only 2 squares of movement to enter a square of deep bog or heavy undergrowth, rather than 4 squares of movement.\nShe takes no penalty on Acrobatics or Stealth checks for being in bogs and undergrowth. All of these abilities apply only when she is wearing light or no armor and carrying no more than a light load."
