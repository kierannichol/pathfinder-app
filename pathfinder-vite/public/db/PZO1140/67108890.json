    "text": "This sheath is designed to be strapped around your forearm, but it is too bulky to be hidden under a long sleeve. It can hold one forearm-length item, such as a dagger, dart, potion, scroll containing a single spell, or wand. As a swift action, you can bend your wrist to cause the sheathed item to drop into your hand (provoking attacks of opportunity as normal for retrieving an item). Placing an item in the sheath is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. You can wear only one wrist sheath per arm that you have."
