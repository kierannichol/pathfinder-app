    "text": "A water dancer gains the elemental focus ability of the kineticist class, but must choose water as his element. He gains the basic hydrokinesis wild talent as normal, and gains the kinetic blast feature of the kineticist class for the water element, using his monk level as his effective kineticist level. He can\u0027t use his kinetic blast when armored or encumbered."
