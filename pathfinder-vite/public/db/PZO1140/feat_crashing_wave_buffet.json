      "Benefit": "When dragging or repositioning an opponent, you use your full body to knock your opponent around like a constant wave. At the end of the drag or reposition maneuver, your opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC \u003d 10 + half your character level + your Wisdom modifier + 2 for every 5 feet you drag or reposition your opponent). On a failed save, your opponent becomes disorientated from the movement and takes a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, and Dexterity-based skill checks until the end of its next turn."
