    "text": "At 4th level, the magus learns to use his arcane pool to recall spells he has already cast. With a swift action he can recall any single magus spell that he has already prepared and cast that day by expending a number of points from his arcane pool equal to the spell\u0027s level (minimum 1). The spell is prepared again, just as if it had not been cast."
