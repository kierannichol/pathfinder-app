    "text": "At 18th level, a summoner can divert more of his eidolon\u0027s evolutions to himself. This ability functions as the aspect ability, but the maximum number of evolution points the summoner can divert increases to 6. In addition, the eidolon loses 1 point from its evolution pool for every 2 points (or fraction thereof ) diverted to the summoner instead of losing 1 point from the evolution pool for each point diverted."
