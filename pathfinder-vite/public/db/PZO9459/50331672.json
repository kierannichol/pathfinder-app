The target must be within one size category of the wielder. The wielder can appear as that humanoid for up to 7 minutes and can dismiss the effect as a free action. Anyone interacting with the wielder of a doppelganger\u0027s sword who is familiar with the impersonated humanoid can attempt a DC 14 Will saving throw to disbelieve the illusion."
