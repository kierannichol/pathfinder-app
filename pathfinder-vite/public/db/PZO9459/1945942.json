    "text": "This spell functions as black tentacles, except the tentacles blindly grasp at the targets\u0027 eyes and ears, and tug at their hair, clothes, and equipment. Instead of grapple attempts, the tentacles attempt dirty trick combat maneuver checks (CMB \u003d your caster level + 4 [the tentacles\u0027 Strength bonus] + 1 [the tentacles\u0027 size bonus]). Roll on the following table to determine the effect of a successful dirty trick combat maneuver check."
