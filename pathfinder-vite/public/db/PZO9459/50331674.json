    "text": "This dark-gray tunic allows a character to make a single jump of up to 40 feet per day, or four jumps of 10 feet each per day. All jumps must begin and end in an area that has at least some dim light. If the wearer has at least 4 levels in the shadowdancer prestige class, the tunic instead adds 40 feet to the total number of feet he can shadow jump in 1 day."
