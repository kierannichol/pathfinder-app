    "text": "This smooth lodestone is gray and streaked with veins of glossy obsidian. As a ranged touch attack, the bearer can throw it at an opponent within 30 feet. If it strikes a target in metal armor, the burdenstone attaches itself to the target for 2d6 rounds.\nAn attached burdenstone increases the target\u0027s load by one step. If a target\u0027s load is already heavy, the target is knocked prone, its movement is reduced to 10 feet, and it cannot run. An attached burdenstone also prevents the target from flying. A target may not be affected by more than one burdenstone at a time.\nA successful DC 20 Strength check made as a full-round action can remove the stone from a target before the duration elapses. Once a burdenstone has been removed or the duration expires, it becomes an ordinary magnetic stone."
