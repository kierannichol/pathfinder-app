    "text": "Appearing as a heavy, elaborate neckpiece while worn, a burglar\u0027s torc can be removed and disassembled into its component parts in 4 minutes (or in 1 minute if the user is trained in the Disable Device skill). When dismantled, a burglar\u0027s torc contains parts that function as a set of mithral masterwork thieves\u0027 tools, 10 feet of silk rope, and a mithral grappling hook. Reassembling the torc takes 8 minutes (or 4 minutes if the user is trained in the Disable Device skill). An observer must succeed at a DC 30 Perception check to recognize an assembled burglar\u0027s torc for what it is; if the observer handles the torc, the DC for this check decreases to 15."
