      "Effect": "The witch can steal the voice of one creature within 30 feet, causing it to lose, for a number of rounds equal to the witch\u0027s Intelligence bonus, all abilities that rely on speech, including talking, casting spells with verbal components, and using auditory bardic performances. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. If this hex is used upon a willing target, the duration lasts for a number of hours equal to the witch\u0027s Intelligence bonus. Additionally, the witch can change her voice to match that of any creature whose voice she has stolen with this hex, as per vocal alteration."
