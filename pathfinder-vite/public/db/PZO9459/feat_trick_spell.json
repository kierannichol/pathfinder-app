If the target fails its Will save against a trick spell, in addition to the spell\u0027s normal effects, the target also clumsily hinders itself. Immediately attempt a special combat maneuver check (1d20 + your caster level + your Charisma bonus) to perform a dirty trick combat maneuver against the target. Any feats you have that apply to dirty trick maneuvers (such as Greater Dirty Trick) also apply to this check."
