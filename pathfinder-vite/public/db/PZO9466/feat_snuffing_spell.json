      "Benefit": "You can modify a spell to extinguish magical and non-magical light sources that the target has. The first time a creature takes damage from or fails a saving throw against a snuffing spell, any non-magical light sources it has are immediately extinguished and you can attempt to dispel any active spells with the light descriptor that are affecting the target as if you had also cast the targeted version of dispel magic. Spells that do not target creatures can\u0027t be snuffing spells."
