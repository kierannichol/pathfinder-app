    "text": "You infuse a target\u0027s shadow with energies from the Shadow Plane, shaping the shadow into one that appears to belong to a different creature, and tricking the target into believing it actually is that creature. When you cast this spell, choose one Huge or smaller creature of the animal type or one Medium or Small creature of the humanoid type. If the chosen creature is ill suited to the target\u0027s current environment, such as an aquatic creature not in water, the subject gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws against baleful shadow transmutation. If the subject fails its Will save, it believes that it is the chosen creature, causing it to lose its extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities, lose its ability to cast spells (if it had the ability), and gain the alignment, special abilities, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of its new form in place of its own. It retains any class features (other than spellcasting) that aren\u0027t extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities."
