      "Benefit": "While you are using Blinded Blade Style and you are blinded or unable to see, your ability to pinpoint creatures\u0027 locations using Blinded Competence improves to function like blindsight rather than blindsense, and the range increases to 30 feet. In addition, you add half your character level to the DCs of Bluff checks to feint you in combat."
