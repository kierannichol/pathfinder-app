    "text": "Phantoms have two slam natural weapon attacks. Those attacks’ damage is based on the size of the phantom and is sometimes modified by the abilities Table 1–12: Small or Large Phantom Slam Damage Damage Damage Level (Small Phantom) (Large Phantom) 1st–4th 1d4 1d8 5th–8th 1d6 2d6 9th–12th 1d8 2d8 13th–16th 1d10 3d6 17th–20th 2d6 3d8 of the phantom’s emotional focus. Table 1–11 gives the damage by spiritualist level of the slam attacks made by a Medium phantom. See Table 1–12 for the damage of such attacks for Small and Large phantoms. Often, an individual phantom manifests in a form that makes it appear as if it had weapons or other natural attacks. Regardless of their apparent forms, the phantom’s attacks still deal the slam attack damage listed on Table 1–11 or Table 1–12."
