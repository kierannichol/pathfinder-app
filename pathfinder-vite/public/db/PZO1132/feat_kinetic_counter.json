      "Benefit": "You can ready an action to use your blast to counter an opponent\u0027s elemental abilities. If you ready a fire simple blast, you can counter any spell or activated extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability that has the water or ice descriptor, and if you ready a cold or water simple blast, you can counter any spell or activated extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability that has the fire descriptor. In order to successfully counter the effect, you must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to either 11 + the opponent\u0027s caster level (for spells and spell-like abilities) or 11 + the opponent\u0027s Hit Dice (for extraordinary and supernatural abilities). Against spells and spell-like abilities, treat a success as if you had counterspelled the effect using dispel magic. Against activated supernatural and extraordinary abilities, a successful kinetic counter negates the ability\u0027s effect entirely while still expending the ability. For example, if a pyrokineticist succeeds at her caster level check against a white dragon\u0027s breath weapon, she negates the breath weapon\u0027s effect in the entire area, and the dragon must wait 1d4 rounds to use its breath weapon again."
