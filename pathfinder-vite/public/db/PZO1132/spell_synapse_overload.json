    "text": "You cause the target\u0027s mind to unleash a vast overflowing torrent of information throughout the target\u0027s body, causing the target\u0027s synapses to violently trigger. The target takes 1d6 points of electrical damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and is staggered for 1 minute. A successful Fortitude saving throw doesn\u0027t reduce the damage, but it negates the staggered effect."
