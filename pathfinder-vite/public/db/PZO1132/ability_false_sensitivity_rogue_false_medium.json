    "text": "At 2nd level, a charlatan can convincingly fake the ability to use occult skill unlocks such as automatic writing and dowsing. An untrained onlooker can\u0027t tell the difference between the false medium\u0027s scams and a true use of occult skill unlocks.\nAn onlooker capable of using the particular occult skill unlock that the false medium is faking can attempt the appropriate skill check for that unlock, opposed by the false medium\u0027s Bluff check, to detect the fraud.\nIn any case, any results of the false medium\u0027s charades are fabricated (for instance, the false medium might ask leading questions to elicit false memories while pretending to use hypnotism)."
