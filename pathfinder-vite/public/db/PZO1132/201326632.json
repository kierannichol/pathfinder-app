    "text": "The large sapphire that adorns this platinum ring darkens in hue as its wearer depletes her psychic spellcasting potential. The gem turns black when the wearer\u0027s daily spells are exhausted or if the wearer has no ability to cast psychic spells. A ring of psychic mastery grants the caster 1 additional psychic spell per day for each spell level from 1st to 4th that she is capable of casting."
