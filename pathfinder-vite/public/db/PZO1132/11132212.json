    "text": "These layered lambskin gloves are specially designed and psychically attuned to increase the tactile sensitivity of the wearer\u0027s hands. To provide any benefit, the gloves must be worn for 8 uninterrupted hours. All Dexterity skill checks requiring the use of the hands take a â€“2 penalty as long as the gloves remain on. After this 8-hour period, the user can remove the gloves to gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks for the psychometry occult skill unlock. This benefit fades after 1 hour."
