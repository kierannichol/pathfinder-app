    "text": "When casting a divination spell, the psychic sees a glimmer of her future. By spending 1 point from her phrenic pool as she casts a divination spell, she gains a +2 insight bonus to AC for a number of rounds equal to the linked spellâ€™s level. She can instead spend 2 points to increase the bonus to +4. This amplification can be linked only to divination spells."
