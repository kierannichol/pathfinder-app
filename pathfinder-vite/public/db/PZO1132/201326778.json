    "text": "You create an immersive mindscape (see page 235) that the minds of both you and another creature enter together. You choose whether the mindscape is overt or veiled, and whether it\u0027s harmless or harmful. You can choose any shape and size trait, as well as any gravity trait (though you can\u0027t make it so the gravity is so strong it harms creatures within). The mindscape has normal time, no alignment traits, and normal magic."
