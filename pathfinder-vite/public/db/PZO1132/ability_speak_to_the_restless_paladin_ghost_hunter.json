    "text": "At 9th level, a ghost hunter can commune with the spirits of the restless dead once per day. By holding a seance for 10 minutes, she can ask questions of a destroyed undead or a neutralized or destroyed haunt. To use this ability on a corporeal undead, the ghost hunter must have the creature\u0027s head in her possession. For a haunt or incorporeal undead, this seance must be held in the haunt\u0027s location or where the incorporeal undead was destroyed. Treat this ability as speak with haunt or as speak with dead (but affecting only undead rather than only corpses), using the ghost hunter\u0027s class level as the caster level."
