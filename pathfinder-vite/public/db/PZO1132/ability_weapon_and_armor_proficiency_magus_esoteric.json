This alters the magus\u0027s weapon and armor proficiency.\nDiminished Spellcasting: An esoteric has one fewer spell slot of each level than a regular magus. If this reduces his number of spell slots of a particular level to zero, he can cast spells of that level only if his Intelligence allows bonus spells of that level."
