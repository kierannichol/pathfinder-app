    "text": "You build upon your targets\u0027 innate prejudice, stoking it from a simmer to the full flame of hatred. Choose a creature type (if you choose humanoid or outsider, you must also choose a subtype). Targets who hold no ill will toward and have a completely positive opinion of the chosen creatures automatically succeed at their saving throws, while targets with a particular hatred toward the chosen creature (such as the dwarf\u0027s hatred racial ability) take a â€“4 penalty on their saving throws. Targets that fail their saving throws become hostile toward all creatures of the chosen type and never treat them as allies for the spell\u0027s duration. Affected creatures take everything creatures of the chosen type do in the worst possible light."
