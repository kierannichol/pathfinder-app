    "text": "An overflowing rod amplifies and focuses the side effects of a kineticist\u0027s burn. While holding the rod, the kineticist counts as 3 levels higher for the purpose of determining the effects of her elemental overflow ability. If used by a character without elemental overflow, the rod grants its wielder the benefit of elemental overflow as a 3rd-level kineticist (which is generally helpful only to low-level kineticists or kineticists with archetypes that replace elemental overflow with another class feature)."
