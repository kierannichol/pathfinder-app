    "text": "Although it appears to be a simple horseshoe, a lucky horseshoe focuses and channels the mystical energies of good fortune. As long as a lucky horseshoe\u0027s owner carries it on her person, she gains a +1 luck bonus on saving throws. Once per day, she can invoke the lucky horseshoe\u0027s power to gain a +4 luck bonus on a single saving throw. She must declare that she is using this ability before the roll is made."
