    "text": "This simple chalkboard consists of a book-sized wooden frame surrounding a thin, rectangular slice of flat black slate. Though mediums typically use mundane slates to demonstrate automatic writing, this magical version can obtain answers to specific questions regarding a dead creature if the user has access to at least a fragment of bone from the deceased\u0027s body. Once the user places a bone fragment upon the slate, that fragment animates and begins scribbling answers to the following four questions on the slate\u0027s surface."
