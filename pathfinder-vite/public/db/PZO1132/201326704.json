    "text": "This poorly formed wax figure resembles an unfinished sculpt of a humanoid. It can be bound to a living humanoid in a similar way to a ganji doll, but must be sculpted into the shape of that humanoid and have a piece of that creature\u0027s hair, teeth, blood, bone, or flesh pressed into the wax. Those familiar with the target notice the waxen image\u0027s resemblance to the target with a DC 15 Perception check.\nA waxen image can be blinded, damaged, or targeted with a touch spell in the same way as a ganji doll, except that the bound creature is unaffected if it\u0027s farther than 100 feet from the waxen image. A waxen image can be used only once, and melts as soon as it\u0027s used."
