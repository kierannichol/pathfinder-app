    "text": "While a block of this sweet-scented incense burns, creatures inhaling its fumes become unusually receptive to thought. In still air, the incense\u0027s smoke permeates a 40-foot-by-40- foot area to a height of 20 feet. Creatures within that area can communicate telepathically with other creatures in the area. Creatures communicating in this fashion don\u0027t need to share a language, but must have an Intelligence of 3 or higher. The openness of mind engendered by the incense also provides a +5 insight bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks against creatures in the area, and imposes a –5 penalty on Bluff and Intimidate checks against such creatures and a –2 penalty on saving throws against mind-affecting effects.\nModerate wind halves the area of the smoke. Strong wind disperses the incense, rendering it ineffective as long as the wind continues. A single block of incense of open thoughts burns for 1 hour. It can be extinguished and relit, but each use consumes at least 10 minutes of its remaining duration."
