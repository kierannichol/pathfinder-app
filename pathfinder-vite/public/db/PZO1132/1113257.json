    "text": "These small clay vessels are fired in shapes representing various small animalsâ€”fish, lizards, mice, and sparrows are the most common. If a pot\u0027s user places a living animal matching the pot\u0027s form within, the user can communicate with the animal through whispers, as speak with animals. This ability functions three times per day."
