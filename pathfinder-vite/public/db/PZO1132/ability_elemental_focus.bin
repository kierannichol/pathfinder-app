kineticistability¢Å
ÂAt 1st level, a kineticist chooses one primary element on which to focus. This element determines how she accesses the raw power of the Ethereal Plane, and grants her access to specific wild talents (see below) and additional class skills. She gains her selected elementâ€™s basic utility wild talent (basic telekinesis, basic aerokinesis, etc.) as a bonus wild talent.
