    "text": "The number noted here is the increase to the phantom’s natural armor bonus when it manifests as an ectoplasmic creature, and its deflection bonus when it manifests as an incorporeal creature. An ectoplasmic or incorporeal manifested phantom can’t wear armor[2] of any kind, as the armor interferes with the spiritualist’s connection with the phantom; a phantom may seem to be wearing armor, but this appearance is just an illusory part of its appearance."
