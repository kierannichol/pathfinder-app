    "text": "A flying skiff is a long, flat-bottomed vehicle akin to a naval ship, and is covered in metallic veins. Without a psychic pilot, a flying skiff acts in all regards as a keelboat (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 184). A single Large directfire siege engine can be mounted on the front of a flying skiff.\nA control helmet that fits a Small, Medium, or Large creature is linked by long, curling cables to the metal veins of the skiff. Whenever a psychic creature (one with levels in an occult class, the Psychic Sensitivity feat, or the ability to use psychic spelllike abilities) wears the control helmet, the flying skiff gains the following abilities."
