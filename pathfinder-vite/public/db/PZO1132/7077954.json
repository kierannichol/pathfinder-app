    "text": "Fashioned of durable canvas and leather straps, this instrument of restraint prevents its wearer from using his arms entirely. Properly binding a creature in a straitjacket requires 1 minute, and the creature must be willing or helpless. This time can be reduced to 5 rounds, but doing so lowers the DC to escape the restraints by 5. A creature wearing a straitjacket gains the grappled condition, except it is able to move. Escaping from the straitjacket requires a successful DC 28 Escape Artist check (DC 30 for a masterwork straitjacket.)"
