    "text": "At 3rd level, an escapologist can attempt an Escape Artist check as a full-round action to remove a mind-affecting effect currently affecting her.\nThe DC of this check is equal to the effect\u0027s original save DC + 20. She cannot remove effects that do not allow a saving throw. She can attempt to escape even if paralyzed or restrained, as long as she can take purely mental actions. She can attempt this check against a particular effect once per round if the effect is measured in rounds, once per minute if the effect is measured in minutes, once per 10 minutes if the effect is measured in 10-minute intervals, and so on."
