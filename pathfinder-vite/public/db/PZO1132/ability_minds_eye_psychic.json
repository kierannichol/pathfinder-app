    "text": "Some psychics train their visual and psychic senses, binding them together into a unified focus to better guide their ranged spells and place them with uncanny precision. While casting a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, the psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool and gain a +4 insight bonus on the attack roll. The psychic can spend 1 additional point to ignore penalties from cover (but not total cover)."
