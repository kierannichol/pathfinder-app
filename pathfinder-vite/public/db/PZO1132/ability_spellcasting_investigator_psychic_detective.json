    "text": "A psychic detective casts psychic spells drawn from the psychic class spell list and augmented by a select set of additional spells (see Psychic Detective Spells). Only spells from the psychic class spell list of 6th level or lower and psychic detective spells are considered to be part of the psychic detective\u0027s spell list. If a spell appears on both the psychic detective and psychic class spell lists, the psychic detective uses the spell level from the psychic detective spell list. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a psychic detective must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell\u0027s level. The saving throw DC against a psychic detective\u0027s spell is 10 + the spell\u0027s level + the psychic detective\u0027s Intelligence modifier.\nLike other spellcasters, a psychic detective can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. She knows the same number of spells and receives the same number of spells slots per day as a bard of her investigator level, and knows and uses 0-level knacks as a bard uses cantrips. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score.\nAt 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a psychic detective can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows, using the same rules as a bard.\nIn effect, the psychic detective loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell\u0027s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the psychic detective can cast.\nA psychic detective need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any psychic detective spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell\u0027s level.\nPsychic Detective Spells: A psychic detective has the following spells on her spell list, in addition to psychic spells of 6th level or lower.\n1st--Detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, find traps. 3rd--Calm spirit*, daylight. 4th--Modify memory. 6th--Banishment, moment of prescience, scrying (greater)."
