    "text": "Slightly smaller and shorter than vril staves (see page 255), hollow rods are hollow silver tubes covered in intricate glyphs and small, flute-like keys. Three times per day, a kineticist can utilize the hollow rod in conjunction with a blast wild talent or the kinetic healer wild talent to augment that talent\u0027s destructive or healing capabilities, treating the wild talent as maximized. A hollow rod can\u0027t be used on a wild talent affected by metakinesis."
