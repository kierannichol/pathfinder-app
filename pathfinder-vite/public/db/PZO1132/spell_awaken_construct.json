    "text": "You amplify the animating force of a construct to more closely resemble a true soul, granting the construct humanlike sentience. To do so, you must succeed at a Spellcraft check (DC \u003d 15 + the construct\u0027s current Hit Dice). If the construct\u0027s master (if any) is present, this is an opposed Spellcraft check. You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken--it is a free-willed creature. Golems previously under another creature\u0027s control, either as shield guardians or a golem crafter\u0027s creations, break all connections with that creature."
