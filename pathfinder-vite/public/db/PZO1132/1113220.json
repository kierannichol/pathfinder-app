    "text": "This spell taps into the target\u0027s mind so you get an impression of the actions it will take. You gain a +2 insight bonus to AC against the target\u0027s attacks. If the target fails its Will save, you also see how the target will react to your attacks, and the bonus applies on your attack rolls and damage rolls against the target. These bonuses apply only while the target is within range of the spell, though if it goes out of range, the bonuses return once it\u0027s back in range. Whenever the target misses you with an attack, the spell\u0027s bonuses increase by 1 until the spell ends (to a maximum of +5)."
