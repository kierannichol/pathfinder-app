    "text": "This cold-iron-lined wooden cabinet is the size of a large upright chest, with just enough room inside for a Mediumsized creature to sit comfortably on a small wooden seat. The cabinet is constructed of alternating layers of cold iron sheets and slats of cypress wood insulated with sheep\u0027s wool, and is specially crafted to attract and focus atmospheric energy to recharge the internal reservoirs of characters capable of casting psychic magic.\nActivating an orgone accumulator requires spending hours inside it while meditating. The creature must remain conscious, taking no actions other than meditating. A creature inside the box that remains in this state automatically gains a +2 bonus on saving throws to recover from curses, diseases, and poisons. An orgone accumulator can also be used in conjunction with the faith healing occult skill unlock. If the subject of the faith healing is within the orgone accumulator, the creature attempting the Heal check for faith healing gains a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.\nIn addition, a creature can concentrate while within the box to gain the benefits of restorative spells. Each of these spells lists a number of hours a user must remain meditating inside the box. At the end of that time, the user must attempt a Wisdom check with the listed DC to gain the benefits of the spell. A creature with the Psychic Sensitivity feat or levels in an occult class gains a +2 bonus on this Wisdom check."
