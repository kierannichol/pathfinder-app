    "text": "A ventriloquist\u0027s dummy is made of finely sculpted and painted wood, shaped and dressed like a typical humanoid, and sized at roughly 2 feet. An insert in the back of the dummy allows a Small or Medium creature to manipulate it with one arm. When used as part of a routine, a ventriloquist\u0027s dummy adds a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform (comedy) checks."
