    "text": "At 7th level, a butterfly blade can use aura of the unremarkable once per day as a spell-like ability. At 11th level, he can use it twice per day, and at 14th level, it becomes a constant spell-like ability that he can activate or deactivate as a free action. The ability\u0027s caster level is equal to his slayer class level, and the DC is equal to 10 + the number of ranks the butterfly blade has in either Bluff or Intimidate, whichever is higher."
