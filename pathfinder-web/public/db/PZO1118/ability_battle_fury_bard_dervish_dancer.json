    "text": "At 20th level, the dervish dancer can unleash a whirlwind of blows while performing a battle dance. As a full-round action, he can take a single move action and unleash a single attack at his highest bonus against each target within his reach during any point of his move, up to a maximum number of attacks equal to the dervish dancer\u0027s character level. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.\nThis ability replaces deadly performance."
