    "text": "Used tactically for long-range attacks on troops, these arrows are fitted with heavy iron heads. While these heads help them travel great distances, they make the arrows less effective at dealing damage. Iron-tipped distance arrows increase their bow\u0027s range increment by 10 feet but take a â€“1 penalty on damage dealt per range increment (minimum 1 point of damage). They are sold in leather quivers in quantities of 20."
