      "Benefit": "When using the Diplomacy skill to make a request or change a creature\u0027s attitude, you can use verbal misdirection. To do so, make a Bluff check against that creature. If you succeed, you gain a +4 bonus on your next Diplomacy check against that creature if the check is made within the next minute. If you fail by 5 or more, you instead take a â€“2 penalty on your next Diplomacy check against that creature."
