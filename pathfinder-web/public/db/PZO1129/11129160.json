    "text": "These wooden drinking cups are similar to those found in many common taverns, and always come in pairsâ€”one is a master cup, and the other is a mark cup. When a user of the master cup shares drinks with someone with the mark cup, the master cup\u0027s user gains a supernatural advantage when attempting to develop a good rapport with the creature drinking from the mark cup. After 5 minutes of sharing a drink and chatting with a user of the mark cup, the user of the master cup gains a +5 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks against the user of the mark cup. The two users must share a beverage from a common source (for example, two cupfuls poured from a single bottle of wine, ladled from the same punch bowl, or dipped into the same spring water) and spend the 5 minutes socializing with one another. The bonus lasts for 1 hour or until the users move more than 15 feet apart from each other, whichever comes first. Once a creature has used a mark cup, that creature cannot be affected by the same mark cup for 1 day."
