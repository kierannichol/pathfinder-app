    "text": "A calumet is a two-piece ceremonial smoking pipe with a bowl shaped from stone or clay and an intricately carved wooden stem decorated with dangling fetishes. The pipe is typically carried in a special leather pouch festooned with beads, patterns, and trinkets. The pipe is used to smoke various herbal mixtures required for certain rituals. The communal smoking of a calumet is sometimes incorporated into diplomatic meetings as a sign of solidarity between various parties. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks against anyone you share your calumet with in this way."
