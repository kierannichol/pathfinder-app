    "text": "This ring carved from a single piece of cherry wood bears an inscription written in Tien. If the wearer can cast summon nature\u0027s ally spells, the wearer adds shikigami to the 3rd-level list of monsters he can summon with those spells, adds kodama to the 5th-level list, adds zuishin to the 7th-level list, and adds toshigami to the 9th-level list. Also, once per day on command the wearer can use this ring to summon a shikigami, as if by the summon nature\u0027s ally III spell."
