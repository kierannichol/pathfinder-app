If the wearer can cast summon nature\u0027s ally spells, the wearer adds leaf leshy to the 1st-level list of monsters he can summon with those spells, adds gourd leshy to the 2nd-level list, adds fungus leshy the 3rd-level list, and adds seaweed leshy to the 4th-level list. Also, once per day on command the wearer can use this ring to summon a leaf leshy, as if by the summon nature\u0027s ally I spell."
