    "text": "These garish tokens usually take the form of a colorful clothing accessories. So long as a token is grasped in the user\u0027s off hand, she can spend 1 panache point to gain the use of a specific ability associated with the token. Once per day, the bearer can use the token to gain the full benefit of the token without spending panache. Non-swashbucklers can use the tokens, but unless they have another way of gaining panache, they can use the ability only once per day. A character can benefit from only one token at a time; holding a second token provides no additional benefit. There are four types of tokens, each offering a different benefit.\nBlue Scarf: The user can spend 1 panache point as a swift action to increase her melee reach with light or one-handed piercing weapons by 5 feet for 1 minute.\nGreen Glove: The user can spend 1 panache point as a swift action to ignore the effects of difficult terrain until the end of her next turn.\nRed Sash: The user can spend 1 panache point as an immediate action to attempt a combat maneuver check to trip a creature that has charged and ended its charge in a space within the user\u0027s melee reach. This combat maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity, it\u0027s attempted before the attack at the end of the charge, and the sash\u0027s user gains a +2 bonus on the check. If the check is successful, the attacker can\u0027t make an attack at the end of its charge.\nWhite Lace Kerchief: The user can spend 1 panache point as a swift action to pinpoint an unseen, adjacent enemy and gains the benefits of the Blind Fight feat for 1 round."
