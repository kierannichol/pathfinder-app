    "text": "You create a transparent, shimmering wall through which creatures and objects appear to be wildly distorted to viewers. Any creature that passes through the wall is immediately assailed by overwhelming vertigo, becoming nauseated for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save; if nauseated, the creature must also succeed at a DC 12 Acrobatics check or fall prone. Creatures gain partial concealment (20% miss chance) against creatures on the other side of the wall.",
