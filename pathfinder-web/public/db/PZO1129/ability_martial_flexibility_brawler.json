    "text": "A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn\u0027t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat\u0027s prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).The brawler can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat\u0027s daily limit.At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another\u0027s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.At 12th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability."
