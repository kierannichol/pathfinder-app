    "text": "The damage reduction of this dull gray +1 adamantine chain shirt stacks with any other damage reduction the wearer possesses. For example, a wearer with DR 5/magic would reduce damage from nonmagical attacks by 6, and magical attacks by 1. While the wearer rages or maintains a raging song, the armor emits a low droning sound and grants the benefits of light fortification.\nWhile the wearer maintains a bardic performance, the armor\u0027s links jangle in harmony with his song or movements, aiding his focus. The wearer receives a +1 luck bonus on all ability checks and skill checks he attempts during such a performance. In addition, any penalties applied to his attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws are reduced by 1. If a die roll has multiple penalties, the total of the penalties is reduced by 1, not each individual penalty.",
