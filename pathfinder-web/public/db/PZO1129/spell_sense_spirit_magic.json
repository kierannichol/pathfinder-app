    "text": "You gain greater sensitivity to magic associated with your primary spirit and wandering spirits (any spells on the spirit magic spell lists for these spirits, as well as spell-like abilities that duplicate the effects of those spells). You gain a +10 circumstance bonus on Spellcraft checks to identify these spells if they are cast within the area, and a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws to resist the effects of such spells. If any of these spells require an attack roll, you are never considered flat-footed against such attacks.",
