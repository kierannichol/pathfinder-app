The target must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier) or be staggered for 1 round for every 2 sorcerer levels you possess. You may use this ability once per day at 9th level. At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day. At 20th level, you may use this ability three times per day."
