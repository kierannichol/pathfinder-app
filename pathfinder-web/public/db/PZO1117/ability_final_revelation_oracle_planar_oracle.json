    "text": "At 20th level, you become an extraplanar creature. Choose one outer plane, such as Heaven or the Abyss. You gain superficial physical characteristics as appropriate to natives of your chosen outer plane. For example, if your chosen plane is Heaven, you gain angelic features such as a halo and metallic skin. This change does not alter your Hit Dice, hit points, saving throws, skill points, class skills, or proficiencies. Your type changes to “outsider (extraplanar),\"except on your associated plane, where your type is “outsider (native).\"In addition, you gain immunity to your associated energy type and gain damage reduction 10/magic. Unlike other outsiders, you can still be brought back from the dead as if you were a member of your previous creature type.\nThis replaces the final revelation of the oracle\u0027s mystery."
