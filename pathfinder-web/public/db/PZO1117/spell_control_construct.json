    "text": "You wrest the control of a construct from its master. For as long as you concentrate, you can control the construct as if you were its master. You must make a Spellcraft check each round to maintain control. The DC of the Spellcraft check is (10 + the construct\u0027s HD). If the construct\u0027s creator or master is present and trying to control the construct, you both must make opposed Spellcraft checks each round to control the construct.",
