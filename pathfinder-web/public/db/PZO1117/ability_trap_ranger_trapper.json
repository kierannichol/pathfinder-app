    "text": "At 5th level, a trapper learns how to create a snare trap and one other ranger trap of her choice.\nAt 7th level and every two levels thereafter, she learns another trap. The trapper can use these traps a total number of times per day equal to 1/2 her ranger level + her Wisdom modifier. Once a trap is learned, it can\u0027t be unlearned and replaced with a different type of trap. The trapper cannot select an individual trap more than once."
