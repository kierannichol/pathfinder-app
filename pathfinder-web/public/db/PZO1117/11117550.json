    "text": "You weaken the target\u0027s defenses against poison. The target gains a –4 penalty on saves against poison, and poisons affecting the target continue for another 2 frequency increments (for example, black adder venom lasts 8 rounds instead of 6, and arsenic lasts for 6 minutes instead of 4). Attempts to cure the poisoned target with skill or magic take a –4 penalty."
