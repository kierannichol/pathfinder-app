    "text": "Blood, dirt, wine, and more stain this white leather book. The owner\u0027s name, Jack Were-son, is stamped into the cover in peeling gold, yet no more information about the author is immediately evident. Several of the pages contain careful diagrams and illustrations done by a competent but uninspiring artist."
