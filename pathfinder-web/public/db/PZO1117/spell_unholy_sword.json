The weapon acts as a +5 unholy weapon(+5 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, extra 2d6 damage against good opponents). It also emits a magic circle against goodeffect (as the spell). If the magic circleends, the sword creates a new one on your turn as a free action. The spell is automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand. You cannot have more than one unholy swordat a time."
