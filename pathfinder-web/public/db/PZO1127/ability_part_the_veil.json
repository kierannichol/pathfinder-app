    "text": "At 8th level, you can lace spells you cast with the raw madness that waits in the outer darkness. Activating this ability is a swift action that you must use as you cast a spell that targets a single creature and that allows a Will saving throw to negate or reduce the spell’s primary effect. If the target fails to resist the spell, the target is also confused for a number of rounds equal to the spell’s level as visions of the void cause temporary insanity. The victim must succeed at a new saving throw each round to end the effect—these additional saving throws apply only to the additional confusion effect and not to the original spell effect. Part the veil is a mind-affecting effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your class level."
