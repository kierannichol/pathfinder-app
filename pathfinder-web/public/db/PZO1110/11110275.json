    "text": "This spell causes instant diminution of a humanoid creature, halving its height, length, and width and dividing its weight by 8. This decrease changes the creature\u0027s size category to the next smaller one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Dexterity, a â€“2 size penalty to Strength (to a minimum of 1), and a +1 bonus on attack rolls and AC due to its reduced size."
