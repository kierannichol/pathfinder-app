    "text": "You turn a number of normal-sized centipedes, scorpions, or spiders into their giant counterparts. Only one type of vermin can be transmuted (so a single casting cannot affect both a centipede and a spider). The number of vermin which can be affected by this spell depends on your caster level, as noted on the table below.",
