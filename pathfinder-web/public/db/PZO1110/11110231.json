    "text": "This set of flashy—perhaps even gaudy— clothes is meant for entertaining. Entertainer\u0027s outfits come in a wide range of styles, from scandalous to flattering to absurd. While the outfit looks whimsical, its practical design does nothing to inhibit your ability to tumble, dance, walk a tightrope, or run (if the audience turns ugly)."
