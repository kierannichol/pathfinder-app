    "text": "This unremarkable powder resembles chalk dust or powdered graphite. When stared at, however, the dust changes color and form. A creature covered in dust of illusion is affected as if by a disguise self glamer, with the individual who sprinkles the dust envisioning the illusion desired. An unwilling target is allowed a DC 11 Reflex save to avoid the dust. The glamer lasts for 2 hours."
