    "text": "A crossbow bolt used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised weapon (–4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical multiplier ×2). Bolts come in a case or quiver that holds 10 bolts. All crossbows except repeating crossbows use these kinds of crossbow bolts, which are sometimes called \"quarrels.\""
