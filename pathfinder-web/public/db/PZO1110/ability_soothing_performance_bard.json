    "text": "A bard of 12th level or higher can use his performance to create an effect equivalent to the mass cure serious wounds, using the bardâ€™s level as the caster level. In addition, this performance removes the fatigued, sickened, and shaken condition from all those affected. Using this ability requires 4 rounds of continuous performance, and the targets must be able to see and hear the bard throughout the performance. Soothing performance relies on audible and visual components."
