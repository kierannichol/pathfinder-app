    "text": "The wondrous items known as golem manuals contain all the information and magical power required to create a particular kind of golem. This effectively grants the Craft Construct feat to anyone using the manual to craft a golem of that type, and it provides an increase in caster level for the purpose of meeting the prerequisite to craft that specific type of golem. Further, the manual grants a +5 competence bonus on skill checks to craft the golem and contains all the necessary spells, which can be activated by anyone who has the relevant spells on their class\u0027s spell list (but only for the purpose of crafting the golem). When using a golem manual, you must still spend the normal amount of time to craft the golem and pay the cost of the golem\u0027s body (or provide it through other means), but you do not need to pay the rest of the normal cost to create the golem.\nThe spells included in a golem manual require a spell trigger activation and can be activated only to assist in the construction of a golem. The cost of the book does not include the cost of constructing the golem\u0027s body. Once the golem is finished, the writing in the manual fades and the book is consumed in flames. When the book\u0027s ashes are sprinkled upon the golem, it becomes fully animated.\nFor example, with a clay golem manual, you would need to provide a body worth 1,500 gp (rather than the normal full cost of 21,500 gp), spend 42 days constructing the golem\u0027s body (1 for each 1,000 gp in the normal price of the golem), have a caster level of 9th or higher (as the manual provides a +2 bonus and the normal requirement is 11th level), have animate objects, bless, commune, prayer, and resurrection on your class\u0027s spell list, and succeed at a DC 16 Craft (sculptures) or Craft (pottery) check (but the manual gives you a +5 bonus on the check.)\nAdamantine (Construct Handbook): The book contains crushing hand, geas/quest, heal, stoneskin, and wish.
