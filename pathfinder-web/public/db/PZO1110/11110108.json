    "text": "A sai is a metal spike flanked by a pair of prongs used to trap an enemy\u0027s weapon. When wielding a sai, you get a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to sunder an enemy\u0027s weapon. Though pointed, a sai is not usually used for stabbing. Instead, it is used primarily to bludgeon foes, punching with the hilt, or else to catch and disarm weapons between its tines. Sais are often wielded in pairs.",
