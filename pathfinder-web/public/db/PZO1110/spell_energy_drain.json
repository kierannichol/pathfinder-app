    "text": "This spell functions like enervation, except that the creature struck gains 2d4 temporary negative levels. Twenty-four hours after gaining them, the subject must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC \u003d energy drain spell\u0027s save DC) for each negative level. If the save succeeds, that negative level is removed. If it fails, that negative level becomes permanent.",
