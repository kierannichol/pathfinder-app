    "text": "This +1 heavy steel shield is made of metal, but its color is a flat black that seems to absorb light. Once every 2 days, on command, it can disintegrate an object that it touches, as the spell but requiring a melee touch attack. This effect only functions as an attackâ€”it can\u0027t be activated to target a creature or weapon as it strikes the shield."
