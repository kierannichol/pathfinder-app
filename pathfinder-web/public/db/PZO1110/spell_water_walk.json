Mud, oil, snow, quicksand, running water, ice, and even lava can be traversed easily, since the subjects\u0027 feet hover an inch or two above the surface. Creatures crossing molten lava still take damage from the heat because they are near it. The subjects can walk, run, charge, or otherwise move across the surface as if it were normal ground.",
