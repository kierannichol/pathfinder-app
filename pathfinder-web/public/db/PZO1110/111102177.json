    "text": "Driving sleet blocks all sight (even darkvision) within it and causes the ground in the area to be icy. A creature can walk within or through the area of sleet at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can\u0027t move in that round, while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details)."
