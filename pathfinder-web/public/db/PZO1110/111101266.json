The +2 enhancement bonus also applies whenever the weapon is used against creatures native to the elemental planes. It operates as a +3 longsword on the Astral Plane and the Ethereal Plane, or when used against opponents native to either of those planes. On any other plane, or against any outsider, it functions as a +4 longsword."
