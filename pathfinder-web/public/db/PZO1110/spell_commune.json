You are allowed one such question per caster level. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity\u0027s knowledge. â€œUnclear\" is a legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the Outer Planes are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the deity\u0027s interests, a short phrase (five words or less) may be given as an answer instead.",
