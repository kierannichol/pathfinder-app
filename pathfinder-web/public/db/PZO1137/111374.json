    "text": "Barbatos wields a potent weapon named Eyjatas, a +4 speed unholy quarterstaff embedded with innumerable inhuman eyeballs. Three times per day when striking a creature with Eyjatas, its wielder can rip the target\u0027s eyes out, permanently blinding it and dealing 2d6 points of bleed damage. A creature can resist this effect with a successful DC 30 Fortitude save, but no save is allowed if the attack was a confirmed critical hit. Once Eyjatas rips out a creature\u0027s eyes, it functions as a bane weapon against that target.\nThree times per day, the wielder of Eyjatas can cast prying eyes. In addition, the wielder can use arcane eye at will, even on other planes viewed through scrying, and can use eyebite (DC 20) at will within 30 feet of the arcane eye.",

      "Destruction": "To destroy Eyjatas, the quarterstaff\u0027s dozens of eyes must be blinded by the purifying light of an unwavering truth spoken by an immortal that has only ever spoken lies in its life. Once the eyes are blinded in this way, the staff must be hurled into a magical portal that has no entrance and that leads nowhere."
