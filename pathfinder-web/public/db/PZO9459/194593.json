After a hit with the dagger but before damage is determined, the wielder of an arachnid\u0027s fang can release a stored dose of poison into the creature struck by the blade as a free action. Up to 8 doses of poison can be stored in the dagger at a time, but only 1 dose can be released on a given attack."
