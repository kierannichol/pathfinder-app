    "text": "When thrown, this +1 dart animates and attacks a single target as a dancing weapon for 4 rounds. When a stirge dart hits, instead of dealing normal damage, the dart drains blood from the target, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage. The dart falls to the ground harmlessly once it stops attacking. A stirge dart can be used only once before it loses all of its magical properties."
