    "text": "A monk of the mantis\u0027s knowledge of anatomy allows her to deal blows that both deal damage and impose debilitating conditions.\nAt 7th level, if a monk of the mantis stuns a target with Stunning Fist, the target is also entangled for 1 round after the Stunning Fist effect ends. At 11th level, if the monk of the mantis stuns a target with Stunning Fist, the target is also exhausted for 1 round after the Stunning Fist effect ends.\nAt 13th level, the monk can spend 1 point from her ki pool as part of her Stunning Fist attack to increase the duration of these additional effects to a number of rounds equal to her Wisdom bonus (minimum 2 rounds)."
