    "text": "This black alchemical concoction reacts when it comes into contact with metal, rapidly expanding into a sticky, inflexible substance that temporarily renders armor more difficult to use. When the sap is smeared onto metal armor or thrown at a creature wearing metal armor (as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet), that armor is considered one category heavier for the purposes of movement (heavy armor is still treated as heavy). This increase does not apply to proficiency in wearing the armor. Additionally, the arcane spell failure chance of armor affected by mithralbane sap increases by 10%, its maximum Dexterity bonus decreases by 2 (to a minimum of 0), and its armor check penalty increases by 3. These effects last for 1 minute, after which the grease hardens and crumbles away. Armor that\u0027s not primarily made of metal and metal items such as weapons and shields are not meaningfully affected by mithralbane sap. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
