      "Benefit": "Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can move your opponent, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent\u0027s CMD, you may move your opponent as if from the reposition combat maneuver. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.",
      "Special": "You can only apply the effects of one of the following feats to a given critical hit: Bull Rush Strike, Disarming Strike, Repositioning Strike, Sundering Strike, or Tripping Strike. You may choose to use this feat after you make your confirmation roll.",
