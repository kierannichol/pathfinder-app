    "text": "This item normally looks like a heavy steel brooch or cloak clasp, often depicting a heavy helm or sturdy shield. On command, the brooch transforms in a clatter of metallic plates and panels to instantly cover the wearer in a complete suit of +1 full plate, with the design of the brooch displayed on the armor\u0027s breastplate. The same command word causes the armor to transform into the brooch. The brooch only transforms if the wearer\u0027s armor slot is unoccupied, thus it won\u0027t work if the wearer is already armored. The brooch associated with this armor weighs less than a pound and occupies the neck slot when in this form.",
