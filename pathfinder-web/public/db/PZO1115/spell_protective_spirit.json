When a creature makes an attack of opportunity against you, the protective spiritmakes an immediate attack using your base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier. On a successful hit, the spirit does no damage, but it causes the attack of opportunity to automatically miss. A protective spiritcan defend against a number of attacks of opportunity equal to your Dexterity bonus (minimum 1) per round.",
