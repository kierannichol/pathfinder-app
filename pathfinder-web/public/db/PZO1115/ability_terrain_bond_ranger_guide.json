    "text": "At 4th level, the guide forms a bond with the land itself, enabling him to direct others in such terrain. When in his favored terrain, the Ranger grants all allies within line of sight and that can hear him a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks. Also, as long as they travel with him, the Ranger\u0027s allies leave no trail and can\u0027t be tracked. The Ranger can choose for the group to leave a trail, or even specific members of the group to leave a trail if he so desires.\nThis ability replaces hunter\u0027s bond."
