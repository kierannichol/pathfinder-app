    "text": "You learn the answers to a specific set of questions about a creature so long as you have access to at least one drop of its blood. You can cast this spell on the blood of the living or the dead, but living or undead creatures are entitled to a saving throw to resist the spell. You can cast the spell on dried or fresh blood. Once you cast the spell the answers to the following four questions appear on any flat surface you designate (a wall, a piece of paper, and so on). Who are you? (The name by which the creature is most commonly known) What are you? (Gender, race, profession/role) How was your blood shed? (Brief outline of the events that caused its wound, to the best of the victim\u0027s knowledge) When was your blood shed? These answers always appear in a language you can read even if the creature cannot speak that or any language."
