    "text": "This ornately designed +1 lance, decorated with ribbons and small favors, allows its wielder to more effectively knock an opponent from his mount. A successful hit with a lance of jousting on a mounted opponent forces the target to make a Ride check (DC 10 + damage dealt) to avoid being knocked from the saddle. Although this lance is used in combat to remove a mounted foe\u0027s advantage, use of one in a tournament or similar contest is generally considered a dishonorable form of cheating."
