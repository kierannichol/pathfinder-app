    "text": "Rare to virtually nonexistent on the surface world, spider\u0027s silk rope is woven of strands of silk from monstrous spiders by goblin slaves in the employ of the drow. As such it is commonly used by the dark elves, though shorter spider\u0027s silk rope scraps (generally no more than 10 feet long) frequently appear among goblins. Spider\u0027s silk rope has 6 hit points and can be burst with a DC 25 Strength check."
