    "text": "This simple musical instrument seems and behaves in all ways like any other kind of magical pipes until its owner plays it in an urban setting. Once he does, it requires all people within hearing range to make a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid falling into a murderous fury. Those who fail their saves gain the effects of a rage spell for the next 1d6 hours and experience a strong compulsion (DC 15 Will save negates) to attack any stranger or disliked person whom they encounter during this time. If the owner spends more than 3 consecutive days in an urban setting, he must make a DC 15 Will saving throw each day to avoid playing the riot pipes at some point during each subsequent day. The pipes remain with the player until the curse is broken."
