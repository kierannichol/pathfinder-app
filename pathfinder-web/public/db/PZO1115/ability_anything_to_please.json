    "text": "At 8th level, you can compel a creature within 30 feet to attempt to please you as a standard action. The creature receives a Will save to negate this affect. If the save fails, the creature attacks your enemies for 1 round, gives you its most valuable item, or drops prone at your feet and grovels for 1d4 rounds (GMâ€™s choice). You can use this ability once per day at 8th level and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 8th. This is a mind-affecting effect."
