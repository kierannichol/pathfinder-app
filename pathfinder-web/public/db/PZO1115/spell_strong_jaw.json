    "text": "Laying a hand upon an allied creature\u0027s jaw, claws, tentacles, or other natural weapons, you enhance the power of that creature\u0027s natural attacks. Each natural attack that creature makes deals damage as if the creature were two sizes larger than it actually is. If the creature is already Gargantuan or Colossal-sized, double the amount of damage dealt by each of its natural attacks instead. This spell does not actually change the creature\u0027s size; all of its statistics except the amount of damage dealt by its natural attacks remain unchanged.",
