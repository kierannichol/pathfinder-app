    "text": "Resurgent transformationgrants you the ability to recover from deadly wounds with restored vitality and a will to fight, but at a price. Once cast, resurgent transformationlies dormant for up to 1 hour per level until you are reduced to one-quarter hit points or less. Once triggered, you immediately gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution and Strength, damage reduction 5/--, and the benefits of a hastespell. In addition, you heal 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25). Resurgent transformationcan even save you from death by healing the damage from an otherwise mortal wound, though it does not prevent death from massive damage or from causes other than hit point loss. Your mental faculties are impaired by this magical transformation, however, causing 1d4 points of Intelligence and Wisdom damage."
