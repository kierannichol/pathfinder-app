    "text": "Carved from the bone of some giant beast, this large horn emits an eerie, heart-lurching moan when sounded. A creature with the favored enemy class feature may blow the horn as a standard action to daze one type of favored enemy within 90 feet for 1d4 rounds (DC 13 Will save negates). Creatures suffer a penalty on this save equal to the ranger\u0027s favored enemy bonus against that type of creature. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect; creatures that cannot hear the horn are immune to its magic. The horn\u0027s magic works once per day."
