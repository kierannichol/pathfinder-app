    "text": "As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack against a creature, causing it to experience terrible hallucinations for 1 round. During this time, the creature loses any immunity to fear effects it might possess and takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls made against you. In addition, the creature takes a penalty on Will saves made against fear effects equal to 1/2 your cleric level (minimum –1). This power is a mind-affecting effect. You can use this ability for a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier."
