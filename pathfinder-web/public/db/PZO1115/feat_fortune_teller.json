      "Benefit": "Upon taking this feat, choose a focus item for your divination magic--a crystal ball, runes, a harrow deck, or some such item. Whenever you cast a spell from the divination school, you may use this focus item instead of the spell\u0027s material component, as long as the cost of the material component is no more than 1,000 gp. If you choose to perform the spell using your focus item and the spell\u0027s normal material component (regardless of that component\u0027s cost), you cast the spell at +1 caster level."
