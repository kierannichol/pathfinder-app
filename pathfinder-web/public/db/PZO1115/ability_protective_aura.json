    "text": "At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot protective aura as a standard action. Allies in this aura receive a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws. In addition, allies in the area gain the benefits of protection from evil (although the AC bonus and saving throw bonus do not stack with those granted by this effect). You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. These rounds do not have to be consecutive."
