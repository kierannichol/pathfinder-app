    "text": "You can touch a willing creature as a standard action, granting it a +4 bonus on all saving throws made against mind-affecting effects and immunity to confusion. This bonus lasts for 1 minute. If the creature fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect during this period, it loses its immunity to confusion and is immediately confused for one round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier."
