      "Benefit": "Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can disarm your opponent, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent\u0027s CMD, you may disarm your opponent as if from the disarm combat maneuver. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.",
      "Special": "You can only apply the effects of one of the following feats to a given critical hit: Bull Rush Strike, Disarming Strike, Repositioning Strike, Sundering Strike, or Tripping Strike. You may choose to use this feat after you make your confirmation roll.",
      "Normal": "You must perform a disarm combat maneuver to disarm an opponent."
