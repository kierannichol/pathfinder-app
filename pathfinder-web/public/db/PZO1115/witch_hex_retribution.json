      "Effect": "A witch can place a retribution hex on a creature within 60 feet, causing terrible wounds to open across the target\u0027s flesh whenever it deals damage to another creature in melee. Immediately after the hexed creature deals damage in melee, it takes half that damage (round down). This damage bypasses any resistances, immunities, or damage reduction the creature possesses. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the witch\u0027s Intelligence modifier. A Will save negates this effect."
