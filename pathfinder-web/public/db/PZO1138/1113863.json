    "text": "This exotic, fur-trimmed cloak is decorated with golden filigree. In addition to offering magical protection, the cloak guides a skilled wearer\u0027s blade to block attacks. Such cloaks are often commissioned by Aldori Academy graduates when they attain swordlord status.\nA swordlord\u0027s cloak acts as a cloak of resistance. In addition, whenever the wearer is benefiting from the defensive parry class feature, he receives an insight bonus to his AC equal to the cloak\u0027s resistance bonus."
