    "text": "At 13th level, a halcyon druid wearing her bonded mask can embody the spirit it represents, which can be any Tiny to Large agathion, angel, archon, or azata. This ability requires a standard action to activate and functions as per beast shape IV (using the adjustments for magical beasts), but adds the following abilities if the assumed form has them: aura of menace, protective aura, speak with animals, telepathy, and truespeech. If the assumed form has immunity to a condition, the druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against effects that cause that condition. A halcyon druid can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her druid level. The duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments."
