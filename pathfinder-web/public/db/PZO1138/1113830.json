    "text": "This +1 light mace is forged of black iron and topped with what appears to be a clenched fist with spikes protruding from between the fingers. As a move action, the wielder can expend 1 point from his arcane pool (as per a magus), 1 point from his arcane reservoir (as per an arcanist), or one use of fervor (as per a warpriest) to make a single melee attack with the signifer\u0027s fist. Characters without any of these options can instead activate a signifer\u0027s fist in this way as a standard action once per day. If the attack deals damage to a creature, the signifer\u0027s fist gains the bane weapon special ability against that creature\u0027s type (or subtype if the creature is a humanoid or outsider) for 1 minute. This benefit doesn\u0027t apply if the target is immune to bleed, though the attack still deals damage normally."
