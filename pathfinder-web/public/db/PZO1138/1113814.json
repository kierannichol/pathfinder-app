    "text": "This spell allows you to lay your hand upon a magical glyph, symbol, or other magical spell effect (referred to in this spell description as a â€œrune\") and attempt to absorb the essence of its effect. To absorb a rune, you must be aware of the rune\u0027s existence (but need not know the details of what it actually does) and then succeed at a caster level check (DC \u003d 10 + the caster level of the spell affect being absorbed) as you touch the rune in question. If you fail this caster level check, the magical rune is not triggered unless you fail the roll by 5 or more."
