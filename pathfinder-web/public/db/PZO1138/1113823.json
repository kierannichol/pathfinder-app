    "text": "This wayfinder is made of heat-treated bronze that seems to warp and shimmer in the light. It contains a single slot to store an ioun stone (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 305), and the wayfinder\u0027s construction allows the bearer to overtax the ioun stone\u0027s magical properties once per day to create a special, short-term resonance effect based on the stone\u0027s shape. This process suppresses any other resonance effects the ioun stone might grant for 24 hours. The ioun stone is especially fragile during this time, crumbling to pieces if removed from the wayfinder"
