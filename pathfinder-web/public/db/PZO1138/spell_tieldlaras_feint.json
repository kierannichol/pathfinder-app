    "text": "With a lascivious wink and a sensuous sway, you flood a foe\u0027s mind with lustful thoughts of you, distracting your target and rendering that creature vulnerable to your attacks. An affected creature takes a penalty equal to half your caster level on concentration checks and to its CMD against dirty trickAPG, grapple, and stealAPG combat maneuvers you perform. The creature is also denied its Dexterity bonus to AC for the first melee attack you make against it each round.",
