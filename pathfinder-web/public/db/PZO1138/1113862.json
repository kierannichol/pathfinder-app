    "text": "This set of +3 Gray Maiden plate creates a mental link between the wearer and her allies. The wearer can telepathically communicate with allies within 30 feet (although this communication is one-way, unless an ally also has telepathy). If an ally within 30 feet is aware of a threat, the wearer of this armor is aware as well, and the wearer is never flat-footed unless all allies within 30 feet are also flat-footed. In addition, if the wearer of a maiden\u0027s panoply also wields a maiden\u0027s aegis, activating that shield\u0027s ability does not reduce the maiden\u0027s aegis\u0027s enhancement bonus, and the bonus it grants increases to +2.",
