    "text": "This 1-inch red marble statue depicts a tiny praying mantis. When the command word is uttered, the mantis comes to life and moves as its owner instructs, as per a sensor eye from a prying eyes spell. The mantis remains animated for up to 9 hours or until it returns to the bearer and replays what it saw, at which point it reverts to statue form for 1 day. If the mantis is destroyed while animate, it reverts to statue form."
