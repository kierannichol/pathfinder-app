    "text": "Ordained as one of the sinister albino druids, you carry with you into the wider world a powerful effigy of hair, twigs, and blood that crawls with the deepening cold of the hallowed hunting grounds.",

      "Benefit": "Add the following spells to your druid spell list.",
      "Special": "As part of this feat, you create a personal token that ties your soul and your doings to the fell power of the dark forest. This potent object is treated as a wooden unholy symbol that radiates faint necromancy magic. If your token is ever destroyed, your connection to the shadowy heart of the forest is severed and all benefits of this feat are lost until another is created. This process requires a journey to the same forest and an atonement spell cast by a fellow worshiper of your dark god."
