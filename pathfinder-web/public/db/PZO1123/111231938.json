    "text": "This ebon rod is so dark it seems to absorb the light around it. The rod functions as a +2 light mace, and allows its wielder to see in darkness as if she had the see in darkness ability (Bestiary 2 301). Three times per day, the wielder can use it to create a deeper darkness effect (caster level 8th). To use this ability, the rod\u0027s wielder must touch the target object, which is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity."
