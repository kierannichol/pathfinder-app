When used to make a shield bash attack, the shield\u0027s wielder can make a bull rush maneuver as a free action against her target without provoking an attack of opportunity from the creature being bull rushed. Once per day on command, the wielder can cause the tempest shield to emit a s tream of high-powered air as the gust of wind spell."
