    "text": "This +2 keen dancing longsword is infused with the soul of a bard who chose to instill his consciousness into a weapon rather than to see his voice die. The sword constantly sings. The only way to silence it to a whisper is with a DC 15 Diplomacy or Intimidate check, and even this only quiets the sword for 10 minutes plus another 10 minutes for every 5 points by which the DC is exceeded. The sword speaks, though it typically communicates through song. A singing sword has the following powers."
