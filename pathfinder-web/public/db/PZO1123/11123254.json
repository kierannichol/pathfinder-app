    "text": "These glasses look like golden teeth holding a pair of greentinted lenses. The wearer may use eyebite 11 times per day on command, affecting one target for each use of the spell. The wearer does not need to use these rounds consecutively, but each activation is a standard action (unlike the spell, in which targeting a new foe is a swift action). If the wearer removes the glasses, the eyebite effects immediately end."
