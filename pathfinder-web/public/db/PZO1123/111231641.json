    "text": "The price of jewelry varies wildly by its quality. Many cultures, particularly nomads, consciously use jewelry as a form of portable wealth, most notably with belts and bangles made from coins. A commoner\u0027s ornaments may only be worth a few copper pieces, an artisan\u0027s a few silver pieces, and a merchant\u0027s a few gold pieces, while nobles rarely wear jewelry worth less than 100 gp."
