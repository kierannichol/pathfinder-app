    "text": "This multicolored headband with beaded tassels tips luck in the wearer\u0027s favor. The wearer gains a +1 luck bonus on saving throws.\nAny effect that gives the wearer a luck bonus (such as a divine favor or prayer spell) or explicitly increases the wearer\u0027s good luck (such as a witch\u0027s fortune hex, the Luck domain\u0027s bit of luck domain power, and so on) lasts for 1 round longer than normal on the wearer. Abilities without a time-based duration (such as carrying a stone of good luck) are unaffected by the headband."
