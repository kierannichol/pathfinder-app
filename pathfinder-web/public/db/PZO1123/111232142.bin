éWhen a liming weapon is wielded, a pale glow outlines it. On a successful strike against a creature affected by a means of magical concealment, the weapon outlines the creature in faerie fire (as the spell) for 1 round. Magical means of concealment include blur, displacement, invisibility, and similar effects, whether from a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural means, but not those provided by extraordinary abilities . A liming weapon has no special effect against creatures merely hiding or concealed by non-magical means, or those hidden by environmental conditions (even magical) such as darkness or fog.
