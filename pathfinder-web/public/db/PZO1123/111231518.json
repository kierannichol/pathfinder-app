    "text": "Each of these calf-high boots bears a vertical blade on the bottom, allowing you to travel swiftly on ice. Wearing ice skates allows you to move on ice at normal speed with a successful DC 5 Acrobatics check (including running and charging), but your movement is reduced to half speed on all other terrain. Donning or removing an ice skate is a full-round action. Skating with only one is possible, but the DC of the Acrobatics check rises to 15."
