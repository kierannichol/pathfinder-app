µThis special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A repositioning weapon grants the wielder a +2 enhancement bonus on combat maneuver checks to reposition a foe. If the wielder confirms a critical hit with the weapon, he can attempt to reposition his opponent as a free action. These reposition attempts still provoke attacks of opportunity as normal. A weapon cannot have both the anchoring and repositioning special abilities .
