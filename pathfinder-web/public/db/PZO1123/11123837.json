    "text": "An evolution of the punching dagger, the pata is a short sword that ends in a full, fingerless gauntlet hilt. You punch rather than stab with the weapon, allowing you to put more force behind each strike. While wearing a pata, you cannot use that hand for anything else. A pata provides a +10 bonus to your CMD against disarm attempts.",
