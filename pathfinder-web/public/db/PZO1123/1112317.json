    "text": "This ruffled silk cloak is incredibly durable despite its soft, delicate construction. Anytime the wearer falls asleep (whether the sleep is natural or brought on by a magical effect), the cloak immediately transforms into sticky strands that envelop the wearer\u0027s body, hardening into a solid silk cocoon. While wrapped in the cocoon the wearer gains a +4 enhancement bonus to natural armor and is protected from critical hits and sneak attacks as if subject to the light fortification armor ability (25% chance for normal damage on a critical hit). The cocoon opens and transforms back into a cloak once the wearer awakens."
