    "text": "A universalist wizard who selects the amulet as his bonded object may choose one school of spells each day when he prepares spells. He then can use the necklace to spontaneously convert any prepared wizard spell of that school into any other wizard spell of that school he knowsâ€” though the desired spell must be of the same level or lower than the prepared spell. For example, if the wizard chooses evocation when he prepares his spells that morning, until the next time he prepares spells, he can spontaneously convert a prepared fireball into any other evocation wizard spell of 3rd level or lower that he knows."
