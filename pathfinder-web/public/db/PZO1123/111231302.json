    "text": "This coarse, acrid-smelling thread is more akin to wire than fabric. When carefully sewn into the body of a flesh golem or zombie (requiring 1 hour per Hit Die of the creature and a successful DC 20 Heal or Spellcraft check), the stitches change the creature\u0027s damage reduction to DR 5/ adamantine and slashing. Variant zombies lacking damage reduction (such as fast zombies) instead gain DR 5/slashing. One length of stitching is required for every Hit Die of the creature being enhanced. Using an insufficient number of lengths has no effect. A full thimble of embalming thread contains 20 lengths.\nIf the skill check to use the stitches fails, they are not wasted, but must first be cleaned and unknotted, requiring 1 hour per stitch. Once used successfully, the stitches cannot be reused."
