    "text": "The warden of the woods is a suit of +3 greenwood splint mail made of strips of laminated greenwood that flex with the wearer\u0027s movement but stiffen when struck in battle. (The greenwood special material is described on page 50.) This armor is treated in all ways like medium armor, including when determining proficiency. The armor has an arcane spell failure chance of 25%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +2, and an armor check penalty of â€“4.\nAs a move action, the wearer can snap a strip of wood loose from the armor. The strip lengthens into a weapon of a type chosen by the armor\u0027s wearer. It can become a +1 greenwood club, a +1/+1 greenwood quarterstaff, or a +1 keen greenwood wooden stake. If the wearer creates a club or quarterstaff in this way, it gains the benefits of the shillelagh spell with a duration of 1 minute. Each weapon removed from the warden of the woods reduces the armor\u0027s enhancement bonus by 1. Consequently, a maximum of three such weapons can be separated from the armor at any given time. The greenwood weapons keep their enhancement bonuses only while they\u0027re in the wearer\u0027s hands, though they remain masterwork weapons for other wielders.\nThe wearer can reintegrate a weapon back into the warden of the woods as a move action and restore the lost enhancement bonus. Each day at dawn, the armor regenerates any missing strips (regaining its full enhancement bonus), and any weapons still detached from the armor crumble into dust.",
