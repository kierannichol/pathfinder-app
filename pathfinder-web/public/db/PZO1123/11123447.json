    "text": "These sturdy leather-soled cloth boots have straps at the ankles and calves to ensure a snug fit. Once per day, when the wearer of the boots is grappled, pinned, or entangled, she may transfer herself to any spot within 30 feet as if using a dimension door spell. A gnome wearing these boots may instead transfer herself up to 400 feet away."
