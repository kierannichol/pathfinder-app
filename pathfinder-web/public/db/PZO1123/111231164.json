    "text": "This oily bronze helm is fashioned in the shape of a frog\u0027s head. Three times per day as a swift action, the helm fires an unerring tongue of force at a visible target within 20 feet.\nIf the target is an unattended object weighing 250 pounds or less, it is pulled 20 feet toward the wearer. If the target is a creature of the wearer\u0027s size or smaller, the wearer may make a combat maneuver check as a free action to pull the target 20 feet toward him.\nIf the target is a creature larger than the wearer, an unattended object weighing more than 250 pounds, or an immobile structure such as a wall, the wearer is pulled 20 feet toward the target. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the object or creature stops if the movement would move it into a solid object or creature."
