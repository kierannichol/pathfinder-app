    "text": "This plain cloak only has any effect when worn by a member of a half-human race, such as a half-orc or half-elf. It alters the wearer\u0027s appearance similarly to a hat of disguise, but only to the extent that it conceals or alters the wearer\u0027s nonhuman physical traits so the creature appears fully human. Any feature that is plausibly human remains. For example, a half-orc wearing the cloak loses his green or gray skin color and pointed ears, has no visible tusks, and is otherwise completely able to pass as a human version of his normal self. Likewise, a half-elf wearing the cloak has round ears, humanlike eyes, and no other traits indicating elven ancestry. The wearer has no control over the specific guise, and those familiar with his normal appearance can recognize him in his human guise."
