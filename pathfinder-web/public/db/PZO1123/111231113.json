    "text": "This helm functions like a helm of brilliance but is lower-powered. Instead of the standard helm\u0027s allotment of gems, the lesser helm has 10 diamonds (fireball, 10d6 damage, Reflex DC 20 half), 20 corals (flaming sphere), 30 garnets (scorching ray), and 40 agates (light). It still glows near and harms undead, has the flaming weapon special ability, and provides fire resistance (though only 20 instead of 30).\nJust like the standard helm, the wearer risks detonation if damaged by magical fire; diamonds become fireballs centered on the wearer, corals become flaming spheres in and adjacent to the wearer\u0027s space, garnets become scorching rays that fire randomly at creatures in range, and the agates and the helm itself are destroyed."
