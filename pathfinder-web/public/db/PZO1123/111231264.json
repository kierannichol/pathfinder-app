    "text": "People who lose hands, arms, legs, or feet in combat sometimes replace them with prosthetics: realistic simulations of their missing limbs. Usually carved of wood and painted to match the wearer\u0027s skin tone, these items have limited functionality, allowing a legless person to walk at half speed, or enabling an armless person to hold a shield in a fixed position, but little more. Clever individuals have been known to create small compartments in their prosthetics, just large enough to hold very small objects. A prosthetic hand or foot can hold an item with negligible weight, while a prosthetic limb can hold up to 1 or 2 pounds."
