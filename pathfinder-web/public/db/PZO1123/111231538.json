    "text": "Favored by the grave-wardens of sites known to be infested with the spirits of the dead, this pendant is an iron ring strung on a necklace made from polished and discolored bones, nails, and teeth. A faint blue light limns the wearer, protecting him from attack. Undead creatures are repulsed by this light and take a –2 penalty on all attack rolls against the wearer of a gravewatch pendant. Incorporeal undead creatures are further repulsed and instead take a –4 penalty on all attack rolls against the wearer. Undead creatures can sense this light easily, however, and receive a +4 circumstance bonus on Perception checks to detect a creature wearing this pendant."
