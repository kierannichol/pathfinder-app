    "text": "The basic single-shot pistol is one of the most common firearms, although in most campaigns it is still rare enough to be an object of envy or curiosity to most. As such, it can take a variety of different forms, from wildly ornate masterpieces in the shape of fire-breathing dragons to the more common woodhandled pistols, or nothing more than a simple metal tube with a triggering device.\nA pistol uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.",
