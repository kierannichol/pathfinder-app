    "text": "This battered +1 mithral breastplate bears a resemblance to a stylized turtle shell. On command, its wearer can vanish inside the armor, leaving the breastplate behind while she stays safely hidden in an extradimensional space. This space is barely large enough for the wearer to sit comfortably, but does provides breathable air and light to see by. The wearer cannot perceive the environs around the armor while inside. A second command word returns the wearer to the armor\u0027s location, wearing the armor. If the wearer can\u0027t return to the space the armor is in, she is instead shunted to the nearest empty space that can contain her, but no longer wearing the armor.\nIf the breastplate is destroyed, the wearer immediately returns to the square the armor was in when it was destroyed. Successfully dispelling the armor likewise returns the wearer, though in this case still wearing the armor.",
