    "text": "This delicate ring appears to be a ring of spell storing or a ring of spell turning, but instead of aiding casting or counterspelling, the ring hinders such efforts. Each time the wearer casts an arcane spell, he suffers a 25% spell failure chance. Furthermore, the wearer of the ring takes a â€“4 penalty on Spellcraft checks to identify a spell when attempting to counterspell. The ring can only be removed by a remove curse spell or a similar effect."
