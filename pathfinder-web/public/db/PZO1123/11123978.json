    "text": "This ring is a thin but sturdy piece of forged steel crafted to resemble a serpent swallowing its tail, and is magically imbued to reveal the secrets of arcane mastery to its wearer. The ring allows a wearer with an arcane pool to store up to 4 points from his arcane pool in the ring as a swift action. These points remain in the ring until used. A wearer can spend arcane pool points stored in the ring as if they were his own, or can spend them in each of the following ways."
