    "text": "This small crude-looking drum is attached to a strap long enough to loop around the wearer\u0027s neck. A successful DC 12 Perform (percussion) check activates the drum, which enhances any nearby natural or magical fire as long as the bearer spends a move action each round to continue playing. All fires (including fire spells and effects) within 30 feet of the bearer deal an additional 1 point of fire damage (or 2 points for the greater version).\nAll unattended flammable alchemical objects such as tindertwigs, flasks of oil or alchemist\u0027s fire, and fireworks within this range have a 10% chance of spontaneously igniting or exploding (as appropriate to the item) when the drum activates. This chance increases by 5% each round and is checked at the start of the performer\u0027s turn as long as the playing continues.\nA greater goblin fire drum has all the above abilities and can create pyrotechnics once per day."
