    "text": "This mummified dwarf hand hangs on a steel chain around a character\u0027s neck, bringing the wearer more in tune with the earth beneath her feet. If the wearer spends a standard action concentrating on the hand, she gains tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet until the start of her next turn. This ability only allows her to sense creatures and objects that are in contact with earth or stone."
