    "text": "This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A quenching weapon thrust into a non-magical fire of Medium size or smaller extinguishes it. When used against a creature of the fire subtype, it deals an extra 1d6 points of damage. The wielder of a quenching weapon receives a +2 competence bonus on saving throws against fire-based effects, and the weapon itself is immune to fire damage."
