    "text": "This resplendent suit of +3 full plate shimmers and shifts between all the colors of the rainbow. A single color dominates the others at any given time. As a swift action, the wearer can change the dominant color. This color remains dominant until the wearer changes it again. When the wearer of prismatic plate is struck by a prismatic spray, or when he passes through a prismatic sphere or prismatic wall, he ignores the effect that matches the dominant armor color. He receives no special protection against the other colors of those spells. In addition to this benefit, each color provides a unique type of protection.",
