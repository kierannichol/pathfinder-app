ËA ghost touch weapon deals damage normally against incorporeal creatures, regardless of its bonus. An incorporeal creatureâ€™s 50% reduction in damage from corporeal sources does not apply to attacks made against it with ghost touch weapons. The weapon can be picked up and moved by an incorporeal creature at any time. A manifesting ghost can wield the weapon against corporeal foes. Essentially, a ghost touch weapon counts as both corporeal or incorporeal.
