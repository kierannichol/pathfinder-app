    "text": "This suit of +4 greater shadow greater slick leather armor fits as snugly as a tight suit of silk against its wearer\u0027s skin and harbors an amoral and bloodthirsty intelligence. Via the telepathy it shares with its wielder, the armor gives constant advice on how to be stealthy, reach out of the way spots, and get the drop on foes. It also grants an extra +1d6 points of sneak attack damage, but the wearer must already have the sneak attack class feature to gain this bonus. Furthermore the armor has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +10 and no arcane spell failure.",
