    "text": "Shaped like a fist, this iron amulet is surrounded by a frigid fog. On command, this amulet causes the wearer\u0027s hands to become encased in a layer of freezing iron. The wearer is protected from the frigid cold and can make savage blows with his hands. Unarmed strikes and natural attacks the wearer makes with hands gain the frost weapon special ability and are treated as cold iron for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The wearer\u0027s hands become rigid while using this amulet and cannot be use to hold or manipulate objects (unless that manipulation could be accomplished with a club and is not damaged by cold). The transformation can be ended as a swift action."
