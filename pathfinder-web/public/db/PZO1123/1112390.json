    "text": "When rubbed vigorously into the skin, this potent red liniment enhances a Tiny or smaller creature\u0027s ability to make full use of its size and mobility. Applying a dose of liniment is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity (similar to applying an oil). A creature under the effects of the liniment no longer provokes attacks of opportunity for moving through threatened squares or for entering a larger creature\u0027s square. The balm lasts for 5 minutes before its effects wear off. A newly created bottle of balm holds 5 doses."
