    "text": "The lash of the howler is a +1 vicious scorpion whip tipped with quills torn from a howler\u0027s mane. Each time a creature takes damage from the lash of the howler, it must succeed at a DC 14 Reflex save or a quill breaks off and lodges in its flesh. The whip instantly sprouts a new quill to replace the one lost. The quill leaves the target sickened until it is removed. Removing a single quill from a creature requires a DC 15 Heal check made as a full-round action. For every 5 by which the check is exceeded, one additional quill can be removed. On a failed check, a quill is still removed but the process deals 1d4+1 points of damage to the victim."
