    "text": "This +1 light wooden shield has a leather strip on the back on which a spellcaster can scribe a single spell as on a scroll. A spell so scribed requires half the normal cost in raw materials. The strip cannot accommodate spells of higher than 3rd level. The strip is reusable.\nA random caster\u0027s shield has a 50% chance of having a single medium scroll spell on it. The spell is divine (01–80 on d%) or arcane (81–100). A caster\u0027s shield has a 5% arcane spell failure chance. The price of the shield is modified by the value of the scroll spell if one is currently scribed."
