Should anyone bite into it (even a small taste), he must make an immediate DC 19 Will saving throw or fall into an eternal slumber as though by the witch\u0027s grand hex of the same name. The victim can only be awakened by a casting of break enchantment, limited wish, wish, or miracle, or by a kiss from someone of royal blood."
