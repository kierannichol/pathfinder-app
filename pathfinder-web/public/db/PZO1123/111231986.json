    "text": "This is an ironhandled version of a scholar\u0027s brush with a sharpened handle. Though it does little damage, it is easily concealed (you gain a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal an iron brush on your body) and can be thrown short distances, or used to jab at key nerve clusters and acupuncture points to surprisingly devastating effect.",
