Three times per day as a free action, the lion\u0027s head can be commanded to attack (independently of the shield wearer), biting with the wielder\u0027s base attack bonus (including multiple attacks, if the wielder has them) and dealing 2d6 points of damage. This attack is in addition to any actions performed by the wielder."
