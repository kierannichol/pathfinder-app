    "text": "This stout, dense rod is always constructed of highly conductive metal, shot through with weblike veins of white or yellow glass. While a creature holds a conduit rod, she gains electricity resistance 5 as a constant effect as well as a +1 bonus to her effective caster level when casting any spell with the electricity descriptor.\nOnce per day as a free action, when the wielder of a conduit rod casts a spell with the electricity descriptor, she can teleport anywhere that spell\u0027s effect, but is otherwise unaffected by the spell."
