    "text": "This armor is often sculpted with unholy symbols. Once per day on command, the wearer can invoke an effect, as per the spell righteous might, lasting for 10 rounds. Unrighteous armor is always aligned toward evil (negative energy), for the effects of righteous might. Unrighteous armor bestows one permanent negative level on any good creature attempting to wear it. The negative level remains as long as the armor is worn and disappears when it is removed. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the armor is worn."
