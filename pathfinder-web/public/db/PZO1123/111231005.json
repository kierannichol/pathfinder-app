    "text": "The wearer of these slippers may walk on air (as the spell air walk) for up to 10 minutes per day, which may be used in 1-minute increments and requires no action to activate. However, she may only walk on air within or on top of natural or magical mist or fog, including fog-like gases such as those created by acid fog, cloudkill, incendiary cloud, or stinking cloud. Walking on top of such clouds carries no danger for the wearer, but walking through the cloud has its normal effect."
