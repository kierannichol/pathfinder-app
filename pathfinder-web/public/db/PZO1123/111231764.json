    "text": "This snug leather hood has built-in goggles and a filtration tube containing sponges. A filter hood uses your helm slot and imposes a –2 penalty on hearing- and sight-based Perception checks. While the sponges are moist, the hood grants you a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against inhaled poisons and other airborne attacks that require you to breathe them. Moistening the sponges with water is a standard action. The sponges dry out after 1d4 × 10 minutes and should be thoroughly rinsed after each use."
