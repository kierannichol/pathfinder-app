    "text": "This tall, teapotlike device contains a small chamber for coffee grounds and a large chamber for water, connected by a small tube. Heating the pot forces boiling water through the tube and into the grounds. A glass knob at the top of the tube allows you to see the color of the brew and stop when it is sufficiently strong. It can brew up to 4 cups of coffee at a time. It can also be used to make tea, steep medicinal herbs, or just boil water."
