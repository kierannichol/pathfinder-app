    "text": "This pistol acts as a normal +2 pistol, but it has a strange aversion to talk of peace. Anytime the wielder or an ally within line of sight that the wielder can hear attempts to improve a creature\u0027s initial attitude with the Diplomacy skill, without spending an action, the pistol leaps into the wielder\u0027s hand and takes a single shot at the creature the wielder or ally is using Diplomacy against. If the wielder or ally is attempting to affect multiple creatures, the gun shoots a random member of the group. This occurs even if the pistol is unloaded, as the pistol\u0027s curse magically loads itself with a normal bullet and black powder when the action is taken."
