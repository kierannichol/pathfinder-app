    "text": "These heavy and overlapping layers of clothing, coupled with a wide hat outfitted with a dense, veil-like netting around its brim, makes it all but impossible for Diminutive and Fine creatures to make physical contact with your body. Wearing a swarmsuit cuts your speed in half, but gives you DR 10/— against swarms of Fine creatures and DR 5/— against swarms of Diminutive creatures."
