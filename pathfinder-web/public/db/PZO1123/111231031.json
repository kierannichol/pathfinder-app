    "text": "This item appears to be a normal cloak, with a pattern very similar to a major cloak of displacement nocturnal designs, but when worn its magical properties distort and warp light waves. This displacement works similar to the blur spell, granting a 20% miss chance on attacks against the wearer. It functions continually."
