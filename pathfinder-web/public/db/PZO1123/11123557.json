    "text": "This cursed scrying device is at first glance indistinguishable from a normal crystal ball. However, anyone attempting to use the scrying device becomes fascinated for 1d6 minutes, and a telepathic suggestion is implanted in her mind (Will DC 19 negates).\nThe user of the device believes that she viewed the desired creature or scene through the ball, but she actually came under the influence of a powerful wizard, lich, or even some power or being from another plane. Each further use brings the crystal hypnosis ballâ€˜s gazer deeper under the influence of the controller, either as a servant or a tool. Note that throughout this time, the user remains unaware of her subjugation."
