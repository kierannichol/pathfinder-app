    "text": "This +1 unholy scorpion whip (Ultimate Combat 144) is fashioned from skin flayed from a barbed devil\u0027s back. It grants its wielder a +5 competence bonus on Intimidate checks. A shaken creature struck by the hellscourge must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or become frightened for 1 round. A frightened or panicked creature struck must instead save or cower for 1d4 rounds. Both of these are mind-affecting fear effects.\nIf wielded by a person who wears hamatula hide armor, the hellscourge functions as a +1 flaming unholy whip. Such a wielder can lash the whip once per day to hurl flames as a scorching ray (creating two rays); doing so extinguishes the whip\u0027s flames until the next day."
