    "text": "This pair of hinged metal plates is decorated with studs to add texture to the pastry cakes you cook with it. You pour batter on it, close it, and place it on a fire or stove to cook. Some waffle irons have plates that imprint the waffle with a noble\u0027s coat of arms, a religious symbol, or a country\u0027s flag. A mithral waffle iron almost always bears a specific insignia rather than the generic waffle pattern. As with other mithral cookware, food rarely sticks to a mithral waffle iron."
