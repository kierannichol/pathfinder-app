    "text": "This shortbow is beautifully made and inlaid with iridescent designs, appearing to be a +2 shortbow. When it fires its arrows, though, it does it with so much force that the arrows are always broken on either a hit or a miss. This bow must be used as its owner\u0027s primary ranged weapon and can only be discarded after the owner is subject to a remove curse spell or similar effect."
