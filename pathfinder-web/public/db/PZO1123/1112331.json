    "text": "This 4-inch-square cloth pocket has no powers unless it is sewn onto a garment (which takes 1d4 minutes). Once sewn, it changes its appearance to match the garment. Any magic item inside it cannot be magically detected, as if protected by magic aura. Hiding an item in the pocket gives the garment\u0027s wearer a +5 competence bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal the item. The pocket can be removed from the garment with a DC 10 Heal check or an appropriate Craft check such as Craft (cloth) or Craft (leather); failing this roll by 5 or more gives the pocket the broken condition."
