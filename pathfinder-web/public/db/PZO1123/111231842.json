    "text": "This vicious-looking +2 battleaxe grants its wielder the Great Cleave feat. But when using this feat, the wielder makes an additional attack against a random adjacent creature instead of choosing which creature to attack. When determining which creature is attacked, the wielder always counts himself as a possible target, even if he is not adjacent to the target. The wielder of a biting battleaxe must always uses it as his primary weapon and must use Great Cleave at every opportunity until subject to a remove curse spell or similar effect."
