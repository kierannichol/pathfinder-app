    "text": "This fine, red leather sheath is decorated with gold filigree. It fits any bladed slashing weapon. While worn, a scabbard of stanching protects against bleed damage. Anytime the wearer suffers a bleed effect, the scabbard automatically stanches it. It has no effect on bleed damage from effects that require a DC 16 or higher caster level or Heal check."
