    "text": "This heavy blade has a convex curve near the end, making its overall shape similar to that of a battleaxe. A typical khopesh is 20 to 24 inches in length. Its curved shape allows the wielder to hook around defenses and trip foes. The elegant shape of a khopesh leads some artisans to cover them in ornate decorations.",
