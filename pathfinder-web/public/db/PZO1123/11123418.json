    "text": "This jagged bone knife seems too thin and frail for combat but easily cuts flesh. If used to perform a coup de grace on a helpless living creature and the creature dies from the attack, the creature\u0027s flesh begins to peel off and its bones animate as a skeleton under the command of the bearer of the razor. The creature\u0027s flesh is not destroyed, but decays at a steady rate. The bearer of the razor can spend 1 minute reattaching the flesh to the animate skeleton, which ends the necromantic magic and results in a normal corpse (though a corpse of a person killed or mutilated by knife wounds). If the bearer uses the razor to flense and animate another creature\u0027s bones, the previous animate skeleton is immediately destroyed."
