    "text": "Armor and shields with this special ability excel at blocking the attacks of certain types of creatures, similar to a bane weapon’s excelling against certain foes. Against the designated foe, the item’s enhancement bonus to AC is +2 better than its actual bonus and provides DR 2/— against attacks from that foe. This increase in enhancement bonus applies only to the armor or shield’s enhancement bonus, not to temporary bonuses (such as the magic vestment spell). To randomly determine the armor or shield’s designated foe, use the table for the bane weapon special ability (page 136)."
