    "text": "A gloom chymist is skilled at mixing potent concoctions known as glooms, which are infused with shadow energy. A gloom is identical to a bomb except that it deals 1d6 points of cold damage + additional damage equal to the gloom chymist\u0027s Intelligence modifier. This damage increases by 1d6 for every 2 alchemist levels beyond 1st the gloom chymist has. A gloom does not qualify as a bomb for the purposes of feats or discoveries."
