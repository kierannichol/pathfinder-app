    "text": "A touch from your hand, which is engulfed in darkness, disrupts a creature\u0027s vision by coating its eyes in supernatural darkness. Each touch causes the target to become blinded for 1 round unless it makes a successful Fortitude saving throw. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per caster level. Any touch attack not used after 1 round per caster level is lost."
