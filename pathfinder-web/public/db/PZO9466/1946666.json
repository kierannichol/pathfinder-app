    "text": "You create a mobile area of bright light centered on one target while simultaneously suppressing other light sources surrounding it. The light level in the target\u0027s space increases to bright light, causing the target to take any penalties that it would normally take in bright light. In addition, all mundane light sources (and magic light sources of 3rd spell level or lower) within 20 feet of the target\u0027s space are suppressed, shedding no light as long as they remain within this spell\u0027s affected area and reverting the area normally affected by those light sources to their unmodified illumination levels."
