    "text": "You ward an area\u0027s shadows such that light cannot penetrate them. The illumination level in the affected area no longer changes when nonmagical light enters it. Any magical effect must succeed at a caster level check (DC \u003d 10 + your caster level) in order to change the light level within the spell\u0027s radius. Darkvault has no effect on spells or effects that would make the spell\u0027s area darker.",
