    "text": "You infuse the target mindless undead creature with power drawn from the Shadow Plane, immediately granting it the advanced creature simple template. It gains a +2 bonus on all rolls, including damage rolls, a +2 bonus to special ability DCs, a +4 bonus to AC and CMD, and 2 additional hit points per Hit Die. The undead creature\u0027s destructive instincts take hold for the duration of this spell, and any attempts to control or command the undead creature have a 50% chance of failing; if uncontrolled, the undead creature attacks any living creatures it sees. This spell has no effect on undead creatures that already have the advanced creature template."
