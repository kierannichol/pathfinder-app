    "text": "This spell functions like shadow transmutation, except it can mimic greater polymorph instead of polymorph. The illusory attacks and special abilities of any shape assumed using greater shadow transmutation deal three-fifths (60%) damage to nonbelievers, and nondamaging effects are 60% likely to work against nonbelievers."
