    "text": "You animate the target\u0027s shadow with semi-living energies drawn from the Shadow Plane, instilling a maddening hunger for its owner\u0027s life energy within it. If the target fails its Will save, it takes 1d4 points of Strength damage as a quasi-real shadow manifests in its space and attacks it. This shadow remains attached to the target and moves wherever the target moves."
