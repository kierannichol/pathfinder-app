    "text": "You attach strands of aether to everything your telekinesis touches. Any time you damage a creature using your telekinetic blast, as long as that creature doesnâ€™t use a teleportation effect, you can see that creature at any distance as if using blindsight until the end of your next turn. Immediately after damaging a creature, You can accept 1 point of burn to strengthen the strands of aether attached to that creature, increasing the duration of the touchsight on that creature to 1 round per kineticist level."
