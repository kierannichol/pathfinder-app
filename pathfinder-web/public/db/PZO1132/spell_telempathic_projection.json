You can instead use this spell to assist your own or an ally\u0027s Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Perform, or Sense Motive check, granting that check a +5 insight bonus against the target of your telempathic projection with no save. In this case, the spell\u0027s duration expires immediately when the skill check is complete.",
