    "text": "This small but thick booklet contains information on a specific form of folk divination, such as cartomancy, cheiromancy, crystallomancy, or horoscopy. Using such a book while reading a creature\u0027s fortune reduces the time needed to read that fortune by 2 minutes. When used as part of a Sense Motive check for the prognostication occult skill unlock, this book grants a +2 circumstance bonus. If the fortunetelling method requires a particular item, such as a deck of cards for cartomancy or animal bones for osteomancy, that item provides a +2 circumstance bonus that doesn\u0027t stack with the bonus provided by the prognostication manual.\nA prognostication manual is useful primarily for cheiromancy (palm reading), horoscopy, and other methods that don\u0027t require special equipment."
