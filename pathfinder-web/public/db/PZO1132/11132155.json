    "text": "This normal mirror is roughly 4 feet long and 3 feet wide. It is similar to a mirror of opposition or mirror of life trapping, but it lacks a command word. A mirror of soul snaring has 15 extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or have its soul sucked into one of the compartments. A creature not aware of the cursed nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection and thus needing to attempt the saving throw drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror is cursed and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack).\nWhen a creature\u0027s soul is trapped, its body remains outside of the mirror. The body becomes possessed by a malignant spirit who behaves in a way entirely opposed to how the trapped creature would. Treat this spirit as the creature, with a reversed alignment (and potentially other factors reversed, such as being an antipaladin instead of a paladin). In the case of neutral characters, the spirit can be either chaotic evil or lawful good as decided by the GM. The death of the creature\u0027s original body does not free its soul from the mirror, though if it is ever set free, it immediately passes on to the afterlife as it no longer has a body to inhabit.\nIf the mirror\u0027s capacity is exceeded, one victim\u0027s soul (determined randomly) is set free and immediately reconnects with its duplicate body if available. If the mirror is destroyed (hardness 1, 5 hit points), all victims currently trapped in it are freed. Unless the mirror is destroyed, not even a miracle or wish can restore the trapped creature\u0027s spirit to its body."
