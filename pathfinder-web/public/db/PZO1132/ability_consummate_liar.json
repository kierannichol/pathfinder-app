In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the Improved Feint and Greater Feint feats, even if he doesnâ€™t have Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint."
