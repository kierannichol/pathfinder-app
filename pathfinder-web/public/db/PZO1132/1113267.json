    "text": "These specially charged pieces of parchment come in small packages containing seven sheets. Psychically attuned to the specific magnetic fluids a living creature needs to part the ethereal veil, these sheets add a 5% bonus to the chance of creating meaningful writing for the automatic writing occult skill unlock. This use consumes one sheet of the paper, and only one sheet can be used per attempt."
