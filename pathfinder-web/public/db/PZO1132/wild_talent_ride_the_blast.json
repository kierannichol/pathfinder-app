    "text": "You can use this wild talent as part of activating a kinetic blast other than telekinetic blast. You transform yourself into your element or energy and send yourself along with your kinetic blast. You appear at the end of the blast’s path, adjacent to the blast’s target (or final target, for form infusions like chain) or at the center of the burst or spread for form infusions like explosion. This ability doesn’t work with form infusions that involve melee attacks (such as kinetic blade) or that use a cone shape (such as spray)."
