A masterwork or magic sword could seem to be a useless, rusting, discarded blade, and a luxurious throne could appear to be a decrepit wooden chair. If used against an attended object, the wielder can immediately attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. Decrepit disguise counters and dispels quintessence.",
