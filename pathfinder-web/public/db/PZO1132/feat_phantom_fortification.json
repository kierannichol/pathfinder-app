      "Benefit": "Your phantom has a 50% chance of ignoring critical hits and precision-based damage when fully manifested in its ectoplasmic form, as if wearing armor with the moderate fortification special ability. This doesn\u0027t stack with other similar effects, and doesn\u0027t apply against attacks made with ghost touch weapons or weaponlike constructs made of force (such as a clenched fist, mage\u0027s sword, or spiritual weapon)."
