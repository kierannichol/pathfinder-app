    "text": "You create a mental block in the target\u0027s mind, impeding the flow of his mental spellcasting process and forcing him to incorporate a thought component into any spell or spell-like ability he uses. This is in addition to any other components the spell already requires, and doesn\u0027t replace the verbal component. Spell-like abilities require this thought component, even though they normally don\u0027t need spell components.",
