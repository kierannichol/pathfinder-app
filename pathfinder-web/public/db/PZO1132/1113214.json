    "text": "When glimpsed out of the corner of the eye, the beatific expression of this child\u0027s rag doll twists into a malignant grin. The doll feeds off of violent emotion and anger. Each time anger flares or battle rages within 20 feet of the doll, there is a 5% chance the malevolent spirit within the doll awakens, manifesting as an advanced poltergeist (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 292, 211). When this happens, the doll becomes incorporeal and floats into the air, the poltergeist\u0027s malevolent spirit invisibly surrounding it. The poltergeist\u0027s site bond ability is tied to the space it spawned in, and it immediately attacks those around it. When the poltergeist is slain, the doll turns corporeal again and falls to the ground, its spirit quelled for the time being. The spirit within the doll can be questioned using the call spirit spell.\nOwning a haunted doll leads to troubled dreams for the possessor, full of seemingly prophetic warnings of doom. Each night, there is a 10% chance that the owner needs to attempt a DC 20 Will save. On a failure, the owner gains no rest for the night and can\u0027t recover spells, pools, or other daily abilities."
