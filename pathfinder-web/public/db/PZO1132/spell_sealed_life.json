    "text": "You seal the life force within the target, preventing it from sharing its vitality with others. Affected creatures can\u0027t transfer damage to or from another, such as through shield other, a spiritualist\u0027s life bond, or a summoner\u0027s life link. Effects such as vampiric touch that steal vitality from others deal damage normally, but provide no benefits."
