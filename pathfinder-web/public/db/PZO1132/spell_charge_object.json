    "text": "You charge an item with minor psychic energy. The item can be detected by the detect psychic significance spell. If you wish, you can imprint the item with your ownership history. Spells such as object reading and uses of the psychometry occult skill unlock (see page 196) can reveal any information about yourself you impart into the object, including your name, alignment, profession, and a summary of your experiences with the item. You can\u0027t impart false information into the object, but you can omit any details you\u0027d prefer not to divulge. If the target object is already psychically charged, you can add more information to it, but you can\u0027t use charge object to erase existing psychic information.",
