    "text": "This metal gauntlet is the sort appropriate for wearing with chainmail, though versions suited for leather or full plate exist. Affixed to the wrist is a white cloth with a longsword embroidered in gold thread. Once per day, the wearer can speak a command word to give a weapon the wearer holds in that hand (or the gauntlet itself) a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls for 1 minute. An Inheritor\u0027s gauntlet uses up the wearer\u0027s entire hands slot; the wearer can not use another item (even another Inheritor\u0027s gauntlet) that also uses the hands slot, though a matching nonmagical gauntlet is often worn on the other hand.\nIf Iomedae is the wearer\u0027s patron, the gauntlet lets the wearer use any sword he holds in that hand as a holy symbol. Once per day, the wearer can speak a command word and give any sword he holds the powers of an evil outsider-bane weapon for 1 minute; this effect ends if the wearer drops the sword or removes the gauntlet. If the wearer uses a finger to draw Iomedae\u0027s symbol on any solid surface, the symbol glows as brightly as a candle for 1 hour or until the wearer draws the symbol elsewhere (whichever comes first)."
