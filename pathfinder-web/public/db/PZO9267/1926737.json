    "text": "This 8-foot length of corroded, broken chain is threaded with a leather strap to hold it together; it is worn like a belt and must be tied in place, as it lacks a buckle. Once per day, the wearer can call upon its power to summon an evil creature from the summon monster I list; the creature attacks the wearer\u0027s enemies if any are present, but it is not under the wearer\u0027s control and attacks the wearer or the wearer\u0027s allies if there are no more enemies to kill.\nIf Rovagug is the wearer\u0027s patron, the wearer can gain the benefits of a rage spell once per day by speaking the god\u0027s name. If the wearer is ever bound, shackled, or otherwise rendered helpless while still conscious, this rage ability automatically activates if the wearer hasn\u0027t already used it that day."
