    "text": "This drab gray cloak billows about as if blown by an invisible wind. Once per day, the wearer can use doom, which causes a deathlike shadow to fleetingly cross the wearer\u0027s face.\nIf Groetus is the wearer\u0027s patron, once per day the wearer can use false life. If the wearer successfully delivers a coup de grace against a dying foe while false life is active, the wearer\u0027s temporary hit points from the false life effect increase by 1 (to a maximum of 20 temporary hit points). The dying creature must have at least as many Hit Dice as the wearer for this effect to occur."
