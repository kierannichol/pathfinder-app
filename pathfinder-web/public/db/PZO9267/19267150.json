The gore attack uses the creature\u0027s base attack bonus, and the creature gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the gore attack. The gore attack deals a number of points of damage equal to 1d6 + Strength modifier if the target is Small, 1d8 + Strength modifier if the target is Medium, and 2d6 + Strength modifier if the target is Large or larger."
