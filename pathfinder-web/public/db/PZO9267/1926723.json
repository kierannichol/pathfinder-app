    "text": "This impossibly hard, lumpy piece of unforged iron originates from metal that remained cool after smeltingâ€”ore that resisted all attempts to forge it into another shape. Worshipers of Gorum believe this metal is a reflection of their god\u0027s unrelenting determination, and often fashion this \"stubborn iron\" into a pendant, though it is sometimes used as a mace head or as a counterweight to a greatsword or another large weapon instead. While wearing a Shad\u0027Gorum nugget around the neck, the wearer gains fire resistance 1 and a +1 resistance bonus on Will saving throws.\nIf Gorum is the wearer\u0027s patron, the wearer can use chill metal once per day. At will, the wearer can mend small metallic items as if using a mending spell."
