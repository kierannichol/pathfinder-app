The wearer gains a luck bonus or penalty equal to 1d6–3 on Craft checks to make armor or weapons while wearing it. This bonus or penalty is determined the first time the wearer attempts such a Craft check to determine a day\u0027s progress. If the wearer removes the armor, this bonus or penalty persists for an additional 24 hours. Once per day, the wearer can use magic weapon.",
