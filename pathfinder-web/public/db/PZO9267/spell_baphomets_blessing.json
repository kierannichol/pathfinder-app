    "text": "You change the target\u0027s head into that of a bull. The creature\u0027s Intelligence becomes 2, and it gains a gore melee attack that it can use as a primary or secondary attack. The gore attack uses the creature\u0027s base attack bonus, and the creature gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the gore attack. The gore attack deals a number of points of damage equal to 1d6 + Strength modifier if the target is Small, 1d8 + Strength modifier if the target is Medium, and 2d6 + Strength modifier if the target is Large or larger.",
