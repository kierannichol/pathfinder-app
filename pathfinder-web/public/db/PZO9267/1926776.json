Once per day, the wearer can speak a command word to cause the cape to transform into a cloud of butterflies or moths. This functions as cape of wasps, except the swarm doesn\u0027t deal poison damage and deals full damage to incorporeal creatures. In addition, the wearer can use glitterdust once per day."
