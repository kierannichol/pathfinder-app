    "text": "Upon striking a piece of solid ground with the spell\u0027s focus or a holy symbol, you let out a wave of energy that repairs items within its burst. All objects or constructs within the burst are repaired of 1d6 points of damage per level. When this spell affects constructs, the spell bypasses any immunity to magic as if the spell did not allow spell resistance."
