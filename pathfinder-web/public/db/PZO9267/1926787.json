    "text": "This +1 bitter leather armor looks much like a blacksmith\u0027s apron or an alchemist\u0027s smock, and has many small pockets suitable for holding extracts, potions, or poisons. Once per day, the wearer can use negate aroma (lasting 1 hour). This effect suspends the armor\u0027s bitter special ability if used on the wearer. Once per day, the wearer can pull a tanglefoot bag from one of the apron\u0027s pockets, although the bag crumbles into dust if it is not used within 1 minute.",
