  "benefit": "Whenever you score a critical hit, your opponent becomes staggered for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful Fortitude save reduces the duration to 1 round. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. The effects of this feat do not stack. Additional hits instead add to the duration.",
  "special": "You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess Critical Mastery.",
