Whenever the {@class_1} uses lay on hands to heal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effects from all of the mercies possessed by the {@class_1}. A mercy can remove a condition caused by a curse, disease, or poison without curing the affliction. Such conditions return after 1 hour unless the mercy actually removes the affliction that causes the condition.

At 3rd level, the {@class_1} can select from the following initial mercies.
- _Deceived_: The target can immediately attempt a new saving throw to disbelieve any ongoing illusions that it failed to disbelieve within the last minute. Source PPC:HH
- _Fatigued_: The target is no longer fatigued.
- _Riled_: The {@class_1}â€™s lay on hands also acts as calm emotions, but only for the purpose of suppressing morale bonuses (such as from the rage spell) and emotion effects that arenâ€™t fear effects. Use the {@class_1}â€™s level as the caster level. Source PPC:HH
- _Shaken_: The target is no longer shaken.
- _Sickened_: The target is no longer sickened.

At 6th level, a {@class_1} adds the following mercies to the list of those that can be selected.
- _Dazed_: The target is no longer dazed.
- _Diseased_: The {@class_1}â€™s lay on hands ability also acts as remove disease, using the {@class_1}â€™s level as the caster level.
- _Enfeebled_: The {@class_1} dispels any magical effects that are reducing one of the targetâ€™s ability scores ({@class_1}â€™s choice). Source PPC:HH
- _Haunted_: The {@class_1}â€™s lay on hands also acts as protection from evil, but only for the purpose of allowing a new saving throw against enchantment (charm) and enchantment (compulsion) effects, making the target immune to any attempts to possess or exercise mental control over the target, or preventing a life force from controlling the target (all as described in the second effect of protection from evil). Use the {@class_1}â€™s level as the caster level. Source PPC:HH
- _Staggered_: The target is no longer staggered, unless the target is at exactly 0 hit points.
- _Targeted_: The {@class_1}â€™s lay on hands also acts as sanctuary, using the {@class_1}â€™s level as the caster level. The saving throw DC to negate this effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the {@class_1}â€™s level + the {@class_1}â€™s Charisma modifier. Source PPC:HH

At 9th level, a {@class_1} adds the following mercies to the list of those that can be selected.
- _Confused_: The target is no longer confused. Source PPC:HH
- _Cursed_: The {@class_1}â€™s lay on hands ability also acts as remove curse, using the {@class_1}â€™s level as the caster level.
- _Exhausted_: The target is no longer exhausted. The {@class_1} must have the fatigue mercy before selecting this mercy.
- _Frightened_: The target is no longer frightened. The {@class_1} must have the shaken mercy before selecting this mercy.
- _Injured_: The target gains fast healing 3 for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the {@class_1}â€™s level. Source PPC:HH
- _Nauseated_: The target is no longer nauseated. The {@class_1} must have the sickened mercy before selecting this mercy.
- _Poisoned_: The {@class_1}â€™s lay on hands ability also acts as neutralize poison, using the {@class_1}â€™s level as the caster level.
- _Restorative_: The target heals 1d4 points of ability damage from a single ability score of the {@class_1}â€™s choosing. The {@class_1} must have the enfeebled mercy before selecting this mercy. Source PPC:HH

At 12th level, a {@class_1} adds the following mercies to the list of those that can be selected.
- _Amputated_: The {@class_1}â€™s lay on hands also acts as regenerate, but only for the purposes of regrowing severed body members, broken bones, and ruined organs. The {@class_1} must have the injured mercy before she can select this mercy. Source PPC:HH
- _Blinded_: The target is no longer blinded.
- _Deafened_: The target is no longer deafened.
- _Ensorcelled_: The {@class_1}â€™s lay on hands also acts as dispel magic, using the {@class_1}â€™s level as her caster level (maximum 20). Source PPC:HH
- _Paralyzed_: The target is no longer paralyzed.
- _Petrified_: The {@class_1}â€™s lay on hands ability also acts as stone to flesh, but only for the purpose of removing the petrified condition from a creature. Source PPC:HH
- _Stunned_: The target is no longer stunned.

These abilities are cumulative. For example, a 12th-level {@class_1}â€™s lay on hands ability heals 6d6 points of damage and might also cure Fatigued and Exhausted conditions as well as removing diseases and neutralizing poisons. Once a condition or spell effect is chosen, it canâ€™t be changed.
