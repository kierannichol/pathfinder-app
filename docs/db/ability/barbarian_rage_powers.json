  "description": "As a {@class_1} gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at {@level} level, a {@class_1} gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of {@class_1} attained after 2nd level. A {@class_1} gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the {@class_1} to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a {@class_1} cannot select an individual power more than once.\n\nAny {@class_1} who meets the powers’ prerequisites can select and use rage powers. Totem rage powers grant powers related to a theme. A {@class_1} cannot select from more than one group of totem rage powers; for example, a {@class_1} who selects a beast totem rage power cannot later choose to gain any of the dragon totem rage powers (any rage power with “dragon totem” in its title)."
