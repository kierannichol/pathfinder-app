paladin:divine_bondDivine Bond"â8Upon reaching 5th level, a {@class_1} forms a divine bond with her god. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.

The first type of bond allows the {@class_1} to enhance her weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a celestial spirit for 1 minute per {@class_1} level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: axiomatic, brilliant energy, defending, disruption, flaming, flaming burst, holy, keen, merciful, and speed. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the propertyâ€™s cost (see Table: Melee Weapon Special Abilities). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the {@class_1} but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the {@class_1}. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. A {@class_1} can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.

If a weapon bonded with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the {@class_1} loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the {@class_1} takes a â€“1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.

The second type of bond allows a {@class_1} to gain the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve her in her crusade against evil. This mount is usually a heavy horse (for a Medium {@class_1}) or a pony (for a Small {@class_1}), although more exotic mounts, such as a boar, camel, or dog are also suitable. This mount functions as a druidâ€™s animal companion, using the {@class_1}â€™s level as her effective druid level. Bonded mounts have an Intelligence of at least 6.

In addition to horses, a {@class_1} may select (at the GMâ€™s discretion) some less ordinary creatures.

A Medium {@class_1} can select an elkPPC:WO, giant seahorsePPC:WO, giraffePPC:WO, yakPZO1140 or zebraPZO1140 as a bonded mount.

A Small {@class_1} can select an antelopePPC:WO, capybaraPZO1140, eohippusPZO1140, giant weaselPPC:WO, ramPPC:WO, reindeerPZO1140, stagPPC:WO, or wolfdogPZO1140 as a bonded mount.

The auspice, bodyguard, racer, and totem guide archetypes are all particularly appropriate for a {@class_1}â€™s bonded mount.

Once per day, as a full-round action, a {@class_1} may magically call her mount to her side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the {@class_1}â€™s level. The mount immediately appears adjacent to the {@class_1}. A {@class_1} can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level.

At 11th level, the mount gains the celestial creature simple template and becomes a magical beast for the purposes of determining which spells affect it.

At 15th level, a {@class_1}â€™s mount gains spell resistance equal to the {@class_1}â€™s level + 11.

Should the {@class_1}â€™s mount die, the {@class_1} may not summon another mount for 30 days or until she gains a {@class_1} level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the {@class_1} takes a â€“1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.

Divine Bond Variants (Optional)
Source: Pathfinder Player Companion: Healerâ€™s Handbook

Although all {@class_1}s commune with divine forces and celestial spirits, some are able to do so in ways that transcend the typical martial blessing or celestial servitor.

When a {@class_1} gains the divine bond class feature, she can choose one of the following variant divine bonds instead of those outlined by her class. All variant divine bonds are supernatural abilities, and a {@class_1} cannot choose a variant divine bond if she has an archetype that alters or replaces divine bond.

Agathion Bond: As a standard action, the {@class_1} can call forth an agathion spirit that bonds to her healing hands for 1 minute per {@class_1} level, causing her to manifest physical traits evocative of one kind of agathion. This bond allows the {@class_1} to add her Charisma bonus to the amount of hit points that she restores with her spells, her lay on hands ability, and her channel energy ability. For every 3 levels beyond 5th, she restores 1 additional hit point with those abilities, up to a maximum of 5 + her Charisma modifier at 20th level. The {@class_1} can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 5th, up to a total of four times per day at 17th level.

Angelic Bond: As a standard action, the {@class_1} can call forth an angel spirit that bonds to her, causing her to manifest a resplendent halo. This bond allows the {@class_1} to shine light as per continual flame for 1 minute per {@class_1} level. Additionally, while the halo shines, all allies within 20 feet gain the benefits of protection from evil, except the deflection and resistance bonuses are +3. For every 3 levels she has beyond 5th, the deflection bonus and resistance bonus provided by this effect increases by 1, up to a maximum of +8 at 20th level. The {@class_1} can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 5th, up to a total of four times per day at 17th level.

Archon Bond: As a standard action, the {@class_1} can call forth an archon spirit that bonds to her brow, causing her eyes to glow with righteous fury for 1 minute per {@class_1} level. While this bond is active, any hostile creature within a 10-foot radius of the {@class_1} that looks at her must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 her {@class_1} level + her Charisma modifier) or take a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws and to AC for 24 hours. Whether or not the saving throw is successful, a creature cannot be affected by the same {@class_1}â€™s archon bond again for 24 hours, and the penalties from multiple archon bonds donâ€™t stack. Creatures that donâ€™t have eyesight are not affected by this ability. For every 3 levels beyond 5th, the radius of the {@class_1}â€™s archon bond increases by 5 feet, up to a 35-foot radius at 20th level. The {@class_1} can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 5th, up to a total of four times per day at 17th level.
