She cannot be caught Flat-Footed, nor does she lose her Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A {@class_1} with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint Action (see Combat) against her.
