  description: "For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the\
    \ fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls\
    \ know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are\
    \ not soldiers or professional warriors--they are the battle possessed, creatures\
    \ of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know\
    \ little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the\
    \ moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the\
    \ next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to\
    \ danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors\
    \ might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies\
    \ embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians\
    \ storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage. Role:\
    \ Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to\
    \ take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness\
    \ and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into\
    \ battle and ruin all who would stand in their way. Alignment: Any non-lawful\

    description: "A bard is trained to use the Perform skill to create magical effects\
      \ on those around him, including himself if desired. He can use this ability\
      \ for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Charisma modifier. At each\
      \ level after 1st a bard can use bardic performance for 2 additional rounds\
      \ per day. Each round, the bard can produce any one of the types of bardic performance\
      \ that he has mastered, as indicated by his level.Starting a bardic performance\
      \ is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action.\
      \ Changing a bardic performance from one effect to another requires the bard\
      \ to stop the previous performance and start a new one as a standard action.\
      \ A bardic performance cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the bard\
      \ is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented\
      \ from taking a free action to maintain it each round. A bard cannot have more\
      \ than one bardic performance in effect at one time.At 7th level, a bard can\
      \ start a bardic performance as a move action instead of a standard action.\
      \ At 13th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a swift action.Each\
      \ bardic performance has audible components, visual components, or both.If a\
      \ bardic performance has audible components, the targets must be able to hear\
      \ the bard for the performance to have any effect, and many such performances\
      \ are language dependent (as noted in the description). A deaf bard has a 20%\
      \ chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with an audible\
      \ component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily\
      \ limit. Deaf creatures are immune to bardic performances with audible components.If\
      \ a bardic performance has a visual component, the targets must have line of\
      \ sight to the bard for the performance to have any effect. A blind bard has\
      \ a 50% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with a visual\
      \ component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily\

    description: "Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin forms a divine bond with her\
      \ god. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot\
      \ be changed.The first type of bond allows the paladin to enhance her weapon\
      \ as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a celestial spirit for 1 minute\
      \ per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed light\
      \ as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus.\
      \ For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement\
      \ bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the\
      \ weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they\
      \ can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: axiomatic, brilliant\
      \ energy, defending, disruption, flaming, flaming burst, holy, keen, merciful,\
      \ and speed. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the\
      \ property's cost (see Table: Melee Weapon Special Abilities). These bonuses\
      \ are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities\
      \ do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus\
      \ must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties\
      \ granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot\
      \ be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts\
      \ no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the paladin but resumes\
      \ giving bonuses if returned to the paladin. These bonuses apply to only one\
      \ end of a double weapon. A paladin can use this ability once per day at 5th\
      \ level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to\
      \ a total of four times per day at 17th level.If a weapon bonded with a celestial\
      \ spirit is destroyed, the paladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days,\
      \ or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period,\
      \ the paladin takes a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.The second\
      \ type of bond allows a paladin to gain the service of an unusually intelligent,\
      \ strong, and loyal steed to serve her in her crusade against evil. This mount\
      \ is usually a heavy horse (for a Medium paladin) or a pony (for a Small paladin),\
      \ although more exotic mounts, such as a boar, camel, or dog are also suitable.\
      \ This mount functions as a druid's animal companion, using the paladin's level\
      \ as her effective druid level. Bonded mounts have an Intelligence of at least\
      \ 6.In addition to horses, a paladin may select (at the GM's discretion) some\
      \ less ordinary creatures.A Medium paladin can select an elkPPC:WO, giant seahorsePPC:WO,\
      \ giraffePPC:WO, yakPZO1140 or zebraPZO1140 as a bonded mount.A Small paladin\
      \ can select an antelopePPC:WO, capybaraPZO1140, eohippusPZO1140, giant weaselPPC:WO,\
      \ ramPPC:WO, reindeerPZO1140, stagPPC:WO, or wolfdogPZO1140 as a bonded mount.The\
      \ auspice, bodyguard, racer, and totem guide archetypes are all particularly\
      \ appropriate for a paladin's bonded mount.Once per day, as a full-round action,\
      \ a paladin may magically call her mount to her side. This ability is the equivalent\
      \ of a spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin's level. The mount immediately\
      \ appears adjacent to the paladin. A paladin can use this ability once per day\
      \ at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels thereafter,\
      \ for a total of four times per day at 17th level.At 11th level, the mount gains\
      \ the celestial creature simple template and becomes a magical beast for the\
      \ purposes of determining which spells affect it.At 15th level, a paladin's\
      \ mount gains spell resistance equal to the paladin's level + 11.Should the\
      \ paladin's mount die, the paladin may not summon another mount for 30 days\
      \ or until she gains a paladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day\
      \ period, the paladin takes a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls."

    \ as being just as unstable, unpredictable, and dangerous as the concoctions he\
    \ brews. While some creators of alchemical items content themselves with sedentary\

    \ answers a deeper calling. Rather than cast magic like a spellcaster, the alchemist\
    \ captures his own magic potential within liquids and extracts he creates, infusing\
    \ his chemicals with virulent power to grant him impressive skill with poisons,\
    \ explosives, and all manner of self-transformative magic. Role: The alchemist's\
    \ reputation is not softened by his exuberance (some would say dangerous recklessness)\
    \ in perfecting his magical extracts and potion-like creations, infusing these\
    \ substances with magic siphoned from his aura and using his own body as experimental\
    \ stock. Nor is it mollified by the alchemist's almost gleeful passion for building\
    \ explosive bombs and discovering strange new poisons and methods for their use.\

      \ to create powerful bombs that they can hurl at their enemies. An alchemist\
      \ can use a number of bombs each day equal to his class level + his Intelligence\
      \ modifier. Bombs are unstable, and if not used in the round they are created,\
      \ they degrade and become inert--their method of creation prevents large volumes\
      \ of explosive material from being created and stored. In order to create a\
      \ bomb, the alchemist must use a small vial containing an ounce of liquid catalyst--the\
      \ alchemist can create this liquid catalyst from small amounts of chemicals\
      \ from an alchemy lab, and these supplies can be readily refilled in the same\
      \ manner as a spellcaster's component pouch. Most alchemists create a number\
      \ of catalyst vials at the start of the day equal to the total number of bombs\
      \ they can create in that day--once created, a catalyst vial remains usable\
      \ by the alchemist for years.Drawing the components of, creating, and throwing\
      \ a bomb requires a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity.\
      \ Thrown bombs have a range of 20 feet and use the Throw Splash Weapon special\
      \ attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such\
      \ as Point-Blank Shot and Weapon Focus. On a direct hit, an alchemist's bomb\
      \ inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage + additional damage equal to the alchemist's\
      \ Intelligence modifier. The damage of an alchemist's bomb increases by 1d6\
      \ points at every odd-numbered alchemist level (this bonus damage is not multiplied\
      \ on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike). Splash damage from\
      \ an alchemist bomb is always equal to the bomb's minimum damage (so if the\
      \ bomb would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage on a direct hit, its splash damage\
      \ would be 6 points of fire damage). Those caught in the splash damage can attempt\
      \ a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the\
      \ alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier.Alchemists can learn\
      \ new types of bombs as discoveries (see the Discovery ability) as they level\
      \ up. An alchemist's bomb, like an extract, becomes inert if used or carried\

      \ to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use\
      \ Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold\
      \ the potion for 1 round to attempt such a check.Like an alchemist, an investigator\
      \ prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical\
      \ power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking\
      \ the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound\
      \ to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such\
      \ their effects can be dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using\
      \ the investigator's level as the caster level.An investigator can create only\
      \ a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment\
      \ of extracts per day is given on Table: Investigator. In addition, he receives\
      \ bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way\
      \ a wizard receives bonus spells per day.When an investigator mixes an extract,\
      \ he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from\
      \ his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the\
      \ investigator's possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping--an\
      \ investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract,\
      \ once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator\
      \ must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of\
      \ work.Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials\
      \ is insignificant--comparable to the valueless material components of most\
      \ spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component\
      \ is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot\
      \ be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate\
      \ divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.An investigator uses the\
      \ alchemist formulae list to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator\
      \ can prepare an extract of any formulae he knows. To learn or use an extract,\
      \ an investigator must have at least an Intelligence score equal to 10 + the\
      \ extract's level. The saving throw DC for an investigator's extract is equal\
      \ to 10 + the extract's level + the investigator's Intelligence modifier.An\
      \ investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a\
      \ special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he\
      \ prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1st-level\
      \ formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his\
      \ Intelligence modifier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula\
      \ for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to\
      \ his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs,\
      \ pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook.\
      \ An investigator can study a wizard's spellbook to learn any formula that is\
      \ equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn\
      \ spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another\
      \ investigator's or an alchemist's formula book (and vice versa). An investigator\
      \ does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae."

    description: "Starting at 4th level, a warpriest can release a wave of energy\

      \ This energy can be used to deal or heal damage, depending on the type of energy\

      \ that expends two uses of his fervor ability and doesn't provoke an attack\
      \ of opportunity. The warpriest must present a holy (or unholy) symbol to use\
      \ this ability. A good warpriest (or one who worships a good deity) channels\
      \ positive energy and can choose to heal living creatures or to deal damage\
      \ to undead creatures. An evil warpriest (or one who worships an evil deity)\
      \ channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures\
      \ or heal undead creatures. A neutral warpriest who worships a neutral deity\
      \ (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) channels positive energy\
      \ if he chose to spontaneously cast cure spells or negative energy if he chose\
      \ to spontaneously cast inflict spells.Channeling energy causes a burst that\
      \ affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius\
      \ centered on the warpriest. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to\
      \ the amount listed in the fervor ability. Creatures that take damage from channeled\
      \ energy must succeed at a Will saving throw to halve the damage. The save DC\
      \ is 10 + 1/2 the warpriest's level + the warpriest's Wisdom modifier. Creatures\
      \ healed by channeled energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total--all\

    \ now grants temporary hit points and static bonuses on attack and damage rolls,\
    \ rather than bonuses to ability scores that force players to recalculate a number\

    \ magical hazards and conning dull-witted opponents. Unchained: While much of\
    \ the unchained rogue will be familiar to those who have played the original rogue,\
    \ there are a number of new class features that greatly enhance the power and\
    \ flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the debilitating injury class\
    \ feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper her foes, giving her\
    \ a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending on the situation. In\
    \ addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon Finesse for free\
    \ at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to damage rolls with\
    \ one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue's edge ability ties into\
    \ a new system called skill unlocks. With this feature, the unchained rogue can\
    \ master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters without\
    \ access to such talents. Alignment: Any Hit Die: d8 Starting Wealth: 4d6 × 10\
    \ gp (average 140 gp.) In addition, each character begins play with an outfit\
    \ worth 10 gp or less."

    \ call forth all manner of creatures to do their bidding. Known as summoners,\
    \ these arcane practitioners form close bonds with particular outsiders, known\

    \ design--the biggest change comes to the eidolon. The unchained summoner selects\
    \ a subtype for his eidolon (such as angel, demon, or protean), which determines\
    \ a number of its evolutions and helps to shape the eidolon's general attitude\
