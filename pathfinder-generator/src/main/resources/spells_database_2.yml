    \ use your caster level as their base attack bonus and have a +13 bonus due to\
    \ their Strength. Any tendril that succeeds in grappling a foe deals 4d6+13 points\
    \ of damage to the grappled creature. Additionally, the tendrils created by this\
    \ spell can detect evil auras, as if they had spent 3 rounds observing all creatures\
    \ and objects within the spell's area using detect evil, and attack and impede\
    \ the movement of only evil creatures, though they also attack any structures\
    \ in their area. Each structure suffers a single attack each round; your caster\
    \ level acts as the base attack bonus for these attacks, and the tendrils deal\
    \ 4d6+13 points of damage on each successful attack. Creatures that lack evil\
    \ auras are not attacked or impeded by this spell."
