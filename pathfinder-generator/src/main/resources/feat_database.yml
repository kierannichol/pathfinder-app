  prerequisites: "Craft Wondrous Item, Grisly Ornament, Harvest Parts."
  benefit: "Whenever you use the Grisly Ornament feat, you are able to permanently\
    \ integrate one ornament you have crafted using the harvested creature parts into\
    \ a wondrous item. The ornament grants no ongoing benefits, but once per day you\
    \ can activate an integrated ornament as a free action to gain its full benefits\
    \ for 1 minute. You can integrate an ornament into a wondrous item (or replace\
    \ an item's existing ornament) by spending 8 hours of work and 100 gp × the creature's\
