    \ take a standard action to cast now take a full-round action, and spells that\
    \ normally take longer than a standard action take twice as long. (Swift action\
    \ spells still take a swift action.) To discover your ruse, a creature must succeed\
    \ at a Perception, Sense Motive, or Spellcraft check (the creature receives an\
    \ automatic check with whichever of those skills has the highest bonus) against\
    \ a DC equal to 15 + your number of ranks in Bluff or Disguise (whichever is higher)\
