      Effect: "This functions as a storm of vengeance combined with an earthquake\
        \ that occurs on the second round of the effect (while acid is raining from\
        \ the sky). A witch must concentrate for the duration of this effect. If disrupted,\
        \ the effect immediately ends. A witch can only use this ability once per\
        \ day."

      Effect: "The witch calls forth the ghost of a humanoid creature with no more\
        \ than 18 Hit Dice. The ghost has its own personality and desires, but is\
        \ willing to bargain with the witch, as if she had cast greater planar ally.\
        \ To seal an agreement with the witch, the ghost requires life energy equal\
        \ to 1 temporary negative level (this is in addition to the standard payment\
        \ for the ghost's service). This negative level persists as long as the ghost\
        \ remains in the service of the witch; the witch can end the agreement as\
        \ a standard action, immediately removing the negative level."

      Effect: "The witch can animate a hut, small house, covered wagon, tent, or similar\
        \ construction as an animated object. The hut can be of up to Huge size (approximately\
        \ 15 feet by 15 feet). The animated hut's hardness increases to 8 and its\
        \ hit points double. The witch can give the hut the following commands: guard\
        \ (the hut watches for trespassers within 120 feet using the witch's Perception\
        \ modifier and screams if it spots any), hide (all entrances are hidden by\
        \ illusory wall spells and locked with arcane lock), and move (moves at speed\
        \ 60 on giant bird or bone legs as directed by the witch, even obeying commands\
        \ such as “follow me from 100 feet away\"). The hut remains animate for 24\
        \ hours, until she dismisses it or she animates another, at which time the\
        \ hut stops where it is and reverts to its nonmagical state."
