description: "The paladin’s lay on hands also acts as protection from evil, but
  only for the purpose of allowing a new saving throw against enchantment
  (charm) and enchantment (compulsion) effects, making the target immune to any
  attempts to possess or exercise mental control over the target, or preventing
  a life force from controlling the target (all as described in the second
  effect of protection from evil). Use the paladin’s level as the caster level."
