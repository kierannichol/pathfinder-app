description: "The paladin’s lay on hands also acts as protection from evil, but only\
  \ for the purpose of allowing a new saving throw against enchantment (charm) and\
  \ enchantment (compulsion) effects, making the target immune to any attempts to\
  \ possess or exercise mental control over the target, or preventing a life force\
  \ from controlling the target (all as described in the second effect of protection\
  \ from evil). Use the paladin’s level as the caster level."
