  \ improve both themselves and their animal companions. Role: Hunters can adapt their\
  \ tactics to many kinds of opponents, and cherish their highly trained animal companions.\
  \ As a team, the hunter and her companion can react to danger with incredible speed,\
  \ making them excellent scouts, explorers, and saboteurs. Alignment: Any neutral.\
  \ Hit Die: d8. Parent Classes: Druid and ranger. Starting Wealth: 4d6 × 10 gp (average\
  \ 140 gp.) In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or\

    \ from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing\
    \ a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where\
