description: "While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses,\
  \ shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every\
  \ living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world\
  \ and expand the influence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties\
  \ to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their\
  \ power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need. Role: Shamans\
  \ make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power\
  \ of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren't\
  \ the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed. Alignment:\
  \ Any. Hit Die: d8. Parent Classes: Oracle and witch. Starting Wealth: 3d6 Ã— 10\
  \ gp (average 105 gp.) In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth\
  \ 10 gp or less."
