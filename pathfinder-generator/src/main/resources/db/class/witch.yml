description: "Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through\
  \ blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with the unknown. Generally\
  \ feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly\
  \ power. Communing with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch\
  \ gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes.\
  \ As a witch grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but\
  \ some remain blissfully unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of\
  \ what it might be or where its true purposes lie. Role: While many witches are\
  \ recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly\
  \ or in hiding. The blend of witches' spells makes them adept at filling a number\
  \ of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of\
  \ abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater\
  \ knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them. Alignment:\
  \ Any. Hit Die: d6. Starting Wealth: 3d6 Ã— 10 gp (average 105 gp.) In addition,\
  \ each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less."
