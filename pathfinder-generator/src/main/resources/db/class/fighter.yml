description: "Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to\
  \ prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still\
  \ others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove\
  \ their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate\
  \ lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning\
  \ the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all\
  \ to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled\
  \ warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into\
  \ arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts\
  \ of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled\
  \ champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them. Role: Fighters excel\
  \ at combat--defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving\
  \ such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a\
  \ wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess. Alignment:\
  \ Any. Hit Die: d10. Starting Wealth: 5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp.) In addition,\

  description: "At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as Combat Feats, sometimes also called \"fighter bonus feats.\" Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level."
