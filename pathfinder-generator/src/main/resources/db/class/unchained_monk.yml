description: "For the truly exemplary, martial skill transcends the battlefield--it\
  \ is a lifestyle, a doctrine, a state of mind. These warrior-artists search out\
  \ methods of battle beyond swords and shields, finding weapons within themselves\
  \ just as capable of crippling or killing as any blade. These monks (so called since\
  \ they adhere to ancient philosophies and strict martial disciplines) elevate their\
  \ bodies to become weapons of war, from battle-minded ascetics to self-taught brawlers.\
  \ Monks tread the path of discipline, and those with the will to endure that path\
  \ discover within themselves not what they are, but what they are meant to be. Role:\
  \ Monks excel at overcoming even the most daunting perils, striking where it's least\
  \ expected, and taking advantage of enemy vulnerabilities. Fleet of foot and skilled\
  \ in combat, monks can navigate any battlefield with ease, aiding allies wherever\
  \ they are needed most. Unchained: Much of the monk has been reworked, including\
  \ its base attack bonus, Hit Die, saves, and many of its special abilities. The\
  \ result is a version of the monk that not only is easier to play, but also possesses\
  \ a great deal more versatility. Flurry of blows is now much simpler to use in play.\
  \ Many of the higher-level abilities of the monk, such as abundant step and quivering\
  \ palm, have been incorporated into the new system of ki powers. As a monk advances\
  \ in level, he can select from a variety of ki powers, allowing the player to truly\
  \ customize his character. Alignment: Any lawful Hit Die: d10. Starting Wealth:\
  \ 1d6 Ã— 10 gp (average 35 gp.) In addition, each character begins play with an outfit\
  \ worth 10 gp or less."
