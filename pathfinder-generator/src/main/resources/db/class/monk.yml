description: "For the truly exemplary, martial skill transcends the battlefield--it\
  \ is a lifestyle, a doctrine, a state of mind. These warrior-artists search out\
  \ methods of battle beyond swords and shields, finding weapons within themselves\
  \ just as capable of crippling or killing as any blade. These monks (so called since\
  \ they adhere to ancient philosophies and strict martial disciplines) elevate their\
  \ bodies to become weapons of war, from battle-minded ascetics to self-taught brawlers.\
  \ Monks tread the path of discipline, and those with the will to endure that path\
  \ discover within themselves not what they are, but what they are meant to be. Role:\
  \ Monks excel at overcoming even the most daunting perils, striking where it's least\
  \ expected, and taking advantage of enemy vulnerabilities. Fleet of foot and skilled\
  \ in combat, monks can navigate any battlefield with ease, aiding allies wherever\
  \ they are needed most. Alignment: Any lawful Hit Die: d8 Starting Wealth: 1d6 Ã—\
