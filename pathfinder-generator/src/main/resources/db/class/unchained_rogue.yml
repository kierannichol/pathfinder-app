description: "Life is an endless adventure for those who live by their wits. Ever\
  \ just one step ahead of danger, rogues bank on their cunning, skill, and charm\
  \ to bend fate to their favor. Never knowing what to expect, they prepare for everything,\
  \ becoming masters of a wide variety of skills, training themselves to be adept\
  \ manipulators, agile acrobats, shadowy stalkers, or masters of any of dozens of\
  \ other professions or talents. Thieves and gamblers, fast talkers and diplomats,\
  \ bandits and bounty hunters, and explorers and investigators all might be considered\
  \ rogues, as well as countless other professions that rely upon wits, prowess, or\
  \ luck. Although many rogues favor cities and the innumerable opportunities of civilization,\
  \ some embrace lives on the road, journeying far, meeting exotic people, and facing\
  \ fantastic danger in pursuit of equally fantastic riches. In the end, any who desire\
  \ to shape their fates and live life on their own terms might come to be called\
  \ rogues. Role: Rogues excel at moving about unseen and catching foes unaware, and\
  \ tend to avoid head-to-head combat. Their varied skills and abilities allow them\
  \ to be highly versatile, with great variations in expertise existing between different\
  \ rogues. Most, however, excel in overcoming hindrances of all types, from unlocking\
  \ doors and disarming traps to outwitting magical hazards and conning dull-witted\
  \ opponents. Unchained: While much of the unchained rogue will be familiar to those\
  \ who have played the original rogue, there are a number of new class features that\
  \ greatly enhance the power and flexibility of the rogue. Chief among these is the\
  \ debilitating injury class feature. A rogue with this ability can severely hamper\
  \ her foes, giving her a much-needed boost to her offense or defense, depending\
  \ on the situation. In addition, with finesse training, the rogue now gains Weapon\
  \ Finesse for free at 1st level. This ability also lets her add her Dexterity to\
  \ damage rolls with one weapon starting at 3rd level. Finally, the rogue's edge\
  \ ability ties into a new system called skill unlocks. With this feature, the unchained\
  \ rogue can master a small set of chosen skills, outperforming all those characters\
  \ without access to such talents. Alignment: Any Hit Die: d8 Starting Wealth: 4d6\
  \ Ã— 10 gp (average 140 gp.) In addition, each character begins play with an outfit\
  \ worth 10 gp or less."
