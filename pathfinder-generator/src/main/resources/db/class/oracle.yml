description: "Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious\
  \ than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice,\
  \ selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand.\
  \ Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner\
  \ strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support\
  \ their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate\
  \ all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle\
  \ as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen\
  \ ways. Role: Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead\
  \ preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals.\
  \ Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding\
  \ of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor\
  \ and sick. Alignment: Any. Hit Dice: d8. Starting Wealth: 3d6 Ã— 10 gp (average\
  \ 105gp.) In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or\
  \ less."
