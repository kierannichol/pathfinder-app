description: "For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury\
  \ of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know.\
  \ Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers\
  \ or professional warriors--they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter\
  \ and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training,\
  \ preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the\
  \ foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold\
  \ their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance\
  \ to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks\
  \ of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies\
  \ roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit\
  \ of battle, and woe to those who face their rage. Role: Barbarians excel in combat,\
  \ possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior\
  \ to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most\
  \ other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would\
  \ stand in their way. Unchained: The unchained barbarian is similar in many regards\
  \ to the standard barbarian--she still goes into a rage and gains rage powers, but\
  \ many of the details have been changed. Rage now grants temporary hit points and\
  \ static bonuses on attack and damage rolls, rather than bonuses to ability scores\
  \ that force players to recalculate a number of statistics. Additionally, many rage\
  \ powers now function whenever the barbarian is raging, as opposed to just once\
  \ per rage. Finally, the overall utility of many of the rage powers has been adjusted\
  \ to make them more useful and interesting. Alignment: Any non-lawful Hit Die: d12\
  \ Starting Wealth: 3d6 × 10 gp (average 105gp.) In addition, each character begins\
  \ play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less."
