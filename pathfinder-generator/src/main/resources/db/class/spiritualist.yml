    \ of her phantom and the substance of the Ethereal Plane to partially manifest\
    \ aspects of both in her own body. When she does, she uses this bonded manifestation\
    \ to enhance her own abilities while the phantom is still bound to her consciousness.\n\
    For the spiritualist to use this ability, the phantom must be confined in the\
    \ spiritualist’s consciousness; it can’t be manifested in any other way.\nDuring\
    \ a bonded manifestation, the phantom can’t be damaged, dismissed, or banished.\
    \ A spiritualist can use bonded manifestation a number of rounds per day equal\
    \ to 3 + her spiritualist level. The rounds need not be consecutive. She can dismiss\
    \ the effects of a bonded manifestation as a free action, but even if she dismisses\
    \ a bonded manifestation on the same round that she used it, it counts as 1 round\
    \ of use.\nWhen a spiritualist uses this ability, she must choose either ectoplasmic\
    \ or incorporeal form. When she makes this choice, she gains all of the abilities\
    \ based on the form she chooses and her spiritualist level.\nEctoplasmic Bonded\
    \ Manifestation: When a spiritualist uses this ability and chooses ectoplasmic\
    \ form, she gains an ectoplasmic shield that protects her without restricting\
    \ her movement or actions. She gains a +4 shield bonus to Armor Class; this bonus\
    \ applies to incorporeal touch attacks. The ectoplasmic shield has no armor check\
    \ penalty or arcane spell failure chance. At 8th level, the spiritualist also\
    \ sprouts a pair of ectoplasmic tendrils from her body. Once per round as either\
    \ a swift or a standard action (spiritualist’s choice), the spiritualist can use\
    \ one or both tendrils to attack creatures within her melee reach (using the attack\
    \ bonus and damage dice of her ectoplasmic manifested phantom) or to manipulate\
    \ objects. She can even use that action to have one tendril make an attack and\
    \ the other manipulate an object, as long as that object can be manipulated with\
    \ one hand. At 13th level, the phantom’s ectoplasm clings to the spiritualist\
    \ like a suit of armor. This grants the spiritualist a +6 armor bonus to AC without\
    \ imposing an armor check penalty, an arcane spell failure chance, or any reduction\
    \ in speed. At 18th level, the spiritualist can take a full-round action to attack\
    \ all creatures within her melee reach with her tendrils (using the attack bonus\
    \ and damage dice of her ectoplasmic manifested phantom). When she does, she rolls\
    \ the attack roll twice, takes the better of the two results, and uses that as\
    \ her attack roll result against all creatures within her melee reach. If the\
    \ better attack roll threatens a critical hit, the spiritualist chooses one target\
    \ that she hit to confirm the critical hit against. The other attacks that hit\
    \ are considered normal hits rather than critical threats.\nIncorporeal Bonded\
    \ Manifestation: When a spiritualist uses this ability and chooses incorporeal\
    \ form, she becomes shrouded in a haze of insubstantial mist, granting her concealment\
    \ against ranged attacks. At 8th level, the spiritualist can better affect incorporeal\
    \ creatures with melee attacks; her unarmed strikes and melee weapon attacks are\
    \ treated as if they had the ghost touch magic weapon special ability. At 13th\
    \ level, the spiritualist can take a standard action to become invisible (as the\
    \ invisibility spell) until the start of her next turn. At 18th level, the spiritualist\
    \ gains the incorporeal subtype and a fly speed of 30 feet (good) while using\
    \ this form of bonded manifestation."

    \ she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level.\
    \ To learn or cast a spell, a spiritualist must have a Wisdom score equal to at\
    \ least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against\
    \ a spiritualist’s spell equals 10 + the spell level + the spiritualist’s Wisdom\
    \ modifier.\nA spiritualist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell\
    \ level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Spiritualist.\
    \ In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score.\n\
    A spiritualist’s selection of spells is limited. A spiritualist begins play knowing\
    \ four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the spiritualist’s choice. At\
    \ each new spiritualist level, she learns one or more new spells as indicated\
    \ on Table: Spiritualist Spells Known. Unlike her number of spells per day, the\
    \ number of spells a spiritualist knows does not affect her Wisdom score. The\
    \ numbers on Table: Spiritualist Spells Known are fixed.\nUpon reaching 5th level,\
    \ and at every third spiritualist level thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a spiritualist\
    \ can learn a single new spell in place of one she already knows.\nIn effect,\
    \ the spiritualist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’\
    s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be\
    \ at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spiritualist spell she can cast.\
    \ A spiritualist can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must\
    \ choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new\
    \ spells known for the level.\nKnacks: A spiritualist learns a number of knacks,\
    \ or 0-level psychic spells, as noted on Table: Spiritualist Spells Known under\
    \ Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they can be cast\
    \ any number of times per day. Knacks prepared using another spell slot, because\
    \ of metamagic feats applied to them, for example, consume spell slots as normal."
