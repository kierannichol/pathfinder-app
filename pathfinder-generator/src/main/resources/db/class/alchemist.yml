description: "Whether secreted away in a smoky basement laboratory or gleefully experimenting\
  \ in a well-respected school of magic, the alchemist is often regarded as being\
  \ just as unstable, unpredictable, and dangerous as the concoctions he brews. While\
  \ some creators of alchemical items content themselves with sedentary lives as merchants,\
  \ providing tindertwigs and smokesticks, the true alchemist answers a deeper calling.\
  \ Rather than cast magic like a spellcaster, the alchemist captures his own magic\
  \ potential within liquids and extracts he creates, infusing his chemicals with\
  \ virulent power to grant him impressive skill with poisons, explosives, and all\
  \ manner of self-transformative magic. Role: The alchemist's reputation is not softened\
  \ by his exuberance (some would say dangerous recklessness) in perfecting his magical\
  \ extracts and potion-like creations, infusing these substances with magic siphoned\
  \ from his aura and using his own body as experimental stock. Nor is it mollified\
  \ by the alchemist's almost gleeful passion for building explosive bombs and discovering\
  \ strange new poisons and methods for their use. These traits, while making him\
  \ a liability and risk for most civilized organizations and institutions of higher\
  \ learning, seem to fit quite well with most adventuring groups. Alignment: Any.\
  \ Hit Die: d8. Starting Wealth: 3d6 Ã— 10 gp (average 105gp.) In addition, each character\
  \ begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less."

  description: "In addition to magical extracts, alchemists are adept at swiftly mixing\
    \ various volatile chemicals and infusing them with their magical reserves to\
    \ create powerful bombs that they can hurl at their enemies. An alchemist can\
    \ use a number of bombs each day equal to his class level + his Intelligence modifier.\
    \ Bombs are unstable, and if not used in the round they are created, they degrade\
    \ and become inert--their method of creation prevents large volumes of explosive\
    \ material from being created and stored. In order to create a bomb, the alchemist\
    \ must use a small vial containing an ounce of liquid catalyst--the alchemist\
    \ can create this liquid catalyst from small amounts of chemicals from an alchemy\
    \ lab, and these supplies can be readily refilled in the same manner as a spellcaster's\
    \ component pouch. Most alchemists create a number of catalyst vials at the start\
    \ of the day equal to the total number of bombs they can create in that day--once\
    \ created, a catalyst vial remains usable by the alchemist for years.Drawing the\
    \ components of, creating, and throwing a bomb requires a standard action that\
    \ provokes an attack of opportunity. Thrown bombs have a range of 20 feet and\
    \ use the Throw Splash Weapon special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and\
    \ can be selected using feats such as Point-Blank Shot and Weapon Focus. On a\
    \ direct hit, an alchemist's bomb inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage + additional\
    \ damage equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. The damage of an alchemist's\
    \ bomb increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered alchemist level (this bonus\
    \ damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike).\
    \ Splash damage from an alchemist bomb is always equal to the bomb's minimum damage\
    \ (so if the bomb would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage on a direct hit, its\
    \ splash damage would be 6 points of fire damage). Those caught in the splash\
    \ damage can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this save is equal\
    \ to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier.Alchemists\
    \ can learn new types of bombs as discoveries (see the Discovery ability) as they\
    \ level up. An alchemist's bomb, like an extract, becomes inert if used or carried\
    \ by anyone else."

  description: "At 1st level, an alchemist discovers how to create a mutagen that\
    \ he can imbibe in order to heighten his physical prowess at the cost of his personality.\
    \ It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent\
    \ until used. An alchemist can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time--if\
    \ he brews a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. As with an extract\
    \ or bomb, a mutagen that is not in an alchemist's possession becomes inert until\
    \ an alchemist picks it up again.When an alchemist brews a mutagen, he selects\
    \ one physical ability score--either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It's\
    \ a standard action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes\
    \ the alchemist to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting him a +2 natural armor\
    \ bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for 10 minutes\
    \ per alchemist level. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist\
    \ takes a â€“2 penalty to one of his mental ability scores. If the mutagen enhances\
    \ his Strength, it applies a penalty to his Intelligence. If it enhances his Dexterity,\
    \ it applies a penalty to his Wisdom. If it enhances his Constitution, it applies\
    \ a penalty to his Charisma.A non-alchemist who drinks a mutagen must make a Fortitude\
    \ save (DC 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier)\
    \ or become nauseated for 1 hour--a non-alchemist can never gain the benefit of\
    \ a mutagen, but an alchemist can gain the effects of another alchemist's mutagen\
    \ if he drinks it. (Although if the other alchemist creates a different mutagen,\
