      participated in the medium’s seance that day dies within line of effect
      and line of sight of the medium, the medium can spend an immediate action
      to accept that ally’s spirit within him. Since the ally inhabits the
      portion of the medium’s soul normally reserved for a spirit, this
      suppresses the medium’s spirit, spirit bonus, and spirit surge abilities
      as long as the medium maintains this ability. The ally’s spirit and the
      medium share the medium’s body and can decide each round on the medium’s
      turn which of them will take the medium’s actions for that round. If they
      don’t agree on who should act, they attempt opposed Charisma checks to
      determine who is dominant for the next hour, and the dominant character
      decides who acts on each round. The ally’s spirit has all the spells and
      limited use abilities (such as uses of channel energy, ki, and panache)
      that it possessed at the time of death, but it is incapable of regaining
      any abilities, points, spells, or uses of abilities it expends. When the
      ally’s spirit acts, it uses the ally’s base attack bonus, caster level,
      and special abilities (such as weapon proficiency), but uses the medium’s
      physical ability scores. If the ally returns to life, this ability
      immediately ends. Otherwise, the medium can maintain this ability
      indefinitely. The medium can end this effect as a standard action, though
      if the ally is unwilling to depart, the medium must succeed at a Will
      saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the ally’s hit dice + the ally’s Charisma
      modifier) or the attempt fails and the ally becomes dominant for 24

      A medium can cast a small number of psychic spells drawn from the medium
      spell list. To learn or cast a spell, a medium must have a Charisma score
      equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. He can cast any spell he knows
      without preparing it ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a medium’s
      spell is equal to 10 + the spell level + the medium’s Charisma modifier.

      A medium can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day.
      His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Medium. In addition, he
      receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score.

      The medium’s selection of spells is limited. At 1st level, a medium knows
      two 0-level spells of his choice. At each new level, the medium learns one
      or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Medium Spells Known. Unlike his
      spells per day, the number of spells a medium knows is not affected by his
      Charisma score; the numbers on the table are fixed. At 5th level and every
      3 levels thereafter, a medium can learn a single new spell in place of one
      he already knows. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the
      spell being exchanged, and he must choose whether to swap the spell at the
      same time he gains new spells known for the level.

      The medium casts all spells as psychic spells.

      Knacks: Mediums learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells, as noted on
      Table: Medium Spells Known. These spells are cast like any other spell,
      but they don’t consume slots and can be used again."

    description: "A medium serves as a vessel to channel spirits—astral echoes of
      powerful souls from ages past that live on in myth and legend. Each day, a
      medium can channel a spirit through a ritual known as a seance. Seances
      take 1 hour to perform and require the medium’s concentration. A full list
      of spirits can be found here.

      FAQ The medium class says that spirits can be channeled from any
      appropriate location, not just from the list of favored locations, but is
      that true, or can I only channel from one of the favored locations? As the
      class says, you can channel from any appropriate location, and the favored
      locations are just a place to start. There might be times where you don’t
      have access to all six legends, but a medium, either PC or NPC, should
      generally be able to access a legend if they can come up with a good
      conceptual tie between the legend and a location he can find or even set
      up himself. For instance, a medium could go hunt a deer and then use that
      location to channel a champion spirit of a legendary hunter. [Source]

      At the end of a seance, the medium invites a local spirit to inhabit him
      and serve as his spirit for that day. Each spirit arises from one a
      legend. Though the medium can choose the legend to which the spirit he
      channels belongs, he must channel that spirit from an appropriate
      location. Each spirit has a favored location it usually inhabits, though
      spirits may also be present at other locations appropriate to their
      legends; such locations are listed in each legend’s Favored Locations
      entry [also, see FAQ at right]. The medium gains the spirit’s listed
      seance boon and lesser spirit power for 24 hours. The medium also gains
      the spirit’s intermediate spirit power at 6th level, its greater spirit
      power at 11th level, and its supreme spirit power at 17th level. After 24
      hours, the medium loses contact with the channeled spirit and can perform
      another seance.

      A medium can invite his allies to participate in his seance—shared seance
      and certain spirit powers affect other participants. A character counts as
      participating so long as she maintains physical contact with another
      participating character and willfully opens herself to the spirit; unlike
      the medium, other participating characters can take other actions during
      this time. Only creatures with an Intelligence score of at least 3 can
      participate in a seance.

      In addition to granting power to the medium, a channeled spirit can
      influence the medium. By channeling a spirit, the medium allows the spirit
      to gain 1 point of influence over him. If the medium loses that 1 point of
      influence, he loses contact with the spirit, though he is still unable to
      perform a new seance until the normal 24 hour period has elapsed since his
      last seance. When the spirit leaves after the 24-hour duration and before
      the next seance, the spirit’s influence over the medium resets to 0.
      Certain abilities allow the medium to gain additional power in exchange
      for allowing the spirit more influence over him.

      When a spirit gains at least 3 points of influence over the medium, the
      dual impulses housed within the same body cause the medium to meld with
      his spirit’s consciousness.

      The resulting muddled sense of self and struggle for control causes the
      medium to take a –2 penalty on initiative checks as well as a specific
      additional penalty listed in each spirit’s entry. However, the spirit’s
      mental presence grants the medium a +4 bonus against possession effects
      and a +2 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects that are
      not related to possession.

      If a spirit ever attains 5 or more points of influence over the medium,
      the medium completely loses control to the spirit. He effectively becomes
      an NPC under the GM’s control until after he awakens the next day with the
      spirit gone.

      During his seance, the medium can choose to channel a weaker spirit to
      gain its help without incurring as much of its influence. If he does so,
      he can forgo any number of spirit powers, starting with his most powerful
      spirit power. For each spirit power he forgoes, the medium can use his
      spirit surge ability twice without incurring influence."

      generally be able to access a legend if they can come up with a good
      conceptual tie between the legend and a location he can find or even set
      up himself. For instance, a medium could go hunt a deer and then use that
      location to channel a champion spirit of a legendary hunter. [Source]

      At the end of a seance, the medium invites a local spirit to inhabit him
      and serve as his spirit for that day. Each spirit arises from one a
      legend. Though the medium can choose the legend to which the spirit he
      channels belongs, he must channel that spirit from an appropriate
      location. Each spirit has a favored location it usually inhabits, though
      spirits may also be present at other locations appropriate to their
      legends; such locations are listed in each legend’s Favored Locations
      entry [also, see FAQ at right]. The medium gains the spirit’s listed
      seance boon and lesser spirit power for 24 hours. The medium also gains
      the spirit’s intermediate spirit power at 6th level, its greater spirit
      power at 11th level, and its supreme spirit power at 17th level. After 24
      hours, the medium loses contact with the channeled spirit and can perform
      another seance.

      A medium can invite his allies to participate in his seance—shared seance
      and certain spirit powers affect other participants. A character counts as
      participating so long as she maintains physical contact with another
      participating character and willfully opens herself to the spirit; unlike
      the medium, other participating characters can take other actions during
      this time. Only creatures with an Intelligence score of at least 3 can
      participate in a seance.

      In addition to granting power to the medium, a channeled spirit can
      influence the medium. By channeling a spirit, the medium allows the spirit
      to gain 1 point of influence over him. If the medium loses that 1 point of
      influence, he loses contact with the spirit, though he is still unable to
      perform a new seance until the normal 24 hour period has elapsed since his
      last seance. When the spirit leaves after the 24-hour duration and before
      the next seance, the spirit’s influence over the medium resets to 0.
      Certain abilities allow the medium to gain additional power in exchange
      for allowing the spirit more influence over him.

      When a spirit gains at least 3 points of influence over the medium, the
      dual impulses housed within the same body cause the medium to meld with
      his spirit’s consciousness.

      The resulting muddled sense of self and struggle for control causes the
      medium to take a –2 penalty on initiative checks as well as a specific
      additional penalty listed in each spirit’s entry. However, the spirit’s
      mental presence grants the medium a +4 bonus against possession effects
      and a +2 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects that are
      not related to possession.

      If a spirit ever attains 5 or more points of influence over the medium,
      the medium completely loses control to the spirit. He effectively becomes
      an NPC under the GM’s control until after he awakens the next day with the
      spirit gone.

      During his seance, the medium can choose to channel a weaker spirit to
      gain its help without incurring as much of its influence. If he does so,
      he can forgo any number of spirit powers, starting with his most powerful
      spirit power. For each spirit power he forgoes, the medium can use his
      spirit surge ability twice without incurring influence."

      The medium can select only a single taboo. The medium is not magically
      prevented from breaking his taboo, but if he breaks the taboo for any
      reason, he takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, ability
      checks, skill checks, and saving throws for 1 hour and his spirit gains 1
      point of influence over him. If the medium continues violating the taboo
