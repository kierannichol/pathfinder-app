description: "There are those who spend their lives poring over ancient tomes and\
  \ texts, unlocking the power of magic, and there are those who spend their time\
  \ perfecting the use of individual weapons, becoming masters without equal. The\
  \ magus is at once a student of both philosophies, blending magical ability and\
  \ martial prowess into something entirely unique, a discipline in which both spell\
  \ and steel are used to devastating effect. As he grows in power, the magus unlocks\
  \ powerful forms of arcana that allow him to merge his talents further, and at the\
  \ pinnacle of his art, the magus becomes a blur of steel and magic, a force that\
  \ few foes would dare to stand against. Role: Magi spend much of their time traveling\
  \ the world, learning whatever martial or arcane secrets they can find. They might\
  \ spend months learning a new sword-fighting style from a master warrior, while\
  \ simultaneously moonlighting in the local library, poring through tomes of ancient\
  \ lore. Most who take this path dabble in all sorts of lore, picking up anything\
  \ that might aid them in their search for perfection. Alignment: Any. Hit Die: d8.\
  \ Starting Wealth: 4d6 × 10 gp (average 140 gp.) In addition, each character begins\
  \ play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less."
