description: "Skilled at tracking down targets, slayers are consummate hunters, living\
  \ for the chase and the deadly stroke that brings it to a close. Slayers spend most\
  \ of their time honing their weapon skills, studying the habits and anatomy of foes,\
  \ and practicing combat maneuvers. Role: The slayer is elusive, and good at finding\
  \ the opportune time and location to strike. Combining the deadliest talents of\
  \ rangers and rogues, a slayer's abilities are all about getting into combat, dealing\
  \ with a target, and then getting back out again. Alignment: Any. Hit Die: d10.\
  \ Parent Classes: Ranger and rogue. Starting Wealth: 5d6 × 10 gp (average 175 gp.)\
  \ In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less."
