    \ mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.\nAllay Pain: The subject of this\
    \ trick gains DR 15/— against one attack that deals nonlethal damage. The mesmerist\
    \ can trigger this trick whenever the subject is hit with an attack that deals\
    \ nonlethal damage. Source PCS:OR Avian Escape: The subject changes shape to elude\
    \ an attacking enemy. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes\
    \ damage from an enemy’s attack. The subject transforms into a bird (as beast\
    \ shape III). Though the subject can appear as any Tiny bird, it uses the statistics\
    \ for a raven. This is a polymorph effect. Concealing Veil: When this trick is\
    \ triggered, the subject is affected by a nondetection spell for 1 round per mesmerist\
    \ level. Source PPC:OO Cursed Sanction: A ward curses an enemy who attacks the\
    \ subject. While this trick is implanted, a visible, circular symbol appears on\
    \ the subject’s forehead. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject\
    \ is attacked or becomes the target of a spell that requires an attack roll. The\
    \ attacker takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill\
    \ checks for 1 minute per mesmerist level (Will negates). This penalty applies\
    \ to the triggering attack roll. This is a curse effect. Faked Death: The subject\
    \ appears to die, but actually can stealthily move about. The mesmerist can trigger\
    \ this trick when the subject is damaged by an attack. The subject seems to fall\
    \ down dead (as programmed image), but actually turns invisible (as invisibility)\
    \ for a number of rounds equal to the mesmerist’s level or until she attacks.\
    \ Once the subject becomes visible again, the illusory dead body disappears. These\
    \ are illusion effects, and a creature that interacts with the false body can\
    \ attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect. The false body is a figment;\
    \ the invisibility is a glamer. Free in Body: When constrained, the subject can\
    \ easily slip loose. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject begins\
    \ its turn grappled or under an effect that impedes its movement (including paralysis,\
    \ solid fog, slow, and web). The subject gains the benefits of freedom of movement\
    \ for 1 minute. Greater Mask Misery: This trick functions as the mask misery trick,\
    \ but can be used to ignore greater conditions as well. A mesmerist must have\
    \ the mask misery mesmerist trick to take greater mask misery. Mental Fallback:\
    \ Mental commands placed deep in the subject’s mind trigger when she would fall\
    \ under mind control, allowing the mesmerist to control her instead. The mesmerist\
    \ can trigger this trick when the subject is affected by a charm or compulsion\
    \ effect created by an enemy. The subject acts as though the mesmerist had cast\
    \ the spell instead of the enemy. For instance, if the subject were affected by\
    \ charm monster cast by an enemy, that enemy can’t try to give her orders, but\
    \ the mesmerist could. If the charm or compulsion causes penalties or conditions\
    \ (such as those imposed by confusion, crushing despair, or hold person), the\
    \ subject can ignore any of those penalties or conditions the mesmerist chooses.\
    \ This trick overrides the charm or compulsion for a number of rounds equal to\
    \ the mesmerist’s level or until the duration of the triggering effect elapses,\
    \ whichever comes first. The mesmerist can’t implant this trick on himself. Shadow\
    \ Blend: The mesmerist can trigger this trick whenever the subject attempts a\
    \ Stealth check while in an area of dim or darker light. The subject gains total\
    \ concealment from all enemies (50% miss chance) as long as it remains within\
    \ areas of dim or darker light. Against creatures with darkvision, the subject\
    \ gains concealment (20% miss chance) rather than total concealment. Once triggered,\
    \ this effect lasts for 1 round per mesmerist level or until the subject enters\
    \ an area of normal or brighter light. Source PCS:OR Spatial Switch: The mesmerist\
    \ allows himself and an ally to physically swap places. The mesmerist can trigger\
    \ this trick when an enemy moves adjacent to or attacks either the subject or\
    \ the mesmerist, provided the subject and the mesmerist are within 100 feet of\
    \ one another. The subject and the mesmerist then swap positions. If this trick\
    \ was triggered by an attack, the swap happens before checking to see whether\
    \ the attack hits. The mesmerist can’t implant this trick on himself. This is\
    \ a conjuration (teleportation) effect. Spell Anticipation: The mesmerist can\
    \ choose a spell to strike back at enemy spellcasters. When the mesmerist implants\
    \ this trick, he must expend one spell slot to couple a spell he knows of that\
    \ level with the trick. That spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action\
    \ or less and be able to target one creature (spells like dominate person that\
    \ have more restrictive targeting can be used, but have no effect if triggered\
    \ against creatures that don’t match). He can trigger this trick when the subject\
    \ is targeted by an enemy’s spell. The mesmerist’s spell then triggers, affecting\
    \ only the enemy spellcaster. This takes effect only if the enemy spellcaster\
    \ is within range of the spell (as measured from the subject of the trick), and\
    \ functions as though the mesmerist were in the subject’s square. The enemy’s\
    \ spell still has its full effect, even if the mesmerist’s spell would normally\
    \ protect against it or make the caster unable to cast it. Umbral Transformation:\
    \ The subject of this trick turns into a living shadow for 1 round, as if affected\
    \ by shadow body. After this trick ends, the subject is staggered for 1 round.\
    \ Source PCS:OR Vision of Blood: When an enemy is struck by the subject, it believes\
    \ its wound is far more severe, and the shock overwhelms it. The mesmerist can\
    \ trigger this trick when the subject hits with an attack using a weapon, a natural\
    \ weapon, or an unarmed strike. The attack’s target must succeed at a Will saving\
    \ throw or be stunned for 1 round. If the triggering attack was a critical hit,\
    \ the target doesn’t get a saving throw. Willful Ignorance: The subject gains\
    \ the ability to tell one undetectable lie. When the subject attempts to lie,\
    \ the mesmerist can trigger this trick. That particular lie resists truth-detecting\
    \ magic, and creatures attempting to use such magic must succeed at a caster level\
    \ check against a DC equal to 15 + the mesmerist’s class level to succeed; failure\
    \ means the magic doesn’t detect the subject’s lie or force her to speak only\
    \ the truth. Source PPC:OO"

    \ one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free\
    \ action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick’s description),\
    \ even if it isn’t his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet\
    \ + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick.\nThe mesmerist\
    \ monitors for the trick’s triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection,\
    \ so he doesn’t need line of sight to trigger it—but anything that blocks telepathic\
    \ contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until\
    \ the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.\nOnce triggered, a trick is\
    \ no longer implanted, and can’t be triggered again until the mesmerist implants\
    \ the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is\
    \ either instantaneous or appears in the trick’s entry. The DC for any mesmerist\
    \ trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 +\
    \ 1/2 the mesmerist’s level + the mesmerist’s Charisma modifier.\nThe mesmerist\

    \ of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless\
    \ specifically noted in the mesmerist trick’s description, a mesmerist can’t choose\
    \ a particular trick more than once.\nAstounding Avoidance: The subject can avoid\
    \ damage from magical and unusual attacks. The mesmerist can trigger this trick\
    \ when the subject attempts a saving throw against an attack or spell that normally\
    \ deals half damage on a successful save, before the subject rolls the save. If\
    \ the subject succeeds at her save, she takes no damage. If the mesmerist is 12th\
    \ level or higher, the subject takes only half damage if she fails her save. The\
    \ benefits of this trick don’t stack with those of the evasion or stalwart class\
    \ features. Compel Alacrity: A dash of mental speed lets the subject push past\
    \ her physical limits to avoid an enemy. The mesmerist can trigger this trick\
    \ when the subject begins her turn within an enemy’s reach. The subject can move\
    \ 10 feet as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. The distance\
    \ the subject can move increases by 5 feet for every 5 levels the mesmerist possesses,\
    \ to a maximum of 30 feet at 20th level. The subject can’t move farther than her\
    \ speed in this way. The movement from this trick doesn’t count against the subject’\
    s movement speed for that round. Chain of Eyes: The subject can share her senses\
    \ with the mesmerist. The mesmerist triggers chain of eyes by closing his eyes\
    \ and concentrating on the implanted subject, allowing the mesmerist to see and\
    \ hear everything the target experiences with her own senses of sight and hearing\
    \ (including any special senses or magical effects). Once triggered, chain of\
    \ eyes lasts for 1 minute per mesmerist level or until the mesmerist shifts his\
    \ field of vision back to himself as a free action. While viewing events from\
    \ the target’s perspective, the mesmerist is flat-footed, even if he can see himself\
    \ from another perspective. Source PPC:OO False Flanker: A duplicate of the mesmerist\
    \ appears momentarily, as though he were fighting in tandem with the subject.\
    \ The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject moves into or begins her\
    \ turn in a square where she threatens an enemy. An illusory duplicate of the\
    \ mesmerist appears in any unoccupied space adjacent to that enemy. This duplicate\
    \ counts as threatening the enemy for the purposes of determining flanking, but\
    \ can’t actually make attacks. The duplicate disappears at the end of the turn\
    \ during which the trick is triggered. This is an illusion (figment) effect, and\
    \ a creature that interacts with the false flanker can attempt a saving throw\
    \ to disbelieve the effect. Fearsome Guise: A veil of illusion makes the subject\
    \ appear to be someone else and then transform into a hideous monster at an opportune\
    \ time. While this trick is implanted, the subject’s appearance is altered, as\
    \ disguise self. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attacks\
    \ a creature. The illusory appearance brief ly makes the subject appear monstrous,\
    \ then ends. The mesmerist attempts an Intimidate check to demoralize the target\
    \ of the triggering attack. The restrictions on attempts to demoralize a target\
    \ (the target being within 30 feet and able to see and hear the creature attempting\
    \ the Intimidate check) apply to the subject of the trick. This is an illusion\

    \ the target enters an area with dim or darker light. The subject can move double\
    \ its normal speed (up to an additional 30 feet) for 1 round, but only while moving\
    \ through areas of dim or darker light. Additionally, the subject can move at\
    \ its normal speed and use the bonus speed from this trick in areas of total darkness,\
    \ even if it cannot see. Source PCS:OR Gift of Will: A small portion of the mesmerist’\
    s vast mental power buttresses his ally’s mind. The mesmerist can trigger this\
    \ trick when the subject attempts a Will saving throw or a Sense Motive check,\
    \ or is targeted by an Intimidate check to demoralize her. For a saving throw,\
    \ the subject uses the mesmerist’s Will saving throw bonus instead of her own.\
    \ For a Sense Motive check or Intimidate check, she adds the mesmerist’s Charisma\
    \ bonus as a morale bonus on the check or to the DC. The mesmerist can’t implant\
    \ this trick on himself. Levitation Buffer: A mesmerist’s telekinetic assault\
    \ renders foes around the subject less of a threat. The mesmerist can trigger\
    \ this trick when either an enemy moves adjacent to the subject or the subject\
    \ begins her turn with one or more enemies adjacent to her. The mesmerist can\
    \ either lift all enemies adjacent to the subject slightly into the air or push\
    \ them all away from the subject. Lifting enemies causes them to move at half\
    \ speed and take a –4 penalty to their CMDs against bull rush, drag, and reposition\
    \ attempts for 1 round (Will negates). The speed reduction and CMD penalty don’\
    t stack with those from hostile levitation. Pushing enemies away requires the\
    \ mesmerist to attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check using his mesmerist level\
    \ + his Charisma modifier as his CMB. Any enemy that’s successfully pushed moves\
    \ away from the subject of the trick using the normal rules for a bull rush. Linked\
    \ Reaction: A hive mind allows the mesmerist and an ally to share one another’\
    s reaction times. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when either the subject\
    \ or the mesmerist is surprised and the other isn’t (even if the mesmerist would\
    \ normally be unable to take actions because of being surprised). Both the mesmerist\
    \ and the subject can act in this surprise round. The mesmerist can’t implant\
    \ this trick on himself. Mask Misery: The subject can shrug off a condition for\
    \ a short time before succumbing to it. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when\
    \ the subject becomes affected by a minor condition listed under the touch treatment\
    \ ability. The subject can ignore the effect of that condition for 1d4 rounds,\
    \ after which the subject takes the full effect. This has no effect on any conditions\
    \ affecting the subject other than the triggering condition, even if those other\
    \ effects are also listed under touch treatment. The rounds during which the subject\
    \ ignores the triggering effect still count against that effect’s duration; if\
    \ the duration of mask misery is longer than the effect lasts, the subject isn’\
    t affected by the condition at all. If an effect that imposes more than one condition\
    \ triggers this trick, the subject ignores all eligible conditions. If the mesmerist\
    \ is 6th level or higher, he adds the moderate conditions to the conditions he\
    \ can ignore with this trick, and this trick ends minor conditions entirely instead\
    \ of suppressing them temporarily. The mesmerist doesn’t need to have touch treatment\
    \ to choose or use this trick. Meek Facade: The subject magically seems like a\
    \ weak target, goading an enemy into attacking her. The mesmerist can trigger\
    \ this trick when the subject misses a creature with an attack (even if it’s part\
    \ of a full attack in which she hits that creature with another attack). The enemy\
    \ must attack no one other than the subject, and the subject gains a +2 dodge\
    \ bonus to AC against the triggering enemy’s attacks. Both of these effects last\
    \ for 1 round. The bonus to AC increases by 1 for every 5 levels the mesmerist\
    \ possesses. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. Mesmeric Mirror: An illusory\
    \ image appears near the subject to throw off attackers. The mesmerist can trigger\
    \ this trick when the subject is attacked or becomes the target of a spell that\
    \ requires an attack roll. One duplicate of the subject appears, and the attacker\
    \ must determine randomly which it hits (as mirror image). For every 5 class levels\
    \ the mesmerist possesses, one additional image appears, to a maximum of five\
    \ images at 20th level. Each image lasts for 1 minute per mesmerist level or until\
    \ destroyed. This is an illusion (figment) effect. Mesmeric Pantomime: By orchestrating\
    \ the movement of his ally’s body, the mesmerist imparts to that ally his own\
    \ skill at a physical task. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject\
    \ attempts a Strength– or Dexterity-based skill check. The subject either uses\
    \ the mesmerist’s bonus on the skill check in place of her own or gains a morale\
    \ bonus on the check equal to the mesmerist’s Charisma bonus, Whichever results\
    \ in a higher modifier. The mesmerist can’t implant this trick on himself. Misdirection:\
    \ An enemy’s perception of an attack by the subject shifts, making the foe unprepared\
    \ to defend against the attack. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the\
    \ subject makes an attack or uses a spell that requires an attack roll. The mesmerist\
    \ attempts a Bluff check to feint against a single target of the subject’s attack.\
    \ Unlike a normal feint, this ability can be used on non-melee attacks. If the\
    \ feint succeeds, the target of the attack is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC\
    \ against the triggering attack. The target doesn’t suffer any additional effects\
    \ that the mesmerist or the subject would cause on a normal feint or Bluff check.\
    \ This is an illusion (glamer) effect. Psychic Impression: Objects retain psychic\
    \ impressions of those who come in contact with them, and a powerful mind can\
    \ read these impressions. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject\
    \ touches an object that another creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or more\
    \ has touched in the last 10 minutes. The mesmerist receives a psychic impression\
    \ of the emotional state of the last such creature to touch the object. This impression\
    \ contains no images or languages and can’t show the mesmerist who the creature\
    \ was if the mesmerist doesn’t already know. Source PPC:HoG Psychosomatic Surge:\
    \ Psychic magic soothes the subject, alleviating her wounds temporarily. The mesmerist\
    \ can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage. The subject gains a number\
    \ of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + 1/2 the mesmerist’s level. If the damage\
    \ from the triggering attack would have reduced the subject to 0 hit points or\
    \ fewer, this trick grants an additional 1d8 temporary hit points. These temporary\
    \ hit points last for 1 hour or until discharged. Reflect Fear: The mesmerist\
    \ can trigger this trick when the subject is affected by a fear effect or is the\
    \ target of an Intimidate check to demoralize it. When the trick is triggered,\
    \ the subject suppresses the fear effect that triggered the trick for 1d4 rounds,\
    \ and any creature that caused this effect must succeed at a Will save or become\
    \ shaken for 1 round. The rounds during which the subject ignores the triggering\
    \ fear effect still count against the effect’s duration. If the duration of the\
    \ reflect fear trick is longer than the fear effect lasts, the subject isn’t affected\
    \ by the fear effect at all. Source PCS:OR Reflection of Weakness: Psychic feedback\
    \ causes an enemy to suffer from the same weakening effect it imposes on the subject.\
    \ The mesmerist can trigger this trick when an attack or spell used by an enemy\
    \ causes the subject to take ability damage, ability drain, bleed damage, or a\
    \ minor or moderate condition listed under the touch treatment class feature.\
    \ If the trick is triggered by ability damage, ability drain, or bleed damage,\
    \ the amount of damage or drain the subject takes is reduced by 2 points (to a\
    \ minimum of 0 points), and the creature that made the attack or cast the spell\
    \ takes 2 points of ability damage to an ability score of the mesmerist’s choice.\
    \ The monster can attempt a Will save to negate the ability damage. This ability\
    \ can be used if the attacker inflicts a curse, disease, or poison that deals\
    \ ability damage or drain, but only if it deals that damage immediately, with\
    \ no onset time. If the trick is triggered by the subject gaining a condition,\
    \ the subject is still affected by the condition, but the attacker takes a condition\
    \ of the mesmerist’s choice for 1 round. This condition must come from the minor\
    \ condition or moderate condition lists of the touch treatment class feature.\
    \ The enemy can attempt a Will save to avoid gaining the condition. The mesmerist\
    \ doesn’t need to have touch treatment to select or use this trick. See in Darkness:\
    \ The subject gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet for 1 minute. The mesmerist\
    \ can trigger this trick when the subject moves into an area of darkness. Source\
    \ PCS:OR Shadow Splinter: The mesmerist protects the subject against an attack\
    \ and redirects the harm to someone else. The mesmerist can trigger this trick\
    \ when the subject takes damage from an attack. The damage the subject takes is\
    \ reduced by an amount equal to 3 + the mesmerist’s Charisma modifier (to a maximum\
    \ of the total amount of damage the attack deals). Another creature within range\
    \ of the original attack, other than the attacker, is affected by a shadow illusion\
    \ that makes it appear as if the attacker is attacking that creature instead of\
    \ the attacker’s actual target. This second creature takes an amount of damage\
    \ equal to the amount by which the attack’s damage was reduced. This shadow doesn’\
    t require a roll to hit and ignores cover and concealment, but the target can\
    \ attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. If it succeeds at this save, it\
    \ neither takes the damage nor believes the attacker targeted it. This trick can’\
    t be triggered if there’s no eligible second creature within range to take the\
    \ redirected damage. This is an illusion (shadow) effect. Slip Bonds: While implanted\
    \ with this trick, the subject gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist\
    \ checks. If the subject becomes grappled, pinned, shackled, or otherwise personally\
    \ restrained, the mesmerist can trigger the trick and cause the subject to become\
    \ incorporeal just long enough to slip her bonds (unless they can otherwise restrain\
    \ an incorporeal creature). This effect doesn’t last long enough for the subject\
    \ to move through walls or other barriers. If the mesmerist is 12th level, the\
    \ subject remains incorporeal until the beginning of the mesmerist’s next turn.\
    \ Source PPC:OO Spectral Smoke: A cloud of smoke pops up around the subject, foiling\
    \ attacks. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by\
    \ an attack or by a spell that requires an attack roll. A smoke cloud appears\
    \ in the subject’s square and in a 10-foot radius around it. This cloud lasts\
    \ for 1 round per mesmerist level. The cloud functions as fog cloud, but is an\
    \ illusion (figment) effect that can’t be dispersed by wind and can be used underwater.\
    \ A creature that interacts with the cloud can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve\
    \ the effect. The radius of the cloud increases by 5 feet for every 5 caster levels\
    \ the mesmerist possesses, to a maximum of 30 feet at 20th level. Telepathic Link:\
    \ The subject can communicate telepathically with the mesmerist during a crisis.\
    \ The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject and her allies are outnumbered\
    \ in combat. For 1 minute per mesmerist level, the subject and the mesmerist can\
    \ communicate telepathically. If the subject and the mesmerist are more than a\
    \ medium distance (100 feet + 10 feet per level) apart, the telepathic connection\
    \ is severed and cannot be regained unless the trick is implanted again. The mesmerist\
    \ and the subject must share a language to be able to communicate. Source PPC:HoG\
    \ Umbral Shield: The subject ignores any harmful effects of bright light or sunlight\
    \ for 1 minute. The mesmerist can trigger this trick whenever the subject would\
    \ be exposed to harmful bright light (such as sunlight is to a vampire). The subject\
    \ is immune to the dazzled condition while this trick is in effect. Source PCS:OR\
    \ Unwitting Messenger: The mesmerist describes a recipient to the subject while\
    \ implanting this trick, then recites a verbal message no longer than five words\
    \ per mesmerist level. The subject of unwitting messenger has no memory of the\
    \ message or the target recipient. When the subject encounters the specified recipient,\
    \ she repeats the message verbatim, but does not recall speaking the message or\
    \ its contents. The message remains buried in the subject’s subconscious for 24\
    \ hours, after which time it disappears if not delivered. The subject of unwitting\
    \ messenger can be fooled by mundane disguises or illusions, causing her to deliver\
    \ the message to the wrong recipient. Source PPC:OO Vanish Arrow: With a flourish,\
    \ the mesmerist snatches a projectile from an enemy before it can be shot. The\
    \ mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by a ranged weapon\
    \ attack, before the attack roll is made. The mesmerist attempts a Sleight of\
    \ Hand check opposed by the attacker’s Perception check. If the mesmerist succeeds,\
    \ that ranged attack automatically misses, and the projectile appears stowed on\
    \ the mesmerist’s person. If the attacker is making a full attack, this affects\
    \ only one of the attacks (of the mesmerist’s choice). If the attack is made with\
    \ a javelin or other thrown weapon, the attacker gains a +4 bonus on its Perception\
    \ check. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts)\
    \ and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects are not affected\
    \ by this ability. Voice of Reason: The subject can more easily pierce sightbased\
    \ illusions with the mesmerist’s aid. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when\
    \ the subject attempts a saving throw to disbelieve a sight-based illusion effect,\
    \ but only so long as the mesmerist is not affected by or has disbelieved the\
    \ illusion himself. The subject receives an insight bonus on her saving throw\
    \ to disbelieve the illusion equal to the mesmerist’s Charisma modifier. This\
    \ trick cannot be used for illusions that do not allow a saving throw. Source\

    \ number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment\
    \ is given on Table: Mesmerist. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day\
    \ if he has a high Charisma score.\nThe mesmerist’s selection of spells is limited.\
    \ A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells\
    \ of the mesmerist’s choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more\
    \ new spells, as indicated on Table: Mesmerist Spells Known.\nUnlike a mesmerist’\
