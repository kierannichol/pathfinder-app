description: "While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried\
  \ rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers,\
  \ bloodragers' veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for\
  \ spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes\
  \ manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating\
  \ power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively.\
  \ The bloodrager's magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their\
  \ physical prowess. Role: Masters of the battlefield, bloodragers unleash fearful\
  \ carnage on their enemies using their bloodlines and combat prowess. The bloodrager's\
  \ place is on the front lines, right in his enemies' faces, supplying tremendous\
  \ martial force bolstered by a trace of arcane magic. Alignment: Any. Hit Die: d10.\
  \ Parent Classes: Barbarian and sorcerer. Starting Wealth: 3d6 Ã— 10 gp (average\
  \ 105 gp.) In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or\
  \ less."
