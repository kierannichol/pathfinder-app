description: "Capable of calling upon the power of the gods in the form of blessings\
  \ and spells, warpriests blend divine magic with martial skill. They are unflinching\
  \ bastions of their faith, shouting gospel as they pummel foes into submission,\
  \ and never shy away from a challenge to their beliefs. While clerics might be subtle\
  \ and use diplomacy to accomplish their aims, warpriests aren't above using violence\
  \ whenever the situation warrants it. In many faiths, warpriests form the core of\
  \ the church's martial forces--reclaiming lost relics, rescuing captured clergy,\
  \ and defending the church's tenets from all challenges. Role: Warpriests can serve\
  \ as capable healers or spellcasters, calling upon their divine powers from the\
  \ center of the fight, where their armor and martial skills are put to the test.\
  \ Alignment: A warpriest's alignment must be within one step of his deity's, along\
  \ either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis. Hit Die: d8. Parent Classes:\
  \ Cleric and fighter. Starting Wealth: 5d6 Ã— 10 gp (average 175 gp.) In addition,\
  \ each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less."
