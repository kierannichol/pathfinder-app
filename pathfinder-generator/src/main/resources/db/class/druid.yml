description: "Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers\
  \ a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal\
  \ magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids.\
  \ Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors\
  \ of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and\
  \ prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded\
  \ for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting\
  \ abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's\
  \ wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes\
  \ with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization. Role: While\
  \ some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned\
  \ creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others\
  \ transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications\
  \ of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion\
  \ to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic\
  \ demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders. Alignment: Any neutral\
  \ Hit Die: d8 Starting Wealth: 2d6 × 10 gp (average 70 gp.) In addition, each character\

    \ influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people,\

  description: "At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any small\
    \ or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include\
    \ all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the beast shape\
    \ I spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level,\
    \ or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action\
    \ and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of\
    \ an animal the druid is familiar with.A druid loses her ability to speak while\
    \ in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained\
    \ animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the\
    \ same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes\
    \ is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)A druid can use\
    \ this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter,\
    \ for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild\
    \ shape at will. As a druid gains in levels, this ability allows the druid to\
    \ take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each\
    \ form expends one daily usage of this ability, regardless of the form taken.At\
    \ 6th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal\
    \ or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape\
    \ now functions as beast shape II. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's\
    \ wild shape functions as elemental body I.At 8th level, a druid can use wild\
    \ shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small\
    \ or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape\
    \ now functions as beast shape III. When taking the form of an elemental, the\
    \ druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body II. When taking the form\
    \ of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as plant shape I.At 10th\
    \ level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large\
    \ plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape\
    \ now functions as elemental body III. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's\
    \ wild shape now functions as plant shape II.At 12th level, a druid can use wild\
    \ shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking\
    \ the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental\
    \ body IV. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions\
