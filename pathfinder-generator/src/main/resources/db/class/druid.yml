description: "Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds
  lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable,
  these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance
  known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often
  misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who
  would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock
  themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible
  powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship
  of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest
  temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom
  long abandoned and forgotten by civilization. Role: While some druids might
  keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to
  fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform
  into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship
  personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself.
  Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as
  likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific
  awe-inspiring natural wonders. Alignment: Any neutral Hit Die: d8 Starting

      functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a
      person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma
      modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.The typical domestic
      animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are
      usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be
      able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of
      one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in
      this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take
      more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical
      beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –4 penalty on
      the check."

    description: "At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any
      small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new
      forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions
      like the beast shape I spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1
      hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal
      or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of
      opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is
      familiar with.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form
      because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can
      make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same
      general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is
      a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)A druid can use
      this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels
      thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a
      druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains in levels, this ability
      allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals,
      elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily usage of this ability,
      regardless of the form taken.At 6th level, a druid can use wild shape to
      change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the
      form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as beast shape II.
      When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as
      elemental body I.At 8th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a
      Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant
      creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now
      functions as beast shape III. When taking the form of an elemental, the
      druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body II. When taking the
      form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as plant shape
      I.At 10th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Large
      elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental,
      the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body III. When taking
      the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as plant shape
      II.At 12th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Huge
      elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental,
      the druid's wild shape now functions as elemental body IV. When taking the
      form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as plant shape III."
