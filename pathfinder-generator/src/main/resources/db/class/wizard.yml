description: "Beyond the veil of the mundane hide the secrets of absolute power. The\
  \ works of beings beyond mortals, the legends of realms where gods and spirits tread,\
  \ the lore of creations both wondrous and terrible--such mysteries call to those\
  \ with the ambition and the intellect to rise above the common folk to grasp true\
  \ might. Such is the path of the wizard. These shrewd magic-users seek, collect,\
  \ and covet esoteric knowledge, drawing on cultic arts to work wonders beyond the\
  \ abilities of mere mortals. While some might choose a particular field of magical\
  \ study and become masters of such powers, others embrace versatility, reveling\
  \ in the unbounded wonders of all magic. In either case, wizards prove a cunning\
  \ and potent lot, capable of smiting their foes, empowering their allies, and shaping\
  \ the world to their every desire. Role: While universalist wizards might study\
  \ to prepare themselves for any manner of danger, specialist wizards research schools\
  \ of magic that make them exceptionally skilled within a specific focus. Yet no\
  \ matter their specialty, all wizards are masters of the impossible and can aid\
  \ their allies in overcoming any danger. Alignment: Any Hit Die: d6 Starting Wealth:\
  \ 2d6 × 10 gp (average 70 gp.) In addition, each character begins play with an outfit\
  \ worth 10 gp or less."
