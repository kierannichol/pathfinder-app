description: "While many warriors strive to perfect their art, spending all of their\
  \ time honing their skill at martial arms, others spend as much effort dedicating\
  \ themselves to a cause. These warriors, known as cavaliers, swear themselves to\
  \ a purpose, serving it above all else. Cavaliers are skilled at fighting from horseback,\
  \ and are often found charging across a battlefield, with the symbol of their order\
  \ trailing on a long, fluttering banner. The cavalier's true power comes from the\
  \ conviction of his ideals, the oaths that he swears, and the challenges he makes.\
  \ Role: Cavaliers tend to marshal forces on the battlefield, using their mounted\
  \ talents and challenges to control the flow of the fight. Outside of battle, cavaliers\
  \ can be found advancing their cause through diplomacy and, if needed, subterfuge.\
  \ The cavalier is no stranger to courtly intrigue and can hold his own in even the\
  \ most delicate of social situations. Alignment: Any. Hit Dice: d10. Starting Wealth:\
  \ 5d6 × 10 gp (average 175gp.) In addition, each character begins play with an outfit\
  \ worth 10 gp or less."
