description: "Being a renowned hero can be dangerous to your health and prosperity.\
  \ Fighting against corruption and the evil that lurks within society makes you a\
  \ target and, even worse, puts your friends and family in danger. For those who\
  \ must maintain a social persona, being a part of the greater community while secretly\
  \ fighting against powerful forces within it requires leading a double life. By\
  \ day, the vigilante maneuvers through society, dealing with other nobles or influential\
  \ individuals. By night, he dons a disguise and an utterly different set of goals,\
  \ taking the fight to his foes and solving problems with a blade when words will\
  \ not suffice. Game Masters should consider carefully whether or not a vigilante\
  \ will make for a good fit with their campaign. The class is one that requires a\
  \ degree of social aptitude and roleplaying to make full use of its potential. Campaigns\
  \ that focus more on wilderness exploration, travel, or dungeon delving and that\
  \ are lighter on politics, negotiation, and manipulation might require a vigilante\
  \ player to put in additional effort to make full use of his class features. Alternatively,\
  \ a vigilante is uniquely suited to make for a powerful villain, hidden by day behind\
  \ a mask of civility and a terror at night, free to commit terrible acts without\
  \ risking discovery. For players, the vigilante offers a unique opportunity to take\
  \ on the role of a character with a hidden side, and whose life is committed to\
  \ a secret agenda that he must struggle to advance in a complex world. Not every\
  \ problem can be solved with a dagger in the dark, and even the most stubborn foe\
  \ might be become an ally with the proper bribe. For the vigilante, these tasks\
  \ are both within reach as long as you learn to properly use your dual nature and\
  \ hidden skills to your fullest advantage. Life can be unfair. Think of the starving\
  \ peasants forced to toil for the local baron or the common laborers tasked with\
  \ building the king's newest palace for a mere handful of copper pieces each week.\
  \ There are those who see these injustices and do nothing. There are those who are\
  \ willing to reap the rewards obtained through the suffering of others. Then there\
  \ are those who see inequality and find themselves driven to take action, outside\
  \ the law if necessary. These vigilantes operate in plain sight, hiding behind respectable\
  \ personas by day, but donning alternate guises by night to right the wrongs they\
  \ see all around them. Not all vigilantes are out to make the world a better place.\
  \ Some criminals hide behind the pretense of being ordinary folk, only to become\
  \ terrors in the shadows, stealing and killing to fulfill some dark agenda. In either\
  \ case, the vigilante is a character of two natures--the face that everyone knows\
  \ and the mask that inspires fear. Role: A vigilante can take on many tasks within\
  \ a group. Most are skilled at negotiating delicate social situations and courtly\
  \ intrigue, but they can also serve as stealthy spies or even brutish warriors in\
  \ dangerous environments. Alignment: Any. Hit Die: d8. Starting Wealth: 5d6 Ã— 10\

  name: "Dual Identity"
  label: null
  type: "Ex"
  description: "A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social\
    \ circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In\
    \ effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society\
    \ while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the\
    \ vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and\
    \ his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him.\
    \ Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless\
    \ the vigilante's true identity revealed to the world at large.The vigilante can\
    \ start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or\
    \ vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be\
    \ done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante's secret.Changing\
    \ identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is\
    \ certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering\
    \ his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as\
    \ much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar\
    \ spells and effects that change the user's appearance do not reduce the time\
    \ required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to\
    \ be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his\
    \ social identity risks exposing his secret.Despite being a single person, a vigilante's\
    \ dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities.\
    \ When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity's alignment for all\
    \ spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of\
    \ meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible\
    \ if both of his alignments meet the requirements.A vigilante's two alignments\
    \ cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For\
    \ example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante\
    \ identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral\
    \ good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would\
    \ change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.Any\
    \ attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante\
    \ is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the\
    \ creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise,\
    \ the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the\
    \ target were invalid or did not exist."
