description: "Role: More than capable of upholding the honor of their deities in battle,\
  \ clerics often prove stalwart and capable combatants. Their true strength lies\
  \ in their capability to draw upon the power of their deities, whether to increase\
  \ their own and their allies' prowess in battle, to vex their foes with divine magic,\
  \ or to lend healing to companions in need. As their powers are influenced by their\
  \ faith, all clerics must focus their worship upon a divine source. While the vast\
  \ majority of clerics revere a specific deity, a small number dedicate themselves\
  \ to a divine concept worthy of devotion--such as battle, death, justice, or knowledge--free\
  \ of a deific abstraction. (Work with your GM if you prefer this path to selecting\
  \ a specific deity.) Alignment: A cleric's alignment must be within one step of\
  \ her deity's, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis. Hit Die: d8\
  \ Starting Wealth: 4d6 × 10 gp (average 140 gp.) In addition, each character begins\
  \ play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less."
