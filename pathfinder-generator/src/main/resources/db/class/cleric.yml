description: "Role: More than capable of upholding the honor of their deities in
  battle, clerics often prove stalwart and capable combatants. Their true
  strength lies in their capability to draw upon the power of their deities,
  whether to increase their own and their allies' prowess in battle, to vex
  their foes with divine magic, or to lend healing to companions in need. As
  their powers are influenced by their faith, all clerics must focus their
  worship upon a divine source. While the vast majority of clerics revere a
  specific deity, a small number dedicate themselves to a divine concept worthy
  of devotion--such as battle, death, justice, or knowledge--free of a deific
  abstraction. (Work with your GM if you prefer this path to selecting a
  specific deity.) Alignment: A cleric's alignment must be within one step of
  her deity's, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis. Hit Die:
  d8 Starting Wealth: 4d6 × 10 gp (average 140 gp.) In addition, each character
  begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less."

    description: "Regardless of alignment, any cleric can release a wave of energy
      by channeling the power of her faith through her holy (or unholy) symbol.
      This energy can be used to cause or heal damage, depending on the type of
      energy channeled and the creatures targeted.

      A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) channels
      positive energy and can choose to deal damage to undead creatures or to
      heal living creatures. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an
      evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to
      living creatures or to heal undead creatures. A neutral cleric of a
      neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) must
      choose whether she channels positive or negative energy. Once this choice
      is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the
      cleric can cast spontaneous cure or inflict spells (see spontaneous
      casting).

      Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type
      (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the cleric. The
      amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6
      points of damage for every two cleric levels beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6
      at 5th, and so on). Creatures that take damage from channeled energy
      receive a Will save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is equal to
      10 + 1/2 the cleric’s level + the cleric’s Charisma modifier. Creatures
      healed by channel energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total—all
      excess healing is lost. A cleric may channel energy a number of times per
      day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. This is a standard action that
      does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A cleric can choose whether or
      not to include herself in this effect.

      A cleric must be able to present her holy symbol to use this ability."

    description: "A cleric's deity influences her alignment, what magic she can
      perform, her values, and how others see her. A cleric chooses two domains
      from among those belonging to her deity. A cleric can select an alignment
      domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if her alignment matches that
      domain. If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, she still
      selects two domains to represent her spiritual inclinations and abilities
      (subject to GM approval). The restriction on alignment domains still
      applies.Each domain grants a number of domain powers, dependent upon the
      level of the cleric, as well as a number of bonus spells. A cleric gains
      one domain spell slot for each level of cleric spell she can cast, from
      1st on up. Each day, a cleric can prepare one of the spells from her two
      domains in that slot. If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, a
      cleric can prepare it only in her domain spell slot. Domain spells cannot
      be used to cast spells spontaneously.In addition, a cleric gains the
      listed powers from both of her domains, if she is of a high enough level.
      Unless otherwise noted, activating a domain power is a standard action."
