description: "Role: More than capable of upholding the honor of their deities in battle,\
  \ clerics often prove stalwart and capable combatants. Their true strength lies\
  \ in their capability to draw upon the power of their deities, whether to increase\
  \ their own and their allies' prowess in battle, to vex their foes with divine magic,\
  \ or to lend healing to companions in need. As their powers are influenced by their\
  \ faith, all clerics must focus their worship upon a divine source. While the vast\
  \ majority of clerics revere a specific deity, a small number dedicate themselves\
  \ to a divine concept worthy of devotion--such as battle, death, justice, or knowledge--free\
  \ of a deific abstraction. (Work with your GM if you prefer this path to selecting\
  \ a specific deity.) Alignment: A cleric's alignment must be within one step of\
  \ her deity's, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis. Hit Die: d8\
  \ Starting Wealth: 4d6 × 10 gp (average 140 gp.) In addition, each character begins\
  \ play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less."

  description: "Regardless of alignment, any cleric can release a wave of energy by\
    \ channeling the power of her faith through her holy (or unholy) symbol. This\
    \ energy can be used to cause or heal damage, depending on the type of energy\
    \ channeled and the creatures targeted.\nA good cleric (or a neutral cleric who\
    \ worships a good deity) channels positive energy and can choose to deal damage\
    \ to undead creatures or to heal living creatures. An evil cleric (or a neutral\
    \ cleric who worships an evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to\
    \ deal damage to living creatures or to heal undead creatures. A neutral cleric\
    \ of a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) must choose\
    \ whether she channels positive or negative energy. Once this choice is made,\
    \ it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can\
    \ cast spontaneous cure or inflict spells (see spontaneous casting).\nChanneling\
    \ energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either undead\
    \ or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the cleric. The amount of damage\
    \ dealt or healed is equal to 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for\
    \ every two cleric levels beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on). Creatures\
    \ that take damage from channeled energy receive a Will save to halve the damage.\
    \ The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the cleric’s level + the cleric’s Charisma\
    \ modifier. Creatures healed by channel energy cannot exceed their maximum hit\
    \ point total—all excess healing is lost. A cleric may channel energy a number\
    \ of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. This is a standard action\
    \ that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A cleric can choose whether\
    \ or not to include herself in this effect.\nA cleric must be able to present\
    \ her holy symbol to use this ability."

  description: "A cleric's deity influences her alignment, what magic she can perform,\
