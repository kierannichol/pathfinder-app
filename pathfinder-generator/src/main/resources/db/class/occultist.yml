    \ make attacks against targets outside the circle, cast spells that cross the\

    \ any ability that would allow it to leave the circle or disturb the circle in\

    \ one additional implement school, to a maximum of seven schools at 18th level.\
    \ Each implement school adds one spell per spell level of that school of magic\
    \ to the occultist’s spell list. No spells from any other school are considered\
    \ to be on the occultist’s spell list until he selects the associated implement\
    \ school. He can’t use spell trigger or spell completion magic items from unknown\
    \ schools without succeeding at the appropriate Use Magic Device check. An occultist\
    \ can select an implement schools more than once in order to learn additional\
    \ spells from the associated school.\nEach implement schools is represented by\
    \ a small list of objects. Every day, the occultist selects one item from that\
    \ school’s list to be his implement for the day for each implement school he knows.\
    \ The occultist needs only one such item to cast spells of the corresponding school,\
    \ unless he selected that implement schools multiple times, in which case he needs\
    \ one item for each set of spells gained from that school. Implements don’t need\
    \ to be magic items, and non-magical implements don’t take up a magic item slot\
    \ even if they’re worn. Implements that are not magic items are often of some\
    \ historical value or of personal significance to the occultist, such as the finger\
    \ bone of a saint, the broken scepter of a long-dead king, the skull of a mentor’\
    s familiar, or the glass eye of an uncanny ancestor.\nWhenever an occultist casts\
    \ a spell, he must have the corresponding implement in his possession and present\
    \ the implement to the target or toward the area of effect.\nThis act is part\
    \ of casting the spell and doesn’t require any additional action. If the occultist\
    \ lacks the corresponding implement, he can attempt to cast the spell, but must\
    \ succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + the spell’s level) to do so. Spells\
    \ cast by an occultist without the appropriate implement are always treated as\
    \ if they were cast at the minimum caster level for the spell in question (caster\
    \ level 1st for a 1st-level spell, caster level 4th for a 2nd-level spell, and\
    \ so on).\nEach implement schools also grants a base focus power. This power is\
    \ added to the list of focus powers possessed by the occultist (see Mental Focus\
    \ below). In addition, each implement schools grants access to a number of other\
    \ focus powers that the occultist can select from using his mental focus class\

    \ the item. If the item is a magic item, the occultist learns its properties and\
    \ command word as if he had successfully examined the item using detect magic\
    \ and succeeded at a Spellcraft check. This ability does not reveal whether the\
    \ item is cursed unless the occultist’s class level is equal to or greater than\
    \ the caster level of the item. If the item has any historical significance, the\
    \ occultist learns one piece of information about its past (as determined by the\
    \ GM). Finally, if the item was last used no longer than 1 day ago per the occultist’\
    s class level, the occultist learns one piece of information about the last creature\
    \ to use the item. This information might be a glimpse of the creature’s appearance,\
    \ a brief vision of what it saw while using the item, or perhaps its emotional\
    \ state when it last used the item. The GM determines what information is gained\
    \ in this way. This functions like the psychometry occult skill unlock, but doesn’\
    t require a skill check and can be used at will."

  description: "At 8th level, the occultist learns the true name of one particular\
    \ outsider. This outsider can have no more than 3 Hit Dice. Whenever the occultist\
    \ creates a magic circle, he can expend 1 additional point of mental focus to\
    \ focus the circle inward and lure that outsider to the circle (similar to using\
    \ lesser planar binding). The outsider is bound for up to 10 minutes. During this\
    \ time, the occultist can bargain with the outsider for one piece of information.\n\
    This requires a payment of at least 20 gp (or items of at least that value that\
    \ are of interest to the outsider). The bargaining requires the occultist to attempt\
    \ a Diplomacy or Intimidate check opposed by the outsider’s Sense Motive check.\
    \ Succeeding at the check by 5 or more reduces this cost to 10 gp. Failure increases\
    \ the price to 30 gp, whereas failure by 5 or more allows the outsider to escape\
    \ without giving any information (or receiving payment). The information gained\
    \ can be anything that might be learned through a divination spell. The information\
    \ is always correct but is frequently cryptic. It typically takes the outsider\
    \ 1d3 hours to gather the information, at which point it returns of its own accord\
    \ to deliver the information as promised. The outsider always resents being used\
    \ in this way, even if the occultist and the outsider share an alignment component.\
    \ After the occultist bargains with the outsider, the magic circle loses all power\
    \ and the outsider is sent back to its home plane.\nAt 12th level and every 4\
    \ levels thereafter, the occultist learns to contact one additional outsider of\
    \ the same type or a different type. Although he can call only one outsider in\
    \ this way at a time, the occultist can ask such an outsider one additional question\
    \ per calling for every 4 occultist levels he possesses beyond 8th (to a maximum\
    \ of four questions at 20th level), all for the same bargaining price. The questions\
    \ must be in some way related to one another.\nAt 16th level, in lieu of asking\
    \ questions, the occultist can demand that the outsider deliver a message to any\
    \ one friendly creature that the occultist knows personally. The occultist can\
    \ also task the outsider to deliver one object weighing no more than 1 pound.\
    \ Either of these demands requires an opposed check as described above. Delivery\
    \ typically takes 1d4 hours, but this period is reduced to 1d6 minutes if the\
    \ recipient is within 1 mile of the occultist (or even less if the recipient is\
    \ within sight). The occultist must be able to accurately describe the recipient\
    \ in both name and appearance. This ability can’t be used to deliver anything\
    \ to a location, or to enemies or creatures that are unfriendly to the occultist."

  description: "At 4th level, an occultist gains the ability to shift his mental focus\

    \ Shifting mental focus removes a number of points of mental focus from one implement\
    \ and adds the same number – 1 to another implement; this takes 1 minute of quiet\
    \ contemplation while touching both implements. The occultist can shift his mental\
    \ focus only from one implement to another implement; he can’t shift generic focus\
    \ into an implement. Unlike expending focus normally, this shift can reduce the\
    \ effect of a resonant power in the implement from which the mental focus was\
    \ taken. It does not, however, add to the resonant power of the implement to which\
    \ the focus is added."

    \ score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving\
    \ throw against an occultist’s spell equals 10 + the spell level + the occultist’\
    s Intelligence modifier.\nAn occultist can cast only a certain number of spells\
    \ of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table:\
    \ Occultist. In addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence\
    \ score.\nThe occultist’s selection of spells is limited. For each implement school\
    \ he learns to use, he can add one spell of each level he can cast to his list\

    \ as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower\
    \ than the highest-level occultist spell the occultist can cast. The spell learned\
    \ must come from the same list of spells provided by the implement school of the\
    \ spell lost. An occultist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and\
    \ must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains\
    \ new spells known for that level.\nAn occultist need not prepare his spells in\
