      A binding circle is invisible and counts as a trap. If a living creature
      of the corresponding alignment steps inside it, the trap triggers and
      binds the creature inside the circle. While it can move freely within the
      circle, it can’t leave the circle, make attacks against targets outside
      the circle, cast spells that cross the circle’s boundary (the circle
      blocks line of effect from the inside), or use any ability that would
      allow it to leave the circle or disturb the circle in any way. When the
      circle traps a creature in this way, the creature can attempt a Reflex
      save to dive out of the circle before the magic takes hold (DC = 10 + 1/2
      the occultist’s level + the occultist’s Intelligence modifier).

      A creature that can see the circle gains a +4 bonus on this save. If it
      fails its save, the creature must remain in the circle, although it can
      attempt a Will save at the same DC at the end of each hour of imprisonment
      to escape. A binding circle can be spotted with a successful Perception
      check (DC = 25 + 1/2 the occultist’s level). It can also be disarmed using
      Disable Device, with the same DC. Anything crossing the boundary of the
      circle from the outside, such as a weapon, spell effect, or special

    description: "At 1st level, an occultist learns to use two implement schools. At
      2nd level and every 4 occultist levels thereafter, the occultist learns to
      use one additional implement school, to a maximum of seven schools at 18th
      level. Each implement school adds one spell per spell level of that school
      of magic to the occultist’s spell list. No spells from any other school
      are considered to be on the occultist’s spell list until he selects the
      associated implement school. He can’t use spell trigger or spell
      completion magic items from unknown schools without succeeding at the
      appropriate Use Magic Device check. An occultist can select an implement
      schools more than once in order to learn additional spells from the
      associated school.

      Each implement schools is represented by a small list of objects. Every
      day, the occultist selects one item from that school’s list to be his
      implement for the day for each implement school he knows. The occultist
      needs only one such item to cast spells of the corresponding school,
      unless he selected that implement schools multiple times, in which case he
      needs one item for each set of spells gained from that school. Implements
      don’t need to be magic items, and non-magical implements don’t take up a
      magic item slot even if they’re worn. Implements that are not magic items
      are often of some historical value or of personal significance to the
      occultist, such as the finger bone of a saint, the broken scepter of a
      long-dead king, the skull of a mentor’s familiar, or the glass eye of an
      uncanny ancestor.

      Whenever an occultist casts a spell, he must have the corresponding
      implement in his possession and present the implement to the target or
      toward the area of effect.

      This act is part of casting the spell and doesn’t require any additional
      action. If the occultist lacks the corresponding implement, he can attempt
      to cast the spell, but must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 +
      the spell’s level) to do so. Spells cast by an occultist without the
      appropriate implement are always treated as if they were cast at the
      minimum caster level for the spell in question (caster level 1st for a
      1st-level spell, caster level 4th for a 2nd-level spell, and so on).

      Each implement schools also grants a base focus power. This power is added
      to the list of focus powers possessed by the occultist (see Mental Focus
      below). In addition, each implement schools grants access to a number of
      other focus powers that the occultist can select from using his mental
      focus class feature.

      See implement schools for a complete list of implements associated with
      each school and their focus powers."

      draw a circle, he must have chalk, salt, blood, powdered silver, or some
      other appropriate substance at hand (although he can press a magic circle
      into a softer surface such as dirt or clay). Drawing a circle takes 1
      minute and requires the occultist to expend 1 point of mental focus
      (either generic focus or focus from any one of his implements). Once
      completed, this circle functions as a permanent magic circle against any
      alignment of the occultist’s choosing. The circle can’t be against a
      component of the occultist’s alignment (if he is lawful good, for example,
      it can’t be a magic circle against good or law). The circle remains until
      its form is physically broken (for example, if the lines are smeared or
      the salt is scattered).

      Only a living creature can break the circle; environmental effects can’t
      break it. An occultist can have only one circle created in this way at a
      time. If he creates a second circle, the first one loses all its magic
      powers. This type of magic circle can’t normally be focused inward to bind

    description: "An occultist can invest a portion of his mental focus into his
      chosen implements for the day, allowing him to utilize a variety of
      abilities depending on the implements and the amount of mental focus
      invested in them.

      An occultist has a number of points of mental focus equal to his occultist
      level + his Intelligence modifier; these points refresh each day. He can
      divide this mental focus between his implements in any way he desires. If
      an implement is lost or destroyed, the focus invested in it is lost as
      well, though the occultist still refreshes those points of focus normally.

      Once mental focus is invested inside an implement, the implement gains the
      resonant power of its implement school, and the occultist can expend the
      mental focus stored in the implement to activate the associated focus
      powers he knows. If a resonant power grants a bonus that varies based on
      the amount of mental focus invested in the implement, the bonus is
      determined when the focus is invested, and is not reduced or altered by
      expending the mental focus invested in the item. Once all of the mental
      focus in an implement has been expended, it loses its resonant power until
      mental focus is once again invested in the implement.

      The implement grants its resonant power to whoever possesses it; the
      occultist can lend the implement to an ally to assist that ally, but if he
      does so, he has difficulty casting that implement’s spells (see
      Implements) and can’t expend that implement’s focus on focus powers until
      he retrieves the implement or refreshes his focus.

      The occultist refreshes his mental focus once each day after receiving at
      least 8 hours of sleep. After refreshing his mental focus, the occultist
      must spend 1 hour preparing his implements and investing them with this
      power. Mental focus that is not used before the next time the occultist
      refreshes his focus is lost.

      The occultist can choose to save generic mental focus inside his own body
      instead of investing all of it, but expending this focus comes at a higher
      cost.

      Any focus power the occultist activates with generic focus costs twice as
      much mental focus to use (and to maintain, if applicable). The occultist
      can expend his generic focus through an appropriate implement on any focus
      power he knows, but an implement he didn’t invest any focus in at the
      start of the day grants no resonant power."

      magic and succeeded at a Spellcraft check. This ability does not reveal
      whether the item is cursed unless the occultist’s class level is equal to
      or greater than the caster level of the item. If the item has any
      historical significance, the occultist learns one piece of information
      about its past (as determined by the GM). Finally, if the item was last
      used no longer than 1 day ago per the occultist’s class level, the
      occultist learns one piece of information about the last creature to use
      the item. This information might be a glimpse of the creature’s
      appearance, a brief vision of what it saw while using the item, or perhaps
      its emotional state when it last used the item. The GM determines what

    description: "At 8th level, the occultist learns the true name of one particular
      outsider. This outsider can have no more than 3 Hit Dice. Whenever the
      occultist creates a magic circle, he can expend 1 additional point of
      mental focus to focus the circle inward and lure that outsider to the
      circle (similar to using lesser planar binding). The outsider is bound for
      up to 10 minutes. During this time, the occultist can bargain with the
      outsider for one piece of information.

      This requires a payment of at least 20 gp (or items of at least that value
      that are of interest to the outsider). The bargaining requires the
      occultist to attempt a Diplomacy or Intimidate check opposed by the
      outsider’s Sense Motive check. Succeeding at the check by 5 or more
      reduces this cost to 10 gp. Failure increases the price to 30 gp, whereas
      failure by 5 or more allows the outsider to escape without giving any
      information (or receiving payment). The information gained can be anything
      that might be learned through a divination spell. The information is
      always correct but is frequently cryptic. It typically takes the outsider
      1d3 hours to gather the information, at which point it returns of its own
      accord to deliver the information as promised. The outsider always resents
      being used in this way, even if the occultist and the outsider share an
      alignment component. After the occultist bargains with the outsider, the
      magic circle loses all power and the outsider is sent back to its home
      plane.

      At 12th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the occultist learns to
      contact one additional outsider of the same type or a different type.
      Although he can call only one outsider in this way at a time, the
      occultist can ask such an outsider one additional question per calling for
      every 4 occultist levels he possesses beyond 8th (to a maximum of four
      questions at 20th level), all for the same bargaining price. The questions
      must be in some way related to one another.

      At 16th level, in lieu of asking questions, the occultist can demand that
      the outsider deliver a message to any one friendly creature that the
      occultist knows personally. The occultist can also task the outsider to
      deliver one object weighing no more than 1 pound. Either of these demands
      requires an opposed check as described above. Delivery typically takes 1d4
      hours, but this period is reduced to 1d6 minutes if the recipient is
      within 1 mile of the occultist (or even less if the recipient is within
      sight). The occultist must be able to accurately describe the recipient in
      both name and appearance. This ability can’t be used to deliver anything
      to a location, or to enemies or creatures that are unfriendly to the

      Intelligence modifier.

      An occultist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level
      per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Occultist. In
      addition, he gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence
      score.

      The occultist’s selection of spells is limited. For each implement school
      he learns to use, he can add one spell of each level he can cast to his
      list of spells known, chosen from that school’s spell list. If he selects
      the same implement school multiple times, he adds one spell of each level
      from that school’s list for each time he has selected that school.

      When the occultist learns to cast a new level of spells, he immediately
      adds one spell of that level to his list of spells known from each
      implement school he knows (plus any extra spells from schools he has
      selected multiple times).

      At 5th level and every 3 occultist levels thereafter (8th, 11th, and so
      on), an occultist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he
      already knows. In effect, the occultist loses the old spell in exchange

      spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the
      highest-level occultist spell the occultist can cast. The spell learned
      must come from the same list of spells provided by the implement school of
      the spell lost. An occultist can swap only a single spell at any given
      level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time
      that he gains new spells known for that level.

      An occultist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell
      he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of
      spells per day for the spell’s level."
