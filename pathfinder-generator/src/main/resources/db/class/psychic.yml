description: "Within the mind of any sentient being lies power to rival that of
  the greatest magical artifact or holy site. By accessing these staggering
  vaults of mental energy, the psychic can shape the world around her, the minds
  of others, and pathways across the planes. No place or idea is too secret or
  remote for a psychic to access, and she can pull from every type of psychic
  magic. Many methods allow psychics to tap into their mental abilities, and the
  disciplines they follow affect their abilities."

      draw upon to manipulate psychic spells as she casts them. The maximum
      number of points in a psychic’s phrenic pool is equal to 1/2 her psychic
      level + her Wisdom or Charisma modifier, as determined by her psychic
      discipline. The phrenic pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of
      rest or meditation; these hours don’t need to be consecutive. The psychic
      might be able to recharge points in her phrenic pool in additional

    description: "A psychic develops particular techniques to empower her
      spellcasting, called phrenic amplifications. The psychic can activate a
      phrenic amplification only while casting a spell using psychic magic, and
      the amplification modifies either the spell’s effects or the process of
      casting it. The spell being cast is called the linked spell. The psychic
      can activate only one amplification each time she casts a spell, and doing
      so is part of the action used to cast the spell. She can use any
      amplification she knows with any psychic spell, unless the amplification’s
      description states that it can be linked only to certain types of spells.
      A psychic learns one phrenic amplification at 1st level, selected from the
      list below. At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, the psychic learns
      a new phrenic amplification."

      nondetection, the DC of the caster level check for using a divination on
      the warded creature or item would increase. This increase also applies to
      checks to dispel, counterspell, or identify the linked spell. The bonus
      applies while the spell is cast and lasts for the spell’s duration (if
      appropriate), to a maximum of 24 hours. The psychic can choose to spend 2

      1d10, or 1d10 to 1d12). This increases the size of each die rolled, so a
      spell that dealt 4d6+3 points of force damage would deal 4d8+3 points of
      force damage instead. This amplification can be linked only to spells that
      deal force damage, and only if that damage includes a die value. A spell
      that already uses d12s for damage can’t be amplified in this way."

      ranged attack roll, the psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool

    description: "The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to probe one
      target’s mind if that creature is affected by the linked spell. If the
      target of the linked spell fails its saving throw or is hit by the spell,
      the psychic detects its surface thoughts (as the 3rd-round effect of
      detect thoughts). If the linked spell doesn’t already require an attack
      roll or allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Will Saving Throw
      to avoid the thought-detection effect only; the DC is calculated using the
      linked spell’s level (and all other bonuses that would apply if the linked
      spell allowed a Will save). This amplification can be linked only to
      spells that affect a target or an area. If the linked spell can affect
      more than one creature, the psychic can attempt to detect more than one
      target’s thoughts by spending 1 additional point per creature beyond the
      first. She must select these targets when she casts the spell and spends
      the points. This is a mind-affecting effect."

      a lower-level spell slot to cast a higher-level version of the spell. This
      costs 2 points per spell level increased. She can’t use this ability to
      cast a version higher than the version she knows. For instance, a psychic
      who knows mind thrust III but not mind thrust IV could cast mind thrust II
      and spend 2 points to treat it as mind thrust III, but couldn’t spend 4

    description: "Each psychic accesses and improves her mental powers through a
      particular method, such as rigorous study or attaining a particular mental
      state.


      This is called her psychic discipline. She gains additional spells known
      based on her selected discipline. The choice of discipline must be made at
      1st level; once made, it can’t be changed. Each psychic discipline gives
      the psychic a number of discipline powers (at 1st, 5th, and 13th levels),
      and grants her additional spells known. In addition, the discipline
      determines which ability score the psychic uses for her phrenic pool and
      phrenic amplifications abilities. The DC of a saving throw against a
      psychic discipline ability equals 10 + 1/2 the psychic’s level + the
      psychic’s Intelligence modifier.


      At 1st level, a psychic learns an additional spell determined by her
      discipline. She learns another additional spell at 4th level and every 2
      levels thereafter, until learning the final one at 18th level. These
      spells are in addition to the number of spells given. Spells learned from
      a discipline can’t be exchanged for different spells at higher levels."
