description: "Within the mind of any sentient being lies power to rival that of
  the greatest magical artifact or holy site. By accessing these staggering
  vaults of mental energy, the psychic can shape the world around her, the minds
  of others, and pathways across the planes. No place or idea is too secret or
  remote for a psychic to access, and she can pull from every type of psychic
  magic. Many methods allow psychics to tap into their mental abilities, and the
  disciplines they follow affect their abilities."

    type: "Su"
    description: "A psychic has a pool of supernatural mental energy that she can
      draw upon to manipulate psychic spells as she casts them. The maximum
      number of points in a psychic’s phrenic pool is equal to 1/2 her psychic
      level + her Wisdom or Charisma modifier, as determined by her psychic
      discipline. The phrenic pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of
      rest or meditation; these hours don’t need to be consecutive. The psychic
      might be able to recharge points in her phrenic pool in additional
      circumstances dictated by her psychic discipline. Points gained in excess
      of the pool’s maximum are lost."
  - id: "ability:phrenic_amplification#psychic"
    name: "Phrenic Amplification"
    type: "Su"
    description: "A psychic develops particular techniques to empower her
      spellcasting, called phrenic amplifications. The psychic can activate a
      phrenic amplification only while casting a spell using psychic magic, and
      the amplification modifies either the spell’s effects or the process of
      casting it. The spell being cast is called the linked spell. The psychic
      can activate only one amplification each time she casts a spell, and doing
      so is part of the action used to cast the spell. She can use any
      amplification she knows with any psychic spell, unless the amplification’s
      description states that it can be linked only to certain types of spells.
      A psychic learns one phrenic amplification at 1st level, selected from the
      list below. At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, the psychic learns
      a new phrenic amplification."

    description: "When the psychic casts a linked spell from the transmutation
      school, she can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to regain 2 hit points
      per level of the linked spell."
  - id: "ability:complex_countermeasure#psychic"
    name: "Complex Countermeasure"
    description: "The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to increase by
      2 the DCs of concentration checks or caster level checks the linked spell
      requires enemies to attempt. For example, if the linked spell were
      nondetection, the DC of the caster level check for using a divination on
      the warded creature or item would increase. This increase also applies to
      checks to dispel, counterspell, or identify the linked spell. The bonus
      applies while the spell is cast and lasts for the spell’s duration (if
      appropriate), to a maximum of 24 hours. The psychic can choose to spend 2
      points from her phrenic pool to instead increase the linked spell’s DCs by
      4."
