  \ paladins, these noble souls dedicate their swords and lives to the battle against\

  \ of their lofty goals, they adhere to ironclad laws of morality and discipline.\
  \ As reward for their righteousness, these holy champions are blessed with boons\
  \ to aid them in their quests: powers to banish evil, heal the innocent, and inspire\
  \ the faithful. Although their convictions might lead them into conflict with the\
  \ very souls they would save, paladins weather endless challenges of faith and dark\
  \ temptations, risking their lives to do right and fighting to bring about a brighter\
  \ future. Role: Paladins serve as beacons for their allies within the chaos of battle.\
  \ While deadly opponents of evil, they can also empower goodly souls to aid in their\
  \ crusades. Their magic and martial skills also make them well suited to defending\
  \ others and blessing the fallen with the strength to continue fighting. Alignment:\

  description: "Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin forms a divine bond with her god.\
    \ This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.The\
    \ first type of bond allows the paladin to enhance her weapon as a standard action\
    \ by calling upon the aid of a celestial spirit for 1 minute per paladin level.\
    \ When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed light as a torch. At 5th level,\
    \ this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels\
    \ beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6\
    \ at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing\
    \ weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following\
    \ weapon properties: axiomatic, brilliant energy, defending, disruption, flaming,\
    \ flaming burst, holy, keen, merciful, and speed. Adding these properties consumes\
    \ an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table: Melee Weapon Special\
    \ Abilities). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has,\
    \ but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least\
    \ a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added.\
    \ The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit\
    \ is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial\
    \ spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the paladin\
    \ but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the paladin. These bonuses apply to\
    \ only one end of a double weapon. A paladin can use this ability once per day\
    \ at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th,\
    \ to a total of four times per day at 17th level.If a weapon bonded with a celestial\
    \ spirit is destroyed, the paladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days,\
    \ or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period,\
    \ the paladin takes a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.The second\
    \ type of bond allows a paladin to gain the service of an unusually intelligent,\
    \ strong, and loyal steed to serve her in her crusade against evil. This mount\
    \ is usually a heavy horse (for a Medium paladin) or a pony (for a Small paladin),\
    \ although more exotic mounts, such as a boar, camel, or dog are also suitable.\
    \ This mount functions as a druid's animal companion, using the paladin's level\
    \ as her effective druid level. Bonded mounts have an Intelligence of at least\
    \ 6.In addition to horses, a paladin may select (at the GM's discretion) some\
    \ less ordinary creatures.A Medium paladin can select an elkPPC:WO, giant seahorsePPC:WO,\
    \ giraffePPC:WO, yakPZO1140 or zebraPZO1140 as a bonded mount.A Small paladin\
    \ can select an antelopePPC:WO, capybaraPZO1140, eohippusPZO1140, giant weaselPPC:WO,\
    \ ramPPC:WO, reindeerPZO1140, stagPPC:WO, or wolfdogPZO1140 as a bonded mount.The\
    \ auspice, bodyguard, racer, and totem guide archetypes are all particularly appropriate\
    \ for a paladin's bonded mount.Once per day, as a full-round action, a paladin\
    \ may magically call her mount to her side. This ability is the equivalent of\
    \ a spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin's level. The mount immediately\
    \ appears adjacent to the paladin. A paladin can use this ability once per day\
    \ at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels thereafter,\
    \ for a total of four times per day at 17th level.At 11th level, the mount gains\
    \ the celestial creature simple template and becomes a magical beast for the purposes\
    \ of determining which spells affect it.At 15th level, a paladin's mount gains\
    \ spell resistance equal to the paladin's level + 11.Should the paladin's mount\
    \ die, the paladin may not summon another mount for 30 days or until she gains\
    \ a paladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the paladin\
