description: "Some spellcasters seek the secrets of magic, pursuing the power to make\
  \ the impossible possible. Others are born with magic in their blood, commanding\
  \ unbelievable forces as effortlessly as they breathe. Yet still others seek to\
  \ meld the science of arcane scholars with the natural might of innate casters.\
  \ These arcanists seek to discover the mysterious laws of magic and through will\
  \ and expertise bend those forces to their whims. Arcanists are the shapers and\
  \ tinkers of the arcane world, and no magic can resist their control. Role: Arcanists\
  \ are scholars of all things magical. They constantly seek out new forms of magic\
  \ to discover how they work, and in many cases, to collect the energy of such magic\
  \ for their own uses. Many arcanists are seen as reckless, more concerned with the\
  \ potency of magic than the ramifications of unleashing such power. Alignment: Any.\
  \ Hit Die: d6. Parent Classes: Sorcerer and wizard. Starting Wealth: 2d6 × 10 gp\
  \ (average 70 gp.) In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth\
  \ 10 gp or less."
