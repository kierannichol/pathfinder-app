description: "There are those who take a different path when pursuing the arcane arts,\
  \ reaching across the boundaries of the world to the far-f lung planes to call forth\
  \ all manner of creatures to do their bidding. Known as summoners, these arcane\
  \ practitioners form close bonds with particular outsiders, known as eidolons, which\
  \ increase in power along with their callers. In the end, summoners and their eidolons\
  \ become linked, sharing shards of the same souls. Role: Summoners spend much of\
  \ their time exploring the arcane arts alongside their eidolons. While their power\
  \ comes from within, they rely heavily on their eidolon companions in dangerous\
  \ situations. While a summoner and his eidolon function as individuals, their true\
  \ power lies in what they can accomplish together. Unchained: Most of the summoner's\
  \ class features are the same as those of the class's original design--the biggest\
  \ change comes to the eidolon. The unchained summoner selects a subtype for his\
  \ eidolon (such as angel, demon, or protean), which determines a number of its evolutions\
  \ and helps to shape the eidolon's general attitude and appearance. In addition,\
  \ some of the evolutions are now tied to one or more subtypes and base forms, to\
  \ make eidolons that better match the expected appearances and abilities of such\
  \ creatures. Finally, the summoner spell list has been greatly revised, removing\
  \ a number of imbalances. Alignment: Any. Hit Die: d8."

    \ of its abilities. An eidolon must be within one alignment step of the summoner\
    \ who calls it (so a neutral good summoner can call a neutral, lawful good, or\
    \ chaotic good eidolon) and can speak all of his languages. An eidolon is treated\
    \ as a summoned creature, except it is not sent back to its home plane until reduced\
    \ to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution\
    \ score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and\
    \ attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent\
    \ contact with summoned creatures.A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual\
    \ that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon's hit\
    \ points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception\
    \ to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its\
    \ normal hit points. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains\
    \ until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent\
    \ back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following\
    \ day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of dispel magic,\
    \ but spells such as dismissal and banishment function normally. If the summoner\
    \ is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished.The eidolon\
    \ takes a form shaped by the summoner's desires. The eidolon's Hit Dice, saving\
    \ throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner's class level\
    \ and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon gains a\
    \ pool of evolution points based on the summoner's class level that can be used\
    \ to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains\
    \ a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he\
    \ gains another level of summoner.The eidolon's physical appearance is up to the\
    \ summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature appropriate\
    \ to its subtype. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like\
    \ a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical\
    \ to a rune that appears on the summoner's forehead as long as the eidolon is\
    \ summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be\
    \ concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as alter self or polymorph\
    \ (although invisibility does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).See the Eidolon\
    \ Unchained rules here."
