description: "For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical\
  \ fighter. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by\
  \ the thunderous rhythm of gunfire--the pounding beat of the gunslinger. Gunslingers\
  \ are a bold and mysterious lot. While many treat the secrets of black powder with\
  \ the same care and reverence that a wizard typically reserves for his spellbook,\
  \ most gunslingers know that firearms are a secret that cannot remain concealed\
  \ forever. While current firearms are simple, often imprecise, and even dangerous\
  \ devices, they are a technology on the move, and one that will become even more\
  \ powerful when it is fully fused with magic. Role: Gunslingers are thunderous artillery,\
  \ often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy,\
  \ many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing,\
  \ to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters\
  \ of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous\
  \ weapons. Alignment: Any. Hit Die: d10. Starting Wealth: 5d6 x 10 gp (average 175gp)\
  \ In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less, and\
  \ the gunslinger begins with her starting firearm."

  description: "A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some\
    \ gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely\
    \ that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless\
    \ from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms,\
    \ grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions\
    \ in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains a number of grit points\
    \ equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Her grit goes up or down throughout\
    \ the day, but usually cannot go higher than her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1),\
    \ though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends\
    \ grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains grit in the following ways.Critical\
    \ Hit with a Firearm: Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a\
    \ firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming\
    \ a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer\
    \ Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.Killing\
    \ Blow with a Firearm: When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit\
    \ points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit\
    \ point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature\
    \ to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than\
    \ half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore\
    \ any grit."
