description: "Whereas many warriors brave battle encased in suits of armor and wielding\
  \ large and powerful weapons, swashbucklers rely on speed, agility, and panache.\
  \ Swashbucklers dart in and out of the fray, wearing down opponents with lunges\
  \ and feints, all while foiling the powerful attacks against them with a flick of\
  \ the wrist and a flash of the blade. Their deft parries and fatal ripostes are\
  \ carnage elevated to an art form. Some may be arrogant and devil-may-care, but\
  \ behind this veneer lie people deeply dedicated to their craft. Those of smaller\
  \ races are particularly driven to prove that the right mix of discipline and daring\
  \ is the perfect counter to size and strength, and enjoy nothing more than taking\
  \ down lumbering brutes and bullies. Role: Combining fancy footwork with quick and\
  \ precise lunges, swashbucklers dart in and out of battle, harassing and thwarting\
  \ their opponents. These fast and agile combatants serve as protectors for spellcasters\
  \ and flank mates for rogues and slayers, while waiting for the opportunity to show\
  \ panache and score the killing blow on some lumbering hulk. Swashbucklers often\
  \ face death with wry humor, mocking it with jabbing wit. Alignment: Any. Hit Die:\
  \ d10. Parent Classes: Fighter and gunslinger. Starting Wealth: 5d6 × 10 gp (average\
  \ 175 gp.) In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or\
  \ less."
