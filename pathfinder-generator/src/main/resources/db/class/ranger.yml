description: "For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators\
  \ and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common:\
  \ unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive\
  \ game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient,\
  \ and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining\
  \ insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more\
  \ lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier,\
  \ others pursue more cunning game--even fugitives among their own people. Role:\
  \ Ranger are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully\
  \ dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm\
  \ to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of\
  \ enemies. Alignment: Any Hit Die: d10 Starting Wealth: 5d6 × 10 gp (average 175\
  \ gp.) In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less."

    \ bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum\

    \ allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.The second option is to form a close\

    \ choose from the following list: badger, bird, camel, cat (small), dire rat,\
    \ dog, horse, pony, snake (viper or constrictor), or wolf. If the campaign takes\
    \ place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose a shark\
