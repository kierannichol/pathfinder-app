description: "Whether on the trail of a fugitive, a long-lost treasure trove, or a\
  \ criminal mastermind, investigators are motivated by an intense curiosity about\
  \ the world and use knowledge of it as a weapon. Mixing gumption and learnedness\
  \ into a personal alchemy of daring, investigators are full of surprises. Observing\
  \ the world around them, they gain valuable knowledge about the situation they're\
  \ in, process that information using inspiration and deduction, and cut to the quick\
  \ of the matter in unexpected ways. Investigators are always evaluating situations\
  \ they encounter, sizing up potential foes, and looking out for secret dangers,\
  \ all while using their vast knowledge and powers of perception to find solutions\
  \ to the most perplexing problems. Role: Investigators live to solve mysteries and\
  \ find inventive ways to get out of jams. They serve as advisors and support for\
  \ their adventuring parties, but can take center stage when knowledge and cunning\
  \ are needed. No slouches in battle, they know how to make surprise attacks and\
  \ use inspiration to bring those attacks home. Alignment: Any. Hit Die: d8. Parent\
  \ Classes: Alchemist and rogue. Starting Wealth: 3d6 × 10 gp (average 105 gp.) In\

  description: "Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical\
    \ substances and magical potion-like extracts.When using Craft (alchemy) to create\
    \ an alchemical item, an investigator gains a competence bonus equal to his class\
    \ level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use Craft (alchemy)\
    \ to identify potions as if using detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1\
    \ round to attempt such a check.Like an alchemist, an investigator prepares his\
    \ spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into\
    \ a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract.\
    \ These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator.\
    \ Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be\
    \ dispelled by dispel magic and similar effects, using the investigator's level\
    \ as the caster level.An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts\
    \ of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given\
    \ on Table: Investigator. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he\
    \ has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells\
    \ per day.When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and\
    \ reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract\
    \ immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator's possession, reactivating\
    \ as soon as it returns to his keeping--an investigator cannot normally pass out\
    \ his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for\
    \ 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts\
    \ every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.Creating extracts consumes\
    \ raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant--comparable to\
    \ the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a\
    \ costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption\
    \ of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus\
    \ requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus\
    \ requirement.An investigator uses the alchemist formulae list to determine the\
    \ extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formulae\
    \ he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an\
    \ Intelligence score equal to 10 + the extract's level. The saving throw DC for\
    \ an investigator's extract is equal to 10 + the extract's level + the investigator's\
    \ Intelligence modifier.An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores\
    \ his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this\
    \ book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with\
    \ two 1st-level formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal\
    \ to his Intelligence modifier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new\
    \ formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae\
    \ to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same\
    \ costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a spellbook.\
    \ An investigator can study a wizard's spellbook to learn any formula that is\
    \ equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn\
    \ spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another\
    \ investigator's or an alchemist's formula book (and vice versa). An investigator\
    \ does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae."
