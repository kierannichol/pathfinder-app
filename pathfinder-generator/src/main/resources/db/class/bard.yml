description: "Untold wonders and secrets exist for those skillful enough to
  discover them. Through cleverness, talent, and magic, these cunning few
  unravel the wiles of the world, becoming adept in the arts of persuasion,
  manipulation, and inspiration. Typically masters of one or many forms of
  artistry, bards possess an uncanny ability to know more than they should and
  use what they learn to keep themselves and their allies ever one step ahead of
  danger. Bards are quick-witted and captivating, and their skills might lead
  them down many paths, be they gamblers or jacks-of-all-trades, scholars or
  performers, leaders or scoundrels, or even all of the above. For bards, every
  day brings its own opportunities, adventures, and challenges, and only by
  bucking the odds, knowing the most, and being the best might they claim the
  treasures of each. Role: Bards capably confuse and confound their foes while
  inspiring their allies to ever-greater daring. While accomplished with both
  weapons and magic, the true strength of bards lies outside melee, where they
  can support their companions and undermine their foes without fear of
  interruptions to their performances. Alignment: Any Hit Die: d8 Starting
  Wealth: 3d6 × 10 gp (average 105 gp.) In addition, each character begins play
  with an outfit worth 10 gp or less."

      effects on those around him, including himself if desired. He can use this
      ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Charisma modifier.
      At each level after 1st a bard can use bardic performance for 2 additional
      rounds per day. Each round, the bard can produce any one of the types of
      bardic performance that he has mastered, as indicated by his
      level.Starting a bardic performance is a standard action, but it can be
      maintained each round as a free action. Changing a bardic performance from
      one effect to another requires the bard to stop the previous performance
      and start a new one as a standard action. A bardic performance cannot be
      disrupted, but it ends immediately if the bard is killed, paralyzed,
      stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free
      action to maintain it each round. A bard cannot have more than one bardic
      performance in effect at one time.At 7th level, a bard can start a bardic
      performance as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level,
      a bard can start a bardic performance as a swift action.Each bardic
      performance has audible components, visual components, or both.If a bardic
      performance has audible components, the targets must be able to hear the
      bard for the performance to have any effect, and many such performances
      are language dependent (as noted in the description). A deaf bard has a
      20% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with an
      audible component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts
      against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to bardic performances
      with audible components.If a bardic performance has a visual component,
      the targets must have line of sight to the bard for the performance to
      have any effect. A blind bard has a 50% chance to fail when attempting to
      use a bardic performance with a visual component. If he fails this check,

      attack may use the bard’s Perform check result in place of its saving
      throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result

      paying attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creatures

      observes the performance for as long as the bard continues to maintain it.
      While fascinated, a target takes a –4 penalty on skill checks made as
      reactions, such as Perception checks. Any potential threat to the target
      allows the target to make a new saving throw against the effect. Any

      use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in associated skills.
      When substituting in this way, the bard uses his total Perform skill
      bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of its associated skill's
      bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class
      skill. At 6th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the bard can select an
      additional type of Perform to substitute.The types of Perform and their
      associated skills are: Act (Bluff, Disguise), Comedy (Bluff, Intimidate),
      Dance (Acrobatics, Fly), Keyboard Instruments (Diplomacy, Intimidate),
      Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate),
      Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind
