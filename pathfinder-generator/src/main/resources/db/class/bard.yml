description: "Untold wonders and secrets exist for those skillful enough to discover\
  \ them. Through cleverness, talent, and magic, these cunning few unravel the wiles\
  \ of the world, becoming adept in the arts of persuasion, manipulation, and inspiration.\
  \ Typically masters of one or many forms of artistry, bards possess an uncanny ability\
  \ to know more than they should and use what they learn to keep themselves and their\
  \ allies ever one step ahead of danger. Bards are quick-witted and captivating,\
  \ and their skills might lead them down many paths, be they gamblers or jacks-of-all-trades,\
  \ scholars or performers, leaders or scoundrels, or even all of the above. For bards,\
  \ every day brings its own opportunities, adventures, and challenges, and only by\
  \ bucking the odds, knowing the most, and being the best might they claim the treasures\
  \ of each. Role: Bards capably confuse and confound their foes while inspiring their\
  \ allies to ever-greater daring. While accomplished with both weapons and magic,\
  \ the true strength of bards lies outside melee, where they can support their companions\
  \ and undermine their foes without fear of interruptions to their performances.\
  \ Alignment: Any Hit Die: d8 Starting Wealth: 3d6 × 10 gp (average 105 gp.) In addition,\
  \ each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less."

    \ after 1st a bard can use bardic performance for 2 additional rounds per day.\
    \ Each round, the bard can produce any one of the types of bardic performance\
    \ that he has mastered, as indicated by his level.Starting a bardic performance\
    \ is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action.\
    \ Changing a bardic performance from one effect to another requires the bard to\
    \ stop the previous performance and start a new one as a standard action. A bardic\
    \ performance cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the bard is killed,\
    \ paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking\
    \ a free action to maintain it each round. A bard cannot have more than one bardic\
    \ performance in effect at one time.At 7th level, a bard can start a bardic performance\
    \ as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a bard can start\
    \ a bardic performance as a swift action.Each bardic performance has audible components,\
