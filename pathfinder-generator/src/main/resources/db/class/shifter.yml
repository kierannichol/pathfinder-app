description: "Whether riding on the wind as a falcon or hiding in some fetid bog waiting\
  \ to strike, the shifter is a true master of the wild. Both a devoted defender of\
  \ druidic circles and a fierce predator, the shifter can take on the forms of nature\
  \ and even fuse them together with devastating effect and unbridled savagery. By\
  \ way of the druidic discipline of wild shape, they become living aspects of the\
  \ wild. At first, they are able to assume only a minor aspect, but with time and\
  \ practice they can fully transform into ever more powerful forms. The shifter class\
  \ offers players a way to experience a shapeshifting character that is more martially\
  \ inclined than a spellcasting druid. With each new level, the shifter's powers\
  \ grow in new and surprising ways, creating a character that thrives in battle,\
  \ exploration, and stealth. Shifters are protectors of druidic circles and avengers\
  \ of nature, yet a shifter's magic is different from that of her druidic kin. Rather\
  \ than invoking spells from the natural world or forging alliances with animals,\
  \ shifters focus their supernatural powers inward to gain control over their own\
  \ forms. Their ability to change their forms is as varied as the wonders of the\
  \ wilds themselves but always remains at least partially rooted in the natural world.\
  \ There are many paths to becoming a shifter; most are trained in that role by druidic\
  \ circles and have their powers unlocked via rituals of initiation. Yet some stumble\
  \ upon the gift naturally, as if their blood bore the secrets of shifter transformation.\
  \ For those leaning toward the causes of law and good, the path of the shifter is\
  \ one of contemplation and understanding. They become one with nature through mental\
  \ and physical mimicry and gain an ever deeper spiritual understanding of the ebb\
  \ and flow of the natural world. Those leaning toward the chaotic and evil teachings\
  \ of druidic philosophy find such enlightenment through more violent means. These\
  \ are typically quicker transformations, both brutal and painful, imparting the\
  \ dark lessons of nature through its most catastrophic forms. Shifters who lean\
  \ toward true neutrality are the most diverse when it comes to their command of\
  \ metamorphic secrets. Role: The shifter is so attuned to nature and the wild beasts\
  \ of the world that she can call upon those powers to mystically fortify her being.\
  \ Fluid in form and function, she can shape herself to overcome hardships and support\
  \ those she befriends or serves. Alignment: Any neutral. Hit Die: d10. Starting\
  \ Wealth: 3d6x10 gp (average 105 gp)."
