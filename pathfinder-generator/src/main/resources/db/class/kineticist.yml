  description: "A kineticist can use wild talents—magical abilities similar to spells\
    \ but drawn from the kineticist’s innate psychic talent and usable at will. Wild\
    \ talents are typically spell-like abilities (though some are supernatural abilities),\
    \ and take a standard action to use unless otherwise noted. A wild talent always\
    \ has the elemental descriptor or descriptors (aether, air, earth, fire, or water)\
    \ matching its element entry. A wild talent that can be used with any of several\
    \ elements gains the appropriate elemental descriptor when used with an element.\
    \ For example, the wall wild talent gains the earth descriptor when used by a\
    \ geokineticist.\nEvery wild talent has an effective spell level. A kineticist\
    \ can always select 1st-level wild talents, but she can select a wild talent of\
    \ a higher level only if her kineticist level is at least double the wild talent’\
    s effective spell level. Kinetic blast and defense wild talents are always considered\
    \ to have an effective spell level equal to 1/2 the kineticist’s class level (to\
    \ a maximum effective spell level of 9th at kineticist level 18th).\nUnless otherwise\
    \ noted, the DC for a saving throw against a wild talent is equal to 10 + the\
    \ wild talent’s effective spell level + the kineticist’s Constitution modifier.\
    \ The kineticist uses her Constitution modifier on all concentration checks for\
    \ wild talents.\nIn addition to the wild talents she gains from her other class\
    \ features, at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a kineticist selects a\
    \ new utility wild talent from the list of options available to her. A kineticist\
    \ can select only universal wild talents or those that match her element (see\
    \ Elemental Focus above). At 6th, 10th, and 16th levels, a kineticist can replace\
    \ one of her utility wild talents with another wild talent of the same level or\
    \ lower. She can’t replace a wild talent that she used to qualify for another\
    \ of her wild talents.\nA complete listing of utility wild talents can be found\
    \ here: Utility Wild Talents"
