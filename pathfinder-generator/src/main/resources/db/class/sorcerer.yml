description: "Scions of innately magical bloodlines, the chosen of deities, the spawn\
  \ of monsters, pawns of fate and destiny, or simply flukes of fickle magic, sorcerers\
  \ look within themselves for arcane prowess and draw forth might few mortals can\
  \ imagine. Emboldened by lives ever threatening to be consumed by their innate powers,\
  \ these magic-touched souls endlessly indulge in and refine their mysterious abilities,\
  \ gradually learning how to harness their birthright and coax forth ever greater\
  \ arcane feats. Just as varied as these innately powerful spellcasters' abilities\
  \ and inspirations are the ways in which they choose to utilize their gifts. While\
  \ some seek to control their abilities through meditation and discipline, becoming\
  \ masters of their fantastic birthright, others give in to their magic, letting\
  \ it rule their lives with often explosive results. Regardless, sorcerers live and\
  \ breathe that which other spellcasters devote their lives to mastering, and for\
  \ them magic is more than a boon or a field of study; it is life itself. Role: Sorcerers\
  \ excel at casting a selection of favored spells frequently, making them powerful\
  \ battle mages. As they become familiar with a specific and ever-widening set of\
  \ spells, sorcerers often discover new and versatile ways of making use of magics\
  \ other spellcasters might overlook. Their bloodlines also grant them additional\
  \ abilities, assuring that no two sorcerers are ever quite alike. Alignment: Any\
  \ Hit Die: d6 Starting Wealth: 2d6 × 10 gp (average 70 gp.) In addition, each character\
  \ begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less."
