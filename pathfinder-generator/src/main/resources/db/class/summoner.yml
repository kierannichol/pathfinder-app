description: "While many who dabble in the arcane become adept at beckoning monsters\
  \ from the farthest reaches of the planes, none are more skilled at it than the\
  \ summoner. This practitioner of the arcane arts forms a close bond with one particular\
  \ outsider, known as an eidolon, who gains power as the summoner becomes more proficient\
  \ at his summoning. Over time, the two become linked, eventually even sharing a\
  \ shard of the same soul. But this power comes with a price: the summoner's spells\
  \ and abilities are limited due to his time spent enhancing the power and exploring\
  \ the nature of his eidolon. Role: Summoners spend much of their time exploring\
  \ the arcane arts alongside their eidolons. While their power comes from within,\
  \ they rely heavily on their eidolon companions in dangerous situations. While a\
  \ summoner and his eidolon function as individuals, their true power lies in what\
  \ they can accomplish together. Alignment: Any. Hit Die: d8. Starting Wealth: 2d6\
  \ Ã— 10 gp (average 70gp.) In addition, each character begins play with an outfit\
  \ worth 10 gp or less."
