description: "Grim and determined, the inquisitor roots out enemies of the faith,\
  \ using trickery and guile when righteousness and purity is not enough. Although\
  \ inquisitors are dedicated to a deity, they are above many of the normal rules\
  \ and conventions of the church. They answer to their deity and their own sense\
  \ of justice alone, and are willing to take extreme measures to meet their goals.\
  \ Role: Inquisitors tend to move from place to place, chasing down enemies and researching\
  \ emerging threats. As a result, they often travel with others, if for no other\
  \ reason than to mask their presence. Inquisitors work with members of their faith\
  \ whenever possible, but even such allies are not above suspicion. Alignment: An\
  \ inquisitor's alignment must be within one step of her deity's, along either the\
  \ law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis. Hit Dice: d8. Starting Wealth: 4d6 Ã— 10\
  \ gp (average 140gp.) In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth\
  \ 10 gp or less."
