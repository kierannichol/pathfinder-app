description: "Skalds are poets, historians, and keepers of lore who use their gifts\
  \ for oration and song to inspire allies into a frenzied rage. They balance a violent\
  \ spirit with the veneer of civilization, recording events such as heroic battles\
  \ and the deeds of great leaders, enhancing these stories in the retelling to earn\
  \ bloodier victories in combat. A skald's poetry is nuanced and often has multiple\
  \ overlapping meanings, and he applies similar talents to emulate magic from other\
  \ spellcasters. Role: A skald inspires his allies, and often presses forward to\
  \ fight enemies in melee. Outside of combat, he's useful as a healer and scholar,\
  \ less versatile but more durable than a bard. Alignment: Any. Hit Die: d8. Parent\
  \ Classes: Barbarian and bard. Starting Wealth: 3d6 × 10 gp (average 105 gp.) In\
  \ addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less."
