    benefit: "A slayer with this advanced talent can kill foes that are unable to\
      \ defend themselves. To attempt to assassinate a target, the slayer must first\
      \ study his target for 1 round as a standard action. On the following round,\
      \ if the slayer makes a sneak attack against the target and that target is denied\
      \ its Dexterity bonus to AC, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly\
      \ killing the target. This attempt automatically fails if the target recognizes\
      \ the slayer as an enemy. If the sneak attack is successful, the target must\
      \ attempt a Fortitude saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the slayer's\
      \ level + the slayer's Intelligence modifier. If the target fails this save,\
      \ it dies; otherwise, the target takes the sneak attack damage as normal and\
      \ is then immune to that slayer's assassinate ability for 24 hours."
