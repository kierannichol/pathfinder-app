          - Benefit: "A slayer can select one of the following rogue advanced talents or ninja master tricks in place of a slayer advanced talent. Any talent effects based on rogue or ninja level use the slayer’s class level. This talent can be selected multiple times; each time, it grants the slayer a new rogue advanced talent or ninja master trick, but a slayer can’t select the same one more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to a slayer’s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision of which to use must be made before the attack roll is made."
