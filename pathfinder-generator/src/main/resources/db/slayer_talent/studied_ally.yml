    benefit: "The slayer can study an ally or friendly creature he can see as a move\
      \ action. The slayer gains a +1 bonus on checks and attack rolls to use the\
      \ aid another action to help with that ally's skill checks, attacks, or AC.\
      \ This bonus increases at the same rate as a slayer's studied target bonus.\
      \ At 7th level, a slayer can study an ally as a move or swift action. A slayer's\
      \ studied ally counts against the number of studied targets he can have active\
      \ at once."
