    prerequisite: "The rogue (or slayer) must have the aligned sneak attack talent\
      \ to select this talent."
    benefit: "When making a sneak attack against an opponent with an alignment subtype,\
      \ a rogue (or slayer) with this talent can forgo her sneak attack damage to\
      \ scramble the creature's metaphysical nature. If the attack succeeds, the rogue\
      \ deals weapon damage as normal, and the target must succeed at a Fortitude\
      \ save (DC = 10 + half the rogue's level + the rogue's (or slayer's) Intelligence\
      \ modifier) or lose all damage reduction overcome by aligned weapons (such as\
      \ DR 10/good), lose all regeneration overcome by aligned sources (such as regeneration\
      \ 10 [good]), and lose the ability to cast spells and use spell-like abilities\
      \ with alignment descriptors for 1 round for every 2d6 points of sneak attack\
      \ damage the rogue (or slayer) would have dealt (minimum 1 round)."
