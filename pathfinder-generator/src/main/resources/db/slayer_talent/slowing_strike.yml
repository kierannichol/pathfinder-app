    benefit: "An opponent damaged by the slayerâ€˜s sneak attack has its speed halved\
      \ for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude saving throw negates this effect (DC\
      \ = 10 + 1/2 of the slayer's level + the slayer's Intelligence modifier). Against\
      \ creatures with multiple types of movement, the slayer must choose which movement\
      \ type to affect. If the slayer affects a creature's flight movement, its maneuverability\
      \ is reduced by one step; if it's airborne at the time, it falls unless it succeeds\
      \ at a DC 10 Fly check. If the slayer targets a creature already affected by\
      \ this ability, its speed and maneuverability are not further reduced; the slayer\
      \ may either extend the duration of that effect by 1d4 rounds or choose another\
      \ movement type to affect (keeping track of the duration of each affected movement\
      \ separately)."
