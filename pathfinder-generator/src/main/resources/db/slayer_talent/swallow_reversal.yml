    benefit: "As an attack action, the slayer can make a single melee attack against\
      \ his studied target at his highest base attack bonus. When attempting a swallow\
      \ reversal, the slayer rolls two attack rolls and uses the highest result. If\
      \ the attack is a critical threat, the slayer attempts to confirm the critical\
      \ hit as normal. The slayer can use swallow reversal at will, but it can only\
      \ be used against a given target once per day."
