    Effect: "A storm of ice and freezing wind envelops the target, which takes 3d8\
      \ points of cold damage (Fortitude half). If the target fails its save, it is\
      \ paralyzed and unconscious but does not need to eat or breathe while the ice\
      \ lasts. The ice has 20 hit points; destroying the ice frees the creature, which\
      \ is staggered for 1d4 rounds after being released. Whether or not the target's\
      \ saving throw is successful, it cannot be the target of this hex again for\
      \ 1 day."
