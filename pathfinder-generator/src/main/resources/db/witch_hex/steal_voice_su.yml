    Effect: "The witch can steal the voice of one creature within 30 feet, causing\
      \ it to lose, for a number of rounds equal to the witch's Intelligence bonus,\
      \ all abilities that rely on speech, including talking, casting spells with\
      \ verbal components, and using auditory bardic performances. A successful Will\
      \ saving throw negates this effect. If this hex is used upon a willing target,\
      \ the duration lasts for a number of hours equal to the witch's Intelligence\
      \ bonus. Additionally, the witch can change her voice to match that of any creature\
      \ whose voice she has stolen with this hex, as per vocal alteration."
