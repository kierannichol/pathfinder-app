    Effect: "The witch can cause a creature within 60 feet to be shunned by its allies\
      \ for a number of rounds equal to the witch's Intelligence modifier. Any other\
      \ creature attempting to directly assist the target with a harmless spell or\
      \ aid another action must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the aiding\
      \ creature is unaffected by this hex. If the save fails, the aiding creature\
      \ can't follow through, the action is lost, and the aiding creature can't directly\
      \ aid the target for the duration of this hex. This hex does not prevent the\
      \ target from benefiting from area of effect spells."
