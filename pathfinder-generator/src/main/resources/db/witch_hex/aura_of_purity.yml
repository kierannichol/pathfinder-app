    Effect: "Diseases, inhaled poisons, and noxious gaseous effects (such as stinking\
      \ cloud) are negated in a 10-foot aura around the witch for a number of minutes\
      \ equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it\
      \ must be spent in 1-minute increments. Effects caused by spells whose level\
      \ is more than half the witch's class level are unaffected."
