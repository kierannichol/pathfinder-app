    Effect: "Effect On a failed Fortitude save, the subject loses the use of darkvision,\
      \ greensight, low-light vision, see in darkness, and other visual abilities\
      \ beyond simple sight, but not nonvisual means of perception like blindsight,\
      \ scent, or tremorsense. This effect lasts 1 minute. At 8th level, this effect\
      \ lasts for 10 minutes instead. Whether or not the creature succeeds at the\
      \ saving throw, it can't be the target of this hex again for 1 day."
