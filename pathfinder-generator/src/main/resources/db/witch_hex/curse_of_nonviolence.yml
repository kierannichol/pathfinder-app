  text: "The witch can curse a creature to prevent it from attacking innocents."
  sections:
    Effect: "If the target fails its Will save, it cannot take violent actions or\
      \ do anything destructive against any creature with fewer Hit Dice than itself.\
      \ If another creature takes hostile action against the cursed creature, the\
      \ cursed creature can act normally in regard to that creature only. This is\
      \ an abjuration effect. The curse is permanent but can be removed with a break\
      \ enchantment, miracle, or wish spell. Whether or not the save is successful,\
      \ a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day."
