    Effect: "The witch causes a creature within 30 feet to die and be immediately\
      \ reincarnated into a new body. A Will save negates this effect. Those that\
      \ fail are slain and immediately brought back to life with the spell reincarnate.\
      \ Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of\
      \ this hex again for 1 day."
