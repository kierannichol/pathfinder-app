    Effect: "The witch can make an animal or humanoid within 30 feet distrust another\
      \ creature within line of sight. The target's attitude toward the other creature\
      \ decreases by one step. A successful Will save negates this effect. The effect\
      \ lasts for a number of rounds equal to the witch's Intelligence modifier. The\
      \ duration can be extended with the cackle hex. Whether or not the save is successful,\
      \ a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day. At 8th level,\
      \ this effect decreases the attitude of the target creature by two steps."
