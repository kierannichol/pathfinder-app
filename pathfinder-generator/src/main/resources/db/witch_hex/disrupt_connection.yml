    Effect: "The hexer disrupts the connection between a summoned creature within\
      \ 30 feet and its master. The summoned creature must succeed at a Will save\
      \ or be confused for 1d4 rounds. While it's confused in this way, during any\
      \ round in which the percentile die roll to determine the creature's confusion\
      \ result is 76â€“100, the affected creature instead acts as if the hexer had summoned\
      \ it (attacking the hexer's enemies or performing such other tasks that the\
      \ hexer can communicate to it)."
