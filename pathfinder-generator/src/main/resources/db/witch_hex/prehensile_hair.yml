      \ hair as if it were a limb with a Strength score equal to her Intelligence\
      \ score. Her hair has reach 10 feet, and she can use it as a secondary natural\
      \ attack that deals 1d3 points of damage (1d2 for a Small witch). Her hair can\
      \ manipulate objects (but not weapons) as dexterously as a human hand."
