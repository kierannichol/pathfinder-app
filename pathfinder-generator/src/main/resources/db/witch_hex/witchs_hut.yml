    Effect: "The witch can animate a hut, small house, covered wagon, tent, or similar\
      \ construction as an animated object. The hut can be of up to Huge size (approximately\
      \ 15 feet by 15 feet). The animated hut's hardness increases to 8 and its hit\
      \ points double. The witch can give the hut the following commands: guard (the\
      \ hut watches for trespassers within 120 feet using the witch's Perception modifier\
      \ and screams if it spots any), hide (all entrances are hidden by illusory wall\
      \ spells and locked with arcane lock), and move (moves at speed 60 on giant\
      \ bird or bone legs as directed by the witch, even obeying commands such as\
      \ â€œfollow me from 100 feet away\"). The hut remains animate for 24 hours, until\
      \ she dismisses it or she animates another, at which time the hut stops where\
      \ it is and reverts to its nonmagical state."
