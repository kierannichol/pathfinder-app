    Effect: "The warded creature receives a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance\
      \ bonus on saving throws. This ward lasts until the warded creature is hit or\
      \ fails a saving throw. A witch knows when a warded creature is no longer protected.\
      \ A witch can have only one ward active at a time. If the witch uses this ability\
      \ again, the previous ward immediately ends. A witch cannot use this ability\
      \ on herself. At 8th level and 16th level, the bonuses provided by this ward\
      \ increase by +1."
