    Effect: "Effect The witch can see through natural fog, mist, and rain without\
      \ penalty, ignoring any concealment bonuses gained from such effects. If the\
      \ effect is created by magic, the witch can see up to 15 feet without penalty,\
      \ with normal penalties and effects applying beyond that distance. This ability\
      \ functions underwater as well, allowing the witch to see in murky water as\
      \ though it were clear. This does not allow the witch to see anything she could\
      \ not see otherwise, such as an invisible creature."
