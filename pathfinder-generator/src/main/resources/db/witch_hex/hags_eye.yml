  text: "A witch with this hex can create a magic sensor that she can see through."
  sections:
    Effect: "This functions as per the spell arcane eye. If the witch has the coven\
      \ hex, all other witches within 10 feet who also have the coven hex can see\
      \ through this sensor as well, although the witch that created it still controls\
      \ it. The witch can use this eye for a number of minutes per day equal to her\
      \ level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent\
      \ in 1-minute increments."
