    Effect: "With a quick incantation, a witch can place this hex on one creature\
      \ within 60 feet, causing them to suffer intense pain. The target is nauseated\
      \ for a number of rounds equal to the witch's level. A Fortitude save negates\
      \ this effect. If the saving throw is failed, the target can attempt a new save\
      \ each round to end the effect. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature\
      \ cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day."
