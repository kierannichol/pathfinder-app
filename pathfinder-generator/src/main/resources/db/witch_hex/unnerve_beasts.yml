    Effect: "The target becomes offensive to animals (Will negates). Animals become\
      \ distraught and aggressive in the victim's presence--horses buck, dogs snap\
      \ and bark, bulls charge, and so on. The hex lasts a number of hours equal to\
      \ the witch's Intelligence modifier. A creature that saves against the hex cannot\
      \ be affected by the hex for 1 day. The reaction of the animals is a mind-affecting\
      \ charm effect, but the hex on the target is not."
