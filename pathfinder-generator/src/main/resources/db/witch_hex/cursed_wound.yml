    Effect: "For a number of days equal to 3 + the witch's Intelligence modifier (minimum\
      \ 1), whenever the victim is the target of a conjuration (healing) spell or\
      \ magical healing effect, the caster of the healing effect must succeed at a\
      \ caster level check (DC = 11 + the witch's level) to end the hex. If the check\
      \ fails, the healing effect functions as normal, except it cannot remove the\
      \ last 10 points of damage the victim suffered. Similarly, natural healing,\
      \ fast healing, and regeneration fail to cure the victim's last 10 points of\
      \ damage. Thus, the victim's effective maximum number of hit points is 10 fewer\
      \ than normal. A successful Will save reduces the duration of this hex to 1\
      \ round. At 5th level, the victim of this hex also takes a â€“2 penalty on Fortitude\
      \ saving throws to avoid contracting a disease or poison from an injury."
