    Effect: "A witch can use this hex on a creature to prevent it from drawing a weapon\
      \ for a number of rounds equal to the witch's level. This hex has no effect\
      \ on natural weapons or weapons already in a creature's hands, but does prevent\
      \ an archer from drawing arrows. A Will save negates this effect, and whether\
      \ or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex\
      \ again for 1 day."
