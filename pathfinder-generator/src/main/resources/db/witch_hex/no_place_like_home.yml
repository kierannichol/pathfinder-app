    Effect: "Effect She chooses a target for the hex within 30 feet. If she chooses\
      \ an ally, that ally gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC against traps and on Reflex\
      \ saves against traps. If she chooses an opponent, that opponent takes a â€“2\
      \ penalty to AC against traps and on Reflex saves against traps. Either way,\
      \ the effects last for 1 minute. The target can attempt a Will save to negate\
      \ the effects of the hex. At 8th level, the bonus or penalty increases to 4.\
      \ At 16th level, the bonus or penalty increases to 6. A creature targeted by\
      \ this hex cannot be targeted again by this hex for 1 day."
