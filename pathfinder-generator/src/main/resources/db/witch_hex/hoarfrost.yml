    Effect: "The target is rimed with a shell of frost needles that slowly work their\
      \ way into its flesh (Fortitude negates). The target turns pale and blue, and\
      \ takes 1 point of Constitution damage per minute until it dies, saves (once\
      \ per minute), or is cured. Break enchantment, dispel magic, remove curse, and\
      \ similar spells end the effect. If the target saves, it is immune to this hex\
      \ for 1 day. This is a cold effect."
