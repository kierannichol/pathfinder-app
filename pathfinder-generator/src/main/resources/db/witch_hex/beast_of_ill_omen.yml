  sections:
    Effect: "The enemy must make a Will save or be affected by bane (caster level\
      \ equal to the witch's level). The witch can use this hex on her familiar at\
      \ a range of up to 60 feet. The affected enemy must be no more than 60 feet\
      \ from the familiar to trigger the effect; seeing the familiar from a greater\
      \ distance has no effect (though if the enemy and familiar approach to within\
      \ 60 feet of each other, the hex takes effect). The bane affects the closest\
      \ creature to the familiar (ties affect the creature with the highest initiative\
      \ score)."
