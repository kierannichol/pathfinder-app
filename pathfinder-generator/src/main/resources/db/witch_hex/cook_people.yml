    Effect: "Using this hex creates one meal or serving of food of the witch's choice,\
      \ typically a delicious stew or a dough suitable for cookies, pastries, or other\
      \ desserts. Cooking the victim takes 1 hour. Eating the food provides one of\
      \ the following benefits for 1 hour: age resistance, bear's endurance, bull's\
      \ strength, cat's grace, eagle's splendor, fox's cunning, neutralize poison\
      \ (instantaneous), owl's wisdom, remove disease (instantaneous). Alternatively,\
      \ the witch can shape the dough into a Small, human-like creature, animating\
      \ it as a homunculus for 1 hour. The witch must have the cauldron hex to select\
      \ this hex. Using this hex or knowingly eating its food is an evil act."
