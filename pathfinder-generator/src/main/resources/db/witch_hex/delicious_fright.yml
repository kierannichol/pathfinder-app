    Effect: "The target of this hex becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to\
      \ 3 + the witch's Intelligence modifier. As long as the witch remains within\
      \ 30 feet of her target, she gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and a +1\
      \ morale bonus on saving throws as long as this effect persists. A successful\
      \ Will save reduces the duration of this hex to 1 round. This is a mind-affecting\
      \ fear effect."
