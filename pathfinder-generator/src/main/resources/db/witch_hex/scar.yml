description:
  text: "This hex curses a single target touched with horrible scars of the witch's\
    \ choosing, whether something as simple as a single letter on the target's forehead\
    \ or blotchy, burn-like scars on his body."
  sections:
    Effect: "The target may make a Will save to resist this hex. These scars do not\
      \ interfere with the target's senses or prevent it from using abilities, but\
      \ may affect social interactions. The witch can use her hexes on the scarred\
      \ target at a range of up to 1 mile, and she is considered to have a body part\
      \ from the target for the purpose of scrying and similar divination spells.\
      \ They persist through disguises and shapechanging."
