    Effect: "Effect The witch surrounds her target with oppressive heat, dealing a\
      \ number of points of nonlethal damage equal to her witch level and causing\
      \ the target to become fatigued. The target can attempt a Fortitude save to\
      \ reduce this nonlethal damage by half and negate the fatigued condition. Whether\
      \ or not the target succeeds at this save, it can't be the target of this hex\
      \ again for 1 day."
