    Effect: "Calling upon fell powers, a witch can place a hex on a creature within\
      \ 60 feet that causes its sleep to be tormented by terrible nightmares. This\
      \ functions as the spell nightmare each time the affected creature attempts\
      \ to rest. A Will save negates this effect. If the save is failed, the target\
      \ must make a new save each night or be unable to rest."
