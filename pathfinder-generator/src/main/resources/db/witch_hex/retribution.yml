    Effect: "A witch can place a retribution hex on a creature within 60 feet, causing\
      \ terrible wounds to open across the target's flesh whenever it deals damage\
      \ to another creature in melee. Immediately after the hexed creature deals damage\
      \ in melee, it takes half that damage (round down). This damage bypasses any\
      \ resistances, immunities, or damage reduction the creature possesses. This\
      \ effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the witch's Intelligence modifier.\
      \ A Will save negates this effect."
