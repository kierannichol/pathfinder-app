    \ equal to your cleric level, or until the illusory duplicate is dispelled or\
    \ destroyed. You can have no more than one copycat at a time. This ability does\
    \ not stack with the mirror image spell. You can use this ability a number of\
    \ times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier."
