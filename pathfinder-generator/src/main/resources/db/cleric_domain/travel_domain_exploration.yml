    \ such movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You must have line of\
    \ sight to your destination to use this ability. You can bring other willing creatures\
    \ with you, but you must expend an equal amount of distance for each creature\

  description: "You can lay your hand upon any surface and see what is on the other\
    \ side, as if using clairvoyance. Using this power takes 1 minute, during which\
    \ time you must be touching the surface you want to see through. You can keep\
    \ looking for as long as 10 minutes with each use of this power, but must touch\
    \ the surface and take no other action the entire time. The surface cannot be\
    \ thicker than 6 inches plus 1 inch per cleric level you possess. You can use\
    \ this power a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier."
