  description: "At 8th level, you can restore a single creature as if it had just\
    \ completed 8 hours of rest. It takes 10 minutes to use this power. If the use\
    \ of this power is disrupted, it must be restarted, but it is not lost. At the\
    \ end of the 10 minutes, a single willing creature that you have touched regains\
    \ hit points as if it had rested for the night and may make new saving throws\
    \ against effects that require a save once per day. The target does not suffer\
    \ any negative effects if such saving throws are failed, but success counts toward\
    \ removing the affliction (if possible). This ability does not allow a target\
    \ to prepare spells an additional time per day. You can use this ability once\
    \ per day at 8th level, plus one additional time per day for every 2 levels beyond\
    \ 8th."
