  description: "As a standard action, you can create a blast rune in any adjacent\
    \ square. Any creature entering this square takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point\
    \ for every two cleric levels you possess. This rune deals either acid, cold,\
    \ electricity, or fire damage, decided when you create the rune. The rune is invisible\
    \ and lasts a number of rounds equal to your cleric level or until discharged.\
    \ You cannot create a blast rune in a square occupied by another creature. This\
    \ rune counts as a 1st-level spell for the purposes of dispelling. It can be discovered\
    \ with a DC 26 Perception skill check and disarmed with a DC 26 Disable Device\
    \ skill check. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +\
    \ your Wisdom modifier."

  description: "At 8th level, you can attach another spell that you cast to one of\
    \ your blast runes, causing that spell to affect the creature that triggers the\
    \ rune, in addition to the damage. This spell must be of at least one level lower\
    \ than the highest-level cleric spell you can cast and it must target one or more\
    \ creatures. Regardless of the number of targets the spell can normally affect,\
    \ it only affects the creature that triggers the rune."
