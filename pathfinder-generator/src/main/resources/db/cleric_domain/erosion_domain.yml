  name: "Rusting Touch"
  description: "You can cause an opponent’s metal armor or weapon to become dry and\
    \ brittle as it magically corrodes and rusts. You make a melee touch attack against\
    \ a creature wearing metal armor or wielding a metal weapon. If you hit, choose\
    \ a metal weapon, suit of metal armor, or metal shield carried or worn by that\
    \ creature. The object takes an amount of hit point damage equal to 1d6 + half\
    \ your druid level. If the item is not magical, or if your caster level is greater\
    \ than the item’s caster level, this damage bypasses the item’s hardness. You\
    \ can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier."

  description: "At 8th level, you can project an aura of magically enhanced erosion\
    \ as a standard action. Objects made primarily of metal or stone within this aura\
    \ lose 10 points of hardness. Magic items retain a minimum hardness equal to twice\
    \ their enhancement bonus and can attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 +\
    \ half your druid level + your Wisdom modifier) to negate this effect. A construct\
    \ made primarily of metal or stone must succeed at a Fortitude save or lose all\
    \ damage reduction and hardness for 1 round. You can use this ability a number\
    \ of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier."
