  description: "As a standard action, you can create a storm burst targeting any foe within\
  \ 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The storm burst deals 1d6 points of nonlethal\
  \ damage + 1 point for every two cleric levels you possess. In addition, the target\
  \ is buffeted by winds and rain, causing it to take a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls\
  \ for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +\
  \ your Wisdom modifier."

    \ to your cleric level. You can call down as many bolts as you want with a single\
    \ standard action, but no creature can be the target of more than one bolt and\
    \ no two targets can be more than 30 feet apart. This ability otherwise functions\
    \ as call lightning."
