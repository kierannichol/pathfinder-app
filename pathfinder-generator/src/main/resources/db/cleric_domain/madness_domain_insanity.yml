  description: "At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of madness for a number\
    \ of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. Enemies within this aura are affected\
    \ by confusion unless they make a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + Â½ your Cleric\
    \ level + your Wisdom modifier. The confusion effect ends immediately when the\
    \ creature leaves the area or the aura expires. Creatures that succeed on their\
    \ saving throw are immune to this aura for 24 hours. These rounds do not need\
    \ to be consecutive."

  description: "You can touch a willing creature as a standard action, granting it\
    \ a +4 bonus on all saving throws made against mind-affecting effects and immunity\
    \ to confusion. This bonus lasts for 1 minute. If the creature fails a saving\
    \ throw against a mind-affecting effect during this period, it loses its immunity\
    \ to confusion and is immediately confused for one round. You can use this ability\
    \ a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier."
