    \ this ability is a standard action. You can move across any stone surface as\
    \ if under the effects of spider climb. You can also see very well in darkness,\
    \ gaining darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already possess darkvision,\
    \ extend the range by 60 feet. While underground, you also gain an insight bonus\
