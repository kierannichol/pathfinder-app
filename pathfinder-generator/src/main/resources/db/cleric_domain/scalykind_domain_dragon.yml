  description: "You are a true lord of reptiles, able to induce pain, panic, and confusion\
    \ with a mere glance, and your mesmerizing eyes can even drive weak creatures\
    \ into unconsciousness. As a standard action, you can activate a gaze attack with\
    \ a 30-foot range. This is an active gaze attack that can target a single creature\
    \ within range. The target must make a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your cleric level\
    \ + your Wisdom modifier). Those who fail take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage\
    \ + 1 point for every two cleric levels you possess and are fascinated until the\
    \ beginning of your next turn. You can use this ability a number of times per\
    \ day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier. This is a mind-affecting effect."
