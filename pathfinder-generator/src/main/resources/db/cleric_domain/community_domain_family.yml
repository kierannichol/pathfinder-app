  description: "At 8th level, whenever a spell or effect targets you and one or more\
    \ allies within 30 feet, you can use this ability to allow your allies to use\
    \ your saving throw against the effect in place of their own. Each ally must decide\
    \ individually before the rolls are made. Using this ability is an immediate action.\
    \ You can use this ability once per day at 8th level, and one additional time\
    \ per day for every four cleric levels beyond 8th."

  description: "As a standard action, you can touch an ally and remove one condition\
    \ affecting the ally by transferring it to yourself. This transfer lasts a number\
    \ of rounds equal to your cleric level, but you can end it as a free action on\
    \ your turn. At the end of this effect, the condition reverts to the original\
    \ creature, unless it has ended or is removed by another effect. While this power\
    \ is in use, the target is immune to the transferred condition. You can use this\
    \ ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier."
