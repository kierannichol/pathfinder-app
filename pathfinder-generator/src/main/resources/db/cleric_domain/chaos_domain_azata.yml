  description: "With a touch, you can imbue creatures with the spirit of Elysium,\
    \ lifting their spirits and freeing them from bonds. The creatures touched can\
    \ immediately reroll any failed saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities\
    \ of the enchantment (charm) and enchantment (compulsion) subschools. In addition,\
    \ targets receive a +2 sacred bonus on such saving throws and a +2 sacred bonus\
    \ on CMB checks to escape a grapple. Finally, targets can ignore up to 5 feet\
    \ of difficult terrain each round, as if they had the Nimble Moves feat. These\
    \ bonuses last for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your cleric level (minimum\
    \ 1), although the saving throw reroll only applies when the creature is touched.\
    \ You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom\
    \ modifier."
