  description: "At 8th level, you can broaden your mental spectrum to encompass those\
    \ around you. Doing so allows you to read the mind of every creature within 30\
    \ feet as if you had cast detect thoughts. This ability allows you to read the\
    \ surface thoughts of any creature that you are aware of after only 1 round of\
    \ concentration. Creatures in this area are allowed a Will save to negate the\
    \ effect. The DC of this Will save is 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Wisdom\
    \ modifier. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your\
    \ cleric level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive."
