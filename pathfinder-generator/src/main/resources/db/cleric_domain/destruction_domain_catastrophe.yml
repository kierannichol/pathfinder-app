  description: "At 8th level, you can unleash a furious call to the heavens, summoning\
    \ forth an everchanging storm of destruction for a number of rounds per day equal\
    \ to your cleric level. This storm has a radius of 5 feet per cleric level. Each\
    \ round, the storm has one of the following effects: driving rain (–4 on all Perception\
    \ checks and ranged attack rolls), howling winds (–8 on Fly skill checks and ranged\
    \ attack rolls), heavy snow (all terrain is considered difficult), or lightning\
    \ bolt (as call lightning). Other effects depending on the weather might also\
    \ apply (at the GM’s discretion). You choose which effect takes place each round,\
    \ but no effect may be repeated on the following round. These rounds do not need\
    \ to be consecutive."
