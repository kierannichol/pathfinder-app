  description: "As a free action, your hands can become as hard as wood, covered in\
    \ tiny thorns. While you have wooden fists, your unarmed strikes do not provoke\
    \ attacks of opportunity, deal lethal damage, and gain a bonus on damage rolls\
    \ equal to 1/2 your cleric level (minimum +1). You can use this ability for a\
    \ number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier. These rounds do\
    \ not need to be consecutive."

  description: "At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of decay as a standard action.\
    \ Living creatures in this aura (except you) take 1d6 points of damage per round\
    \ as their flesh rots. They also take a cumulative –1 penalty to Strength each\
    \ round they remain in the aura. Once outside the aura, the penalty fades at the\
    \ rate of –1 per round, but it begins building again if they reenter the aura.\
    \ Plant creatures take 2d6 points of damage per round. You can use this ability\
    \ for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. These rounds do not\
    \ need to be consecutive."
