  description: "At 8th level, you can surround yourself with a field wild energies.\
    \ These energies manifest as a 30-foot aura of chaos for a number of rounds per\
    \ day equal to your cleric level. All enemies within this aura must declare one\
    \ type of action at the start of their turn (attack, cast a spell, move, use an\
    \ item, or activate a special ability) and make a Will save. Creatures that fail\
    \ the Will save must take an action other than their declared action. If they\
    \ succeed, they must take the declared action. Creatures cannot select actions\
    \ that they cannot perform."
