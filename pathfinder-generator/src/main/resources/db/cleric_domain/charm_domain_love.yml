  description: "At 8th level, you can cast charm person as a swift action, with a\
    \ DC of 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier. You can only have one\
    \ creature charmed in this way at a time. The total number of rounds of this effect\
    \ per day is equal to your cleric level. The rounds do not need to be consecutive,\
    \ and you can dismiss the charm at any time as a free action. Each attempt to\
    \ use this ability consumes 1 round of its duration, whether or not the creature\
    \ succeeds on its save to resist the effect."

  description: "As an immediate action, you can attempt to thwart a melee or ranged\
    \ attack that targets you. This ability functions as sanctuary, but only against\
    \ one individual attack. You must use the ability after the attack is declared\
    \ but before the roll is made. The creature attacking you receives a Will save\
    \ to negate this effect. If a creature has more than one attack, this ability\
    \ only affects one of the attacks. You can use the ability a number of times per\
    \ day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier. This is a mind-affecting effect."
