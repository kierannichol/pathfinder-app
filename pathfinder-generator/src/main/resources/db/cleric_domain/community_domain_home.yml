  description: "At 8th level, you can create a ward that protects a specified area.\
    \ Creating this ward takes 10 minutes of uninterrupted work. This ward has a maximum\
    \ radius of 5 feet per 2 cleric levels you possess. When the ward is completed,\
    \ you designate any number of creatures inside its area. Should any other creature\
    \ enter the warded area, all of the selected creatures are immediately alerted\
    \ (and awoken if they were asleep). The designated creatures also receive a sacred\
    \ bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier on all saving throws and attack rolls while\
    \ inside the warded area. This ward immediately ends if you leave the area. The\
    \ ward lasts for 1 hour per cleric level. You can use this ability once per day."
