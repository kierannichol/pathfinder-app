  description: "At 8th level, you can touch a creature that has died within the past\
    \ minute to grant it a few moments of life. The dead creature returns to life\
    \ for a number of rounds equal to your cleric level. Creatures returned to life\
    \ in this way have a number of hit points equal to half your cleric level, and\
    \ continue to be affected by any still-active spells, conditions, or afflictions\
    \ present at the time of their death. At the end of this time, the creature dies\
    \ again. The creature is free to act as it sees fit during this time. You are\
    \ granted no control over it."
