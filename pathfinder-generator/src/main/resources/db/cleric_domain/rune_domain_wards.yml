  name: "Blast Rune"
  description: "As a standard action, you can create a blast rune in any adjacent\
    \ square. Any creature entering this square takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point\
    \ for every two cleric levels you possess. This rune deals either acid, cold,\
    \ electricity, or fire damage, decided when you create the rune. The rune is invisible\
    \ and lasts a number of rounds equal to your cleric level or until discharged.\
    \ You cannot create a blast rune in a square occupied by another creature. This\
    \ rune counts as a 1st-level spell for the purposes of dispelling. It can be discovered\
    \ with a DC 26 Perception skill check and disarmed with a DC 26 Disable Device\
    \ skill check. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +\
    \ your Wisdom modifier."

  description: "At 6th level, when a creature is damaged by your blast rune, it cannot\
    \ attack you for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your cleric level unless it succeeds\
    \ at a Will save, as per the spell sanctuary. Using this ability is an immediate\
    \ action when a creature triggers one of your blast runes. The ability does not\
    \ prevent you from being attacked or affected by area of effect spells or abilities.\
    \ You can use this ability once per day at 8th level, plus one additional time\
    \ per day at 14th level and 20th level."
