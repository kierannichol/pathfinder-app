  description: "As a free action, your hands can become as hard as wood, covered in\
    \ tiny thorns. While you have wooden fists, your unarmed strikes do not provoke\
    \ attacks of opportunity, deal lethal damage, and gain a bonus on damage rolls\
    \ equal to 1/2 your cleric level (minimum +1). You can use this ability for a\
    \ number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier. These rounds do\
    \ not need to be consecutive."

  description: "At 6th level, you can cause a host of wooden thorns to burst from\
    \ your skin as a free action. While bramble armor is in effect, any foe striking\
    \ you with an unarmed strike or a melee weapon without reach takes 1d6 points\
    \ of piercing damage + 1 point per two cleric levels you possess. You can use\
    \ this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. These\
    \ rounds do not need to be consecutive."
