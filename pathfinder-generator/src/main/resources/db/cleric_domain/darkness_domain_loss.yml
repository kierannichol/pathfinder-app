  name: "Touch of Darkness"
  description: "As a melee touch attack, you can cause a creatureâ€™s vision to be fraught\
    \ with shadows and darkness. The creature touched treats all other creatures as\
    \ if they had concealment, suffering a 20% miss chance on all attack rolls. This\
    \ effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your cleric level (minimum\
    \ 1). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom\
    \ modifier."

  description: "At 8th level, you can emit a 30- foot aura of forgetfulness for a\
    \ number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. Creatures you target in\
    \ this area must make a Will save or have no memory of any time spent inside the\
    \ area. In addition, spellcasters in the area lose one prepared spell or available\
    \ spell slot per round spent in the area, starting with 1st-level spells and going\
    \ up through higher-level spells. Spellcasters are allowed a save each round to\
    \ negate this loss (this save is separate from the memory loss save). These rounds\
    \ do not need to be consecutive."
