  description: "You can cast mending at will, using your cleric level as the caster\
    \ level to repair damaged objects. In addition, you can cause damage to objects\
    \ and construct creatures by striking them with a melee touch attack. Objects\
    \ and constructs take 1d6 points of damage +1 for every two cleric levels you\
    \ possess. This attack bypasses an amount of damage reduction and hardness equal\
    \ to your cleric level. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal\
    \ to 3 + your Wisdom modifier."
