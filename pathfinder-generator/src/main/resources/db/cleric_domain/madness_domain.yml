  description: "You can give a creature a vision of madness as a melee touch attack.\
    \ Choose one of the following: attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks. The\
    \ target receives a bonus to the chosen rolls equal to ½ your cleric level (minimum\
    \ +1) and a penalty to the other two types of rolls equal to ½ your cleric level\
    \ (minimum –1). This effect fades after 3 rounds. You can use this ability a number\
    \ of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier."

  description: "At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of madness for a number\
    \ of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. Enemies within this aura are affected\
    \ by confusion unless they make a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + ½ your Cleric\
    \ level + your Wisdom modifier. The confusion effect ends immediately when the\
    \ creature leaves the area or the aura expires. Creatures that succeed on their\
    \ saving throw are immune to this aura for 24 hours. These rounds do not need\
    \ to be consecutive."
