    \ allies within 30 feet, you can use this ability to allow your allies to use\
    \ your saving throw against the effect in place of their own. Each ally must decide\
    \ individually before the rolls are made. Using this ability is an immediate action.\
    \ You can use this ability once per day at 8th level, and one additional time\
    \ per day for every four cleric levels beyond 8th."
