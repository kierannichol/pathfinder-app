    \ you have just made before the results of the roll are revealed. You must take\
    \ the result of the reroll, even if itâ€™s worse than the original roll. You can\
    \ use this ability once per day at 6th level, and one additional time per day\
    \ for every six cleric levels beyond 6th."
