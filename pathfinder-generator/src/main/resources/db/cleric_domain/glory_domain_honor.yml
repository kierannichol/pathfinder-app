  description: "At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of divine presence for a\
    \ number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. All allies within this\
    \ aura are treated as if under the effects of a sanctuary spell with a DC equal\
    \ to 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier. These rounds do not need\
    \ to be consecutive. Activating this ability is a standard action. If an ally\
    \ leaves the area or makes an attack, the effect ends for that ally. If you make\
    \ an attack, the effect ends for you and your allies."

  description: "With a touch, you can remind a creature of its duties and responsibilities,\
    \ granting it a new saving throw against each enchantment (charm) or enchantment\
    \ (compulsion) effect that currently affects it. If the saving throw is successful,\
    \ the enchantment effect is ended. This power only affects effects that allow\
    \ a save. If you fail a save against such an effect, you can use this ability\
    \ as an immediate action to grant yourself an additional save. Once the target\
    \ (either you or a touched creature) has made one additional save per effect,\
    \ this ability has no further effect on that particular enchantment effect. You\
    \ can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier."
