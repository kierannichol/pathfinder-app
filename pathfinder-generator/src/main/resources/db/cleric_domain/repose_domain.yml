  description: "Your touch can fill a creature with lethargy, causing a living creature\
    \ to become staggered for 1 round as a melee touch attack. If you touch a staggered\
    \ living creature, that creature falls asleep for 1 round instead. Undead creatures\
    \ touched are staggered for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier.\
    \ You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom\
    \ modifier."

  description: "At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura that wards against death\
    \ for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. Living creatures\
    \ in this area are immune to all death effects, energy drain, and effects that\
    \ cause negative levels. This ward does not remove negative levels that a creature\
    \ has already gained, but the negative levels have no effect while the creature\
    \ is inside the warded area. These rounds do not need to be consecutive."
