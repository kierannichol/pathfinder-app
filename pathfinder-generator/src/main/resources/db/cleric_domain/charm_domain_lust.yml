  description: "At 8th level, you can compel a creature within 30 feet to attempt\
    \ to please you as a standard action. The creature receives a Will save to negate\
    \ this affect. If the save fails, the creature attacks your enemies for 1 round,\
    \ gives you its most valuable item, or drops prone at your feet and grovels for\
    \ 1d4 rounds (GMâ€™s choice). You can use this ability once per day at 8th level\
    \ and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 8th. This is a\
    \ mind-affecting effect."
