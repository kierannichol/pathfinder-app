    \ of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. Allies within this aura are not\
    \ affected by the confused, grappled, frightened, panicked, paralyzed, pinned,\
    \ or shaken conditions. This aura only suppresses these effects, and they return\
    \ once a creature leaves the aura or when the aura ends, if applicable. These\
    \ rounds do not need to be consecutive."

  description: "You touch a willing creature as a standard action, granting it a boon.\
    \ A creature with this boon can, as a swift action, make a saving throw against\
    \ a single spell or effect it is suffering from that grants a save. The DC of\
    \ the saving throw is equal to the original DC of the spell or effect. If the\
    \ saving throw is successful, the effect ends. This boon lasts for 1 minute or\
    \ until successfully used to remove a spell or effect, whichever duration is shorter.\
    \ You can use this ability for a number of times equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier."
