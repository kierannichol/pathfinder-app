  description: "At 8th level, you can cast charm person as a swift action, with a\
    \ DC of 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier. You can only have one\
    \ creature charmed in this way at a time. The total number of rounds of this effect\
    \ per day is equal to your cleric level. The rounds do not need to be consecutive,\
    \ and you can dismiss the charm at any time as a free action. Each attempt to\
    \ use this ability consumes 1 round of its duration, whether or not the creature\
    \ succeeds on its save to resist the effect."
