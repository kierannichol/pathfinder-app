  description: "At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of madness for a number\
    \ of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. Enemies within this aura are affected\
    \ by confusion unless they make a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + ½ your Cleric\
    \ level + your Wisdom modifier. The confusion effect ends immediately when the\
    \ creature leaves the area or the aura expires. Creatures that succeed on their\
    \ saving throw are immune to this aura for 24 hours. These rounds do not need\
    \ to be consecutive."

  description: "As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack against a\
    \ creature, causing it to experience terrible hallucinations for 1 round. During\
    \ this time, the creature loses any immunity to fear effects it might possess\
    \ and takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls made against you. In addition, the creature\
    \ takes a penalty on Will saves made against fear effects equal to 1/2 your cleric\
    \ level (minimum –1). This power is a mind-affecting effect. You can use this\
    \ ability for a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier."
