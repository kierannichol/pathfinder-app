    \ This ability lasts for 1 hour or until the creature touched elects to apply\

  description: "At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of divine presence for a\
    \ number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. All allies within this\
    \ aura are treated as if under the effects of a sanctuary spell with a DC equal\
    \ to 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier. These rounds do not need\
    \ to be consecutive. Activating this ability is a standard action. If an ally\
    \ leaves the area or makes an attack, the effect ends for that ally. If you make\
    \ an attack, the effect ends for you and your allies."
