    \ of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. This acts as a daylight spell.\
    \ In addition, undead within this radius take an amount of damage equal to your\
    \ cleric level each round that they remain inside the nimbus. Spells and spell-like\
    \ abilities with the darkness descriptor are automatically dispelled if brought\
    \ inside this nimbus. These rounds do not need to be consecutive."

    \ Creatures with fewer Hit Dice than your cleric level within this area are blinded\
    \ for 1d4 rounds unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. All creatures in this\
