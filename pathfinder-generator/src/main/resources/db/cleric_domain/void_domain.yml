  description: "At 8th level, you can lace spells you cast with the raw madness that\
    \ waits in the outer darkness. Activating this ability is a swift action that\
    \ you must use as you cast a spell that targets a single creature and that allows\
    \ a Will saving throw to negate or reduce the spell’s primary effect. If the target\
    \ fails to resist the spell, the target is also confused for a number of rounds\
    \ equal to the spell’s level as visions of the void cause temporary insanity.\
    \ The victim must succeed at a new saving throw each round to end the effect—\
    these additional saving throws apply only to the additional confusion effect and\
    \ not to the original spell effect. Part the veil is a mind-affecting effect.\
    \ You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your class level."
