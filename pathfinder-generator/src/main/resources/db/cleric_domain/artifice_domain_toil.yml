  name: "Artificerâ€™s Touch"
  description: "You can cast mending at will, using your cleric level as the caster\
    \ level to repair damaged objects. In addition, you can cause damage to objects\
    \ and construct creatures by striking them with a melee touch attack. Objects\
    \ and constructs take 1d6 points of damage +1 for every two cleric levels you\
    \ possess. This attack bypasses an amount of damage reduction and hardness equal\
    \ to your cleric level. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal\
    \ to 3 + your Wisdom modifier."

  description: "At 8th level, you can emit a 30- foot aura of repetition for a number\
    \ of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. All enemies within this aura must\
    \ make a Will save each round or repeat their action from the previous round (if\
    \ possible). Creatures that attacked on the previous round attack again on the\
    \ following round, although they may change their target. Creatures that moved\
    \ the previous round must take the same move action again, although they may change\
    \ their route. Creatures that drank a potion must do so again, even they can only\
    \ drink from an empty bottle. Actions that cannot be repeated are wasted. These\
    \ rounds do not need to be consecutive."
