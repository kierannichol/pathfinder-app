    \ 100 feet. This wall is up to 20 feet high and up to 10 feet long per cleric\
    \ level you possess. The wall of ash blocks line of sight, and any creature passing\
    \ through it must make a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. The wall\
    \ of ash reveals invisible creatures that are inside it or adjacent to it, although\
    \ they become invisible again if they move away from the wall. You can use this\
    \ ability for a number of minutes per day equal to your cleric level, but these\
    \ minutes do not need to be consecutive."
