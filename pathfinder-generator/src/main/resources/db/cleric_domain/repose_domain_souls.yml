  description: "At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura that wards against death\
    \ for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. Living creatures\
    \ in this area are immune to all death effects, energy drain, and effects that\
    \ cause negative levels. This ward does not remove negative levels that a creature\
    \ has already gained, but the negative levels have no effect while the creature\
    \ is inside the warded area. These rounds do not need to be consecutive."

    \ if it is a magic weapon. This benefit lasts for a number of rounds equal to\
    \ your cleric level. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal\
    \ to 3 + your Wisdom modifier."
