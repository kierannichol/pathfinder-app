  \ turn. She becomes dying or dead at the end of her next turn as normal for her\
  \ current hit point total. This ability has no effect if the barbarian dies from\
  \ a cause other than hit point damage, such as from a death effect or if her Constitution\
  \ damage exceeds her Constitution score."
