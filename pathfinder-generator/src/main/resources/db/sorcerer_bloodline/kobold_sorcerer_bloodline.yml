  type: "SP"
  description: "At 1st level, as a standard action, you can sketch a single, nearly\
    \ invisible magical rune on any 5-foot-square solid surface. When you create a\
    \ rune, pick one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire.\
    \ While the rune is active, the next creature other than you who steps on or touches\
    \ the rune's area causes the rune to explode. The rune's explosion deals a number\
    \ of points of energy damage equal to 1d8 + 1 per sorcerer level you possess to\
    \ anything in its square. A Reflex saving throw halves the damage (DC 10 + 1/2\
    \ your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier). The rune is considered a magical\
    \ trap for the purpose of perceiving it or disabling it. The DC for both Perception\
    \ and Disable Device checks is the same as the Reflex saving throw to halve the\
    \ damage. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your\
    \ Charisma modifier. Each rune lasts for 24 hours or until discharged."
