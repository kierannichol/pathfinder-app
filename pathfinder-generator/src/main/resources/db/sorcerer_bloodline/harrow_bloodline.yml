    \ this ability, and is decorated as a garish ref lection of your personality.\
    \ Thereafter, you always visit this same home. You can place a portal to your\
    \ harrowed home once every 24 hours, but placing a new portal destroys the previous\
    \ one, and you can not move the entrance while you are inside. As long as you\
    \ are not in your harrowed home, time ceases to pass for anything and anyone still\
    \ in your pocket dimension; creatures cannot move, objects do not decay, and everything\
    \ remains exactly the same as you left it the last time you visited the plane.\

  \ back to a branch of the ancient Imlios clan (see History of the Harrow on pages\

  \ its inf luence back in his blood. Perhaps you are descended from exceptionally\
