    \ level. Your sorcerer levels stack with any wizard levels you possess when determining\
    \ the powers of your familiar or bonded object. This ability does not allow you\
    \ to have both a familiar and a bonded item. Once per day, your bonded item allows\
    \ you to cast any one of your spells known (unlike a wizard's bonded item, which\
    \ allows him to cast any one spell in his spellbook)."
