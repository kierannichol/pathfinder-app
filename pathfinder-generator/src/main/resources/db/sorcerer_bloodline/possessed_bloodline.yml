description: "Possessed sorcerers channel their magic potential through a unique bond\
  \ with a possessing spirit rather than through blood alone. These spirits take numerous\
  \ forms, but such is their tenaciousness that they bond in a way that prevents their\
  \ banishment from the host. Instead, both possessor and sorcerer work together,\
  \ their joint  nature allowing the sorcerer to unlock many unnatural abilities.\
  \ Outsider-rich nations such as Cheliax and the Worldwound are common places for\
  \ possessed sorcerers to appear, though anyplace where an outsider could possess\
  \ another living being would be equally suitable. The magical nature of a sorcerer's\
  \ bloodline means the sorcerer herself does not even need to be the creature initially\
  \ possessed to have this particular bloodline. It may be that one of your ancestors\
  \ was possessed by a powerful spirit, one whose presence was so overwhelming that\
  \ it sends ripples of power down through the generations."
