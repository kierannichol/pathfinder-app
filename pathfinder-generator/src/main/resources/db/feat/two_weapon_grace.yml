  \ with two weapons."

  \ Grace feats while fighting with two weapons. Your penalties from two-weapon fighting\
  \ increase by 2 on all attack rolls you make when doing so, and you can't decrease\

  \ further. Add 1/2 your Dexterity bonus to damage with your off-hand weapon instead\

  \ you can use the aforementioned feats despite your other hand being occupied."
