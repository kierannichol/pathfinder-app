id: "feat:rapid_reload"
name: "Rapid Reload"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen) or Exotic Weapon Proficiency\
  \ (firearm)."
benefit: "The time required for you to reload your chosen type of weapon is reduced\
  \ to a free action (for a hand or light crossbow), a move action (for heavy crossbow\
  \ or one-handed firearm), or a standard action (two-handed firearm). Reloading a\
  \ crossbow or firearm still provokes attacks of opportunity. If you have selected\
  \ this feat for a hand crossbow or light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many\
  \ times in a full-attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow."
normal: "A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or light\
  \ crossbow, a standard action to reload a one-handed firearm, or a full-round action\
  \ to load a heavy crossbow or a two-handed firearm."
special: "You can gain Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it\
  \ applies to a new type of crossbow or a new type of firearm."
