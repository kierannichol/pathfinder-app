id: "feat:befuddling_strike"
name: "Befuddling Strike"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "You know just where to strike to temporarily send your enemy into a\
  \ confused stupor."
prerequisites: "Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8."
benefit: "Befuddling Strike forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt\
  \ a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier),\
  \ in addition to dealing damage normally. You must declare that you are using this\
  \ feat before you make your attack roll--thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt.\
  \ A defender who fails this saving throw is confused for 1d4 rounds. You can attempt\
  \ to use Befuddling Strike once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but\
  \ can use it no more than once per round. Constructs, incorporeal creatures, mindless\
  \ creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot\
  \ be affected by this ability."
