benefit: "If you're the only one threatening a foe and an ally within 30 feet who\
  \ also has this feat is the only creature threatening a different foe, you gain\
  \ a +2 morale bonus on your melee attack rolls against the foe that only you are\
  \ threatening. You gain the bonus only if neither of the qualifying opponents is\
  \ flat-footed, helpless or otherwise unable to act. You must be able to see your\
  \ ally to gain the benefit of this feat. If another ally who is not threatening\
  \ your chosen foe makes any sort of attack against that foe (such as a ranged attack\
  \ or a spell), you lose this feat's benefit for 1 round."
