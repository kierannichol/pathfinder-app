description: "You attract a squire to aid you in your knightly endeavors."
prerequisites: "Character level 3rd, proficient with all martial weapons."

  \ You can only attract a 1st-level cohort (referred to hereafter as a squire) with\
  \ this feat, and cannot recruit followers until you have the Leadership feat. You\
  \ determine your Leadership score according to the rules presented in the Leadership\
  \ feat, but your squire is always at least three or more levels lower than yourself."
