name: "Clambering Escape"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "You can escape an area effect by throwing an enemy in its path to shield\
  \ yourself."
prerequisites: "Int 13, Combat Expertise, Improved Reposition, evasion class feature."
benefit: "When you successfully use your evasion class feature to avoid taking damage\
  \ from an effect that allows a Reflex saving throw, you can attempt a special reposition\
  \ combat maneuver check against any one foe within reach as an immediate action.\
  \ If successful, you switch positions with the target of your combat maneuver. If\
  \ your foe was not initially within range of the effect that you evaded, it must\
  \ save against the effect as if it had been within the area of effect."
