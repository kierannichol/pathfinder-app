id: "feat:desert_dweller"
name: "Desert Dweller"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "The endless sands and waterless wastes are your home, and neither the\
  \ heat nor dehydration presents as lethal of a threat to you as it does to other\
  \ travelers."
prerequisites: "Favored terrain (desert) class feature."
benefit: "You treat hot environments as though they were one step less severe; if\
  \ you have a similar ability from another feat, such as Torrid Tolerance, the benefits\
  \ stack and you treat hot conditions as if they were two steps less severe. You\
  \ need to consume only half the normal amount of water for a creature of your size,\
  \ and you gain a +4 bonus on Constitution checks to resist the effects of thirst.\
  \ You also gain a +4 bonus on saving throws and checks to avoid becoming blinded\
  \ or dazzled by glare or being deceived by a desert mirage."
