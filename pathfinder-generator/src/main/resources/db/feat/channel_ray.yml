name: "Channel Ray"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You can focus your channeled energy on a single target."
prerequisites: "Channel energy class feature."
benefit: "When you channel energy, you can project a ray from your holy symbol instead\
  \ of creating a burst. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit an unwilling\
  \ target; your target is then affected by the channeled energy as normal and receives\
  \ a saving throw. You need not make an attack roll to affect a willing creature\
  \ with the ray. The ray has a range of 30 feet per channel energy die, and its save\
  \ DC is increased by 2."
