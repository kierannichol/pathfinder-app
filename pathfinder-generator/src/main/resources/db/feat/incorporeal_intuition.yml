name: "Incorporeal Intuition"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Psychic Sensitivity or the ability to cast psychic spells, Spirit\
  \ Sense."
benefit: "You can sense the presence and movement of incorporeal creatures though\
  \ solid walls, as long as that incorporeal creature is adjacent to you. When you\
  \ sense a creature in this way, you can attempt a Knowledge (religion) check to\
  \ identify the creature and its special powers or vulnerabilities, with a â€“5 penalty.\
  \ When you sense an incorporeal creature with this ability and use a readied action\
  \ to attack it when it attacks from inside the wall, it doesn't gain cover against\
  \ your attack."
normal: "Incorporeal creatures are silent unless they choose to make a sound and are\
  \ thus almost impossible to detect when inside a solid wall. When readying to attack\
  \ an incorporeal creature in a solid wall, it gains cover against your attack."
