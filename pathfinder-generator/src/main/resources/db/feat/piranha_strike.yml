name: "Piranha Strike"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Weapon Finesse, base attack bonus +1."
benefit: "When wielding a light weapon, you can choose to take a -1 penalty on all\
  \ melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain a +2 bonus on all melee\
  \ damage rolls. This bonus to damage is halved (-50%) if you are making an attack\
  \ with an off-hand weapon or secondary natural weapon. When your base attack bonus\
  \ reaches +4, and for every 4 points thereafter, the penalty increases by -1 and\
  \ the bonus on damage rolls increases by +2. You must choose to use this feat before\
  \ the attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn. The bonus damage does\
  \ not apply to touch attacks or effects that do not deal hit point damage. This\
  \ feat cannot be used in conjunction with the Power Attack feat."
