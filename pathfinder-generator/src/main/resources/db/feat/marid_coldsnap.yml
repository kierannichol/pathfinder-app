name: "Marid Coldsnap"
type: "STYLE"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Con 15, Wis 17, Elemental Fist, Marid Spirit, Marid Style, Improved\
  \ Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +13 or monk level 11th."
benefit: "While using Marid Style, as a standard action, you can spend two Elemental\
  \ Fist attempts to unleash a 30-foot line of frigid water. Creatures caught in the\
  \ line take your unarmed strike damage plus the cold damage from your Elemental\
  \ Fist attack and are entangled in ice as per the Marid Spirit feat. A successful\
  \ Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the\
  \ damage by half and prevents a target from becoming entangled."
