id: "feat:hamatulatsu"
name: "Hamatulatsu"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "You have mastered a deadly fighting form inspired by the hideous attacks\
  \ of the barbed devil."
prerequisites: "Improved Unarmed Strike, Weapon Focus (unarmed strike)."
benefit: "Your unarmed attacks can deal either bludgeoning or piercing damage. You\
  \ decide which type of damage you deal whenever you attack a foe, but you may only\
  \ choose one type at a time. If you critically hit a foe with your unarmed strike\
  \ while doing piercing damage, the additional pain caused by the strike causes the\
  \ foe to become sickened for 1 round (or staggered for 1 round if the target is\
  \ already sickened). Multiple critical hits in a round against a single foe do not\
  \ increase the duration of the sickened or staggered condition."
normal: ""
special: "Hamatulatsu may be selected as a substitute bonus feat at 6th level by a\
  \ monk even if the monk does not otherwise meet the prerequisites. This fighting\
  \ style is normally only taught to women of a specific fighting school."
