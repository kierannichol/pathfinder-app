description: ""
prerequisites: ""
benefit: "The acid or fire effects of the affected spell adhere to the creature, causing\
  \ more damage the next round. When a creature takes acid or fire damage from the\
  \ affected spell, that creature takes damage equal to 2x the spell's actual level\
  \ at the start of its next turn. The damage is acid or fire, as determined by the\
  \ spell's descriptor. If a burning spell has both the fire and acid descriptor,\
  \ the caster chooses what kind of damage is dealt by the burning spell effect."
