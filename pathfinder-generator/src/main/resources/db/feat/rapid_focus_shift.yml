id: "feat:rapid_focus_shift"
name: "Rapid Focus Shift"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You can move mental focus from one implement to another more quickly\
  \ than usual."
prerequisites: "Caster level 5th, mental focus class ability."
benefit: "Once per day, you can take a full-round action to shift mental focus from\
  \ one implement to another. You must be undisturbed and able to concentrate. If\
  \ you take any damage during the transfer, you must succeed at a concentration check\
  \ (DC = 10 + the number of points of damage taken) to complete the transfer. If\
  \ you fail this check, you lose the points of mental focus instead of moving them\
  \ from one implement to the other."
normal: "Shifting focus between two implements takes 1 minute of quiet contemplation."
special: "You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you gain an additional\
  \ daily use of Rapid Focus Shift."
