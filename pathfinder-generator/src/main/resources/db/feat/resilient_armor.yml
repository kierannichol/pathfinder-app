name: "Resilient Armor"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "When you enhance your armor or shield, you gain a measure of damage\
  \ reduction."
prerequisites: "Divine bond (armor or shield), or sacred armor class feature."
benefit: "While your armor or shield is under the effect of your divine bond or your\
  \ sacred armor ability, you gain an amount of damage reduction equal to your armor's\
  \ enhancement bonus (including the bonus from your divine bond or sacred armor)\
  \ against the first attack to strike you in each round. An adamantine weapon overcomes\
  \ this damage reduction, but any attack against you made with such a weapon does\
  \ not count against this effect's duration."
