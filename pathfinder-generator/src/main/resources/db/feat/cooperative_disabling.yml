description: ""
prerequisites: "Disable Device 1 rank, trapfinding class feature."
benefit: "When you use the Disable Device skill and fail the check against a trap,\
  \ a single adjacent ally with this feat who is also within reach of the trap can\
  \ attempt a Disable Device check against the same device as an immediate action.\
  \ The ally must have remained adjacent throughout the process of disabling the device\
  \ and must have either aided your Disable Device check or taken no other action.\
  \ If your ally succeeds at the check, your attempt is considered to be successful.\
  \ If your ally fails, your attempt is considered to have failed by 5 or more, even\
  \ if the original check failed by 4 or less."
