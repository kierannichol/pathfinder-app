name: "Sabotage Magic Item"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Magical Aptitude, Disable Device 5 ranks, Use Magic Device 5 ranks."
benefit: "You can attempt a Use Magic Device check to sabotage a magic item rather\
  \ than to activate it, with the same DC as activating it blindly. If you succeed\
  \ at the check, you define a condition under which the magic item will suffer a\
  \ mishap, either dealing 2d6 points of damage to the creature attempting to use\
  \ the magic item and failing to perform its desired function or else affecting the\
  \ wrong target. The condition must be either an audible or a visual trigger, as\
  \ defined by the magic mouth spell. If you fail the check, you suffer a mishap instead,\
  \ just as if you had failed to activate the item blindly by 10 or more."
