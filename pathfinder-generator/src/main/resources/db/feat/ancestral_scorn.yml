name: "Ancestral Scorn"
type: "RACIAL"
description: "The fury you harbor for your fiendish ancestors gives evil outsiders\
  \ great reason to fear you."
prerequisites: "Intimidate 5 ranks, tiefling."
benefit: "Whenever you successfully demoralize an outsider of the evil subtype with\
  \ an Intimidate check, it becomes sickened for 1 round in addition to being affected\
  \ by the normal effects of being demoralized. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, the\
  \ creature is nauseated for 1 round instead."
normal: "Demoralizing a foe with a successful Intimidate check causes it to become\
  \ shaken for 1 round, +1 round for every 5 by which you beat the DC."
