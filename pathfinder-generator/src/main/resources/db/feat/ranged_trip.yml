description: ""
prerequisites: "Dex 13, Deadly Aim, base attack bonus +1."
benefit: "As a full-round action, you can attempt to perform a trip combat maneuver\
  \ with any ranged weapon at a –2 penalty. Add your Dexterity modifier to your CMB\
  \ in place of your Strength modifier and apply range penalties to your combat maneuver\
  \ check, doubling the penalties from range increments. If your target is more than\
  \ 30 feet away, you take an additional –2 penalty. If the trip attempt is successful,\
  \ the target also takes damage as if you had made a successful attack with that\
  \ weapon. You can't be knocked prone by failing the trip attempt."
