benefit: "When your invisibility ends, you gain concealment for 1 round per minute\
  \ of duration the invisibility effect had remaining (minimum 1 round). This only\
  \ occurs if the invisibility is from your racial spell-like ability or a spell you\
  \ cast. Effects that negate invisibility negate this concealment."
