id: "feat:dazing_fist"
name: "Dazing Fist"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "You know just where to strike to daze your foe."
prerequisites: "Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +4."
benefit: "You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack\
  \ roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). Dazing Fist forces a foe\
  \ damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 +\
  \ 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing damage\
  \ normally. A foe who fails this saving throw is dazed for 1 round, until just before\
  \ your next turn. You can attempt to use Dazing Fist once per day for every 4 character\
  \ levels you have, but no more than once per round. Constructs, incorporeal creatures,\
  \ plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected\
  \ by this ability."
