description: "An intentional near-miss demonstrates your frightening skill at range."
prerequisites: "Point-Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Weapon Focus, proficiency with the\
  \ selected weapon."
benefit: "As a standard action, you can make a ranged touch attack using a ranged\
  \ weapon with which you have Weapon Focus. If successful, instead of dealing damage\
  \ or applying any other effects of the attack, you may attempt an Intimidate check\
  \ to demoralize the target as a free action. The target doesn't need to be within\
  \ 30 feet, nor does it need to be able to see or hear you."
