type: "STYLE"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Improved Unarmed Strike, Sense Motive 3 ranks."
benefit: "When using this style, you can attempt a Sense Motive check (DC = 15 + CR\
  \ of target) as a move action against a creature with an Intelligence score of 3\
  \ or higher. If you succeed, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC against attacks\
  \ from the target creature until you are no longer using this style. You can have\
  \ this bonus against only one creature at a time: if you succeed at this Sense Motive\
  \ check against another creature, you lose the bonus against the first creature.\
  \ This bonus increases to +2 when you have 8 ranks in Sense Motive, and to +3 when\
  \ you have 13 ranks in Sense Motive."
