name: "Improved Blind-Fight"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "Your keen senses guide your hand against hidden foes."
prerequisites: "Perception 10 ranks, Blind-Fight."
benefit: "Your melee attacks ignore the miss chance for less than total concealment.\
  \ You may still reroll your miss chance percentile roll for total concealment. If\
  \ you successfully pinpoint an invisible or hidden attacker within 30 feet, that\
  \ attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you with ranged attacks. That is,\
  \ you don't lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn't get\
  \ the usual +2 bonus for being invisible."
