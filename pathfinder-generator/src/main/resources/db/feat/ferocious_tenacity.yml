id: "feat:ferocious_tenacity"
name: "Ferocious Tenacity"
type: "RACIAL"
description: "You spit in the face of death."
prerequisites: "Ferocity racial trait, half-orc or orc, rage class feature."
benefit: "Once per day when raging, if you are hit by an attack that would deal enough\
  \ hit points of damage to kill you (negative hit points equal to your Constitution\
  \ score), as an immediate action you may expend 1 or more rounds of rage to negate\
  \ some of this damage and keep yourself alive. Each round of rage you spend reduces\
  \ the attack's damage by 1 point, but cannot reduce the damage taken below 1 hit\
  \ point."

note: "If this damage still makes you fall unconscious, your rage ends just like it\
  \ normally would, lowering your Constitution to its normal value and reducing your\
  \ hit point total as normal. Therefore, it is possible to use this feat to prevent\
  \ yourself from instantly dying, yet you still die because your negative hit points\
  \ exceed your normal Constitution score--take your normal Constitution into account\
  \ when deciding how many rounds of rage to spend with this feat."
