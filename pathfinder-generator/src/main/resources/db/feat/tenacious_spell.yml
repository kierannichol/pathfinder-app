benefit: "Increase the DC of caster level checks to counter or dispel a tenacious\
  \ spell by 2. If a tenacious spell is dispelled or dismissed, it lasts for 1d4 further\
  \ rounds (to a maximum of the spell's normal duration) before ending (this does\
  \ not occur if antimagic field or a similar spell or effect suppresses or ends the\
  \ spell's effect without dispelling or dismissing it). The lingering auras of tenacious\
  \ spells detectable with detect magic last for twice as long as usual after the\
  \ spells end."
