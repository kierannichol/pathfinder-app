prerequisites: "Spellcraft 15 ranks, at least three metamagic feats."
benefit: "Pick one spell which you have the ability to cast. Whenever you cast that\
  \ spell you may apply any one metamagic feat you have to that spell without affecting\
  \ its level or casting time, as long as the total modified level of the spell does\
  \ not use a spell slot above 9th level. In addition, if you have other feats which\
  \ allow you to apply a set numerical bonus to any aspect of this spell (such as\
  \ Spell Focus, Spell Penetration, Weapon Focus [ray], and so on), double the bonus\
  \ granted by that feat when applied to this spell."
