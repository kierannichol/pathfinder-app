id: "feat:staggering_fist"
name: "Staggering Fist"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +2."
benefit: "When you damage a foe with your unarmed attack, you can also cause it to\
  \ be staggered for 1 round (until just before your next turn). The target can avoid\
  \ this with a successful Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level\
  \ + your Wisdom modifier). You must declare that you are using this feat before\
  \ you make your attack roll; thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt. You can\
  \ attempt to use this feat once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but\
  \ no more than once per round. Constructs, incorporeal creatures, plants, undead,\
  \ and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability."
