description: "Numerous Harrow readings early in your life seem to have hit the mark\
  \ precisely, increasing your belief that you are destined for a specific purpose\
  \ in life."
prerequisites: ""
benefit: "You get a +1 bonus on all Will saves made to resist enchantment effects.\
  \ Once per day, you may draw a card from a Harrow deck you own. At any one time\
  \ for the rest of that day, you may apply a +2 bonus on any d20 roll modified by\
  \ the card's suit. For example, if you drew a card from the suit of Dexterity, you\
  \ could apply this +2 bonus on an Initiative check, a Reflex save, a Dexterity-based\
  \ skill check, or a ranged attack roll. You may assign this +2 bonus after you make\
  \ the roll, but you must do so before you know whether the roll was a success or\
  \ not."
