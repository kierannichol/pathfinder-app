prerequisites: "Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist, Heal 6 ranks."
benefit: "When you make a successful Stunning Fist attempt against an opponent that\
  \ is grappled, helpless, or stunned, instead of imparting any other Stunning Fist\
  \ effect, you can cripple that opponent's mouth, dealing normal unarmed strike damage\
  \ and 1d4 points of bleed damage. Until the bleed damage ends, the target is unable\
  \ to use its mouth to attack, speak clearly, and employ verbal spell components.\
  \ A creature that is immune to critical hits or that has no discernible mouth is\
  \ immune to the effects of this feat."
