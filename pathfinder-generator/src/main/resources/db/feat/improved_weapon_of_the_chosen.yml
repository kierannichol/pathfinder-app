name: "Improved Weapon of the Chosen"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "You gain even greater favor when you use your deity's favored weapon."
prerequisites: "Weapon Focus with your deity's favored weapon, Weapon of the Chosen."
benefit: "This feat acts as Weapon of the Chosen, except you gain the benefits on\
  \ all attacks until the start of your next turn. Your attacks gain a single alignment\
  \ component of your deity--either chaotic, evil, good, or lawful--for the purpose\
  \ of overcoming damage reduction. If your deity is neutral with no other alignment\
  \ components, your attacks instead overcome damage reduction as though your weapon\
  \ were both cold iron and silver."
