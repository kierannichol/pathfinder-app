prerequisites: "Knowledge (geography) 10 ranks, ability to cast greater teleport."
benefit: "If you cast greater teleport--or similar teleportation effects that require\
  \ a reliable description of the location--but do not have a reliable description\
  \ of the destination, you can attempt a DC 25 Knowledge (geography) check prior\
  \ to casting the spell to gain a reliable description of some location within 100\
  \ miles of the destination. If you exceed the DC by 10, you gain a description of\
  \ some location within 50 miles, and if you succeed the DC by 20, you gain a description\
  \ of some location within 25 miles. Once you have attempted such a check for a specific\
  \ location, you cannot attempt it again, and if you attempt to use greater teleport\
  \ elsewhere in the same general area, the result is the same."
