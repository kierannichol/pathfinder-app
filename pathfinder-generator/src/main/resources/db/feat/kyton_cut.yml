type: "STYLE"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Wis 17, Exotic Weapon Proficiency (spiked chain), Kyton Shield, Kyton\
  \ Style, base attack bonus +8 or monk level 6th, Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks, ki\
  \ pool class feature."
benefit: "When using Kyton Style, your spiked chain attacks can be brutal, both to\
  \ yourself and your foe. Before attempting an attack roll with a spiked chain attack,\
  \ you can choose to make a Kyton Cut. Before making the attack, you take 1d6 points\
  \ of nonlethal damage. This damage cannot be avoided or reduced in any way. If you\
  \ are immune to nonlethal damage, you take normal damage instead. If the attack\
  \ hits, its target takes an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and a â€“4 penalty\
  \ on concentration checks for 1 round. The penalty is a pain effect."
