name: "Shocking Amplification"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "Your electricity spells tire their targets."
prerequisites: ""
benefit: "Whenever you cast a spell with the electricity descriptor that targets one\
  \ or more creatures, you can take a â€“1 penalty on attack rolls made with the spell\
  \ and reduce the spell's saving throw DC by 1 to cause the target closest to you\
  \ that is dealt electricity damage by the spell to become fatigued for 1 round.\
  \ This cannot cause a creature that is already fatigued to become exhausted. You\
  \ must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll or before your target\
  \ attempts its saving throw. This feat has no effect on spells that neither allow\
  \ a saving throw nor require an attack roll."
