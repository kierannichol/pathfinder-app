id: "feat:crashing_wave_buffet"
name: "Crashing Wave Buffet"
type: "STYLE"
description: "You disorient your opponents by pushing and pounding them mercilessly,\
  \ just like how the sea beats relentlessly against the rocks."
prerequisites: "Wis 15, Crashing Wave Style, Improved Drag, Improved Reposition, Improved\
  \ Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +6."
benefit: "When dragging or repositioning an opponent, you use your full body to knock\
  \ your opponent around like a constant wave. At the end of the drag or reposition\
  \ maneuver, your opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your\
  \ character level + your Wisdom modifier + 2 for every 5 feet you drag or reposition\
  \ your opponent). On a failed save, your opponent becomes disorientated from the\
  \ movement and takes a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, and Dexterity-based\
  \ skill checks until the end of its next turn."
