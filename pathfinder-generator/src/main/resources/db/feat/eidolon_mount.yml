id: "feat:eidolon_mount"
name: "Eidolon Mount"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "Your eidolon is capable of carrying you into combat with great skill."
prerequisites: "Eidolon able to choose quadruped or serpentine as a base form."
benefit: "Your eidolon is capable of serving you as a combat-trained mount. If the\
  \ eidolon's base form is not quadruped or serpentine, it also gains the ability\
  \ to transmute its physical body into a form suitable for you to ride. This functions\
  \ as the change shape ability, except the eidolon's base form changes to either\
  \ quadruped or serpentine and its size changes to be one size category larger than\
  \ its summoner's base size. Unlike other changes to size, this ability doesn't increase\
  \ the eidolon's ability scores, reach, or weapon damage beyond that of its true\
  \ form. (However, if the eidolon's size is reduced by this ability, its reach and\
  \ weapon damage are adjusted accordingly.) If the eidolon's base form is not quadruped\
  \ or serpentine when it gains this feat, it chooses which base form (quadruped or\
  \ serpentine) to assume when using this ability. The eidolon cannot choose a base\
  \ form that is not available to its subtype with this ability. If both base forms\
  \ are available to the eidolon's subtype, it can change which base form it assumes\
  \ when using this ability whenever it gains a new Hit Die. The eidolon can select\
  \ evolutions that have either base form as a requirement, but any evolutions that\
  \ require one of the base forms (but not the other) provide no benefit while the\
  \ eidolon is assuming the shape of its other base form."
