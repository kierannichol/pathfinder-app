description: "You are master of your own gravity in planar realms where gravity is\
  \ subjective."
prerequisites: "Wis 13."
benefit: "You automatically succeed at Wisdom checks to set a new direction of gravity.\
  \ When you set a new direction of gravity, you can reduce your falling speed by\
  \ up to two-thirds (to a minimum of 50 feet on the first round and 100 feet per\
  \ round thereafter) or increase it to a maximum of twice normal (300 feet on the\
  \ first round and 600 feet per round thereafter). These effects only apply on planes\
  \ with subjective directional gravity."
