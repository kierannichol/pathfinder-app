id: "feat:hell_knight_obedience"
name: "Hell Knight Obedience"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "Performing daily reckonings grants you special boons."
prerequisites: "Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks, must swear allegiance to a single Hell\
  \ Knight order."
benefit: "Upon taking this feat, you gain proficiency in all of your Hell Knight order's\
  \ favored weapons. Additionally, by meditating and inflicting strenuous reckonings\
  \ upon yourself, you unlock the power behind your order's doctrine. Each Hell Knight\
  \ order has its own unique reckoning--a trial of obedience and pain (described in\
  \ Hell Knight order). When coupled with the necessary reflection and meditation,\
  \ this reckoning takes 1 hour per day to perform. Once you have performed your order's\
  \ reckoning, you gain the benefit of a special ability as indicated in the Reckoning\
  \ entry for the Hell Knight order to which you've sworn allegiance. If you have\
  \ at least 12 Hit Dice, you also gain the first boon granted by the Hell Knight\
  \ order. If you have at least 16 Hit Dice, you also gain the Hell Knight order's\
  \ second boon. If you have 20 Hit Dice or more, you also gain the Hell Knight order's\
  \ third boon. Unless a specific duration or number of uses per day is listed in\
  \ a boon's description, the boon's effects are constant."
