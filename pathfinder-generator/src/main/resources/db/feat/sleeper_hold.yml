id: "feat:sleeper_hold"
name: "Sleeper Hold"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "By maintaining a grapple hold on your opponent, you can cause it to\
  \ lose consciousness."
prerequisites: "Greater Grapple, base attack bonus +8."
benefit: "You must declare that you are using this feat before you make a combat maneuver\
  \ check to maintain a grapple (thus a failed check to maintain the grapple ruins\
  \ the attempt). If you maintain a grapple for a number of consecutive rounds equal\
  \ to your opponent's Constitution bonus (minimum 1 round), you can attempt to knock\
  \ out your opponent. The victim must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your\
  \ character level + your Str modifier) or else it falls unconscious for 1d4 rounds.\
  \ Each successive round you attempt this, the target takes a cumulative –1 penalty\
  \ on its saving throw. When you use this feat, you take an additional –2 penalty\
  \ to your AC. Creatures that are immune to bleed damage, stunning, or critical hits\
  \ are immune to this ability."
