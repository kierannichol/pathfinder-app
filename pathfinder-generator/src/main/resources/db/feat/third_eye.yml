id: "feat:third_eye"
name: "Third Eye"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You possess and can open a third eye that permits you to see things\
  \ as they really are and gain greater insight into auras."
prerequisites: "Psychic Sensitivity or ability to cast psychic spells."
benefit: "Once per day as a standard action, you can open a spiritual third eye positioned\
  \ on your forehead between and above your normal eyes. You can keep this eye open\
  \ for up to 1 minute per character level you possess. This duration doesn't have\
  \ to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. Once per day while\
  \ your third eye is open, you can use the read aura occult skill unlock after 1\
  \ minute of intense concentration. This is in addition to the normal daily use of\
  \ read aura (which still takes 10 minutes). While your third eye is open, you gain\
  \ a +4 bonus on Perception checks to read auras, as well as a +8 bonus on Perception\
  \ checks to detect invisible creatures or objects or see through magical disguises\
  \ (both illusory ones and those provided by the change shape ability or polymorph\
  \ magic)."
normal: "Without this feat, you must spend 10 minutes in intense concentration to\
  \ read one of a creature or item's four auras, and you can do so only once per day."
special: "You can take this feat multiple times. Its effects don't stack. Each time\
  \ you take the feat, you increase the number of times per day you can open your\
  \ third eye (and read an aura) by one."
