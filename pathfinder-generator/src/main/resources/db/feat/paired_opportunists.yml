benefit: "Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you receive\
  \ a +4 circumstance bonus on attacks of opportunity against creatures that you both\
  \ threaten. Enemies that provoke attacks of opportunity from your ally also provoke\
  \ attacks of opportunity from you so long as you threaten them (even if the situation\
  \ or an ability would normally deny you the attack of opportunity). This does not\
  \ allow you to take more than one attack of opportunity against a creature for a\
  \ given action."
