name: "Agile Maiden"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "Your armor hinders you less than others."
prerequisites: "Str 13; Dex 13; Endurance or armor training class feature; proficiency\
  \ with heavy armor."
benefit: "For the purpose of class features (such as a ranger's combat style, a barbarian's\
  \ fast movement, or a magus's spellcasting), you treat Gray Maiden plate as medium\
  \ armor or heavy armor, whichever is more beneficial to a given ability. This does\
  \ not affect the armor's statistics, and it is still considered heavy armor for\
  \ all other purposes."
