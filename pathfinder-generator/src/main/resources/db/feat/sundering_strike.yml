benefit: "Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can sunder your\
  \ opponent's weapon, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your\

  \ separately). This does not provoke an attack of opportunity."

  \ critical hit: Bull Rush Strike, Disarming Strike, Repositioning Strike, Sundering\

  \ confirmation roll."
