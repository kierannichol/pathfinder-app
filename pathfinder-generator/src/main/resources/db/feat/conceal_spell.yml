name: "Conceal Spell"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Deceitful, Bluff 1 rank, Disguise 1 rank, Sleight of Hand 1 rank."
benefit: "When you cast a spell or use a spell-like ability, you can attempt to conceal\
  \ verbal and somatic components among other speech and gestures, and to conceal\
  \ the manifestation of casting the spell, so others don't realize you're casting\
  \ a spell or using a spell-like ability until it is too late. The attempt to hide\
  \ the spell slows your casting slightly, such that spells that normally take a standard\
  \ action to cast now take a full-round action, and spells that normally take longer\
  \ than a standard action take twice as long. (Swift action spells still take a swift\
  \ action.) To discover your ruse, a creature must succeed at a Perception, Sense\
  \ Motive, or Spellcraft check (the creature receives an automatic check with whichever\
  \ of those skills has the highest bonus) against a DC equal to 15 + your number\
  \ of ranks in Bluff or Disguise (whichever is higher) + your Charisma modifier;\
  \ the creature gains a bonus on its check equal to the level of the spell or spell-like\
  \ ability you are concealing."
