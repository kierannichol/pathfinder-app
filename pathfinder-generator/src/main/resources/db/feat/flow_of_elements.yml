type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Ability to cast spells; ifrit, oread, sylph, or undine."
benefit: "Whenever you're adjacent to an ifrit, oread, sylph, or undine ally who also\
  \ has this feat, you can spontaneously replace or split a spell's damage when casting\
  \ it, as though the spell were affected by Elemental Spell (without using a higher-level\
  \ spell slot). The type of energy damage depends on your ally's race: acid for oread,\
  \ electricity for sylph, fire for ifrit, or cold for undine."
