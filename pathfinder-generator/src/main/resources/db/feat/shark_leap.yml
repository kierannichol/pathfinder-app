id: "feat:shark_leap"
name: "Shark Leap"
type: "STYLE"
description: "Like a deadly predator, you bolt at unsuspecting foes from below."
prerequisites: "Improved Unarmed Strike, Shark Style, Shark Tear, Swim 10 ranks, base\
  \ attack bonus +10 or monk level 10th."
benefit: "While in Shark Style, when you're underwater with neutral, rising, or swiftly\
  \ rising buoyancy, you can perform a terrifying leap to attack opponents directly\
  \ above you. This works similarly to the charge action, except you can move only\
  \ straight up, and you make a single piercing unarmed strike or bite attack. If\
  \ the attack hits, it deals double damage; if the attack roll's result is also higher\
  \ than 11 + the target's Swim modifier, the attack knocks the target off-balance\
  \ until its next turn. Like with a charge, you can perform a partial version when\
  \ limited to a single standard action (such as in the surprise round); in addition\
  \ to moving half as far as normal for a partial charge, the attack doubles only\
  \ the damage dice (as per Vital Strike) rather than the full damage roll."
