id: "feat:disorienting_blow"
name: "Disorienting Blow"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "When you successfully strike your opponent with your Stunning Fist,\
  \ you leave it in a state of confusion."
prerequisites: "Stunning Fist, base attack bonus +11."
benefit: "You must choose to use this ability before making an attack roll with your\
  \ Stunning Fist, and this effect replaces other effects or conditions that would\
  \ be caused by Stunning Fist. If you successfully hit your opponent and it fails\
  \ its Fortitude save, it becomes confused for 1 round. Additional disorienting blows\
  \ to the confused target add to the duration of its confusion. This feat is otherwise\
  \ subject to all of the limits and conditions of Stunning Fist."
