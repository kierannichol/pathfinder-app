prerequisites: "Improved Unarmed Strike, Scorpion Style, base attack bonus +6."
benefit: "As a standard action, make a single unarmed melee attack against a foe whose\
  \ speed is reduced (such as from Scorpion Style). If the attack hits, you deal damage\
  \ normally and the target is staggered until the end of your next turn unless it\
  \ makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier).\
  \ This feat has no effect on targets that are staggered."
