description: ""
prerequisites: "Knowledge (dungeoneering) 1 rank, base attack bonus +1."
benefit: "You gain a +1 dodge bonus against attacks made by creatures at least two\
  \ size categories smaller than yourself, and gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage\
  \ rolls against such creatures. Additionally, you take only half damage from swarm\
  \ attacks, and as a full-round action can make a single attack with a natural or\
  \ bludgeoning weapon against an adjacent swarm. If the attack hits, you deal half\
  \ damage to the target, even if the swarm is small enough to normally be immune\
  \ to such attacks."
