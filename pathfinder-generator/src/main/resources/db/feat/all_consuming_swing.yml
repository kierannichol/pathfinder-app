id: "feat:all_consuming_swing"
name: "All-Consuming Swing"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "You deliver unchecked destruction when you stand against multiple foes,\
  \ sometimes to your own detriment."
prerequisites: "Str 13, Power Attack, Cleave, Vital Strike, base attack bonus +8."
benefit: "Whenever you use Cleave or Great Cleave, you can apply the additional damage\
  \ you would gain from Vital Strike, Improved Vital Strike, or Greater Vital Strike\
  \ to the initial target of your attack. When you do so, the strain on your body\
  \ causes you to take an amount of damage equal to the extra damage dealt by your\
  \ Vital Strike feat. This self-inflicted damage is not reduced by damage reduction."
