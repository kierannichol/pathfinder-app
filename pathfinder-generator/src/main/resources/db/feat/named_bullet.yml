type: "GRIT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Amateur Gunslinger feat or grit class feature, Gunsmithing, base attack\
  \ bonus +5."
benefit: "Whenever you craft ammunition using Gunsmithing, you may inscribe a bullet\
  \ or alchemical cartridge with the name of its intended target. The ammunition gains\
  \ the bane weapon special ability against the chosen creature only. If the ammunition\
  \ is used to attack any other target, the attack roll is instead made with a â€“2\
  \ penalty. Crafting a named bullet costs 1 grit point and reduces your maximum grit\
  \ points by 1 until the named bullet is fired or destroyed."
