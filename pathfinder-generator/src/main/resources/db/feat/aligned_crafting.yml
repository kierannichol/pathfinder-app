name: "Aligned Crafting"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "Your magical creations reject those you oppose."
prerequisites: "Craft Magic Arms and Armor or Craft Wondrous Item."
benefit: "When you craft a magic weapon, magic armor, a magic shield, or a wondrous\
  \ item, you can infuse it with a bit of your convictions. Creatures that are more\
  \ than one alignment step away from you are sickened while using or wearing this\
  \ item. An item that has been infused with your alignment can never have an opposing\
  \ special ability added to it later (for example, a longsword infused with your\
  \ lawful good alignment cannot later gain the anarchic weapon special ability).\
  \ Infusing the item with your alignment in this way increases the items total construction\
  \ cost by 10%."
