id: "feat:consecrate_spell"
name: "Consecrate Spell"
type: "METAMAGIC"
description: "You infuse spells with heavenly power, drastically increasing their\
  \ effectiveness against would-be heralds of evil."
prerequisites: "Aasimar, able to prepare or cast consecrate."
benefit: "A consecrated spell is treated as a maximized spell against evil creatures\
  \ and creatures with the evil subtype. Against all other creatures, this feat does\
  \ not modify the spell in any way (for example, a consecrated fireball acts as a\
  \ normal fireball against neutral or good creatures). This feat does not stack with\
  \ Maximize Spell."
