id: "feat:shade_of_the_woodlands"
name: "Shade of the Woodlands"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "Ordained as one of the sinister albino druids, you carry with you into\
  \ the wider world a powerful effigy of hair, twigs, and blood that crawls with the\
  \ deepening cold of the hallowed hunting grounds."
prerequisites: "Neutral evil, patron deity is an evil god."
benefit: "Add the following spells to your druid spell list."
normal: ""
special: "As part of this feat, you create a personal token that ties your soul and\
  \ your doings to the fell power of the dark forest. This potent object is treated\
  \ as a wooden unholy symbol that radiates faint necromancy magic. If your token\
  \ is ever destroyed, your connection to the shadowy heart of the forest is severed\
  \ and all benefits of this feat are lost until another is created. This process\
  \ requires a journey to the same forest and an atonement spell cast by a fellow\
  \ worshiper of your dark god."
