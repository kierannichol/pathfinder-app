id: "feat:blinded_competence"
name: "Blinded Competence"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "Your lack of sight enables you to strike your foes with uncanny precision."
prerequisites: "Blinded Blade Style, Blind-Fight, Improved Blind-Fight, Perception\
  \ 10 ranks."
benefit: "While you are using Blinded Blade Style and you are blinded or unable to\
  \ see, you do not need to succeed at Perception checks to pinpoint the location\
  \ of creatures within reach of your melee weapon, or your unmodified reach if you\
  \ are not wielding a melee weapon. This ability functions like blindsense, except\
  \ creatures you cannot see do not gain total concealment against you. Having this\
  \ feat counts as having 15 ranks in Perception for the purpose of satisfying the\
  \ prerequisites of the Greater Blind-Fight feat, as well as any feat that lists\
  \ Greater Blind-Fight as a prerequisite."
