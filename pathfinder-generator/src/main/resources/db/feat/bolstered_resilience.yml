  \ to a maximum of DR 20. The type of the DR remains unchanged. If the attack you\
  \ are guarding against is not successful, the increased damage reduction persists\
  \ until you are hit with an attack or until the start of your next turn, whichever\
  \ happens first. At the start of your next turn, you become fatigued. You cannot\
