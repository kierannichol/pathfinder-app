type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Cartogramancer, Knowledge (geography) 10 ranks, Knowledge (planes)\
  \ 10 ranks, ability to cast greater teleport and plane shift."
benefit: "When researching a plane to which you intend to plane shift, you can attempt\
  \ a DC 25 Knowledge (planes) check as you cast the spell. If you succeed at the\
  \ check, you're able to more precisely target your planar transport, allowing you\
  \ to arrive 5d20 miles away from your intended destination instead of 5d% miles\
  \ away. If you exceed the DC by 10 or more, you arrive 5d10 miles away instead,\
  \ and if you exceed the DC by 20 or more, you arrive 5d6 miles away."
