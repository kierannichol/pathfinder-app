name: "Channel Smite"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "You can channel your divine energy through a melee weapon you wield."
prerequisites: "Channel energy class feature."
benefit: "Before you make a melee attack roll, you can choose to spend one use of\
  \ your channel energy ability as a swift action. If you channel positive energy\
  \ and you hit an undead creature, that creature takes an amount of additional damage\
  \ equal to the damage dealt by your channel positive energy ability. If you channel\
  \ negative energy and you hit a living creature, that creature takes an amount of\
  \ additional damage equal to the damage dealt by your channel negative energy ability.\
  \ Your target can make a Will save, as normal, to halve this additional damage.\
  \ If your attack misses, the channel energy ability is still expended with no effect."
