benefit: "When you hit an opponent with a charge attack, you might also initiate a\
  \ bull rush as a free action. This does not require you to move into your opponent's\
  \ square and does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If you successfully push\
  \ your opponent 15 feet or more, he is also knocked prone."
