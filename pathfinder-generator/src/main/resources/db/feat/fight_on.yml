description: ""
prerequisites: "Con 13; dwarf, half-orc, or orc."
benefit: "Once per day, you can gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your\
  \ Constitution modifier. You can activate this feat as an immediate action when\
  \ reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. You can use this feat to prevent yourself from\
  \ dying. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. If your hit points drop below\
  \ 0 due to the loss of these temporary hit points, you fall unconscious and are\
  \ dying as normal. If you also have the ferocity racial trait, you can use that\
  \ once you have lost the temporary hit points from this feat."
