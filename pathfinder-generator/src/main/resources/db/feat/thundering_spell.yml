name: "Thundering Spell"
type: "METAMAGIC"
description: ""
prerequisites: ""
benefit: "You can modify a spell to deafen a creature damaged by the spell. When a\
  \ creature takes damage from this spell, it becomes deafened for a number of rounds\
  \ equal to the original level of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw,\
  \ a successful save negates the deafening effect. If the spell does not allow a\
  \ save, the target can make a Fortitude save to negate the deafening effect. If\
  \ the spell effect also causes the creature to become deafened, the duration of\
  \ this metamagic effect is added to the duration of the spell."
