name: "Runic Charge"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "You can deliver touch spells with frightful ferocity."
prerequisites: "Caster level 5th."
benefit: "As long as two of your hands are free, you can cast a spell with a range\
  \ of touch and deliver the spell to a single target as part of a charge action.\
  \ When you do so, you gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome the target's\
  \ spell resistance, and the critical threat range of that touch attack is 19â€“20.\
  \ This increased threat range does not stack with similar abilities such as Improved\
  \ Critical."
