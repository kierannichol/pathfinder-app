id: "feat:shadow_dodge"
name: "Shadow Dodge"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You use light and darkness to your advantage, confusing your enemies\
  \ and confounding their senses."
prerequisites: "Dex 13, worshiper of an evil god."
benefit: "You are able to use the light around you to move back and forth from shadow\
  \ to light again, and your sudden shifting dazzles your enemies' eyes. By spending\
  \ a number of feet (in 10-foot increments) when you use this feat to move from one\
  \ square to another and back again, you gain a Dodge bonus to your AC. This bonus\
  \ is equal to +1 for every 10 feet you spend moving like this. You do not provoke\
  \ an attack of opportunity while using this ability. Enemies who do not use sight\
  \ in order to pinpoint your location or who are otherwise able to locate you more\
  \ precisely (such as creatures that possess blindsight, tremorsense, or true seeing)\
  \ ignore this AC bonus. Likewise, this feat is ineffective in areas of darkness\
  \ or bright light, where one cannot readily shift between light and shadow."
