id: "feat:cooperative_counterspelling"
name: "Cooperative Counterspelling"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Spellcraft 5 ranks, racial spell-like ability replicating a spell\
  \ of 1st level or higher."
benefit: "When you and an ally who also has this feat both ready an action to counterspell,\
  \ you can counter a spell if you both expend any spell of the same level and school\
  \ as the spell you wish to counter. If you both attempt to counterspell with dispel\
  \ magic, you each gain a +2 bonus on your caster level checks. If you have more\
  \ than one ally readying an action to counterspell, you can select only one of those\
  \ allies for the purpose of this feat, and that ally must also select you."
