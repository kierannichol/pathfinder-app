name: "Archon Style"
type: "STYLE"
description: "You protect your allies from harm, even at the cost of your own safety."
prerequisites: "Combat Expertise; Combat Reflexes; base attack bonus +2 or monk level\
  \ 1st."
benefit: "While using this style, as a move action, you can protect adjacent allies\
  \ from a single opponent that you currently threaten. This grants adjacent allies\
  \ a +2 dodge bonus to AC against that opponent's next melee attack (as long as that\
  \ attack comes before the beginning of your next turn), but causes you to take a\
  \ â€“2 penalty to AC against that opponent until your next turn. The dodge bonus against\
  \ the designated opponent's attacks persists even if your allies move away from\
  \ you."
