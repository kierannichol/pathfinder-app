id: "feat:eclipse_strike"
name: "Eclipse Strike"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "A sudden darkness disorients your foe, leaving it unprotected against\
  \ your blinding attack."
prerequisites: "Tiefling, darkness racial spell-like ability."
benefit: "You can attack with an eclipse strike as a standard action if you and an\
  \ ally who also has this feat are both flanking the target. You and your ally must\
  \ both have at least one use of your darkness racial spell-like ability available\
  \ to make this attack. If your eclipse strike hits, your target is blinded for 1\
  \ round. Creatures that have the see in darkness ability are immune to the blindness\
  \ that is caused by an eclipse strike."
