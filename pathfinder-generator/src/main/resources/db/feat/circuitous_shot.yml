id: "feat:circuitous_shot"
name: "Circuitous Shot"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "You can bounce ranged attacks off objects to obscure their point of\
  \ origin and surprise foes."
prerequisites: "Dex 19, Blind-Fight, Improved Precise Shot, Point-Blank Shot, Precise\
  \ Shot, base attack bonus +11."
benefit: "You can choose to take a â€“2 penalty on a ranged weapon attack to ricochet\
  \ it off a stone or metal surface and resolve the attack as if it originated from\
  \ the chosen ricochet point for the purpose of determining cover (but not for determining\
  \ concealment). Add the entire distance the weapon or ammunition traveled to determine\
  \ range penalties for the attack. Bouncing a shot this way can potentially enable\
  \ you to make ranged attacks against foes who have total cover against you by going\
  \ around obstacles, but such a foe still has total concealment against your attack."
