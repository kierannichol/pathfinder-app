id: "feat:punishing_kick"
name: "Punishing Kick"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Con 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8."
benefit: "You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack\
  \ roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). On a successful hit, the attack\
  \ deals damage normally and you can choose to push your target 5 feet or attempt\
  \ to knock them prone. If you decide to push the target, it is moved 5 feet directly\
  \ away from you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the\
  \ target must end this move in a safe space it can stand in. If you decide to attempt\
  \ to knock the target prone, the target receives a Fortitude saving throw with a\
  \ DC of 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier to avoid the effect.\
  \ You may attempt a punishing kick attack once per day for every four levels you\
  \ have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round."
