name: "Helpless Prisoner"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Bluff 5 ranks, Escape Artist 1 rank, gnome."
benefit: "When you are restrained or imprisoned, you can make a Bluff check against\
  \ any one creature within 30 feet in which you emphasize both your own harmlessness\
  \ and the pain or inconvenience of your current condition. If the creature knows\
  \ you are dangerous, it adds a +4 bonus to its Sense Motive check. If you win the\
  \ check, the target does something intended to make you a little more comfortable--or\
  \ at least shut you up--that gives you a +5 bonus on your next Escape Artist check."
normal: ""
special: "At the GM's discretion, an especially evil or cruel creature may gain a\
  \ +2 bonus to its Sense Motive check to resist this ability. If it succeeds, it\
  \ does something to make your bindings even more secure and less comfortable, giving\
  \ you a â€“5 penalty on all Escape Artist checks made in those particular bonds."
