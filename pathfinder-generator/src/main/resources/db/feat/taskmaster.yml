description: ""
prerequisites: "Demoralizing Lash, Intimidate 5 ranks, Hobgoblin."
benefit: "As a standard action, you spur an ally, who must have fewer Hit Dice than\
  \ yourself, to reckless effort. For 1 minute, the ally gains a +1 morale bonus on\
  \ attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and Will saves against mind-affecting effects.\
  \ However, the ally also takes a â€“2 penalty to AC and on skill checks. To affect\
  \ an unwilling ally, you must succeed at an Intimidate check with the same DC used\
  \ to demoralize your ally."
normal: ""
special: "If you have 10 or more ranks in Intimidate, the morale bonus increases to\
  \ +2."
