id: "feat:mischievous_tail"
name: "Mischievous Tail"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "Your tail seems to have a mind of its own."
prerequisites: "Dex 15, Grasping Tail, you must have a tail."
benefit: "You can use your tail for all purposes as though it were a free hand, though\
  \ you cannot effectively wield weapons or shields with it (you can still carry such\
  \ objects with your tail, as long as such an object could also be comfortably carried\
  \ in a hand normally). In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on disarm and steal combat\
  \ maneuvers and Sleight of Hand checks performed using only your tail, and combat\
  \ maneuvers performed this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity."
