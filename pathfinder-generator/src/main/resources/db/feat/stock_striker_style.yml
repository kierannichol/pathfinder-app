name: "Stock-Striker Style"
type: "STYLE"
description: "Your fighting technique makes you equally deadly with your firearm's\
  \ stock as with its bullets."
prerequisites: "Pistol-whip gunslinger deed."
benefit: "When you perform the pistol-whip deed while using this style, you gain a\
  \ +1 bonus on the attack roll and on the combat maneuver check to knock the target\
  \ prone; this increases to +2 when you use a two-handed firearm. If you successfully\
  \ knock the target prone, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity from the target\
  \ until the end of your next turn when you make ranged attacks with your firearm.\
  \ You can treat one-handed firearms as light weapons for the purpose of abilities\
  \ such as Weapon Finesse when performing the pistol-whip deed."
