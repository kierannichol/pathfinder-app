name: "Perfect Strike"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8."
benefit: "You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack\
  \ roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). You must use one of the following\
  \ weapons to make the attack: kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, and siangham. You\
  \ can roll your attack roll twice and take the higher result. If one of these rolls\
  \ is a critical threat, the other roll is used as your confirmation roll (your choice\
  \ if they are both critical threats). You may attempt a perfect attack once per\
  \ day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than\
  \ once per round."
