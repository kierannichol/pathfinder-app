type: "GENERAL"
description: "You can prepare more spells than other arcanists can."
prerequisites: "Arcanist level 1st."
benefit: "You gain an extra spell prepared of the highest level you can currently\
  \ cast as an arcanist when selecting this feat. This is in addition to the number\
  \ of spells you can normally prepare from your spellbook. You can instead add two\
  \ spells prepared, but both of these spells must be at least 1 level lower than\
  \ the highest-level spell you can currently cast as an arcanist when selecting this\
  \ feat. You must choose which benefit you gain when you take this feat, and the\
  \ extra spells prepared do not change level when you gain access to higher-level\
  \ spells."
