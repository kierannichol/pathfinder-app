type: "COMBAT"
description: "You can fire multiple arrows at a single target."
prerequisites: "Dex 17, Point-Blank Shot, Rapid Shot, base attack bonus +6."
benefit: "When making a full-attack action with a bow, your first attack fires two\
  \ arrows. If the attack hits, both arrows hit. Apply precision-based damage (such\
  \ as sneak attack) and critical hit damage only once for this attack. Damage bonuses\
  \ from using a composite bow with a high Strength bonus apply to each arrow, as\
  \ do other damage bonuses, such as a ranger's favored enemy bonus. Damage reduction\
  \ and resistances apply separately to each arrow."
