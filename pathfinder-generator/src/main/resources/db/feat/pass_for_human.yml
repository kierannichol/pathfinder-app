id: "feat:pass_for_human"
name: "Pass For Human"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You're easily mistaken for a human rather than a member of your own\
  \ race."
prerequisites: "Half-elf, half-orc, or halfling (see Special)."
benefit: "You receive a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to disguise yourself as a human,\
  \ and do not receive the penalty for disguising yourself as a member of another\
  \ race when you do so. In areas largely populated or settled by humans, you can\
  \ take 10 on your Disguise check, meaning most people tend to assume you are human\
  \ unless given a reason to think otherwise."
normal: ""
special: "A halfling may take this feat, but must have the Childlike feat as a prerequisite.\
  \ The benefits of the two feats stack."
