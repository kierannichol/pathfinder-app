description: ""
prerequisites: "Aasimar, daylight racial spell-like ability."
benefit: "Whenever you are within 15 feet of an aasimar ally who has both the daylight\
  \ racial spell-like ability and this feat, you gain an aura of radiance. You and\
  \ your ally must both have at least one use of your daylight racial spell-like ability\
  \ available to gain this benefit. This aura functions as per the daylight spell,\
  \ except that it's a 10-foot-radius emanation centered on you without additional\
  \ areas of weaker illumination. Creatures within this aura who take penalties in\
  \ bright light double those penalties."
