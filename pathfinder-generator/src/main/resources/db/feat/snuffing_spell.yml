prerequisites: ""
benefit: "You can modify a spell to extinguish magical and non-magical light sources\
  \ that the target has. The first time a creature takes damage from or fails a saving\
  \ throw against a snuffing spell, any non-magical light sources it has are immediately\
  \ extinguished and you can attempt to dispel any active spells with the light descriptor\
  \ that are affecting the target as if you had also cast the targeted version of\
  \ dispel magic. Spells that do not target creatures can't be snuffing spells."
