name: "Lucky Healer"
type: "RACIAL"
description: "Your luck allows you to draw from magical healing far more efficiently\
  \ than most."
prerequisites: "Adaptive luck racial trait, halfling."
benefit: "When a magical healing effect (such as a spell with â€œcure\" in the title\
  \ or channel energy) cures you, you can spend one use of your adaptable luck racial\
  \ trait to reroll the amount of damage cured. You regain a number of hit points\
  \ equal to the new roll or the original roll, whichever is greater. Other creatures\
  \ healed by the effect do not gain this benefit."
