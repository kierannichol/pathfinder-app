description: "Your allies assist you in avoiding certain attacks."
prerequisites: ""
benefit: "Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, and both of\
  \ you are required to make a reflex saving throw against a spell or effect, you\
  \ may take the result of your die roll or that of your ally (your modifiers still\
  \ apply to the roll, regardless of which result you take). If you take your ally's\
  \ result, you are knocked prone (or staggered on your next turn, if you are already\
  \ prone or cannot be knocked prone). In addition, you receive a +2 cover bonus to\
  \ your AC against ranged attacks as long as your ally is wielding a shield."
