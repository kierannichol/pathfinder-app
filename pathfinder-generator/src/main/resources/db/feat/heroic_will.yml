name: "Heroic Will"
type: "RACIAL"
description: "Your indomitable will breaks free from mental shackles."
prerequisites: "Iron Will, base Will save +4, human."
benefit: "Once per day as a standard action, you may attempt a new saving throw against\
  \ a harmful condition requiring a Will save that is affecting you. If you are dominated,\
  \ controlled, or cannot take an action because of the effect against which you are\
  \ trying to make a new saving throw, you can make this saving throw at the start\
  \ of the turn as no action, but on a success, your turn ends. You cannot use this\
  \ feat to remove instantaneous effects, effects that do not require a Will save,\
  \ or effects that do not allow a saving throw."
