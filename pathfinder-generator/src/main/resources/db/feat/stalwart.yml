id: "feat:stalwart"
name: "Stalwart"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You adopt a defensive stance that allows you to absorb and redirect\
  \ hits."
prerequisites: "Diehard, Endurance, base attack bonus +4."
benefit: "While using the total defense action, fighting defensively action, or Combat\
  \ Expertise, you can forgo the dodge bonus to AC you would normally gain to instead\
  \ gain an equivalent amount of DR, to a maximum of DR 5/--, until the start of your\
  \ next turn. This damage reduction stacks with DR you gain from class features,\
  \ such as the barbarian's, but not with DR from any other source. If you are denied\
  \ your Dexterity bonus to AC, you are also denied this DR."
