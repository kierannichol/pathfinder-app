name: "Harrowed Summoning"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Harrowed."
benefit: "When you cast a conjuration (summoning) spell or use a spell-like ability\
  \ to summon one or more creatures, you can draw two random cards from a complete\
  \ harrow deck you own. Doing so adds both a somatic component (if the spell does\
  \ not already have one) and a focus component (the harrow deck) to the spell, but\
  \ does not increase the spell's casting time."
