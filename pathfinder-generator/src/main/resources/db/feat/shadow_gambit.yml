id: "feat:shadow_gambit"
name: "Shadow Gambit"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Spell Focus (illusion), caster level 5th."
benefit: "As a standard action, you can draw upon energies from the Plane of Shadow\
  \ to cause an ongoing figment spell you cast to damage a foe as if the illusion\
  \ were real. The illusion must be one you retain ongoing control of, such as minor\
  \ image, and the target must be both visible to you and within or adjacent to the\
  \ area of your illusion. Using this feat immediately ends the figment's duration."
