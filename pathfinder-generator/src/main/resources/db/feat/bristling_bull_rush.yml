id: "feat:bristling_bull_rush"
name: "Bristling Bull Rush"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You deal damage to opponents when bull rushing them through difficult\
  \ terrain, using the environment itself to harm your targets."
prerequisites: "Str 13, Improved Bull Rush, Power Attack, base attack bonus +3."
benefit: "When you successfully bull rush a creature, it takes 1d4 points of damage\
  \ for every 5 feet it is pushed through naturally occurring difficult terrain. This\
  \ damage is in addition to any damage the creature might normally take from moving\
  \ through the difficult terrain. Creatures with the woodland stride special ability\
  \ or who are otherwise unaffected by difficult terrain are immune to this extra\
  \ damage."
