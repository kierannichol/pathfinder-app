benefit: "Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you can move\
  \ into your ally's square as part of normal movement. At the same time, your ally\
  \ moves into your previous space as an immediate action. Both you and your ally\
  \ must be willing and able to move to take advantage of this feat. Your ally must\
  \ be the same size as you to utilize this feat. Your ally does not provoke an attack\
  \ of opportunity from this movement, but you provoke as normal. This movement does\
  \ not count against your ally's movement on his next turn."
