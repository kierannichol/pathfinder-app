id: "feat:divert_harm"
name: "Divert Harm"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Int 13, Combat Expertise, base attack bonus +6, evasion class feature."
benefit: "Whenever you are the target of an area-of-effect attack that normally deals\
  \ half damage on a successful Reflex save (such as a fireball spell or dragon's\
  \ breath weapon), you may, as an immediate action, wrestle an adjacent foe into\
  \ harm's way. This does not alter the position of you or your opponent, but your\
  \ opponent must attempt a Reflex save against the attack in your place. If your\
  \ opponent fails, it takes half damage from the attack and you take none; if it\
  \ succeeds, it takes no damage and you take damage as normal as though you'd failed\
  \ your saving throw (though this damage is still reduced by abilities such as improved\
  \ evasion). This feat works even if the opponent was already in the affected area\
  \ of the attack (so it is possible that an unlucky opponent could take as much as\
  \ 1-1/2 times the damage normally possible from the attack). You can use this ability\
  \ only on a foe within one size category of yourself."
