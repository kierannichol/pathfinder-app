id: "feat:fox_shape"
name: "Fox Shape"
type: "RACIAL"
description: "You can change into a fox in addition to your other forms."
prerequisites: "Cha 13, base attack bonus +3, kitsune."
benefit: "You can take the form of a fox whose appearance is static and cannot be\
  \ changed each time you assume this form. Your bite attack's damage is reduced to\
  \ 1d3 points of damage on a hit, but you gain a +10 racial bonus on Disguise checks\
  \ made to appear as a fox. Changing from kitsune to fox shape is a standard action.\
  \ This ability otherwise functions as beast shape II, and your ability scores change\
  \ accordingly."
