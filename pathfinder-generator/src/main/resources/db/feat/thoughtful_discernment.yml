name: "Thoughtful Discernment"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Discern lies class feature."
benefit: "Once per day as a free action, you can think back about a single statement\
  \ you heard in the last day and determine if it was a lie. This acts like the discern\
  \ lies spell, but instead of affecting a creature, it affects a single statement\
  \ a creature has made. For example, if the king told you, â€œMy daughter is in the\
  \ monster's dungeon\"\x9d before you left to find her, as long as the king said\
  \ that to you within the past day, you can use this feat to determine whether or\
  \ not the king deliberately and knowingly lied to you when he made that statement."
