description: "A quick sweep of your cloak deflects an incoming attack."
prerequisites: "Prerequisite(s) Dex 13, Dodge."
benefit: "Benefit(s) When you make a dueling dodge while wearing a cloak, you gain\
  \ evasion (as the rogue ability). If a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on\
  \ you, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and\
  \ damage is instead rolled normally. This feat only applies until the attack that\
  \ triggered the immediate action is resolved. This feat does not stack with the\
  \ fortification armor special ability or similar effects."
