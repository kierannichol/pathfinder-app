id: "feat:welcome_pain"
name: "Welcome Pain"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "Your appreciation of pain grants you great stamina."
prerequisites: "Iron Will, worshiper of an evil god."
benefit: "Whenever you would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points because of an ongoing\
  \ or repeating damage effect (such as bleed), you may make a last-ditch effort to\
  \ shed the condition. If you succeed at a DC 25 Will save, you ignore the damage\
  \ that would reduce you to 0 or fewer hit points that turn. The DC of each subsequent\
  \ save made in this manner increases by 1. In addition, spells or abilities that\
  \ have the pain descriptor deal only half damage to you (if any)."
