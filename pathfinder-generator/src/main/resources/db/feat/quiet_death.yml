name: "Quiet Death"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Dex 19, Stealth 10 ranks, rogue level 10th."
benefit: "When you ambush an enemy or enemies that are unaware of your presence, you\
  \ can roll a Stealth check with a –5 penalty. The result indicates the Perception\
  \ DC to hear your attacks (rather than the normal DC of –10 to hear pitched combat)\
  \ until an opponent's first action, when the DC returns to –10. Other enemies present\
  \ can still see the attack; Quiet Death only prevents the sounds of battle from\
  \ alerting further enemies."
