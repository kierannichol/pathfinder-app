id: "feat:covering_fire"
name: "Covering Fire"
type: "TEAMWORK"
description: "Your shot can put an enemy off guard, giving your teammates the opportunity\
  \ to act."
prerequisites: "Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms), Weapon Focus (at least one firearm)."
benefit: "When you hit a foe with a firearm for which you have Weapon Focus, that\
  \ creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls for 1 round against any other ally\
  \ that also has this feat; this changes to a –4 penalty on attacks of opportunity.\
  \ The penalty applied by this feat does not stack with itself. However, if both\
  \ you and an ally with this feat attack the same foe, you can cover each other (since\
  \ a penalty you impose with this feat doesn't apply to attacks against you)."
