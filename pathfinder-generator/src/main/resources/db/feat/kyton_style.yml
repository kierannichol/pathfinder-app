type: "STYLE"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Wis 13, Exotic Weapon Proficiency (spiked chain), Knowledge (planes)\
  \ 3 ranks, ki pool class feature."
benefit: "When using this style, you treat spiked chains as if they had the monk special\
  \ weapon feature. Additionally, if you have Stunning Fist, you can spend 1 point\
  \ from your ki pool to make a Stunning Fist attack with your spiked chain instead\
  \ of an unarmed strike. This still costs a use of Stunning Fist as normal."
