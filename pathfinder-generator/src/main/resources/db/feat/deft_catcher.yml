type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Skill Focus (Sleight of Hand)."
benefit: "Whenever you drop or are forced to drop an item you possess (other than\
  \ by an effect that disarms or steals the item), you can attempt a DC 20 Sleight\
  \ of Hand check as an immediate action to catch the item before it falls away. If\
  \ you are targeted by an effect that would disarm or steal an item you're holding,\
  \ such as a disarm or steal combat maneuver or the effects of a spell like telekinesis,\
  \ you can also attempt a Sleight of Hand check as an immediate action to maintain\
  \ possession of the errant item (DC = 10 + the combat maneuver check result if there\
  \ was a combat maneuver check, or 20 + the DC of the spell if there was no combat\
  \ maneuver check). In either case, if you fail the Sleight of Hand check by 10 or\
  \ more, you fall prone."
