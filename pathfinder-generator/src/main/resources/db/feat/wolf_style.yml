name: "Wolf Style"
type: "STYLE"
description: "While in this style, you hamper foes that turn their backs on you."
prerequisites: "Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, Knowledge (nature) 3 ranks."
benefit: "While using this style, whenever you deal at least 10 points of damage to\
  \ a foe with an attack of opportunity, that foe's base speed decreases by 5 feet\
  \ until the end of its next turn. For every 10 points of damage your attack deals\
  \ beyond 10, the foe's base speed decreases by an additional 5 feet. If the penalty\
  \ meets or exceeds the total base speed of the foe, you can attempt to trip the\
  \ foe as a free action after the attack of opportunity is resolved."
