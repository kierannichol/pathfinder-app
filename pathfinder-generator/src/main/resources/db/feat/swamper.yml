description: "The soft ground and flowing reeds of fetid bogs and misty marshes are\
  \ as comfortable to you as any sunny meadow would be for others."
prerequisites: "Favored terrain (swamp) class feature."

  \ to maintain your balance when moving across a slippery surface, and you can move\

  \ normal in fog, mist, murky water, vegetation, and similarly obscuring conditions,\
  \ and creatures adjacent to you never gain concealment from fog, mist, murky water,\
  \ or vegetation."
