id: "feat:stunning_fist"
name: "Stunning Fist"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8."
benefit: "You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack\
  \ roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). Stunning Fist forces a foe\
  \ damaged by your unarmed attack to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your\
  \ character level + your Wis modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally.\
  \ A defender who fails this saving throw is stunned for 1 round (until just before\
  \ your next turn). A stunned character drops everything held, can't take actions,\
  \ loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, and takes a –2 penalty to AC. You may attempt\
  \ a stunning attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see\
  \ Special), and no more than once per round. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead,\
  \ incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be stunned."
