id: "feat:babble_peddler"
name: "Babble-Peddler"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Appraise 5 ranks, Bluff 5 ranks, gnome."
benefit: "Make a Bluff check to praise the value and worth of an object in your hand\
  \ while denigrating an object held by a nearby creature; this takes anywhere from\
  \ 1 round to 1 minute depending on the appearance and nature of the items. If the\
  \ creature fails its check, it agrees to exchange your object for its own. Obvious\
  \ differences in the value between the exchanged items give your roll a +4 or –\
  4 modifier, at the GM's discretion (offering a clay cup for a jeweled dagger gives\
  \ your roll a –4 penalty). The GM may rule that some items are too obviously valuable\
  \ or worthless for this feat to apply (a king wouldn't trade his crown for any item,\
  \ and no normal person would trade an item for a piece of garbage). If you fail\
  \ the check by 5 or more, the target is insulted and his attitude toward you worsens\
  \ by one category."
