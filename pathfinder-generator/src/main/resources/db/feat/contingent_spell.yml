id: "feat:contingent_spell"
name: "Contingent Spell"
type: "METAMAGIC"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Ability to cast cure spells (a cure spell is any spell with “cure\"\
  \ in its name)."
benefit: "A contingent spell infuses a target with a dormant healing or restorative\
  \ spell that can trigger when the target needs it the most. This metamagic feat\
  \ can be applied to only cure spells; breath of life; or any harmless spell that\
  \ can be used to remove ability score damage, ability score drain, or a negative\
  \ condition or effect (including break enchantment, neutralize poison, and remove\
  \ disease). When you cast a contingent spell, you must set a specific trigger that\
  \ dictates under what circumstances the target is immediately subject to the spell's\
  \ effects (for instance, “When the target dies, breath of life takes effect\").\
  \ The contingent spell's effects can remain dormant within the target for up to\
  \ 10 minutes per caster level you have. A creature can be infused with only one\
  \ contingent spell at a time."
