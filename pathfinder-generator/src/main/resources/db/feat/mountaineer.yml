description: "You are thoroughly at home in the high peaks and precipices of alpine\
  \ territory."
prerequisites: "Favored terrain (mountains) class feature."
benefit: "You gain a +2 bonus on Climb checks on natural stone surfaces and a +4 bonus\
  \ on Fortitude saves to avoid high-altitude fatigue and altitude sickness. If you\
  \ spend 24 hours at a dangerous altitude, you treat that altitude as if it were\
  \ one category lower. If you spend at least 1 week at that altitude, you are immune\
  \ to altitude fatigue or sickness. If you go to a lower altitude for more than 1\
  \ week, you lose this acclimation."
