name: "Loyal To The Death"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Human."
benefit: "Whenever an opponent makes a melee or ranged attack against one of your\
  \ allies who is adjacent to you and who also has this feat, you can spend an immediate\
  \ action to shield the ally with your own body. You become the target of the attack,\
  \ and the opponent gains a +4 bonus on her attack roll. For the purpose of determining\
  \ distance, cover and concealment, you count as being in your ally's square when\
  \ the attack is resolved. If the attack misses you due to concealment, blink, or\
  \ a similar effect, it instead targets your ally as if you had not used this feat's\
  \ ability."
