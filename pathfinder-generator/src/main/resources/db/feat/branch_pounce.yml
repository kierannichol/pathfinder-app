name: "Branch Pounce"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "You are adept at exploiting higher ground to its greatest advantage\
  \ in battle, and can leap from above to deal incredible damage to your foes."
prerequisites: "Climb 3 ranks, Stealth 3 ranks."
benefit: "When charging a target by jumping down from above (such as when jumping\
  \ out of a tree), you can soften your fall with a melee attack. If the attack at\
  \ the end of your charge hits, the attack deals damage as normal and you also deal\
  \ the amount of falling damage appropriate to your fall to the target (1d6 points\
  \ for a 10-foot fall, 2d6 points for a 20-foot fall, and so on). This falling damage\
  \ is not multiplied on a critical hit. You land in an unoccupied square of your\
  \ choosing adjacent to the target, and you take falling damage as if your fall had\
  \ been 10 feet shorter. You can attempt an Acrobatics check as normal to treat the\
  \ fall as an additional 10 feet shorter for the purpose of determining the damage\
  \ you take from the fall. If your attack misses, you land prone in a random square\
  \ adjacent to the target and automatically take the full amount of falling damage."
