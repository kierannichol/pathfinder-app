description: "You can weave bardic music effects into your spellcasting in such a\
  \ way that your spellcasting and bardic performance become indistinguishable."
prerequisites: "Bardic performance ability."
benefit: "Whenever you cast a 1st or higher level spell while you are maintaining\
  \ a bardic performance, you can maintain the bardic performance for that round without\
  \ expending one of your rounds of performance for the day. In addition, you can\
  \ switch from one bardic performance to another as a swift action when you cast\
  \ a spell while maintaining a bardic performance."
