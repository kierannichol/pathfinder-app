  \ both the creature and any creature possessing it are damaged by your attack (the\
  \ amount of damage includes your weapon's damage dice, your Strength modifier, weapon\
  \ special abilities, and so on). The possessing creature can attempt a Will save\
  \ (DC = 10 + 1/2 your base attack bonus + your Charisma modifier) to halve the damage.\
  \ Damage Reduction applies normally against this attack, but incorporeal creatures\
  \ take full damage from this attack as if they were corporeal."
