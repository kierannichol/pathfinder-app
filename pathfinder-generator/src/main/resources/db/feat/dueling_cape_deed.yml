id: "feat:dueling_cape_deed"
name: "Dueling Cape Deed"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "You can use a simple cape to guard yourself and confound your foes."
prerequisites: "Dodge, Sleight of Hand 1 rank."
benefit: "As a move action, you can wrap a cape that you're wearing around your arm\
  \ (removing it if necessary), and treat it as a buckler. If you are using the cape\
  \ in this way, and an opponent misses you with a melee attack, as an immediate action\
  \ you can spend 1 panache point to release your cape from your arm and entangle\
  \ your foe in it. The foe can free it by using a full-round action to escape or\
  \ by destroying the cape; a typical cape has hardness 1 and 3 hit points. You can\
  \ use this feat with items similar in shape and weight to a cape, such as a cloak\
  \ or a curtain."
