prerequisites: "Arcane Strike, ability to cast arcane spells, bloodrage class feature."

  \ Strike, Improved Vital Strike, or Greater Vital Strike, the bonus on damage rolls\
  \ for Arcane Strike is multiplied by the number of times (two, three, or four) you\
  \ roll damage dice for one of those feats."
