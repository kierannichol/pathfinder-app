id: "feat:alchemical_strike"
name: "Alchemical Strike"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "By focusing all your attention into a single attack, you vastly increase\
  \ the effectiveness of thrown alchemical items."
prerequisites: "Throw Anything, base attack bonus +6."
benefit: "You can throw a single alchemical item as a full-attack action, increasing\
  \ the effectiveness of the alchemical agent thrown. When throwing a single alchemical\
  \ item as a full-attack action, you increase the DC of any effects associated with\
  \ that alchemical item by 2. When your base attack bonus reaches +11 and every 5\
  \ points of bonus thereafter, increase the saving throw DC of the alchemical item\
  \ by an additional 2. This feat does not apply to an alchemist's bombs."
normal: ""
special: "An alchemist can take this feat in place of an alchemist discovery. He does\
  \ not need to meet its prerequisites. The alchemist uses his class level, rather\
  \ than the base attack bonus granted by the alchemist class, to calculate his total\
  \ base attack bonus for the purposes of determining the bonus granted by this feat."
