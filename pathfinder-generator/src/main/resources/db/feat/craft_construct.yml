description: "You can create construct creatures like golems."
prerequisites: "Caster level 5th, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Wondrous Item."
benefit: "You can create any construct whose prerequisites you meet. The act of animating\
  \ a construct takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its market price. To create a construct,\
  \ you must use up raw materials costing half of its base price, plus the full cost\
  \ of the basic body created for the construct. Each construct has a special section\
  \ that summarizes its costs and other prerequisites. A newly created construct has\
  \ average hit points for its Hit Dice."
