name: "Tactical Reposition"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "You excel at moving foes right where you want them."
prerequisites: "Int 13, Combat Expertise, Improved Reposition."
benefit: "When making a reposition combat maneuver, you can move an enemy into a trap\
  \ or other hazardous area, such as a pit, wall scythe, or blade barrier. When you\
  \ do so, the moved enemy is treated as though it had activated the trap or triggered\
  \ the hazard, and it takes a â€“2 penalty to AC and on saving throws to mitigate the\
  \ trap or hazard's effects."
normal: "You cannot reposition a foe into an intrinsically dangerous space such as\
  \ a pit or blade barrier."
