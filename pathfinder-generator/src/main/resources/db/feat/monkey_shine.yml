description: "You combine acrobatics and opportunity to devastating effect against\
  \ your opponent."
prerequisites: "Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, Monkey Moves, Monkey Style, Stunning\
  \ Fist, Acrobatics 11 ranks, Climb 11 ranks."
benefit: "While using Monkey Style, if you successfully deliver a Stunning Fist attempt,\
  \ in addition to the normal effect of Stunning Fist, you can spend a free action\
  \ to enter a square adjacent to you that is within your opponent's space. This movement\
  \ does not provoke attacks of opportunity. While you are in your opponent's space,\
  \ you gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC and a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls against that\
  \ opponent. If otherwise unhindered, the opponent can move away from you, but if\
  \ he does, he provokes an attack of opportunity from you even if his choice of movement\
  \ does not normally do so."
normal: "You cannot enter an opponent's space."
