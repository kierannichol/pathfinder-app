name: "Sympathetic Rage"
type: "RACIAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Half-orc or orc, nonlawful."
benefit: "Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who is raging, you may choose to enter\
  \ a similar but less powerful rage as a free action on your turn. This weaker rage\
  \ gives you all the benefits and penalties of a barbarian's rage, except your morale\
  \ bonus to Strength and Constitution is only +2. There is no limit to how long you\
  \ can rage, as long as you remain adjacent to a raging ally (for example, you could\
  \ take a 5-foot step away from one raging ally toward another raging ally and maintain\
  \ your rage). As with a barbarian's rage, when this weaker rage ends, you are fatigued.\
  \ You cannot use this feat if you are fatigued."
