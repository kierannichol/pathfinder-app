name: "Improved Impaling Critical"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Impaling Critical, Critical Focus, Weapon Specialization with selected\
  \ piercing melee weapon, base attack bonus +13."
benefit: "While you are using Impaling Critical to impale an opponent, and you are\
  \ still holding onto that weapon, that opponent must succeed at a grapple combat\
  \ maneuver check against you to pull your weapon out. If you have let go of your\
  \ weapon, the impaled opponent must spend a standard action to remove the weapon.\
  \ Until the opponent pulls the weapon out, his speed in all modes is halved and\
  \ his maneuverability, if any, is reduced by one step. When the weapon comes out,\
  \ instead of dealing the damage normal for Impaling Critical, you can deal bleed\
  \ damage equal to your weapon's damage dice result once per round at the start of\
  \ that opponent's turn."
