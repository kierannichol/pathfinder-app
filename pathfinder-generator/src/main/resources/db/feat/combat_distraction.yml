name: "Combat Distraction"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "Anyone who attacks you while you act like a lunatic exposes themselves\
  \ to brutal counterattacks from your allies."
prerequisites: "Goblin, Acrobatics 1 rank, Escape Artist 1 rank."
benefit: "As a full-round action, you can choose to do something that seems to serve\
  \ no useful purpose. Example actions could include laughing at another creature's\
  \ misfortune, rooting in your pockets for a snack, bending over to pick up what\
  \ looks like a weird bug, or trying to fly into the air by flapping your arms like\
  \ a sea gull. Although you're acting like a lunatic, your unpredictable actions\
  \ are distracting. Any creature other than a goblin within 5 feet of you takes a\
  \ –2 penalty on Perception checks and concentration checks for as long as you continue\
  \ to be a distraction and remain in range. This penalty stacks with other goblins\
  \ performing combat distractions, as long as you're both adjacent to the distracted\
  \ target."
