name: "Disconcerting Stare"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "Your painful stare unnerves your target, making it oblivious to its\
  \ surroundings."
prerequisites: "Mesmerist level 5th, painful stare class feature."
benefit: "When you trigger your painful stare, the target must succeed at a Will save\
  \ (DC = 10 + 1/2 your mesmerist level + your Charisma modifier) or take a –6 penalty\
  \ on Disable Device and Perception checks and a –2 penalty on Reflex saves for the\
  \ next minute. If the target has the trap finding or trap sense class ability and\
  \ fails this save, the target also loses the benefit of that ability (or abilities)\
  \ for 1 minute."
