type: "COMBAT"
description: "You can fight with a weapon wielded in each of your hands. You can make\
  \ one extra attack each round with the secondary weapon."
prerequisites: "Dex 15."
benefit: "Your penalties on attack rolls for fighting with two weapons are reduced.\
  \ The penalty for your primary hand lessens by 2 and the one for your off hand lessens\
  \ by 6. See Two-Weapon Fighting."
normal: "If you wield a second weapon in your off hand, you can get one extra attack\
  \ per round with that weapon. When fighting in this way you suffer a –6 penalty\
  \ with your regular attack or attacks with your primary hand and a –10 penalty to\
  \ the attack with your off hand. If your off-hand weapon is light, the penalties\
  \ are reduced by 2 each. An unarmed strike is always considered light."
