name: "Battering Repair"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "Sometimes smacking your firearm against a solid surface is all that's\
  \ needed to unjam it. Sometimes that solid surface is a creature."
prerequisites: "Craft (alchemy) 3 ranks; grit class feature or Amateur Gunslinger;\
  \ pistol-whip gunslinger deed; quick clear gunslinger deed."
benefit: "You can ignore the broken condition of a firearm you're wielding to perform\
  \ the pistol-whip deed. If you hit a creature with this deed, you can spend 1 grit\
  \ point as an immediate action to remove the broken condition from the firearm,\
  \ but only if the firearm gained that condition from a misfire."
