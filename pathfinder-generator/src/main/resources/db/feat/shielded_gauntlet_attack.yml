name: "Shielded Gauntlet Attack"
type: "STYLE"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Shield Gauntlet Style, Weapon Focus (gauntlet or spiked gauntlet),\
  \ proficiency with bucklers and light shields."
benefit: "While using Shield Gauntlet Style, you can calculate the damage of your\
  \ gauntlet or spiked gauntlet using the sacred weapon damage value of a warpriest\
  \ with a level 4 less than your base attack bonus. The style also allows you to\
  \ take one attack of opportunity each round that does not count toward your maximum\
  \ number of attacks of opportunity. This must be used to make an attack with your\
  \ gauntlet (or spiked gauntlet), or a disarm or steal combat maneuver. You do not\
  \ provoke an attack of opportunity for performing either combat maneuver, and you\
  \ are able to attempt a steal combat maneuver with this attack of opportunity despite\
  \ the maneuver normally requiring a standard action."
