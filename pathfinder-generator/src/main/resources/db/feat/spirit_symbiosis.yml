type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Ability to cast speak with dead, phantom class feature."
benefit: "When you cast speak with dead, you can choose not to gain any of the normal\
  \ effects of the spell, instead temporarily merging the summoned spirit into your\
  \ phantom, exchanging your phantom's current emotional focus and all related abilities\
  \ for a new emotional focus of your choice. This new emotional focus persists for\
  \ 10 minutes per class level you have, after which your phantom's original emotional\
  \ focus returns."
