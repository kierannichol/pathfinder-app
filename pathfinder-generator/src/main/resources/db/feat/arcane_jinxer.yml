prerequisites: "Arcane spellcaster, Halfling Jinx alternate racial trait."
benefit: "When you attempt to jinx a creature, you can expend one of your prepared\
  \ arcane spells or available arcane spell slots to give your target a penalty on\
  \ its jinx save equal to the level of the expended spell or spell slot. This does\
  \ not alter the effect of the jinx, only the saving throw to resist the jinx."
