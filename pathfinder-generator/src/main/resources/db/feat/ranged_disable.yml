name: "Ranged Disable"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Far Shot, Point-Blank Shot, Weapon Focus, Disable Device 9 ranks."
benefit: "As a full-round action, you can attempt a Disable Device check with a ranged\
  \ weapon you have chosen with Weapon Focus. You can use this ability against only\
  \ a simple device (one that would normally take a full-round action to disable),\
  \ and you can't use it if the device has any cover or concealment. This use of the\
  \ ranged weapon deals no damage to the device, but it allows you to attempt a Disable\
  \ Device check instead. You treat the ranged attack as if you were using tools inappropriate\
  \ for the job, taking a â€“4 penalty on your Disable Device check. You also apply\
  \ any range penalty for the weapon to the Disable Device check, but you do not gain\
  \ any bonuses that would normally apply on attack rolls on the Disable Device check."
