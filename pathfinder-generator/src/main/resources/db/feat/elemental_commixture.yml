  \ to one of the elements (acid [earth], cold [water], electricity [air], or fire\

  \ other, and cast during the same initiative turn through the use of readied actions."

  \ as by using the Quicken Spell metamagic feat to cast one spell as a swift action\
  \ or by using effects such as the time stop spell."
