name: "Betraying Blow"
type: "TEAMWORK"
description: "When you break an alliance, you make sure it's broken for good."
prerequisites: "Solo Maneuvers, base attack bonus +8."
benefit: "Whenever you use a melee attack to deal nonlethal damage to a creature that\
  \ only you threaten, roll a Bluff check opposed by your opponent's Sense Motive\
  \ check. You deal an additional amount of nonlethal damage equal to 1/2 the difference\
  \ between your Bluff check and your opponent's Sense Motive check (minimum 0). If\
  \ your opponent has an attitude of friendly or helpful toward you (including temporarily\
  \ due to Intimidate checks, charm person, and similar effects), you instead deal\
  \ an amount of extra nonlethal damage equal to the difference between your checks.\
  \ Regardless, the amount of extra nonlethal damage you deal with this feat cannot\
  \ exceed your Hit Dice."
