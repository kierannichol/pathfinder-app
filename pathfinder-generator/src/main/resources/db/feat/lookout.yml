benefit: "Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you may act\
  \ in the surprise round as long as your ally would normally be able to act in the\
  \ surprise round. If you would normally be denied the ability to act in the surprise\
  \ round, your initiative is equal to your initiative roll or the roll of your ally\
  \ –1, whichever is lower. If both you and your ally would be able to act in the\
  \ surprise round without the aid of this feat, you may take both a standard and\
  \ a move action (or a full-round action) during the surprise round."
