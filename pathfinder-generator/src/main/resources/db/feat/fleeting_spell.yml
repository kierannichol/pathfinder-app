benefit: "A fleeting spell's duration becomes dismissible, if it is not already. You\
  \ can dismiss your own fleeting spell as a swift action. When you dismiss a fleeting\
  \ spell, its lingering aura cannot be detected by magic unless the caster succeeds\
  \ at a caster level check against a DC equal to 11 + your caster level. The DC of\
  \ dispel checks to counter a fleeting spell is reduced by 2, and once active, dispel\
  \ magic removes a fleeting spell without a caster level check. A fleeting spell\
  \ has half its normal duration (with an extended fleeting spell, these duration\
  \ adjustments cancel out). Only spells with a duration of at least 2 rounds can\
  \ be made fleeting, and instantaneous or permanent spells cannot be fleeting spells."
normal: "It is a standard action to dismiss a dismissible spell, and only spells whose\
  \ Duration entry is marked with a D are dismissible."
