id: "feat:false_trail"
name: "False Trail"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You create a false trail to throw off pursuers, enabling you to increase\
  \ your lead on those following you or make them lose your trail entirely."
prerequisites: "Survival 3 ranks."
benefit: "You can create a false trail in the wilderness via a combination of misleading\
  \ footprints, discarded items, torn scraps of clothing, and other signs. When you\
  \ create a false trail, you determine the direction it leads. A creature tracking\
  \ you must succeed at a Perception or Survival check (DC = 10 + half your character\
  \ level + your Wisdom modifier) to determine the trail is fake when first encountering\
  \ it. On a success, the creature can continue to track you as normal. The effect\
  \ of a failure to identify the trail as false depends on the time and effort spent\
  \ making it."
