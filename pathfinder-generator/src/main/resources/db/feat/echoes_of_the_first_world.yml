name: "Echoes of the First World"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "Your fey heritage is strong, and it grows stronger when you're near\
  \ another of your kind."
prerequisites: "Knowledge (nature) 2 ranks, gnome subtype."
benefit: "While you're adjacent to an ally who has the gnome subtype and who also\
  \ has this feat, you gain DR 2/cold iron, and you count as fey instead of humanoid\
  \ for the purposes of effects that target creatures by type. You still count as\
  \ having the gnome subtype, however."
