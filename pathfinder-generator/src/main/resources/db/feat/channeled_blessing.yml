type: "GENERAL"
description: "Your channeled energy can deliver a warpriest's blessing."
prerequisites: "Blessings class feature, channel energy class feature."
benefit: "When you channel energy to heal, you can instead deliver a warpriest's blessing\
  \ to a single willing creature (including yourself ) in the area that otherwise\
  \ would have been healed by your channeled energy. The blessing must be one that\
  \ requires a standard action and affects one or more creatures. If the blessing\
  \ would normally affect multiple targets, you affect only a single target. The target\
  \ receives the blessing in place of the healing and any other effects of the channeled\
  \ energy. (This application doesn't count toward your uses of blessings per day.)"
