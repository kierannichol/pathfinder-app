id: "feat:stock_striker_takedown"
name: "Stock-Striker Takedown"
type: "STYLE"
description: "Your melee strike leaves your target vulnerable to a merciless finishing\
  \ shot."
prerequisites: "Point-Blank Shot, Stock-Striker Style, Stock-Striker Sweep, base attack\
  \ bonus +9, pistol-whip gunslinger deed."
benefit: "After you knock a target prone with the pistol-whip deed while using Stock-Striker\
  \ Style, you can fire one barrel of a loaded firearm you're wielding at the target\
  \ as a move action; if your firearm has the scatter weapon quality, you can instead\
  \ make a scattering shot so long as you include the target in the area of effect.\
  \ For this attack, you take no attack penalty for making a ranged attack against\
  \ a prone target, and the critical multiplier of your weapon increases by 1 (to\
  \ a maximum of Ã—5)."
