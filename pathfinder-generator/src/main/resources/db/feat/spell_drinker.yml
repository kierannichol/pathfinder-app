name: "Spell-Drinker"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "The magic that cannot harm you only makes you stronger."
prerequisites: "Con 13; Great Fortitude, Iron Will, or Lightning Reflexes."
benefit: "Once per hour, as an immediate action after you succeed at a saving throw\
  \ against a creature's spell or spell-like ability, you gain a number of temporary\
  \ hit points equal to 1d6 plus the spell's level for 1 minute. While these temporary\
  \ hit points last, you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like\
  \ abilities cast by that creature. If you have 10 or more Hit Dice, the number of\
  \ temporary hit points you gain from this feat doubles. These temporary hit points\
  \ stack with those gained from other sources, but not with each other."
