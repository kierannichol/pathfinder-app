name: "Hidden Presence"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You are adept at hiding within your host."
prerequisites: "Int or Cha 17, ability to cast possession or greater possession."
benefit: "While possessing another creature, you can hide yourself from divinations\
  \ and pass through wards such as magic circle against evil or the effects of a forbiddance\
  \ spell. You must attempt a Will save against the spell (even if it doesn't normally\
  \ allow a saving throw). If you succeed, the spell treats you as if you were your\
  \ host (for instance, divinations would reveal only the host's alignment, and forbiddance\
  \ keyed to the host's alignment wouldn't damage you). If your saving throw fails,\
  \ the spell functions against you as normal; if the spell normally allows a save,\
  \ your previous failure doesn't count as a failed save against the spell's normal\
  \ effects."
