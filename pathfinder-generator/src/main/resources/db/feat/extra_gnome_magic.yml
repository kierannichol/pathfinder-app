name: "Extra Gnome Magic"
type: "RACIAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Cha 13, gnome."
benefit: "You gain an additional three uses per day of your gnome spell-like abilities\
  \ (dancing lights, ghost sound, prestidigitation). You can use these in any combination;\
  \ for example, you can use dancing lights four times in one day (taking all three\
  \ additional uses for the same spell), or you can cast ghost sound twice, prestidigitation\
  \ twice, speak with animals twice, and dancing lights once. If you have a feat,\
  \ trait, or other ability that changes your racial 0-level spell-like abilities\
  \ to other 0-level spells, this feat applies to them instead."
