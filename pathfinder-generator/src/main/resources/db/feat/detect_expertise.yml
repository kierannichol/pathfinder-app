name: "Detect Expertise"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Int 13; ability to cast detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect\
  \ law, or detect magic."
benefit: "When you use any of the spells listed in this feat's prerequisites to detect\
  \ a creature's alignment or its magic, you have a chance of detecting what spellcasting\
  \ expertise it has. After you observe a creature with the detect spell for 3 rounds,\
  \ it must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Intelligence modifier).\
  \ If it fails the saving throw, you learn what bloodlines, domains, hexes, schools,\
  \ or mysteries (if any) the creature possesses. If the creature makes its save,\
  \ it is immune to the effects of this feat for 24 hours."
