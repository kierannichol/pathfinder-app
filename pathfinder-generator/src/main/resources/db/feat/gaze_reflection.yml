id: "feat:gaze_reflection"
name: "Gaze Reflection"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Spellcraft 10 ranks, bold stare and mesmerist tricks class features."
benefit: "When you avert your eyes from a creature with a gaze attack (including one\
  \ produced by a spell like eyebite or burning gaze or by a magic item), you can\
  \ roll twice and select the better result when checking to see whether you are exposed\
  \ to that gaze attack and when rolling your miss chance on attacks made against\
  \ that creature (the latter doesn't stack with Blind-Fight). In addition, as a swift\
  \ action, you can expend one mesmerist trick to make yourself immune to that creature's\
  \ gaze until the beginning of your next turn. If you expend two mesmerist tricks\
  \ instead, you gain immunity to that creature's gaze and also reflect its gaze back\
  \ at it, affecting it with its own gaze."
normal: ""
special: "A mesmerist's hypnotic stare, a witch's or hag's evil eye, and a vampire's\
  \ dominate ability are treated as gaze attacks for the purpose of this feat, as\
  \ are abilities that are triggered when looking at a creature, such as a nymph's\
  \ blinding beauty or a sea hag's horrific appearance."
