name: "Implant Bomb"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Heal 5 ranks, delayed bomb alchemist discovery."
benefit: "You may implant a bomb in a willing or helpless creature (a mindless creature\
  \ under your control, such as a zombie, counts as willing for this purpose). This\
  \ takes 1 hour and expends 1 use of your bomb ability for the day. When the implanted\
  \ creature dies or is destroyed, the bomb detonates in the creature's square as\
  \ if it were a delayed bomb set by you (though you can set the bomb's damage to\
  \ less than your normal bomb damage). You can use any bomb-affecting discoveries\
  \ on this implanted bomb (acid bomb, frost bomb, smoke bomb, and so on) as normal.\
  \ The bomb automatically detonates 24 hours after you implant it in the creature."
