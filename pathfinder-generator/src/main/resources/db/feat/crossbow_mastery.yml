type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Dex 15, Point-Blank Shot, Rapid Reload, Rapid Shot."
benefit: "The time required for you to reload any type of crossbow is reduced to a\
  \ free action, regardless of the type of crossbow used. You can fire a crossbow\
  \ as many times in a full attack action as you could attack if you were using a\
  \ bow. Reloading a crossbow for the type of crossbow you chose when you took Rapid\
  \ Reload no longer provokes attacks of opportunity."
normal: ""
special: "Starting at 6th level, a ranger with the archery combat style may select\
  \ Crossbow Mastery as a combat style feat."
