name: "Burning Amplification"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You can expend some of the energy of your fire spells to make the flames\
  \ linger long enough to cause your opponents to catch ablaze."
prerequisites: ""
benefit: "Whenever you cast a spell with the fire descriptor, you can take a â€“1 penalty\
  \ on the spells' attack rolls and reduce the spell's saving throw DC by 1 to cause\
  \ any target that is dealt fire damage to catch on fire. The targets do not take\
  \ burning damage for catching on fire until their next turn, and each target can\
  \ attempt a Reflex saving throw to put out the fire before being damaged each round.\
  \ Rather than the normal DC 15 Reflex saving throw to put the fire out, the target\
  \ must succeed at a Reflex saving throw with a DC equal 10 + the spell's level +\
  \ the modifier of your spellcasting ability score). You must choose to use this\
  \ feat before making an attack roll or before your targets attempt their saving\
  \ throws. This feat has no effect on spells that neither allow a saving throw nor\
  \ require an attack roll."
