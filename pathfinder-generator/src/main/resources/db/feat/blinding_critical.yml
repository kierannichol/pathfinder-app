name: "Blinding Critical"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Critical Focus, base attack bonus +15."
benefit: "Whenever you score a critical hit, your opponent is permanently blinded.\
  \ A successful Fortitude save reduces this to dazzled for 1d4 rounds. The DC of\
  \ this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. This feat has no\
  \ effect on creatures that do not rely on eyes for sight or creatures with more\
  \ than two eyes (although multiple critical hits might cause blindness, at the GM's\
  \ discretion). Blindness can be cured by heal, regenerate, remove blindness, or\
  \ similar abilities."
normal: ""
special: "You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical\
  \ hit unless you possess Critical Mastery."
