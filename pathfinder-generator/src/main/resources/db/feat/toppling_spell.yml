benefit: "The impact of your force spell is strong enough to knock the target prone.\
  \ If the target takes damage, fails its saving throw, or is moved by your force\
  \ spell, make a trip check against the target, using your caster level plus your\
  \ casting ability score bonus (Wisdom for clerics, Intelligence for wizards, and\
  \ so on). This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the check fails, the\
  \ target cannot attempt to trip you or the force effect in response."
