description: "The spirit of the dragon wells up inside you and bursts forth in a mighty\
  \ roar."
prerequisites: "Str 15, Improved Unarmed Strike, Dragon Style, Stunning Fist, Acrobatics\
  \ 8 ranks."
benefit: "You gain one additional Stunning Fist attempt per day. While using Dragon\
  \ Style, as a standard action you can expend two Stunning Fist attempts to unleash\
  \ a concussive roar in a 15-foot cone. Creatures caught in the cone take your unarmed\
  \ strike damage and become shaken for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save (DC 10\
  \ + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and\
  \ prevents a target from being shaken."
normal: ""
special: "If you have the Elemental Fist feat, you can expend a daily use of that\
  \ feat to deal your Elemental Fist damage to those caught in the cone. This damage\
  \ is not halved even on a save."
