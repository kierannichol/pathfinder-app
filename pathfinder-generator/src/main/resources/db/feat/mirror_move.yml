id: "feat:mirror_move"
name: "Mirror Move"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Int 13, Combat Expertise, base attack bonus +4."
benefit: "If you are the only character threatening an opponent and that opponent\
  \ uses a combat feat (including taking an action that benefits from a combat feat,\
  \ or gaining any bonus to AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, or saving throws from\
  \ a combat feat), you can take an immediate action to gain the benefit of that feat\
  \ until the end of your next turn. You must meet all the feat's prerequisites. If\
  \ a feat has a daily use limitation, as does Stunning Fist, any uses of that feat\
  \ while you're using Mirror Move count toward that feat's daily limit for you."
