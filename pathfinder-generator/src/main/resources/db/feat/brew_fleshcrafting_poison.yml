type: "ITEM_CREATION"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Caster level 10th, 8 or more ranks in Craft (alchemy)."
benefit: "You can create a fleshcrafting poison capable of mimicking one monster ability.\
  \ Brewing a poison takes 1 day. When you create a fleshcrafting poison, you set\
  \ the caster level, which can be no higher than your own level. The base price of\
  \ a temporary fleshcrafting poison is its caster level × the CR of the creature\
  \ used in the fleshcrafting × 50 gp. To brew a poison, you must spend 1/25 of this\
  \ base price in XP and use up raw materials costing 1/2 this base price."
