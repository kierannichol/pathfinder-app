name: "Touch of Serenity"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Wis 18, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8."
benefit: "You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack\
  \ roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). On a successful hit, the attack\
  \ deals no damage and bestows no other effect or condition, but the target cannot\
  \ cast spells or attack (including attacks of opportunity and attacks as immediate\
  \ actions) for 1 round unless it succeeds on a Will saving throw with a DC of 10\
  \ + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier. You may attempt a touch of\
  \ serenity once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special),\
  \ and no more than once per round."
