type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Any metamagic feat, Spellcraft 7 ranks, ability to cast 2nd-level\
  \ spells, human."
benefit: "With the help of allies who also have this feat, you can spontaneously apply\
  \ metamagic feats to your spells without using a higher-level slot or increasing\
  \ the casting time. Each ally must ready an action to cast the same spell you intend\
  \ to cast. For each other ally within 30 feet who does so, you reduce the cost of\
  \ the spontaneous metamagic feat by 1 level (to a minimum of 0, and you must have\
  \ at least one ally assist you, even if the metamagic feat is normally a +0 adjustment).\
  \ The allies don't need to have the metamagic feat you choose to apply, and the\
  \ effective level of the spell (after applying the metamagic feat) can't be higher\
  \ than the highest level of spells you can cast."
