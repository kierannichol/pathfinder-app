id: "feat:shielded_staff_style"
name: "Shielded Staff Style"
type: "STYLE"
description: "You can attack and defend effectively with a shield attached to your\
  \ staff or spear."
prerequisites: "Dex 15, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Focus (quarterstaff, any weapon\
  \ from the polearms fighter weapon group, or any weapon from the spears fighter\
  \ weapon group), proficiency with bucklers and light shields."
benefit: "When you enter this style, you attach your buckler or light shield to your\
  \ quarterstaff, polearm, or spear, combining them into a weapon known as a shielded\
  \ staff. While in this style, you can wield the shielded staff normally, but attacks\
  \ you make with it take a â€“1 penalty. As long as you wield the shielded staff with\
  \ two hands, you gain a +2 shield bonus to your AC (regardless of the shield or\
  \ buckler's enhancement bonus). You can't make shield bash attacks with the attached\
  \ buckler or shield, and detaching the buckler or shield from the weapon is a move\
  \ action that provokes attacks of opportunity."
