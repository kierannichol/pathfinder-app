id: "feat:archon_diversion"
name: "Archon Diversion"
type: "STYLE"
description: "You throw yourself in front of blows meant for allies, giving those\
  \ allies a chance to strike back against the enemy once they have attacked you."
prerequisites: "Archon Style; Combat Expertise; Combat Reflexes; base attack bonus\
  \ +4 or monk level 3rd."
benefit: "The penalty to AC for using Archon Style to grant nearby allies a bonus\
  \ to AC against a single opponent decreases to â€“1. Once per round while using Archon\
  \ Style, when you have at least one hand free or when wielding a shield, you can\
  \ divert one melee weapon attack targeting an adjacent ally to yourself. After resolving\
  \ the attack, the ally you protected can make an attack of opportunity against the\
  \ diverted opponent. You expend no action to divert the attack, but you must be\
  \ aware of it and must not be flat-footed. You must choose to divert the attack\
  \ after the opponent has declared the melee attack, but before the attack roll is\
  \ rolled."
