type: "RACIAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Con 13, Diehard, Endurance, half-orc or orc."
benefit: "When you are killed by hit point damage, your soul lingers in your body\
  \ for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution bonus. You are still dead, but\
  \ a creature can make a DC 10 Heal check as a standard action to realize that you\
  \ can still be saved. You can be healed by magic as if you were alive. If you are\
  \ healed enough hit points that you would no longer be dead, you are alive again,\
  \ but you gain one permanent negative level."
