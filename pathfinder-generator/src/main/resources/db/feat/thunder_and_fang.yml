id: "feat:thunder_and_fang"
name: "Thunder and Fang"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "You have mastered the ancient Thunder and Fang fighting style, allowing\
  \ you to fight with increased effectiveness when wielding an earth breaker and klar."
prerequisites: "Str 15, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Focus (earth breaker), Weapon\
  \ Focus (klar)"
benefit: "You can use an earth breaker as though it were a one-handed weapon. When\
  \ using an earth breaker in one hand and a klar in your off hand, you retain the\
  \ shield bonus your klar grants to your Armor Class even when you use it to attack.\
  \ Treat your klar as a light weapon for the purposes of determining your two-weapon\
  \ fighting penalty."
normal: "An earth breaker is a two-handed weapon, preventing the use of a klar in\
  \ one hand without imposing penalties for using the earth breaker one-handed. A\
  \ klar can be used either as a one-handed weapon or a shield; it does not grant\
  \ a bonus to AC during rounds in which it is used as a weapon."
