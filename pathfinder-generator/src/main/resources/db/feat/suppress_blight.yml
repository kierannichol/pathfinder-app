name: "Suppress Blight"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You can temporarily suppress afflictions brought on by blight, at a\
  \ long-term cost."
prerequisites: "Great Fortitude, Iron Will."
benefit: "Once per day as a standard action, when you are suffering from a curse or\
  \ disease effect, you can suppress the effects (as delay poison) for 1 hour per\
  \ 3 character levels (minimum 1 hour). While the affliction is suppressed, you gain\
  \ a number of temporary hit points equal to the suppressed affliction's save DC,\
  \ which last as long as the affliction's effects are suppressed. At the end of this\
  \ duration, the effects return and all subsequent saving throw DCs against the affliction\
  \ (including the DC to permanently end the effect) are increased by 2, to a maximum\
  \ increase of half your Hit Dice; you can't suppress an affliction whose save DC\
  \ has already been increased to its maximum."
