type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Improved Shield Bash, Shield Proficiency, Two-Weapon Fighting, base\
  \ attack bonus +6."
benefit: "Any opponents hit by your shield bash are also hit with a free bull rush\
  \ attack, substituting your attack roll for the combat maneuver check (see Combat).\
  \ This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Opponents who cannot\
  \ move back due to a wall or other surface are knocked prone after moving the maximum\
  \ possible distance. You may choose to move with your target if you are able to\
  \ take a 5-foot step or to spend an action to move this turn."
