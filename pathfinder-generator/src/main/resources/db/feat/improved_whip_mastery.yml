name: "Improved Whip Mastery"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Weapon Focus (whip), Whip Mastery, base attack bonus +5."
benefit: "While wielding a whip, you threaten the area of your natural reach plus\
  \ 5 feet. You can also use a whip to grasp an unattended Small or Tiny object within\
  \ your whip's reach and pull that object into your square. To do so, you must hit\
  \ AC 10 with a melee touch attack. Further, you can use the whip to grasp onto an\
  \ object within your whip's reach, using 5 feet of your whip as if it were a grappling\
  \ hook, allowing you to use the rest of your whip to swing on like a rope. As a\
  \ free action, you can release the object your whip is grasping, but you cannot\
  \ use the whip to attack while the whip is grasping an object."
