name: "Trick Spell"
type: "METAMAGIC"
description: "The vengeful nature of your goddess flows through your magic, turning\
  \ your enemies against themselves."
prerequisites: "Ability to cast 1st-level spells, chaotic neutral alignment, worshiper\
  \ of a deity of trickery, lust, and revenge."
benefit: "Only enchantment spells that affect a single target and can be negated with\
  \ a successful Will save can be trick spells. If the target fails its Will save\
  \ against a trick spell, in addition to the spell's normal effects, the target also\
  \ clumsily hinders itself. Immediately attempt a special combat maneuver check (1d20\
  \ + your caster level + your Charisma bonus) to perform a dirty trick combat maneuver\
  \ against the target. Any feats you have that apply to dirty trick maneuvers (such\
  \ as Greater Dirty Trick) also apply to this check."
