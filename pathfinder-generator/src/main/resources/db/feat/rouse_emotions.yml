name: "Rouse Emotions"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Cha 13, Charming Performance, Perform (any) 5 ranks, bardic performance\
  \ or raging song."
benefit: "You can use Charming Performance on all creatures within 60 feet. In addition\
  \ to swaying the crowd's starting attitude toward a single person, you may choose\
  \ to sway the crowd's attitude toward a well-defined group with which they are familiar\
  \ (such as a specific nation, organization, or religion). An attempt to rouse emotions\
  \ about a group takes a â€“5 penalty due to the difficulty of creating strong feelings\
  \ toward an entire group rather than a specific individual. The DC for this check\
  \ is 30 + 1 for every five people in the crowd to be affected. You can't use Rouse\
  \ Emotions to change a crowd's attitude by more than one step, or to make it helpful\
  \ or hostile."
