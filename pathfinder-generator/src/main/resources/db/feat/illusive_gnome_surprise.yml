name: "Illusive Gnome Surprise"
type: "STYLE"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Int 13, Combat Expertise, Gnome Weapon Focus, Illusive Gnome Style,\
  \ Improved Feint."
benefit: "While using Illusive Gnome Style, you gain a +2 bonus on combat maneuver\
  \ checks to perform dirty tricks and on Bluff checks to feint. In addition, when\
  \ you successfully use Bluff to feint against a foe, instead of denying that foe\
  \ its Dexterity bonus to AC, you can treat one â€œgnome\" weapon that you are wielding\
  \ as if it had one of the following weapon special features: blocking, brace, disarm,\
  \ distracting, performance, sunder, or trip. This benefit applies only against that\
  \ foe and lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum\
  \ 1)."
