name: "Shared Judgment"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Second judgment class feature."
benefit: "You can pronounce a single judgment and extend its effects to one adjacent\
  \ ally instead of pronouncing a second judgment. Similarly, once you have the third\
  \ judgment class feature, you can pronounce a single judgment and extend its effects\
  \ to two adjacent allies instead of pronouncing a second and third judgment. Alternatively,\
  \ once you have the third judgment class feature, you can pronounce two judgments\
  \ and extend the effects of one judgment to one adjacent ally instead of pronouncing\
  \ a third judgment. Once an ally has gained the effects of your judgment, he need\
  \ not remain adjacent to you to continue gaining that benefit. You can spend a free\
  \ action to end this benefit for one or both allies. If your judgment bonus is suspended\
  \ for you, it is suspended for all allies, but when it resumes, it does so for all\
  \ allies."
