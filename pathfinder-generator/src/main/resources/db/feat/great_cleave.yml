description: "You can strike many adjacent foes with a single blow."
prerequisites: "Str 13, Cleave, Power Attack, base attack bonus +4."
benefit: "As a standard action, you can make a single attack at your full base attack\
  \ bonus against a foe within reach. If you hit, you deal damage normally and can\
  \ make an additional attack (using your full base attack bonus) against a foe that\
  \ is adjacent to the previous foe and also within reach. If you hit, you can continue\
  \ to make attacks against foes adjacent to the previous foe, so long as they are\

  \ attack action. When you use this feat, you take a â€“2 penalty to your Armor Class\
  \ until your next turn."
