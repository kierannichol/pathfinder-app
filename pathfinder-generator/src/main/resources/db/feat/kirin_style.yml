  \ check to identify a single creature (DC 15 + the creature's CR for this purpose).\
  \ If you succeed at the check, while using this style, you gain a +2 bonus on saving\
  \ throws against that creature's attacks, as well as a +2 dodge bonus to AC against\
  \ that creature's attacks of opportunity. These bonuses last for as long as you\
  \ use this style. If you cease combat with the creature during this time and resume\
  \ it later, you can attempt the check again."
