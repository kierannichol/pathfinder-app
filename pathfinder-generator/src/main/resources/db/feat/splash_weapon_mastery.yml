benefit: "Home >Feats >General Feats > Splash Weapon Mastery You are adept at increasing\
  \ the range, area, and accuracy of splash weapons.  When throwing a splash weapon,\
  \ you act as if you had the Far Shot feat. When you hit with a splash weapon, select\
  \ one additional square adjacent to the splash area; creatures in this area also\
  \ take splash damage. When you miss with a splash weapon, you may adjust the miss\
  \ direction on the grid by +1 or â€“1. This feat counts as Far Shot for the purpose\
  \ of qualifying for other feats, but only in regard to splash weapons. Section 15:\
