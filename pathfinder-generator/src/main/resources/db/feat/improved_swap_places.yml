name: "Improved Swap Places"
type: "TEAMWORK"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Swap Places."
benefit: "When you and your ally use Swap Places, your ally can be up to one size\
  \ larger or smaller than you, and your movement into the ally's square does not\
  \ provoke an attack of opportunity. If your ally cannot fit into the space you had\
  \ been occupying and there are no available adjacent squares to accommodate the\
  \ rest of the ally's space, the ally must squeeze. Alternatively, as part of its\
  \ movement, the ally can attempt a bull rush combat maneuver against a creature\
  \ that occupies a space your ally would occupy, but this bull rush cannot move the\
  \ creature more than 5 feet."
normal: "Using Swap Places requires you and your ally to be the same size, and your\
  \ movement into the ally's square provokes attacks of opportunity."
