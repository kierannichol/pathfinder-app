name: "Heroic Recovery"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You can throw off the effects of crippling conditions."
prerequisites: "Diehard, Endurance, base Fortitude save +4."
benefit: "Once per day as a standard action you may attempt a new saving throw against\
  \ a harmful condition or affliction requiring a Fortitude save that is affecting\
  \ you. If this save against the affliction fails, there is no additional effect,\
  \ but a successful save counts toward curing an affliction such as poison or disease.\
  \ You cannot use this feat to recover from instantaneous effects, effects that do\
  \ not allow a saving throw, or effects that do not require a Fortitude save."
