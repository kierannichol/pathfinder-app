name: "Primal Kineticist"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "When primal magic surrounds you, you can channel it to transform the\
  \ nature of your kinetic blasts."
prerequisites: "Kineticist level 1st."
benefit: "When using a simple kinetic blast in an area where primal magic is either\
  \ predominant or very common, you can accept 1 point of burn to cause your blast\
  \ to become one of the following simple blasts instead. Roll 1d10 to determine the\
  \ simple blast: 1 = air, 2 = cold, 3 = earth, 4 = electric, 5 = fire, 6 = gravity*,\
  \ 7 = negative*, 8 = telekinetic, 9 = water, 10 = wood*. You can apply any of your\
  \ form or substance infusions that are allowed as choices for the random blast,\
  \ accepting the typical burn cost."
