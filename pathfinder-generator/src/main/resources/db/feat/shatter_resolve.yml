type: "GENERAL"
description: "Damaging a foe with negative energy causes despair."
prerequisites: "Channel negative energy class feature, worshiper of an evil god."
benefit: "When you damage a creature by channeling negative energy, you fill it with\
  \ fear. A creature that is affected by your channel negative energy ability and\
  \ fails its Will save to halve the damage also becomes shaken for a number of rounds\
  \ equal to the number of dice used to calculate the damage caused by the channel\
  \ energy ability (so if you deal 1d6 points of damage, the condition lasts 1 round;\
  \ if 2d6 points of damage, then 2 rounds, and so on)."
