name: "Tangle Feet"
type: "RACIAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Dodge, Mobility, Underfoot, Goblin, Small size or smaller."
benefit: "When you successfully make an Acrobatics check to avoid provoking an attack\
  \ of opportunity from a larger opponent when you move through its threatened area\
  \ or its space, you can make that opponent lose its balance until the end of its\
  \ next turn as a free action. While that creature's balance is lost, if it attempts\
  \ to move, it must make a successful DC 15 Acrobatics check or fall prone, wasting\
  \ the move action. You can only affect one creature with this effect each round."
