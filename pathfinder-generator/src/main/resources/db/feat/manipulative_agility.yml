type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Bluff 1 rank, Sleight of Hand 1 rank."
benefit: "You can use Sleight of Hand in place of Bluff for checks to feint in combat,\
  \ as well as for checks to pass secret messages without being noticed (by using\
  \ gestures and body language). In both cases, the effects become visual and don't\
  \ work if the target or recipient is blind or cannot see you. In the case of secret\
  \ messages, the limitations of hand gestures and body language might impact what\
  \ sorts of messages you can pass, at the GM's discretion."
