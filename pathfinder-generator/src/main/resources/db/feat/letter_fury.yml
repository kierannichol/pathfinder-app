name: "Letter Fury"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You go wild when someone tries to steal the words from your head."
prerequisites: "Goblin, rage class feature."
benefit: "If someone reads or writes in your presence (including casting spells like\
  \ glyph of warding or symbol) you can, as an immediate action, choose to activate\
  \ your rage class ability for 1 round. This round of rage does not count toward\
  \ the total number of rounds which you can rage each day, but if you wish to continue\
  \ your rage beyond that single round you must expend rounds from your daily rage\
  \ allotment as normal. Once you use this feat you must wait at least 1 minute after\
  \ you cease raging before you can use it again."
