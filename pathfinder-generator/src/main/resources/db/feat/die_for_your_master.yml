description: ""
prerequisites: "Tumor familiar alchemist discovery."
benefit: "If your tumor familiar is attached, and you would be reduced to 0 or fewer\
  \ hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special\
  \ ability), the familiar throws itself in the way of the attack as an immediate\
  \ action. If it makes a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt), it takes all the\
  \ damage from the attack; if it fails, it takes half damage and you take half damage."
