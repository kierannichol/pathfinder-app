id: "feat:focusing_blow"
name: "Focusing Blow"
type: "TEAMWORK"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Hobgoblin Discipline, hobgoblin."
benefit: "An ally who also has this feat can deal damage to you in order to break\
  \ an ongoing mind-affecting effect that allows a saving throw. The ally must cause\
  \ at least 5 points of damage to you with an attack, spell, or other ability. You\
  \ then reroll your saving throw, with a +1 bonus for every 5 additional points of\
  \ damage the attack caused. If your save is successful, the mind-affecting effect\
  \ ends. Only damage actually dealt counts for purposes of this feat; nonlethal damage\
  \ and damage reduced or eliminated by damage reduction, resistances, and so on does\
  \ not qualify."
