name: "Truth in Wine"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Appraise 3 ranks."
benefit: "You can perform the psychometry occult skill unlock even if you can't use\
  \ psychic magic, though you must consume a drink of high-quality alcohol (costing\
  \ at least 10 gp per drink) to do so. If you can cast psychic spells or have the\
  \ Psychic Sensitivity feat, you can use psychometry one additional time per day.\
  \ If you consume a drink of high-quality alcohol, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus\
  \ on Appraise and Sense Motive checks for 1 minute and can increase the caster level\
  \ of the next divination spell you cast within 1 minute by 1. If you are addicted\
  \ to alcohol, these bonuses increase by 1, but so too does the save DC for your\
  \ addiction."
