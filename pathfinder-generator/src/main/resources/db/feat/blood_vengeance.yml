id: "feat:blood_vengeance"
name: "Blood Vengeance"
type: "RACIAL"
description: "Seeing an ally fall in combat fills you with a raging and murderous\
  \ fury."
prerequisites: "Half-orc or orcs, nonlawful."
benefit: "Whenever one of your allies is reduced to negative hit points or killed,\
  \ you may enter a state similar to but less powerful than a barbarian's rage as\
  \ a free action on your next turn. If you have the rage class feature and are already\
  \ raging, your morale bonuses to Strength and Constitution increase by +2 for the\
  \ duration of your rage. If you do not have the rage class feature, or you have\
  \ no more rage rounds left, this weaker rage gives you all the benefits and penalties\
  \ of a barbarian's rage, except your morale bonus to Strength and Constitution is\
  \ only +2. In either case, this state lasts for 4 rounds."
