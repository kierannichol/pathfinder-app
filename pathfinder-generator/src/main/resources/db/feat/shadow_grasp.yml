id: "feat:shadow_grasp"
name: "Shadow Grasp"
type: "METAMAGIC"
description: "Your darkness spells have substance and bind your foes."
prerequisites: "Tenebrous Spell, Umbral Spell."
benefit: "When you cast a spell with the darkness descriptor that affects an area,\
  \ creatures in the area are entangled. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful\
  \ save negates the entangle effect. If the spell does not normally allow a save,\
  \ a creature can make a Reflex save (DC = the spell's DC if it had a saving throw)\
  \ to negate the effect. If the spell allows spell resistance, failing to overcome\
  \ a creature's spell resistance means it is not entangled. An entangled creature\
  \ remains so as long as it is in the area of the spell and for 1 round after it\
  \ leaves. A creature that leaves and reenters the area must make a new saving throw\
  \ to avoid becoming entangled. Creatures that succeed at a save to resist being\
  \ entangled do not have to make additional saves if they stay within the darkened\
  \ area. You are never impeded by the effects of your spells modified by this feat."
