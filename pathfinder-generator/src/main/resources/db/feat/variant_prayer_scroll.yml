name: "Variant Prayer-Scroll"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You have learned the secret to changing the powers granted by your prayer\
  \ scroll."
prerequisites: "Jiang-shi"
benefit: "You gain the ability to create a different type of prayer scroll. You may\
  \ create a prayer scroll with this ability by using any strip of parchment and a\
  \ writing instrument, but doing so requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted work. Swapping\
  \ your current prayer scroll for a different prepared one is a standard action.\
  \ When wearing a different prayer scroll, you gain its special abilities, but lose\
  \ your normal prayer scroll's immunity to spell completion and spell trigger magic\
  \ items. Your prayer scrolls can be used only by you, and have no effect when used\
  \ by other jiang-shis. When you choose this feat, select one of the following prayer\
  \ scroll types."
