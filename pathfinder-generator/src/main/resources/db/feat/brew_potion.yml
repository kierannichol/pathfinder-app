type: "ITEM_CREATION"
description: "You can create magic potions."
prerequisites: "Caster level 3rd."
benefit: "You can create a potion of any 3rd-level or lower spell that you know and\
  \ that targets one or more creatures or objects. Brewing a potion takes 2 hours\
  \ if its base price is 250 gp or less, otherwise brewing a potion takes 1 day for\
  \ each 1,000 gp in its base price. When you create a potion, you set the caster\
  \ level, which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than\
  \ your own level. To brew a potion, you must use up raw materials costing one half\
  \ this base price."
