id: "feat:whip_slinger"
name: "Whip-Slinger"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Proficient with sling."
benefit: "When wielding a sling, double sling, or halfling sling staff, you threaten\
  \ areas around you as normal and can make attacks of opportunity with the sling\
  \ into these threatened areas. The sling deals 1d4 nonlethal bludgeoning damage\
  \ (1d6 for a Medium wielder), threatens a critical hit on a 20, and deals ×2 damage\
  \ on a critical hit. If the sling isn't loaded with ammunition when you make an\
  \ attack of opportunity, you take a –4 penalty on the attack roll."
normal: "Slings and double slings are ranged weapons, do not threaten areas, and cannot\
  \ make attacks of opportunity. A halfling sling staff can be used as a simple melee\
  \ weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club its size; as a melee\
  \ weapon, it threatens areas normally and its wielder can make attacks of opportunity\
  \ with it."
