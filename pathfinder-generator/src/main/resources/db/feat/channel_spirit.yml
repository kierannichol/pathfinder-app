id: "feat:channel_spirit"
name: "Channel Spirit"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Spirit Ridden or spirit class feature."
benefit: "Select one of the spirit legends available to a medium. You can trade control\
  \ of your body to a spirit of this type for power. You must perform a seance, taking\
  \ 1 hour and requiring your concentration. At the end of the seance, you invite\
  \ a spirit of the chosen type to inhabit your body. You do not require an appropriate\
  \ location to channel the spirit. You gain the benefits of the spirit's spirit bonus\
  \ and seance boon, but no spirit powers. Your spirit bonus is +1, or equal to your\
  \ spirit bonus from any medium class levels you have (whichever is higher). You\
  \ don't select a taboo and the spirit gains no influence over you. You can continue\
  \ to gain the benefits of the spiritual possession for up to 1 hour per character\
  \ level you have. At the end of the duration, the spirit takes over your body, and\
  \ you become an NPC under the GM's control for a duration equal to the amount of\
  \ time the spirit possessed you. You can end the duration prematurely as a free\
  \ action, but the spirit still takes over your body. If you have the spirit class\
  \ feature, you can't use this feat and act as a vessel for a second spirit simultaneously,\
  \ but you gain spirit powers as normal for your medium level."
