description: "Your channeled energy wards off disease."
prerequisites: "Able to cast remove disease or the ability to cure disease with a\
  \ mercy, channel positive energy class feature."
benefit: "When you channel positive energy to harm or turn undead creatures, any undead\
  \ creatures in the area lose the ability to cause disease with their melee and ranged\
  \ attacks for 1d4+1 rounds. If an undead creature successfully saves against your\
  \ channeled energy, this duration is reduced to 1 round for that creature. Immunity\
  \ to positive energy negates this ability."
