name: "Call Truce"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Cha 15, Persuasive, Diplomacy 5 ranks."
benefit: "While in combat, as a 1-round action (as if it were a spell with a 1-round\
  \ casting time, you can call for a truce with any creatures that have an Intelligence\
  \ score of 4 or greater and can understand you. When doing so, you can't be wielding\
  \ a weapon or threatening implement, such as a charged spell, wand, or anything\
  \ else the creatures you are entreating might consider threatening. You must also\
  \ be in plain sight of most the creatures you are entreating."
normal: ""
special: "If the parley would inherently result in the opponents surrendering or losing,\
  \ if the opponents are mind-controlled or fanatics, or if there are other appropriate\
  \ circumstances at the GM's discretion, you might not be able to use this feat.\
  \ For instance, if the opponents' main advantage over your group comes from a short-duration\
  \ spell that would end during a parley (see Calling for a Cease-Fire), you cannot\
  \ use this feat. Circumstances could potentially increase the check's DC by 5, 10,\
  \ or even up to 20."
