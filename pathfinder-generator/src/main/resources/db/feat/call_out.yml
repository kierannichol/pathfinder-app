description: "A well-crafted insult forces an opponent to duel you."
prerequisites: ""
benefit: "Benefit(s) As a standard action, you can make an Intimidate check against\
  \ a hostile target within 30 feet that can clearly see and hear you. The DC of this\
  \ check is equal to 10 + your opponent's Hit Dice + its Wisdom modifier. If the\
  \ target is trained in Sense Motive, the DC is instead equal to 10 + your opponent's\
  \ Sense Motive bonus, if higher. If you succeed at this check, the target enters\
  \ a duel with you. The target cannot withdraw from the duel for 1 round + 1 round\
  \ for every 5 by which the check beat the DC."
