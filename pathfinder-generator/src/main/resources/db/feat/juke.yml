type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Dex 13, Dodge, Mobility, Sidestep."
benefit: "When an opponent charges you, you gain a +4 dodge bonus to your AC. If the\
  \ charger's attack roll misses you and his movement ends while he is adjacent to\
  \ you, you can switch places with the opponent as an immediate action, and he is\
  \ considered to be flanked by you until the end of your next turn. You can't use\
  \ the benefits of Juke if you ready an action to set a weapon with the brace special\
  \ quality against a charging foe."
