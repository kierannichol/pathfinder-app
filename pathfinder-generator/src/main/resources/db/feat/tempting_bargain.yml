id: "feat:tempting_bargain"
name: "Tempting Bargain"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "By going against traditional teachings and summoner practices, you have\
  \ secured the service of an outsider whose morality differs wildly from your own,\
  \ but you must endure its constant temptations or attempts to redeem you."
prerequisites: "Unchained summoner level 1st, eidolon class feature."
benefit: "You can select an eidolon of any alignment, even if its alignment is more\
  \ than one step away from your own. Your eidolon never refuses your call as a result\
  \ of the differences between your respective alignments, though it still can refuse\
  \ to follow commands that are against its ethos or alignment."
normal: ""
special: "If your alignment becomes the same as that of your eidolon, you can immediately\
  \ replace this feat with any other feat you would have qualified for at 1st level.\
  \ The feat you choose for this must be one approved by the GM, depending on the\
  \ nature of your eidolon and its influence over you."
