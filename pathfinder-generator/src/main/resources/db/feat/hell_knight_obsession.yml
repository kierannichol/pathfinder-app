id: "feat:hell_knight_obsession"
name: "Hell Knight Obsession"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You equate pain with discipline and can inflict damage upon yourself\
  \ to unlock greater power."
prerequisites: "Hell Knight Obedience, Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks, must swear allegiance\
  \ to a single Hell Knight order."
benefit: "During your hour-long reckoning, if you choose to deal lethal damage to\
  \ yourself, you reach a state of fantastic focus. Once during the next 24 hours,\
  \ you can draw upon this focus to gain the benefits of any one of the following\
  \ effects. To activate the ability, you must deal 1 point of lethal damage to yourself\
  \ as a swift action (unless otherwise noted). Members of the Order of the Nail often\
  \ install a sharp barb within their armor that deals this damage when the wearer\
  \ is subject to a critical hit; if you're struck by a critical hit while wearing\
  \ such armor, using this ability doesn't require a swift action."
