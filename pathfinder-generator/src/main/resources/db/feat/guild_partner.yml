description: ""
prerequisites: "Associate (a guild)."
benefit: "Whenever you are in a settlement that is the size of small town or larger,\
  \ you can purchase (but not sell) items through your contacts. Treat your current\
  \ settlement as though it were a metropolis to determine its base value and available\
  \ magic items. You pay a 5% markup for such items, and orders take 3d6 days to be\
  \ delivered through guild channels. You can pay an additional 1,000 gp to have your\
  \ item magically delivered in 1d3 days instead."
