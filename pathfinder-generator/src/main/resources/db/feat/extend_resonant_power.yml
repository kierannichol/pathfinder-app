name: "Extend Resonant Power"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You can share the benefits of your resonant focus powers with nearby\
  \ allies."
prerequisites: "Caster level 7th, mental focus class feature."
benefit: "Select an implement school. When you place mental focus points into an implement\
  \ of that school, You can choose to gain benefits from the resonant power as if\
  \ you had placed only half as many points of mental focus into the implement. If\
  \ you do, you can extend the same benefits to one additional ally within 30 feet\
  \ at the time you invest mental focus. If the ally moves outside of the extended\
  \ power's range, the power is suppressed, but it resumes functioning once the ally\
  \ moves within range again. You can spend 1 point of mental focus from your implement\
  \ to pass the effect to a new target, so long as both the original target and the\
  \ new one are within 30 feet. This feat can affect only one implement from a given\
  \ school at a time, even if you have selected the same implement school more than\
  \ once."
normal: ""
special: "You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, select\
  \ a different implement school."
