type: "COMBAT"
description: "In your hands, a spiked chain dances like a living thing."
prerequisites: "Dex 15, Chain Mastery, Exotic Weapon Proficiency (spiked chain), Weapon\
  \ Finesse, Perform (dance) 1 rank."
benefit: "When wielding a spiked chain one-handed, you can add your Dexterity modifier\
  \ instead of your Strength modifier to that weapon's damage. The spiked chain must\
  \ be one appropriate for your size. During your turn, you treat your reach with\
  \ the spiked chain as 5 feet greater. You lose these benefits while fighting with\
  \ multiple weapons or when using a shield (but not when using a buckler)."
