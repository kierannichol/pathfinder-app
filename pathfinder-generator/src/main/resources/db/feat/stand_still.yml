name: "Stand Still"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Combat Reflexes."
benefit: "When a foe provokes an attack of opportunity due to moving through your\
  \ adjacent squares, you can make a combat maneuver check as your attack of opportunity.\
  \ If successful, the enemy cannot move for the rest of his turn. An enemy can still\
  \ take the rest of his action, but cannot move. This feat also applies to any creature\
  \ that attempts to move from a square that is adjacent to you if such movement provokes\
  \ an attack of opportunity."
