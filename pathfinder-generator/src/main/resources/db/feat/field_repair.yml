id: "feat:field_repair"
name: "Field Repair"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You can repair your broken weapon or armor to serviceability even without\
  \ the benefits of artisan tools."
prerequisites: "Craft 4 ranks."
benefit: "If you are trained in a Craft skill appropriate to a broken item, you can\
  \ repair that item with no raw material cost and no penalty on your Craft skill\
  \ check for using improvised tools. If you spend a day, the item regains 1 hit point\
  \ plus one-quarter of its original hit points. Alternatively, if the item gained\
  \ the broken condition because it is a firearm that has misfired or a siege engine\
  \ that suffered a mishap, or has the broken condition because it has the fragile\
  \ weapon quality (or some similar quality), you can make a Craft check with the\
  \ DC it takes to craft that item (see Table 2–2, below). If the check succeeds,\
  \ the item loses the broken condition."
normal: "Improvised tools impose a –2 penalty on Craft checks. Items require raw materials\
  \ to repair."
