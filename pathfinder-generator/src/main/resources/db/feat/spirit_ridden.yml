benefit: "You can perform a seance once per day, taking 1 hour and requiring your\
  \ concentration, calling out to any nearby spirit with the skill you seek. At the\
  \ end of the hour, you invite the spirit to inhabit your body. The spirit grants\
  \ you ranks in a skill of your choice equal to your character level, and you treat\
  \ the skill as a class skill. These effects persist for 1 hour per character level.\
  \ You cannot have more ranks in a skill than your total number of Hit Dice. While\
  \ you're possessed, the spirit influences your personality."
