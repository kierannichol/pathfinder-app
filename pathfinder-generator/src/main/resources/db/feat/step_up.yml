description: ""
prerequisites: "Base attack bonus +1."
benefit: "Whenever an adjacent foe attempts to take a 5-foot step away from you, you\
  \ may also make a 5-foot step as an immediate action so long as you end up adjacent\
  \ to the foe that triggered this ability. If you take this step, you cannot take\
  \ a 5-foot step during your next turn. If you take an action to move during your\
  \ next turn, subtract 5 feet from your total movement."
