prerequisites: "Cha 13, bardic performance class ability, able to cast 1st-level spells."
benefit: "You can combine your bardic performance and your spellcasting in two ways.\
  \ First, you can conceal the activity of casting a bard spell by masking it in a\
  \ performance. As a swift action, you may combine your casting time of a spell with\
  \ a Perform check. Observers must make a Perception or Sense Motive check opposed\
  \ by your Perform check to realize you are also casting a spell. This uses 1 round\
  \ of your bardic performance ability, regardless of the spell's casting time."
