name: "Awesome Blow"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Str 25, Power Attack, Improved Bull Rush, size Large or larger."
benefit: "As a standard action, the creature may perform an awesome blow combat maneuver.\
  \ If the creature's maneuver succeeds against a corporeal opponent smaller than\
  \ itself, its opponent takes damage (typically slam damage plus Strength bonus)\
  \ and is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the attacking creature's choice\
  \ and falls prone. The attacking creature can only push the opponent in a straight\
  \ line, and the opponent can't move closer to the attacking creature than the square\
  \ it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent's move,\
  \ the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent\
  \ is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle."
