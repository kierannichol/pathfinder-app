name: "Darkness Trick"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You can manipulate the luminescence of magic weapons."
prerequisites: "Use Magic Device 5 ranks, ability to cast darkness."
benefit: "When wielding a magic weapon that sheds light or that features a luminescent\
  \ quality, such as a flaming or brilliant energy weapon, you can deactivate that\
  \ illumination as a swift action. You can reignite the illumination at any time\
  \ as a free action. Any intrinsic magic properties that would force the weapon to\
  \ shed light, such as the extra damage of a flaming weapon, do not function while\
  \ the illumination is deactivated, and the â€œsignificant portion\" of a brilliant\
  \ energy weapon that is normally made of light ceases to exist."
