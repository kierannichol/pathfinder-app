type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Dexterity 13, base attack bonus +1."
benefit: "You can choose to take a â€“2 penalty on a ranged attack roll with an axe,\
  \ bouncing it or sliding it along the ground. If the target is flat-footed, running,\
  \ or charging, this attack ignores any bonuses to the target's AC from its shield.\
  \ If the attack hits, you may immediately make a trip attempt against the target\
  \ as a free action. If you fail to trip your opponent, your opponent does not get\
  \ an attempt to trip you in return."
