name: "Caustic Slur"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Bluff 1 rank, favored enemy class feature, gnome."
benefit: "As a standard action, you can make a Bluff check against one sort of favored\
  \ enemy. Any creature of that type within 60 feet of you must make a Will saving\
  \ throw or become angered. If an affected creature attacks you, it's treated as\
  \ if it were using Power Attack (taking a penalty on attack rolls but gaining a\
  \ bonus on damage rolls). If the creature already has the power attack feat, the\
  \ attack penalty increases by 1 and the damage bonus increases by 2. These modifiers\
  \ end when combat ends. This ability does not work on creatures that cannot understand\
  \ you, though sometimes a simple gesture is sufficient for an intelligent opponent\
  \ to catch your gist regardless of any language barrier."
