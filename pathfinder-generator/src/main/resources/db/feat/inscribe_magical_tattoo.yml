name: "Inscribe Magical Tattoo"
type: "ITEM_CREATION"
description: "You can craft magical tattoos."
prerequisites: "Craft (calligraphy, paintings, or tattoos) 5 ranks, caster level 5th."
benefit: "You can create magical tattoos, magic items inked directly into the flesh\
  \ of a willing or helpless creature. Both you and the recipient of the tattoo (if\
  \ the recipient is not yourself) must be present during the entire tattooing process.\
  \ Magic tattoos must be placed on a part of the body normally able to hold a magic\
  \ item slot, but they do not count against or interfere with magic items worn on\
  \ those slots. A single slot can only hold one magical tattoo (non-magical tattoos\
  \ and tattoos acquired from the tattooed sorcerer archetype do not count against\
  \ this limit). Tattoos may be inscribed on the following slots: belt, body, chest,\
  \ feet, hands, head, neck, shoulder, ring (up to two), or wrist. They cannot be\
  \ inscribed on armor, eye, headband, or shield slots."
