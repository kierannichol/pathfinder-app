name: "Fear Eater"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Cha 13, Iron Will, have no immunity to fear effects."
benefit: "As a standard action, you can remove a fear effect from another creature\
  \ by touching it. The fear effect is transferred from that creature to you, with\
  \ the same remaining duration. If the fear effect has varying effects depending\
  \ on the target (such as the effects of cause fear depending on the target's Hit\
  \ Dice), it has the effect it had on the original creature or the effect it would\
  \ have on you, whichever is more severe. When you choose to accept another creature's\
  \ fear, you don't receive any saving throw, spell resistance, or other defenses\
  \ you would normally have against the fear effect."
