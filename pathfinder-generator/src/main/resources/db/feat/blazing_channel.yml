name: "Blazing Channel"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Turn Undead, channel positive energy class feature."
benefit: "When you use your Turn Undead feat, undead failing their saving throw are\
  \ engulfed in holy fire. This functions identically to catching on fire, but the\
  \ damage dealt is divine (like the divine damage from flame strike) rather than\
  \ fire. Water cannot extinguish this holy fire, but any negative energy effect that\
  \ heals the creature of at least 5 points of damage extinguishes the flames instantly."
