name: "Fortune Teller"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "As a result of being raised in a land steeped in tradition and superstition,\
  \ you are skilled at communicating with the spirit world."
prerequisites: "Ability to cast divination spells."
benefit: "Upon taking this feat, choose a focus item for your divination magic--a\
  \ crystal ball, runes, a harrow deck, or some such item. Whenever you cast a spell\
  \ from the divination school, you may use this focus item instead of the spell's\
  \ material component, as long as the cost of the material component is no more than\
  \ 1,000 gp. If you choose to perform the spell using your focus item and the spell's\
  \ normal material component (regardless of that component's cost), you cast the\
  \ spell at +1 caster level."
