name: "Wolf Savage"
type: "STYLE"
description: "You savage your foes so badly that they can become supernaturally disfigured."
prerequisites: "Wis 17, Improved Unarmed Strike, Wolf Style, Wolf Trip, Knowledge\
  \ (nature) 9 ranks."
benefit: "While using Wolf Style, when you deal at least 10 points of damage to a\
  \ prone opponent with a natural weapon or an unarmed strike, as a swift action you\
  \ can savage that creature. When you do, your opponent must succeed at a Fortitude\
  \ save (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Wisdom modifier). If the target\
  \ fails the saving throw, it takes either 1d4 Charisma damage or 1d4 Constitution\
  \ damage, or it becomes fatigued (your choice). Ability score damage dealt with\
  \ this ability cannot equal or exceed the victim's actual ability score total."
