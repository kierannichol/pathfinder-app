id: "feat:deflect_arrows"
name: "Deflect Arrows"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "You can knock arrows and other projectiles off course, preventing them\
  \ from hitting you."
prerequisites: "Dex 13, Improved Unarmed Strike."
benefit: "You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat.\
  \ Once per round when you would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged weapon,\
  \ you may deflect it so that you take no damage from it. You must be aware of the\
  \ attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged attack doesn't count\
  \ as an action. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts)\
  \ and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects can't be deflected."
