name: "Delayed Spell"
type: "METAMAGIC"
description: "You can set a spell to trigger on a delay."
prerequisites: ""
benefit: "A delayed spell can be activated as a standard action anytime within 1 minute\
  \ per spell level of being cast. Only spells that target one or more squares or\
  \ grid intersections can be affected by Delayed Spell, and the target (as well as\
  \ any other variables determined at the time of casting) cannot be changed once\
  \ the delayed spell is cast. You can have as many delayed spells as you wish at\
  \ any given time, but only one spell can be triggered in a single standard action.\
  \ Though a delayed spell does not manifest until it is triggered, it emits a magical\
  \ aura as normal and can be identified with Knowledge (arcana) as a spell effect\
  \ in place."
