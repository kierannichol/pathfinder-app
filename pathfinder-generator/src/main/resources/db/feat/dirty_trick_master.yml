name: "Dirty Trick Master"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Greater Dirty Trick, Improved Dirty Trick, base attack bonus +11."
benefit: "Whenever you successfully perform a dirty trick combat maneuver against\
  \ an opponent who is still affected by a condition inflicted by a previous dirty\
  \ trick (whether your own or another creature's), you can cause the condition to\
  \ worsen. In addition to increasing the duration of the condition as normal, you\
  \ cause an opponent who is dazzled to become dazed, entangled to become pinned,\
  \ shaken to become frightened, and sickened to become nauseated. This worsened condition\
  \ replaces the previous dirty trick condition, and lasts for the duration of the\
  \ dirty trick (including any rounds remaining from the previous dirty trick condition)\
  \ or until the opponent uses a standard action to remove the condition (whichever\
  \ comes first)."
