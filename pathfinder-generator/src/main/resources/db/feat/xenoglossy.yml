id: "feat:xenoglossy"
name: "Xenoglossy"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "People everywhere share a common tongue; they just don't always remember\
  \ it."
prerequisites: "Int 13, Linguistics 3 ranks."
benefit: "With a successful DC 25 Linguistics check, you can speak with a single individual\
  \ with whom you share no common languages. You cannot take 10 on this check, nor\
  \ can anyone aid you. You believe you are speaking your native language, and the\
  \ listener believes you are speaking its native language; however, to everyone else\
  \ able to hear you, you sound like you are speaking gibberish. Creatures that have\
  \ truespeech or that are under the effects of tongues can understand Xenoglossy,\
  \ and other creatures who succeed at a DC 25 Linguistics check can pick up the gist\
  \ of what you are saying."
