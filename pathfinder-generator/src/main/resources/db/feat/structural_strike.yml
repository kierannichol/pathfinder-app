name: "Structural Strike"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Knowledge (engineering) 5 ranks, precise strike class feature or precise\
  \ strike deed."
benefit: "When using the duelist's or swashbuckler's precise strike, you can make\
  \ a single strike as a standard action against an opponent that would be otherwise\
  \ immune to your precise strike damage. If you hit, you deal your precise strike\
  \ damage as normal against this enemy. When using the swashbuckler's precise strike\
  \ deed, you can spend 1 panache point as a swift action to deal your regular precise\
  \ strike damage on a single attack against an opponent that would typically be immune.\
  \ If you have both class features, you can use either option in order to apply the\
  \ full damage from both versions of precise strike."
