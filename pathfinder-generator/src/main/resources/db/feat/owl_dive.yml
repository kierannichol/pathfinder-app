prerequisites: "Dex 17, Owl Style, Owl Swoop, Skill Focus (Stealth), base attack bonus\
  \ +7 or monk level 5th, Acrobatics 1 rank, Fly 1 rank, Stealth 1 rank."
benefit: "While using Owl Style, you can use your base attack bonus in place of your\
  \ ranks in Fly to determine your Fly skill bonus. You can charge through other creatures'\
  \ spaces, but you must make a successful Acrobatics check to move through enemy\
  \ spaces, as normal. If you fail an Acrobatics check to move through an enemy's\
  \ space during a charge, your charge stops just before you enter that enemy's space;\
  \ if you threaten that foe, you can make your charge attack against that foe."
