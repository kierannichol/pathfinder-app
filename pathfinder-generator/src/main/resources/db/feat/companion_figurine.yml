name: "Companion Figurine"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Handle Animal 1 rank, own a figurine of wondrous power."
benefit: "You may select the creature summoned by your figurine of wondrous power\
  \ as an animal companion or familiar, or as appropriate. The figurine has the standard\
  \ abilities of a familiar or animal companion of its type, plus additional abilities\
  \ related to its figurine type (see below). The main advantage of this is that if\
  \ your familiar or companion is killed in creature form, it merely reverts to statue\
  \ form and can be used again later."
