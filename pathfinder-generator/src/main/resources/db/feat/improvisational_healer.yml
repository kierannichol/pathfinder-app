id: "feat:improvisational_healer"
name: "Improvisational Healer"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Heal 1 rank."
benefit: "When attempting a Heal check that normally requires a healer's kit, you\
  \ don't take a penalty on the check for not having a healer's kit. When you use\
  \ a healer's kit, you can augment it with improvised supplies, gaining an additional\
  \ +2 circumstance bonus on your check. Finally, you can treat any potion of cure\
  \ light wounds, potion of cure moderate wounds, or potion of cure serious wounds\
  \ you drink yourself or administer to another character as though its caster level\
  \ were equal to the number of ranks you have in the Heal skill. The spell's normal\
  \ limitations apply; for example, a potion of cure light wounds can cure a maximum\
  \ of 1d8+5 points of damage, even if you have more than 5 ranks in the Heal skill."
