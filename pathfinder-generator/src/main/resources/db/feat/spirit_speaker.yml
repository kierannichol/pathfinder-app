description: ""
prerequisites: "Cha 13, Con 13, Absorb Spiritâ€ , Diplomacy 5 ranks, must have died\
  \ at least once or been possessed by an undead creature."
benefit: "When you absorb a spirit with the Absorb Spirit feat, you can converse with\
  \ it through an internal dialogue in your mind. While conversing with the spirit,\
  \ you can attempt Diplomacy checks to change its attitude toward you, as a normal\
  \ use of that skill. If you are a medium with the haunt channeler class feature,\
  \ you gain a +4 bonus on these Diplomacy checks. Once the spirit's attitude is indifferent\
  \ or better, you can request to know what must be done to lay the spirit to rest,\
  \ though the DC to do so is the DC to change its current attitude + 15. This takes\
  \ into account the circumstance modifiers for the request in a typical situation,\
  \ though it could be higher or lower in an unusual circumstance."
normal: ""
special: "If you are using the optional sanity rules, when you attempt a Diplomacy\
  \ check using this ability, you take 1d6 points of sanity damage instead of 1 point\
  \ of Wisdom damage. No effect can prevent or reduce the damage, nor can the damage\
  \ be healed or suppressed by any means until you release the spirit."
