description: "Just as your undead existence mocks nature, so too does your twisted\
  \ companion reflect the vile nature of vampirism."
prerequisites: "Dhampir or vampire, nongood alignment, 10th level in a class that\
  \ grants a familiar or animal companion."
benefit: "Your animal companion or familiar's type changes to â€œundead.\" The creature\
  \ gains fast healing 5 as well as your vampire or dhampir weaknesses. If you are\
  \ a vampire, the creature also gains the following abilities, depending on what\
  \ type of vampire you are."

special: "If your animal companion or familiar is destroyed, dismissed, or lost, you\
  \ can apply the effects of this feat to the replacement creature. If you are destroyed,\
  \ the creature retains its undead type but loses all other special abilities from\
  \ this feat. If you have more than one animal companion or familiar, choose one\
  \ of them when you select this feat and apply its effects to that creature."
