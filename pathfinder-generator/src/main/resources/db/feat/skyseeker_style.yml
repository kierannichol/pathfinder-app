prerequisites: "Step Up, base attack bonus +1."
benefit: "Once per round, when an opponent attacks you with a reach weapon, you can\
  \ take a 5-foot step towards your opponent as an immediate action. If the movement\
  \ takes you to a square that the opponent's reach weapon does not threaten, you\
  \ receive a +4 bonus to AC against that attack. If you take this step, you cannot\
  \ take a 5-foot step during your next turn. If you take an action to move during\
  \ your next turn, subtract 5 feet from your total available movement."
