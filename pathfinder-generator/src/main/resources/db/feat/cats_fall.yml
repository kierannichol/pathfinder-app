name: "Cat's Fall"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "Much like a cat, you can instantly shift your balance when you fall\
  \ and roll with the impact, avoiding serious injury and landing on your feet."
prerequisites: "Dex 13, Acrobatics 1 rank."
benefit: "When you succeed at a DC 15 Acrobatics skill check to soften a fall, you\
  \ ignore the first 20 feet of that fall and convert the damage from the next 10\
  \ feet of the fall to nonlethal damage. You land on your feet as long as you take\
  \ less than 20 points of damage from the fall."
normal: "A successful DC 15 Acrobatics check allows you to ignore the first 10 feet\
  \ fallen, and you fall prone if you take any falling damage."
