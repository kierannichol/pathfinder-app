type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Int 13, character level 5th."
benefit: "You can prepare for future contingencies without defining what those preparations\
  \ are until they are relevant. As a part of this preparation, while in a settlement\
  \ for at least 24 hours, you can take 8 hours and spend up to 50 gp per character\
  \ level, which becomes your brilliant plan fund. While you have a brilliant plan\
  \ pending, you are always treated as carrying 20 additional pounds of weight, even\
  \ before you define your brilliant plan."
