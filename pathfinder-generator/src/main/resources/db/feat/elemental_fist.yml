name: "Elemental Fist"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "You empower your strike with elemental energy."
prerequisites: "Con 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8."
benefit: "When you use Elemental Strike pick one of the following energy types: acid,\
  \ cold, electricity, or fire. On a successful hit, the attack deals damage normally\
  \ plus 1d6 points of damage of the chosen type. You must declare that you are using\
  \ this feat before you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the\
  \ attempt). You may attempt an Elemental Fist attack once per day for every four\
  \ levels you have attained (see Special), and no more than once per round."
