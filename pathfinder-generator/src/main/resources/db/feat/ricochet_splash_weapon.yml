name: "Ricochet Splash Weapon"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Dex 13, Throw Anything."
benefit: "Whenever your splash weapon misses and the misdirection roll indicates it\
  \ lands in a square occupied by a creature, you may make an attack roll (at a -5\
  \ penalty) as if you had thrown the splash weapon at that creature. If this attack\
  \ roll succeeds, the splash weapon hits and the creature takes full damage instead\
  \ of splash damage. Squares adjacent to this creature still take splash damage as\
  \ normal."
normal: "A thrown splash weapon that misses deals splash damage in the square where\
  \ it lands and in adjacent squares."
