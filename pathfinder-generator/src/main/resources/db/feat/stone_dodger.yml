description: "By working with an ally to gauge the trajectory of incoming attacks,\
  \ you can more easily avoid taking damage."
prerequisites: ""
benefit: "Whenever you are able to see and hear at least one ally with this feat,\
  \ you receive a +4 dodge bonus to AC against attacks from hurled rocks (or projectiles\
  \ of similar shape, including bludgeoning ranged attacks from siege weapons). If\
  \ you are hit by such an attack while you have this bonus, you can attempt a Reflex\
  \ save to take only half damage from the attack. The DC for this save is equal to\
  \ the bonus of the ranged attack used to hurl the rock."
