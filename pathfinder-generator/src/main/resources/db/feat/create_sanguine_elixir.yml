name: "Create Sanguine Elixir"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Cha 15, Brew Potion, Craft (alchemy) 12 ranks, sorcerer level 3rd."
benefit: "Once per day, when you clear your mind to regain spell slots, you can create\
  \ a sanguine elixir. When you do, pick one of your bloodline powers. You transfer\
  \ that power into a small potion that any creature can drink to temporarily gain\
  \ the benefit of your bloodline power. Creating a sanguine elixir takes 1 hour,\
  \ and requires special oils and distillates worth 100 gp, and when you make the\
  \ sanguine elixir, you lose access to the bloodline power until the next time you\
  \ clear your mind to regain spell slots. When a creature drinks a sanguine elixir,\
  \ it can activate the bloodline power anytime before the end of its next turn, as\
  \ if it had access to that bloodline power. A creature that drinks the elixir cannot\
  \ gain the benefit if its character level does not equal or exceed the minimum level\
  \ of the bloodline power. Any level-dependent effects use the character level of\
  \ the creature that drinks the sanguine elixir, or your sorcerer level, whichever\
  \ is lower. Drinking a sanguine elixir is just like drinking a potion. A sanguine\
  \ elixir is treated as a magic item with your caster level."
