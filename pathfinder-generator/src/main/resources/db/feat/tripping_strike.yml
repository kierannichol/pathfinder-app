description: ""
prerequisites: "Int 13, Combat Expertise, Improved Trip, base attack bonus +9."
benefit: "Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can trip your\
  \ opponent, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation\
  \ roll exceeds your opponent's CMD, you may knock your opponent prone as if from\
  \ the trip combat maneuver. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If you\
  \ are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop your weapon to avoid being\
  \ tripped."

special: "You can only apply the effects of one of the following feats to a given\
  \ critical hit: Bull Rush Strike, Disarming Strike, Repositioning Strike, Sundering\
  \ Strike, or Tripping Strike. You may choose to use this feat after you make your\
  \ confirmation roll."
