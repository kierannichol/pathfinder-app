type: "GENERAL"
description: "You have learned a trick that makes your spellcasting more flexible."
prerequisites: "Spell Mastery, wizard level 1st."
benefit: "When you prepare your spells each day, you can choose to keep a number of\
  \ spell slots equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) flexibly prepared.\
  \ Instead of preparing a single spell within each of these slots, you can partially\
  \ prepare two spells. Anytime after you prepare these flexible slots, you can spend\
  \ a full-round action to finalize one slot, choosing one of the two spells to be\
  \ finished and fully prepared in that slot."
