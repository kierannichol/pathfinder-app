id: "feat:purging_emesis"
name: "Purging Emesis"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Great Fortitude."
benefit: "As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can attempt\
  \ to end an ingested poison effect by making yourself vomit. If you succeed at a\
  \ new saving throw against the initial effect, you gain the nauseated condition\
  \ for 1 round but end the poison effect as if you had succeeded at the requisite\
  \ saving throws. Your vomiting causes one adjacent square to become slippery until\
  \ your vomit is cleaned (usually taking 1 full round) or dries up (usually 1 hour).\
  \ Once you use this feat, you must wait at least 1 hour and consume food or drink\
  \ before you can use it again."
