name: "Kinetic Counter"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You can use your kinetic blast to counter your enemy's opposing elemental\
  \ abilities."
prerequisites: "Cold simple blast, fire simple blast, or water simple blast; kinetic\
  \ blast class feature."
benefit: "You can ready an action to use your blast to counter an opponent's elemental\
  \ abilities. If you ready a fire simple blast, you can counter any spell or activated\
  \ extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability that has the water or ice descriptor,\
  \ and if you ready a cold or water simple blast, you can counter any spell or activated\
  \ extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability that has the fire descriptor.\
  \ In order to successfully counter the effect, you must succeed at a caster level\
  \ check with a DC equal to either 11 + the opponent's caster level (for spells and\
  \ spell-like abilities) or 11 + the opponent's Hit Dice (for extraordinary and supernatural\
  \ abilities). Against spells and spell-like abilities, treat a success as if you\
  \ had counterspelled the effect using dispel magic. Against activated supernatural\
  \ and extraordinary abilities, a successful kinetic counter negates the ability's\
  \ effect entirely while still expending the ability. For example, if a pyrokineticist\
  \ succeeds at her caster level check against a white dragon's breath weapon, she\
  \ negates the breath weapon's effect in the entire area, and the dragon must wait\
  \ 1d4 rounds to use its breath weapon again."
