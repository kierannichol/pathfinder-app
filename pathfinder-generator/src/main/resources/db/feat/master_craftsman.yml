  \ Craft Magic Arms and Armor and Craft Wondrous Item feats. You can create magic\
  \ items using these feats, substituting your ranks in the chosen skill for your\
  \ total caster level. You must use the chosen skill for the check to create the\
  \ item. The DC to create the item still increases for any necessary spell requirements\
  \ (see the magic item creation rules in Magic Items). You cannot use this feat to\
  \ create any spell-trigger or spell-activation item."
