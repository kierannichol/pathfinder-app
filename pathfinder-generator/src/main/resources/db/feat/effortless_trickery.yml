name: "Effortless Trickery"
type: "RACIAL"
description: "Your natural knack for illusion allows you to maintain at least one\
  \ illusion spell with little effort."
prerequisites: "Gnome."
benefit: "You can maintain concentration on one spell of the illusion school as a\
  \ swift action. This has no effect on spells of other schools or on illusion spells\
  \ with durations that don't depend on your active concentration. While you may only\
  \ maintain one spell as a swift action, you may take your move and standard actions\
  \ to maintain other spells normally, if you wish."
normal: "Concentrating to maintain a spell is a standard action that does not provoke\
  \ attacks of opportunity."
