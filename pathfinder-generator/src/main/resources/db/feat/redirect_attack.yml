type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Dex 15, Int 15, Dodge."
benefit: "Once per turn, when an opponent only you threaten fails an attack against\
  \ you, you can redirect the attack to target another foe. The new target must be\
  \ adjacent to you and within reach of the opponent that missed you. Attempt a combat\
  \ maneuver check; if the result exceeds both the Combat Maneuver Defense of the\
  \ opponent who missed you and the Armor Class of the new target, the attack strikes\
  \ and deals its normal damage."
