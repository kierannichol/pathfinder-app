id: "feat:draining_strike"
name: "Draining Strike"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8."
benefit: "You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack\
  \ roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). Draining Strike forces a\
  \ foe that was damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude saving throw\
  \ (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing\
  \ damage normally. A defender who fails this saving throw is fatigued for 1 minute\
  \ or until the foe is subject to any spell or effect that heals hit point damage\
  \ any spell that deals hit point damage . If you have a base attack bonus of +14\
  \ or higher, the target is exhausted for the same duration instead. You can attempt\
  \ to use Draining Strike once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but\
  \ you can use it no more than once per round. Constructs, incorporeal creatures,\
  \ plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected\
  \ by this ability."
