id: "feat:summon_evil_monster"
name: "Summon Evil Monster"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You can summon the aid of creatures driven their very nature to destroy\
  \ goodness."
prerequisites: "Evil alignment."
benefit: "When casting summon monster, you also have access to the list of evil monsters\
  \ on this page. When summoning a creature from this list, your debased nature allows\
  \ you to cast the spell as a standard action. The summoned creature appears as normal\
  \ for the spell but can't act until next your next turn. It is not flat-footed,\
  \ however, and it can make attacks of opportunity as normal. These effects don't\
  \ apply for creatures from the standard list that aren't also on this list."
normal: ""
special: "If you possess the Sacred Summons feat, you can apply it to a creature on\
  \ this list whose alignment (as opposed to its subtype or subtypes) matches your\
  \ aura."
