name: "Gravitational Vital Strike"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You use unusual gravities to adjust your vital strikes."
prerequisites: "Vital Strike; Heavy Gravity Acclimation or Light Gravity Acclimation."
benefit: "When using any Vital Strike feat in an area of light or heavy gravity, roll\
  \ the weapon's damage dice for the attack one additional time. For example, if using\
  \ Improved Vital Strike, you would roll the weapon's damage dice for the attack\
  \ four times before adding other damage bonuses, instead of three times. You must\
  \ have the appropriate prerequisite feat associated with the plane's gravity trait\
  \ to gain this benefit."
