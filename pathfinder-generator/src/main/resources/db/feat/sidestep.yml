prerequisites: "Dex 13, Dodge, Mobility."
benefit: "Whenever an opponent misses you with a melee attack, you may move 5 feet\
  \ as an immediate action so long as you remain within that opponent's threatened\
  \ area. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If you take this\
  \ step, you cannot take a 5-foot step during your next turn. If you take an action\
  \ to move during your next turn, subtract 5 feet from your total movement."
