name: "Dueling Mastery"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "You have mastered the impenetrable fighting style."
prerequisites: "Exotic Weapon Proficiency (dueling sword), Quick Draw, Weapon Finesse,\
  \ Weapon Focus (dueling sword)."
benefit: "You gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks as long as you start combat with\
  \ a dueling sword in your hand. As long as you wield only a single dueling sword\
  \ in one hand (not using a shield, an off-hand weapon, armor spikes, unarmed strikes,\
  \ or natural weapons), you gain a +2 shield bonus to your AC. If you wield the sword\
  \ in two hands, this bonus drops to a +1 shield bonus to AC. Although the dueling\
  \ sword deals slashing damage, you treat it as if it were also a piercing weapon\
  \ when determining the effects of weapons used by a duelist or swashbuckler."
