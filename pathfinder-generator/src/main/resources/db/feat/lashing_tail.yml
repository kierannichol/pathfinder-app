id: "feat:lashing_tail"
name: "Lashing Tail"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "Your tail is either thick and heavy enough to serve as a weapon, or\
  \ else is adorned with barbs or quills that weaponize its lashing length."
prerequisites: "Grasping Tail, you must have a tail."
benefit: "You gain a tail slap natural attack that deals damage as appropriate for\
  \ your size (1d6 points for a Medium creature, or 1d4 points for a small creature).\
  \ When you first gain this feat, choose bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing; this\
  \ is the type of damage your tail inflicts, and it cannot be later changed. Due\
  \ to the inherent awkwardness of attacking with your tail, you can't make a tail\
  \ slap attack and other natural weapon attacks as part of the same full attack.\
  \ Treat your tail slap attack as a secondary attack if you also attack with a manufactured\
  \ weapon as part of a full-attack action."
