name: "Upsetting Vengeance"
type: "STYLE"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Dex 13, Combat Reflexes, Improved Shield Bash, Upsetting Shield Style,\
  \ Upsetting Strike, proficiency with bucklers."
benefit: "While using Upsetting Shield Style, the penalty on attack rolls foes take\
  \ for being hit by your shield bash attack applies to their attacks against any\
  \ target. If an adjacent foe taking this penalty makes an attack roll against any\
  \ target and misses the target's AC by 5 or more, that foe provokes an attack of\
  \ opportunity from you. You can only make one attack of opportunity against an opponent\
  \ as a result of this feat or Upsetting Strike each round."
