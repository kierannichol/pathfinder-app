id: "feat:feign_curse"
name: "Feign Curse"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Deceitful, Bluff 5 ranks, Spellcraft 1 rank."
benefit: "As a standard action, you can feign placing a curse on a target. The target\
  \ must attempt a Sense Motive or Spellcraft check (whichever skill that target has\
  \ a higher bonus with) against a DC equal to 15 + your number of ranks in Bluff\
  \ + your Charisma modifier, with a bonus on his skill check equal to any conditional\
  \ bonus he has on saving throws against hexes or curses (like from the spell hex\
  \ ward). If he fails, he becomes plagued by self-doubt and second-guesses himself.\
  \ For his next two attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, or ability checks,\
  \ he rolls twice and takes the lower result; for every 5 ranks of Bluff you possess\
  \ beyond 5, this ability affects an additional roll. This is a mind-affecting effect,\
  \ and it doesn't work if the target is immune to curses."
