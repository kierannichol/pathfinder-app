description: "Using leverage and pure brawn, you can cling to a cliff face, ladder,\
  \ or rope with your legs to free both of your hands to take other actions."
prerequisites: "Str 13, Climb 3 ranks."
benefit: "As a move action while climbing, you can cling to your climbing surface\
  \ with your legs by succeeding at a Climb check with the same DC as that of climbing\

  \ ranged weapon and reload ranged weapons until you resume climbing. The GM can\
  \ rule that this feat doesn't work on certain climbing surfaces."
