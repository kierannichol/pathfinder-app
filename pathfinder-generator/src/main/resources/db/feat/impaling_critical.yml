id: "feat:impaling_critical"
name: "Impaling Critical"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "Your critical hits can skewer your foes."
prerequisites: "Critical Focus, Weapon Specialization with selected piercing melee\
  \ weapon, base attack bonus +11."
benefit: "Whenever you score a critical hit with the selected piercing melee weapon,\
  \ you can impale your opponent on your weapon. While your opponent is impaled in\
  \ this way, each time he starts his turn, you deal damage equal to your weapon's\
  \ damage dice plus the extra damage dice from your weapon's properties. As an immediate\
  \ action, you can pull your weapon out of your opponent. If your opponent is ever\
  \ outside your reach, you must spend a free action to let go of your weapon or pull\
  \ it out of him. Your opponent can also spend a move action to pull your weapon\
  \ out. When the weapon comes out, your opponent takes damage as if starting his\
  \ turn impaled. While you impale your opponent with your weapon, you cannot use\
  \ it to attack, and you must hold on to it."
