name: "Improved Fiendish Darkness"
type: "RACIAL"
description: "Your innate ability to shroud others in darkness is further empowered."
prerequisites: "Fiendish Darkness, darkness spell-like ability, caster level 3rd,\

benefit: "You gain a +2 bonus to your effective caster level when using your darkness\
  \ spell-like ability. In addition, whenever you cast a spell with the [evil] descriptor\
  \ that targets another creature, you can spend a swift action to apply the effects\
  \ of your darkness spell-like ability to the spell cast, with the darkness effect\
  \ centered on the spell's target. Using the darkness spell-like ability in this\
  \ way expends all three uses of it for the day, and it cannot be used if fewer than\
  \ three uses of it remain for that day."
