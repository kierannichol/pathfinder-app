name: "Stick-Fighting Counter"
type: "STYLE"
description: "Using stick-fighting techniques both defensively and offensively, you\
  \ can turn your parries into counterattacks."
prerequisites: "Stick-Fighting Style, base attack bonus +4."
benefit: "While you are fighting defensively, as a free action you can select an opponent\
  \ you have attacked on that turn and prepare yourself to counter one of its attacks.\
  \ Once per round, when that opponent attempts a melee attack against you and the\
  \ attack misses, the attacker provokes an attack of opportunity from you, provided\
  \ that it is within your threatened area. You must use a club, quarterstaff, dan\
  \ bong, sap, or tonfa to perform the attack of opportunity."
