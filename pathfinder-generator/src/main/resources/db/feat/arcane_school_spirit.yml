name: "Arcane School Spirit"
type: "RACIAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Bluff 1 rank, arcane school class feature, gnome."
benefit: "As a full-round action, you extol the virtues of your school of magic to\
  \ one creature within 30 feet. Make a Bluff check opposed by a target's Sense Motive\
  \ check; if you win the check, the target takes a –2 penalty on saving throws made\
  \ to resist the next spell of this school that you cast. If your chosen school is\
  \ universalist, choose a specific school each time you use this ability. If your\
  \ Bluff check succeeds, however, your lack of true commitment to the school means\
  \ the target takes only a –1 penalty on its saving throw."
