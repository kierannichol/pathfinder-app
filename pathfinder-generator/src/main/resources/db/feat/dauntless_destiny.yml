description: ""
prerequisites: "Cha 13, Fearless Curiosity, Intimidate 10 ranks, human."
benefit: "You gain a +1 bonus on saving throws against effects with the emotion descriptor;\
  \ this bonus stacks with those granted by Fearless Curiosity and Intimidating Confidence.\
  \ In addition, once per day you may reroll a natural 1 on a saving throw or an attack\
  \ roll. If your reroll results in a successful saving throw or attack roll, as a\
  \ free action you can make an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of your\
  \ attack or the creature that forced you to make a saving throw, as long as the\
  \ creature is within 30 feet and can see and hear you. This effect does not apply\
  \ on saving throws against traps or other objects. This does not stack with other\
  \ effects that allow you to reroll a saving throw or an attack roll. You may only\
  \ make one reroll."
