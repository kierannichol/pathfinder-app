name: "Trap Wrecker"
type: "RACIAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Power Attack, Disable Device 1 rank, orc."
benefit: "You can attempt to disarm a trap by striking it with a melee weapon instead\
  \ of making a Disable Device check. As a full-round action, make a melee attack\
  \ against an Armor Class equal to the trap's Disable Device DC. If you miss, the\
  \ trap activates. If you hit, roll damage. If this damage is at least half the trap's\
  \ Disable Device DC, you disable the trap. If this damage is less than half the\
  \ trap's Disable Device DC, the trap activates. You can only attempt this on non-magical\
  \ traps. You must be able to reach some part of the trap with your attack in order\
  \ to use this feat. At the GM's discretion, some traps may not be susceptible to\
  \ this feat."
