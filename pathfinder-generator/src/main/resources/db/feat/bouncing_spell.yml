benefit: "Whenever a bouncing spell targeting a single creature has no effect on its\
  \ intended target (whether due to spell resistance or a successful saving throw)\
  \ you may, as a swift action, redirect it to target another eligible creature within\
  \ range. The redirected spell behaves in all ways as if its new target were the\
  \ original target for the spell. Spells that affect a target in any way (including\
  \ a lesser effect from a successful saving throw) may not be redirected in this\
  \ manner."
