description: "You have learned the essential tricks of disguising your odor and keeping\
  \ creatures from locating you by your scent."
prerequisites: "Stealth 1 rank, Survival 1 rank."
benefit: "Creatures cannot use the scent ability to track you (though they can still\

  \ detect your presence by smell at half the normal distance, but cannot pinpoint\
  \ your location with scent."
