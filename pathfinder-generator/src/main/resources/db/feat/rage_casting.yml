  \ spells."
prerequisites: "Blood casting class feature."
benefit: "When you cast a bloodrager spell, as a swift action you can sacrifice some\

  \ points of damage per spell level of the spell you are casting, choosing the amount\
  \ of dice before rolling. You cannot overcome this damage in any way, and it cannot\
  \ be taken from temporary hit points. For each of these damage dice you roll, the\
  \ DC of the spell you are casting increases by 1."
