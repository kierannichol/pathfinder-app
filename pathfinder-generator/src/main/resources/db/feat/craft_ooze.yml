id: "feat:craft_ooze"
name: "Craft Ooze"
type: "ITEM_CREATION"
description: "You can use alchemy to create dangerous ooze creatures."
prerequisites: "Brew Potion, Craft Wondrous Item, Craft (alchemy) 3 ranks, caster\
  \ level 5th."
benefit: "You can create living oozes as though they were magical items. Creating\
  \ an ooze creature takes 1 day for each 500 gp in its construction cost. To create\
  \ an ooze, you must have access to an oozing vat (see below), you must use up raw\
  \ materials worth the construction cost of the ooze, and you must succeed at a Craft\
  \ (alchemy) check (DC 10 + 2 Ã— the ooze's CR). A failed check ruins the materials\
  \ used, while a check that fails by 5 or more also results in an ooze that attacks\
  \ its creator for 1d4 rounds before dissipating into useless waste material. A newly\
  \ created ooze has average hit points for its Hit Dice. Oozes created with this\
  \ feat are mindless and uncontrolled, and even normally intelligent oozes like slithering\
  \ trackers that are created this way have no Intelligence score--nor any loyalty\
  \ to their creator."
