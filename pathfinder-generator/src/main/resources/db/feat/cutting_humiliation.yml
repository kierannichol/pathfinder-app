name: "Cutting Humiliation"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Persuasive, Intimidate 5 ranks."
benefit: "When you successfully demoralize a target by using a verbal Intimidate check\
  \ in a social situation (rather than an Intimidate check you can make via an ability\
  \ such as Dazzling Display or Enforcer), you can instead humiliate the target, causing\
  \ it to take a â€“2 penalty on Charisma-based skill checks and Charisma ability checks\
  \ for 1 hour + 1 additional hour for every 5 by which the result of your check exceeds\
  \ the DC. The target can remove the effect early by taking 10 minutes to compose\
  \ herself. If you fail this check, any creature who witnessed the failure is immune\
  \ to your humiliation from this feat for 24 hours."
