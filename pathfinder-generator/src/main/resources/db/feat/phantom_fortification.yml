id: "feat:phantom_fortification"
name: "Phantom Fortification"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "Your phantom remains partly immaterial even when fully manifested in\
  \ ectoplasmic form."
prerequisites: "Phantom class feature, phantom with the incorporeal flight ability."
benefit: "Your phantom has a 50% chance of ignoring critical hits and precision-based\
  \ damage when fully manifested in its ectoplasmic form, as if wearing armor with\
  \ the moderate fortification special ability. This doesn't stack with other similar\
  \ effects, and doesn't apply against attacks made with ghost touch weapons or weaponlike\
  \ constructs made of force (such as a clenched fist, mage's sword, or spiritual\
  \ weapon)."
