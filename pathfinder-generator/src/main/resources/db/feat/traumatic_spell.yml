name: "Traumatic Spell"
type: "METAMAGIC"
description: "Creatures harmed by your spells relive their torments in nightly terrors."
prerequisites: ""
benefit: "A traumatic spell causes lingering memories of pain and suffering in creatures\
  \ harmed by it. When a creature fails a saving throw against a traumatic spell,\
  \ the next time it sleeps it must succeed at a Will save with a DC equal to the\
  \ original spell's DC or be affected as if by nightmare. Each time the target fails\
  \ its save, it must save again the following night or be affected by another nightmare,\
  \ though the save DC decreases by 2 each night after the first."
