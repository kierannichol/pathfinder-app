id: "feat:blinded_blade_style"
name: "Blinded Blade Style"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Blind-Fight, Perception 5 ranks."
benefit: "While you are using this style, you gain a number of benefits whenever you\
  \ are blinded or unable to see (including when you wear a blindfold or close your\
  \ eyes). Under such circumstances, you do not take any penalties on Strengthâ€“ or\
  \ Dexterity-based skill checks due to blindness. In addition, you gain a +4 bonus\
  \ on hearing- and smell-based Perception checks and gain the scent special ability\
  \ with a range of 10 feet; if you already have scent, the range of your scent ability\
  \ increases by 10 feet instead. Having this feat counts as having 10 ranks in Perception\
  \ for the purpose of satisfying the prerequisites of the Improved Blind-Fight feat,\
  \ as well as any feat that lists Improved Blind-Fight as a prerequisite."
