prerequisites: "Amateur Gunslinger feat or grit class feature."
benefit: "You gain a +1 bonus on Perform (act, comedy, oratory, and sing) skill checks,\
  \ and Perform is a class skill for you. In addition, each time you make a successful\
  \ Bluff check to convince someone of a far-fetched or impossible story, you regain\
  \ 1 grit point. Successfully lying to a friendly or helpful creature, or a creature\
  \ that has fewer Hit Dice than half your character level, doesn't restore grit."
