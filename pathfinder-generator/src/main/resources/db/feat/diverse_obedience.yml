id: "feat:diverse_obedience"
name: "Diverse Obedience"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "Your intense faith in your deity allows you to gain boons not granted\
  \ to most followers."
prerequisites: "Deific Obedience, Knowledge (religion) 5 ranks, alignment must match\
  \ that of your worshiped deity."
benefit: "You are treated as though you had 2 more Hit Dice than you actually do for\
  \ the purposes of determining what divine boons you gain as a result of performing\
  \ your deity's obedience. Diverse Obedience doesn't allow access to divine boons\
  \ granted through prestige classes early, as those boons are tied to prestige class\
  \ levels gained, not overall Hit Dice. If you take levels in a prestige class or\
  \ archetype that offers accelerated access to a boon, this benefit may be superfluous."
