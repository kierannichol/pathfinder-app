name: "Turn Undead"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Channel positive energy class feature."
benefit: "You can, as a standard action, use one of your uses of channel positive\
  \ energy to cause all undead within 30 feet of you to flee, as if panicked. Undead\
  \ receive a Will save to negate the effect. The DC for this Will save is equal to\
  \ 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Charisma modifier. Undead that fail their save\
  \ flee for 1 minute. Intelligent undead receive a new saving throw each round to\
  \ end the effect. If you use channel energy in this way, it has no other effect\
  \ (it does not heal or harm nearby creatures)."
