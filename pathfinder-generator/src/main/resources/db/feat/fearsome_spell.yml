id: "feat:fearsome_spell"
name: "Fearsome Spell"
type: "METAMAGIC"
description: "Your spells inspire great fear in those harmed by them."
prerequisites: ""
benefit: "When a creature takes damage from a fearsome spell, if that creature failed\
  \ its save against the spell, it becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to\
  \ the spell's original level. If the spell doesn't allow a save, creatures harmed\
  \ by it can attempt a Will save (against the same DC the spell would have if it\
  \ did allow a save) to negate the shaken effect. If the spell effect already causes\
  \ creatures to become shaken, on a failed save, add the duration of this metamagic\
  \ effect to the duration of the shaken condition imposed by the spell. A fearsome\
  \ spell can't cause a creature to become frightened, even if that creature is already\
  \ shaken."
