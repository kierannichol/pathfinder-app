name: "Paralyzing Strike"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +14."
benefit: "You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack\
  \ roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). Paralyzing Strike forces\
  \ a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC =\
  \ 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing\
  \ damage normally. A defender who fails this saving throw is paralyzed for 1 round,\
  \ until just before your next turn. You can attempt to use Paralyzing Strike once\
  \ per day for every 4 character levels you have, but no more than once per round.\
  \ Constructs, incorporeal creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune\
  \ to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability."
