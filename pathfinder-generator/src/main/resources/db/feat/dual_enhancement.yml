name: "Dual Enhancement"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You can enhance two weapons, or both ends of a double weapon, with a\
  \ single act."
prerequisites: "Two-Weapon Fighting; divine bond (weapon) or sacred weapon class feature."
benefit: "When you use divine bond or sacred weapon to improve your weapon, you can\
  \ choose to enhance two weapons or both ends of a double weapon. All weapons affected\
  \ must be in hand or otherwise wielded. Any enhancement bonus you add to one of\
  \ your weapons gets added to both automatically, but weapon special abilities must\
  \ be accounted for separately. For example, if you can enhance up to the equivalent\
  \ of a +2 bonus, you could give both your weapons an additional +1 bonus and apply\
  \ the keen special weapon ability to one of those weapons."
