id: "feat:suppress_regeneration"
name: "Suppress Regeneration"
type: "TEAMWORK"
description: "You and your allies can exacerbate a regenerating creature's weaknesses.\
  \ By making a precisely timed attack to open a serious wound just a bit further,\
  \ your allies can extend the length of time the creature's regeneration is suppressed."
prerequisites: ""
benefit: "When you make a successful attack that causes a creature's regeneration\
  \ ability to cease functioning for at least 1 round (such as by hitting a troll\
  \ with alchemist's fire), any ally who also has this feat and is currently threatening\
  \ the creature can make an attack of opportunity against it. This attack of opportunity\
  \ deals no damage, but instead extends the time that the creature's regeneration\
  \ is suppressed by 1 additional round. If multiple allies with this feat hit the\
  \ creature with this attack of opportunity, the additional rounds of suppression\
  \ stack."
