name: "Pushing Assault"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Str 15, Power Attack, base attack bonus +1."
benefit: "When you hit a creature your size or smaller with a two-handed weapon attack\
  \ modified by the Power Attack feat, you can choose to push the target 5 feet directly\
  \ away from you instead of dealing the extra damage from Power Attack. If you score\
  \ a critical hit, you can instead push the target 10 feet directly away from you.\
  \ This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunities, and the target must end\
  \ this move in a safe space it can stand in. You choose which effect to apply after\
  \ the attack roll has been made, but before the damage is rolled."
