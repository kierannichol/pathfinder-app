id: "feat:wild_speech"
name: "Wild Speech"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You speak with the tongue of men and beasts."
prerequisites: "Druid level 6th, wild shape class feature."
benefit: "When using wild shape to take the form in which you cannot speak (such as\
  \ an animal), you are able to speak normally in any language you know. This allows\
  \ you to cast spells with verbal components, speak command words, and activate spell\
  \ completion and spell trigger items. However, it does not give you the ability\
  \ to cast spells requiring somatic components unless you also have the Natural Spell\
  \ feat, or cast spells with material components merged into your form."
