id: "feat:grisly_ornament"
name: "Grisly Ornament"
type: "ITEM_CREATION"
description: "You adorn your gear with mementos from your foes."
prerequisites: "Harvest Parts."
benefit: "You can attempt a Craft or Heal check to craft a special type of trophy\
  \ called an ornament from part of a creature that's been dead for less than an hour.\
  \ You take a â€“4 penalty on this check if you or an ally didn't slay the creature.\
  \ You can craft one ornament per character level per day. Each corpse provides enough\
  \ material for one ornament plus one additional ornament per size category above\
  \ Medium. You can wear one ornament in each magic item slot not already occupied\
  \ by another item. When you craft an ornament, you choose whether it affects Armor\
  \ Class, attack rolls, CMB, CMD, saving throws, or skill checks. The ornament provides\
  \ a morale bonus equal to the monster's CR divided by 4 (round down, minimum 1)\
  \ to the selected statistic against creatures of the same creature type as the source\
  \ of the ornament. This bonus increases by 1 against creatures of the exact same\
  \ variety (so a red dragon's talon provides the increased bonus against red dragons\
  \ but not all dragons). An ornament remains effective for 1 day, plus 1 additional\
  \ day for every 5 by which you exceed the DC to craft it. You can give ornaments\
  \ to others, but gifted ornaments have a morale bonus equal to the monster's CR\
  \ divided by 6 (round down, minimum 0) and remain effective for only 24 hours."
