prerequisites: "Spellcraft 10 ranks, ability to acquire an animal companion, eidolon,\
  \ familiar, or special mount."
benefit: "Any non-instantaneous spell (but not any spell-like ability) you cast on\
  \ yourself can also affect a creature bonded to you (such as an animal companion,\
  \ eidolon, familiar, or special mount). The creature must be within 5 feet of you\
  \ at the time of casting to receive the benefit. The spell's duration is halved\
  \ between you and your bonded creature (for example, a spell with a duration of\
  \ 1 hour has a duration of 30 minutes for both you and your bonded creature)."
