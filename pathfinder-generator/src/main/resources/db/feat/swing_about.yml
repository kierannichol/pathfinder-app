description: "You can grab an ally and move her to a position near you."
prerequisites: "Escape Route."
benefit: "If you have a free hand, as a move action you can grab a willing adjacent\
  \ ally who also has this feat and place her in any other space adjacent to you.\
  \ This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You can do this only with\
  \ allies who are able to move freely (not grappled, held, prone, slowed, or otherwise\
  \ suffering restricted movement) and who are of your size or smaller."
