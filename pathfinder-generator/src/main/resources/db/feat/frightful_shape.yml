id: "feat:frightful_shape"
name: "Frightful Shape"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "Your wild shape form strikes fear into your opponents."
prerequisites: "Wis 19, base attack bonus +9, wild shape class feature."
benefit: "When you use wild shape, it is supernaturally ferocious and disquieting\
  \ in appearance, such that when you attack a creature, you can use this ferocity\
  \ to frighten observers. Opponents within 30 feet of you when you attack must succeed\
  \ at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Charisma modifier)\
  \ to resist being affected by your frightful shape. On a failed save, creatures\
  \ with fewer Hit Dice than you become shaken, or panicked if they have 4 Hit Dice\
  \ or fewer; in either case, the effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your\
  \ character level. An opponent that succeeds at its saving throw is immune to your\
  \ frightful shape for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect."
