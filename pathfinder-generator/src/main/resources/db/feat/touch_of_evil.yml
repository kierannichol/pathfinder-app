id: "feat:touch_of_evil"
name: "Touch of Evil"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Channel negative energy 6d6, evil alignment."
benefit: "As a standard action, you can expend three uses of your channel negative\
  \ energy and make a melee touch attack against a target. You can attempt an opposed\
  \ Sleight of Hand check against the target's Perception to make this attack without\
  \ the target noticing. If the attack hits, the target gets a Will save (DC=10 +\
  \ 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier). On a failed save, you implant\
  \ a suggestion into the creature's mind. This works similar to the suggestion spell,\
  \ however, you can suggest to the creature to commit a harmful or destructive act\
  \ against another creature or object. If you choose the latter, the creature attempts\
  \ to carry out the suggestion in 1d6+1 days as it thinks over the suggestion and\
  \ plans it out. The creature can attempt another Will save at the original DC to\
  \ resist the suggestion right before it carries it out. If it fails the save, it\
  \ gains a +4 circumstance bonus on one die roll used in carrying out the suggestion.\
  \ This relentless planning causes the creature 1 point of Wisdom damage (or 1d6\
  \ sanity damage, if you are using that system), until the suggestion is carried\
  \ out."
