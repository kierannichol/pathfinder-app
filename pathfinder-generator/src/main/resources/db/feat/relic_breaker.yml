prerequisites: "Str 13, Gate Breaker, Improved Sunder, Power Attack, base attack bonus\
  \ +1."
benefit: "Whenever you sunder a held object, its bearer must succeed at a Reflex saving\
  \ throw or the bearer catches on fire (taking 1d6 points of fire damage immediately,\
  \ and an additional 1d6 points of fire damage each subsequent round the creature\
  \ fails a Reflex saving throw). When your total Hit Dice reach 5, this damage increases\
  \ by 1d6, and it increases by 1d6 every 5 levels thereafter, to a maximum of 5d6\
  \ at 20th level. The saving throw's DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Charisma\
  \ modifier."
