description: "You have learned to turn your speed into power, even with a heavier\
  \ blade."
prerequisites: "Dexterity 13, Weapon Finesse, Perform (dance) 2 ranks, proficient\
  \ with scimitar."
benefit: "When wielding a scimitar with one hand, you can use your Dexterity modifier\
  \ instead of your Strength modifier on melee attack and damage rolls. You treat\
  \ the scimitar as a one-handed piercing weapon for all feats and class abilities\
  \ that require such a weapon (such as a duelist's precise strike ability). The scimitar\
  \ must be for a creature of your size. You cannot use this feat if you are carrying\
  \ a weapon or shield in your off hand."
