name: "Bear's Balance"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Iron Will, rage class feature."
benefit: "You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks when not raging. When you fail\
  \ a saving throw against a fear effect, you can choose to enter your rage rather\
  \ than succumb to fear. You can not voluntarily end your rage until the fear effect\
  \ expires or is ended in some other way (such as due to the death of the fear-inducing\
  \ creature) or you exhaust your rounds of rage for the day. This feat has no effect\
  \ if you are already raging when exposed to a fear effect."
