name: "Subtle Enchantments"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "Your enchantments influence targets in more subtle ways and are harder\
  \ to notice."
prerequisites: "Deceitful, Spell Focus (enchantment)."
benefit: "When you cast an enchantment spell or use an enchantment spell-like ability\
  \ to influence a creature's attitude or actions and the foe negates the spell with\
  \ a successful Will save, she has a 50% chance not to notice that she just succeeded\
  \ at a saving throw (she still can attempt to identify your spell or spell-like\
  \ ability as normal). If the foe fails the saving throw or is otherwise affected\
  \ by the spell, the Sense Motive DC to notice she is under the effects of an enchantment\
  \ increases by 5."
normal: "Anyone who successfully saves against a spell notices the mental intrusion\
  \ automatically."
