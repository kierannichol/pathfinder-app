name: "Tree Hanger"
type: "RACIAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Acrobatics 1 rank, vanara."
benefit: "You gain a +2 bonus to your CMD against all trip attacks. If your square\
  \ has a branch or other sturdy large object that you could hang from, as a swift\
  \ action you may make a DC 15 Acrobatics check to jump upward and use your tail\
  \ to hang from that object. While hanging, you can't be tripped, you ignore the\
  \ effects of difficult terrain in your square, and you gain a +2 bonus to your CMD\
  \ against bull rush, drag, and reposition attacks. If you leave that square (including\
  \ if you are moved against your will), you lose your grip on the object and are\
  \ no longer hanging. While hanging, you cannot use your tail for anything else."
