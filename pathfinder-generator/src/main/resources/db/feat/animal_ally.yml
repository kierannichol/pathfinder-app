id: "feat:animal_ally"
name: "Animal Ally"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "Your respect for nature is so great that you can form a deep and lasting\
  \ friendship with an animal."
prerequisites: "Nature Soul, character level 4th, must not have an animal companion\
  \ or mount that advances as an animal companion."
benefit: "You gain an animal companion as if you were a druid of your character level\
  \ â€“3 from the following list: badger, bird, camel, cat (small), dire rat, dog, horse,\
  \ pony, snake (viper), or wolf. If you later gain an animal companion through another\
  \ source (such as the Animal domain, divine bond, hunter's bond, mount, or nature\
  \ bond class features), the effective druid level granted by this feat stacks with\
  \ that granted by other sources."
