id: "feat:ranged_feint"
name: "Ranged Feint"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Base attack bonus +2, Bluff 3 ranks."
benefit: "You can feint with a ranged weapon by throwing a thrown weapon or firing\
  \ one arrow, bolt, bullet, or other piece of ammunition; this feint takes the same\
  \ action as normal to feint, but depending on your weapon, you might have to reload\
  \ or draw another weapon afterward. When you successfully use a ranged feint, you\
  \ deny that enemy its Dexterity bonus to AC against your ranged attacks as well\
  \ as your melee attacks for the same duration as normal. If your feints normally\
  \ deny a foe its Dexterity bonus to AC against attacks other than your own, this\
  \ applies only against others' melee attacks."
normal: "You can feint only with a melee weapon, and only against a creature you threaten\
  \ with that weapon."
