name: "Primal Strike"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "You have learned to draw primal magic through your body to befuddle\
  \ your enemies."
prerequisites: "Wis 17, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8."
benefit: "Before making an attack roll, you can declare a primal strike. If you do\
  \ and the attack hits, it deals damage normally and your target must attempt a Fortitude\
  \ saving throw (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Wisdom modifier). A target\
  \ who fails this saving throw is confused for 1 round. If you are in an area of\
  \ primal magic, the confused condition lasts for 1d4 rounds. You can attempt a primal\
  \ strike attack once per day for every 4 character levels you have (see Special\
  \ below if you have monk levels), but no more than once per round. A primal strike\
  \ is a mind-affecting compulsion effect."
normal: ""
special: "If you have levels in the monk class, you can make a primal attack a number\
  \ of times per day equal to your monk level, plus one additional time per day for\
  \ every 4 levels you have in classes other than monk, though still no more than\
  \ once per round."
