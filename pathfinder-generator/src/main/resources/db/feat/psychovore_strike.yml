id: "feat:psychovore_strike"
name: "Psychovore Strike"
type: "STYLE"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Improved Unarmed Strike, Psychovore Style, Sense Motive 9 ranks."
benefit: "When you strike the creature you are gaining a dodge bonus to AC against\
  \ from Psychovore Style with your unarmed strike, you can force that creature to\
  \ attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom\
  \ modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A creature who fails its save\
  \ is confused for 1d6 rounds. You must declare that you are using this feat before\
  \ you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). You\
  \ can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Wisdom bonus\
  \ (minimum once per day), and no more than once per round. This is a mind-affecting\
  \ effect, and a creature confused in this way never attacks you."
