name: "Flexible Shadow Jump"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You have refined your ability to leap through the shadows."
prerequisites: "Shadow jump shadowdancer class feature."
enabled_formula: "@ability:shadow_jump#shadowdancer"
benefit: "When you travel between shadows using the shadow jump ability, the minimum\
  \ increment that you can jump is 5 feet, allowing you to split your shadow jumps\
  \ into 5-foot increments instead of 10-foot increments. In addition, your shadow\
  \ jump ability counts as the ability to cast dimension door for the purpose of meeting\
  \ the prerequisites of the Dimensional Agility feat as well as any feat that lists\
  \ that feat as a prerequisite, and your shadow jump benefits from such feats as\
  \ if you were casting dimension door."
normal: "Each shadow jump, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment."
