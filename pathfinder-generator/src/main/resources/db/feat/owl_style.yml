type: "STYLE"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Dex 13, Skill Focus (Stealth), Stealth 1 rank."
benefit: "While using this style, you can use your base attack bonus in place of your\
  \ ranks in Stealth to determine your Stealth skill modifier (as usual, this does\
  \ not replace your ranks for other purposes, such as determining the effects of\
  \ Skill Focus). While in this stance and using Stealth, you can charge at a –10\
  \ penalty beyond the penalty you take for using Stealth at full speed (which is\
  \ typically –5)."
