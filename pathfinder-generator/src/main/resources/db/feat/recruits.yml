type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Cha 13, character level 5th."
benefit: "You gain a number of cohorts (as the Leadership feat) that represent NPCs\
  \ you are responsible for instructing and overseeing. You have a number of such\
  \ cohorts equal to half your character level. Unlike normal cohorts, these minor\
  \ cohorts must be at least 4 levels lower than your character level. Since these\
  \ students must spend most of their time studying and gaining experience, you can\
  \ only have one minor cohort travel with you at a time (though they all gain experience\
  \ at the same rate, as those not present are assumed to be studying and growing\
  \ independently). Whenever you are in a major town or city, you may exchange your\
  \ current minor cohort for a different member of your recruits."

special: "Recruits counts as the Leadership feat for purposes of prerequisites. A\
  \ character cannot have both Leadership and Recruits. A character with Recruits\
  \ that later qualifies for Leadership may exchange this feat for Leadership immediately\
  \ upon qualifying (selecting one minor cohort to become a full cohort, while the\
  \ rest move on)."
