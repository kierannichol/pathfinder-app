  \ rounds. A successful Fortitude save reduces the duration to 1 round. The DC of\
  \ this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. The effects of this\
  \ feat do not stack. Additional hits instead add to the duration."

special: "You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical\
  \ hit unless you possess Critical Mastery."
