id: "feat:subjective_slam"
name: "Subjective Slam"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "When in control of gravity, you can use your momentum to cause brutal\
  \ impacts, transforming the very act of falling into a devastating weapon."
prerequisites: "Con 13; Wis 13; Subjective Mobility; base attack bonus +4 or monk\
  \ level 3rd."
benefit: "While on a plane with subjective directional gravity, you halve all damage\
  \ you take from impacts (such as falling damage). While on such a plane, if your\
  \ “fall\" would cause you to collide with a creature or object, you can slam into\
  \ it with devastating force as a standard action. You must succeed at a touch attack\
  \ to slam a creature or object, with a cumulative –1 penalty for every 50 feet of\
  \ your current falling speed; at the GM's discretion, you can automatically hit\
  \ vast objects such as walls. A creature or object hit by this slam takes 1d6 points\
  \ of bludgeoning damage for every 50 feet of current falling speed, to a maximum\
  \ of 6d6, and begins falling at your current speed according to your current subjective\
  \ directional gravity."
