name: "Diehard"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Endurance."
benefit: "When your hit point total is below 0, but you are not dead, you automatically\
  \ stabilize. You do not need to make a Constitution check each round to avoid losing\
  \ additional hit points. You may choose to act as if you were disabled, rather than\
  \ dying. You must make this decision as soon as you are reduced to negative hit\
  \ points (even if it isn't your turn). If you do not choose to act as if you were\
  \ disabled, you immediately fall unconscious."
normal: "A character without this feat who is reduced to negative hit points is unconscious\
  \ and dying."
