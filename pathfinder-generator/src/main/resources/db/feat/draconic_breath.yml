  \ feat or the dragon-scaled racial trait. Using a breath weapon is a standard action\
  \ that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You can use your breath weapon once\
  \ per day. Creatures within the area of your breath weapon who succeed at a Reflex\
  \ saving throw (DC 10 + your character level + your Constitution modifier) take\
  \ only half damage."
