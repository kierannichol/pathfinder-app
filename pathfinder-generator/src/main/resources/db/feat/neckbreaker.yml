type: "COMBAT"
description: "With a quick jerk, you snap an enemy's neck."
prerequisites: "Bonebreaker, Greater Grapple, Improved Grapple, Improved Unarmed Strike,\
  \ Jawbreaker, Stunning Fist, Heal 12 ranks."
benefit: "If you have an opponent your size or smaller helpless or pinned, after you\
  \ initiate or maintain a grapple, you can make a Stunning Fist attempt at a â€“5 penalty\
  \ on the attack roll. If you succeed, you wrench that opponent's neck, dealing 2d6\
  \ Strength or Dexterity damage. If the targeted ability score is reduced to 0, any\
  \ remaining damage is dealt to that opponent's Constitution score. A creature that\
  \ is immune to critical hits or that has no discernible head and neck is immune\
  \ to the effects of this feat."
