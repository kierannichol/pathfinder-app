prerequisites: "Str 15, Mobile Bulwark Style, Shield Focus, Tower Shield Proficiency,\
  \ base attack bonus +4."
benefit: "While using a tower shield, you add half of the shield's bonus to AC (including\
  \ its enhancement bonus) to your touch AC and take only a â€“1 penalty on attack rolls\
  \ because of the shield's encumbrance. While using Mobile Bulwark Style, whenever\
  \ you would use a tower shield to gain total cover, you also grant any adjacent\
  \ ally total cover against attacks passing through the selected edge of your space."
