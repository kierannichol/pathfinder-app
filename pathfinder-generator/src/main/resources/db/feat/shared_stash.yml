name: "Shared Stash"
type: "TEAMWORK"
description: "You are adept at borrowing from your allies even in the middle of combat."
prerequisites: "Quick Draw, base attack bonus +1, Sleight of Hand 1 rank, swarming\
  \ racial trait."
benefit: "While you are in the same square as a willing ally who also has this feat,\
  \ you can draw a weapon from that creature as a free action or draw a hidden weapon\
  \ or any other object as a move action. You can also take a held object from a willing\
  \ ally in the same square as you as a free action. Drawing or taking an object (but\
  \ not a weapon) in this way provokes an attack of opportunity."
