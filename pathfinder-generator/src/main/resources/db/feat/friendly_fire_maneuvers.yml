name: "Friendly Fire Maneuvers"
type: "TEAMWORK"
description: "You and your teammates can anticipate one another's ranged attacks and\
  \ stay out of each others' way."
prerequisites: "Point-Blank Shot, Precise Shot."
benefit: "Allies who also have this feat cannot provide soft cover to enemies, allowing\
  \ you to make attacks of opportunity against an enemy even if those allies grant\
  \ you soft cover against that foe's attacks. If an ally who also has this feat casts\
  \ a spell that targets the area you are in as it allows a Reflex saving throw to\
  \ avoid the effect (such as fireball), you gain a +4 dodge bonus on that saving\
  \ throw."
