name: "Superior Scryer"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Spell Focus (divination), the ability to cast at least one spell of\
  \ the scrying subschool."
benefit: "When casting a scrying spell, you see through the spell's sensor with darkvision\
  \ 60 feet, whether or not you possess darkvision normally and whether or not the\
  \ spell normally allows you to see with darkvision. If the spell sends back sensory\
  \ information only within 10 feet of the sensor (such as with scrying and greater\
  \ scrying), this feat doesn't increase that range. You receive a +2 bonus on Perception\
  \ checks to notice things through a scrying sensor, and your prying eyes and insect\
  \ spies also receive a +2 bonus on Perception checks."
