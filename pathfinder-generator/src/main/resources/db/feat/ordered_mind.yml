type: "GENERAL"
description: "Your study of Hell's laws improves your counterspells."
prerequisites: "Caster level 7th, lawful alignment, worship of the associated deity."
benefit: "You are able to modify more of your spells to use as counterspells. The\
  \ DC of the Spellcraft check you must succeed at to identify an opponent's spell\
  \ is equal to 20 + the spell level of the opponent's spell (instead of 15 + the\
  \ spell level), but you are able to cast as your counterspell any spell from the\
  \ same school of the foe's spell (instead of the same spell). The level of the spell\
  \ used to counterspell must be of a level equal to or higher than your foe's spell."
