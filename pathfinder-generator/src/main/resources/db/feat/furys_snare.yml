name: "Fury's Snare"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Fury's Fall, Improved Trip."
benefit: "If you successfully use a whip to trip a foe, you can choose to drop your\
  \ whip. Your tripped target gains the entangled condition. The target can break\
  \ free of the whip by making a DC 10 Strength check or a DC 15 Escape Artist check\
  \ (add the enhancement bonus of the whip to these DCs), or by using a full-round\
  \ action to disentangle himself. Escaping the whip by making a Strength check means\
  \ the whip gains the broken condition. If the whip has a magical quality such as\
  \ flaming, apply this quality's damage to the target every round on your turn."
