id: "feat:exotic_heritage"
name: "Exotic Heritage"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "Your blood carries hints of an extraplanar ancestor, granting you a\
  \ talent for a certain skill."
prerequisites: ""
benefit: "Choose a skill. You gain a +2 bonus on skill checks with that skill. If\
  \ you have 10 or more ranks in the chosen skill, this bonus increases to +4. This\
  \ bonus does not stack with that granted by Skill Focus. This feat counts as Skill\
  \ Focus with the chosen skill for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of the\
  \ Eldritch Heritage feat. When you select Eldritch Heritage, if you use this feat\
  \ as a prerequisite, you can choose a mutated version of your chosen bloodline as\
  \ though you were a sorcerer with the wildblooded archetype. All other restrictions\
  \ and requirements of Eldritch Heritage still apply."
