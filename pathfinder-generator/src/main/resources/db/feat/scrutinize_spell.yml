description: ""
prerequisites: "Spellcraft 1 rank."
benefit: "When you witness a creature casting a spell, you can attempt a Spellcraft\
  \ check to determine what sort of spellcaster the target is--specifically, what\
  \ the target's class is. The DC of this skill check is equal to 10 + the spellcaster's\
  \ Hit Dice. If the target has levels in multiple spellcasting classes, succeeding\
  \ at this check reveals what class spell list the spell came from. If the result\
  \ of the check is high enough that it would identify the spell being cast (DC =\
  \ 15 + the spell's level), you also identify the spell."
