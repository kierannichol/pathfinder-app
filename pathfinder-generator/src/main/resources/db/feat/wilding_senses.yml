name: "Wilding Senses"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "The wilderness speaks to you, giving you a preternatural sense of approaching\
  \ danger."
prerequisites: "Wis 13, Wilding."
benefit: "You gain a +2 bonus on Perception checks; this bonus increases to +4 when\
  \ determining if you can act during a surprise round. If you have 10 or more ranks\
  \ in Perception, this bonus increases to +4 (or +8 when determining whether you\
  \ can act during a surprise round). This bonus does not stack with that granted\
  \ by the Alertness feat, though Wilding Senses counts as the Alertness feat for\
  \ the purpose of fulfilling feat prerequisites and prestige class requirements."
