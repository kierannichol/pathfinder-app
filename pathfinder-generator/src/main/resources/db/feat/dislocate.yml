prerequisites: "Con 13."
benefit: "As a swift action, you can deal 1d8 points of nonlethal damage to yourself\
  \ as you pop your joints from their sockets, making yourself more flexible though\
  \ suffering incredible pain. Any Escape Artist checks you attempt that would normally\
  \ take 1 minute instead take 1 full-round action. If you have 7 Hit Dice or more,\
  \ the damage you deal to yourself is decreased to 1d6. If you have 14 Hit Dice or\
  \ more, you deal no damage to yourself, and any Escape Artist checks you attempt\
  \ that normally take 1 full round instead take a move action. You can't gain any\
  \ benefits from this feat if you are immune to nonlethal damage."
