id: "feat:brute_stomp"
name: "Brute Stomp"
type: "STYLE"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Str 19, Int 13, Brute Style, Combat Reflexes, Improved Overrun, Improved\
  \ Trip, Improved Unarmed Strike, Vicious Stomp, base attack bonus +8."
benefit: "While using Brute Style, when you make a full attack with a prone opponent\
  \ adjacent to you that includes at least one unarmed strike, you can make an additional\
  \ unarmed strike at your highest base attack bonus against that prone creature.\
  \ These additional attacks don't stack with those granted by Medusa's Wrath, and\
  \ this does not allow you to make an additional attack against a creature you tripped\
  \ during your full attack. Additionally, you can use your Vicious Stomp feat against\
  \ any opponent within your natural reach regardless of whether it falls prone adjacent\
  \ to you."
