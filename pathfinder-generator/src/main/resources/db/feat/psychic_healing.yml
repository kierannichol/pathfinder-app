name: "Psychic Healing"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "The spirit finds ways to heal the body, guided by your faith."
prerequisites: "Cha 11, Psychic Sensitivity or the ability to cast psychic spells,\
  \ Heal 3 ranks."
benefit: "As an additional use of the faith healing skill unlock, you can attempt\
  \ to manipulate a creature's psychic form to heal damage to its physical form. This\
  \ works as the treat deadly wounds use of the Heal skill, but also grants the creature\
  \ a number of temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage healed. These temporary\
  \ hit points last for 1 hour. Psychic healing doesn't require a healer's kit. A\
  \ creature can benefit from psychic healing only once per day, and can't benefit\
  \ from both this ability and treat deadly wounds in the same day."
