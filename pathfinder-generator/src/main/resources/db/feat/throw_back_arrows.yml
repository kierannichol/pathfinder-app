id: "feat:throw_back_arrows"
name: "Throw Back Arrows"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "When you catch arrows and other ranged ammunition, you can immediately\
  \ hurl them at your enemies."
prerequisites: "Dex 17, Deflect Arrows, Improved Unarmed Strike, Snatch Arrows."
benefit: "When using the Snatch Arrows feat, you can throw a caught piece of ranged\
  \ ammunition (such as an arrow, bolt, or sling bullet, but not a firearm bullet)\
  \ as though it were a thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet (even though\
  \ it isn't your turn). The thrown ammunition deals the normal amount of damage for\
  \ its type plus your Strength modifier, and you don't take a penalty for throwing\
  \ a weapon that isn't designed to be thrown. This attack provokes attacks of opportunity\
  \ as normal."
