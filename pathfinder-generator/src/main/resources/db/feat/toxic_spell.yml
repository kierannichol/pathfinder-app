id: "feat:toxic_spell"
name: "Toxic Spell"
type: "METAMAGIC"
description: "You can infuse a spell with the power of a poison."
prerequisites: "Craft (poison) 5 ranks, ability to cast 2nd-level spells, poison use\
  \ class feature."
benefit: "You can use 1 dose of contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury poison as an\
  \ additional material component for a spell you cast. This spell gains the poison\
  \ descriptor. Select a single creature affected by the spell. If that creature fails\
  \ its saving throw against the spell, it must also attempt a saving throw against\
  \ the poison used as a material component. If the target fails the save against\
  \ the poison, the poison takes effect immediately, ignoring any onset time. The\
  \ poison uses its save DC (rather than the save DC of the spell), but is modified\
  \ by any effects that increase the spell's DC (such as Spell Focus). This feat works\
  \ only with spells whose effects can be negated by a successful Fortitude save."
