id: "feat:umbral_spell"
name: "Umbral Spell"
type: "METAMAGIC"
description: "Targets of your darkness spells radiate darkness."
prerequisites: "Tenebrous Spell."
benefit: "An umbral spell gains the darkness descriptor. As long as the spell is in\
  \ effect, the creature or object affected radiates darkness in a 10-foot radius,\
  \ reducing illumination similar to the effects of the darkness spell. Nonmagical\
  \ sources of light, such as torches or lanterns, do not increase the light level\
  \ in this area. Magical light sources only increase the light level in an area affected\
  \ by an umbral spell if they are of a higher level than the umbral spell's unmodified\
  \ spell level. This effect does not stack with itself or with any other effect that\
  \ creates darkness."
