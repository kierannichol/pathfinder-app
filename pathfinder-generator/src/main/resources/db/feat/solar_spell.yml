name: "Solar Spell"
type: "METAMAGIC"
description: "Your spells erupt with the searing light of the sun, blinding or burning\
  \ creatures of evil."
prerequisites: ""
benefit: "Any spell you cast with the [light] descriptor is fortified with the cleansing\
  \ energies of the sun. If the spell creates an area of light, all creatures are\
  \ dazzled for as long as they remain within the spell's area. Oozes, fungal creatures,\
  \ creatures from the Shadow Plane, and undead must also succeed at a Will save (DC\
  \ 10 + the spell level + your Wisdom or Charisma bonus) or take a â€“2 penalty on\
  \ attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for\
  \ as long as they remain within the spell's area. If the spell normally dazzles\
  \ or blinds affected creatures with a duration other than instantaneous or permanent,\
  \ the duration of that effect is increased by a number of rounds equal to the spell's\
  \ original level. Saving throws to remove the effect early still apply and can bypass\
  \ this increase."
