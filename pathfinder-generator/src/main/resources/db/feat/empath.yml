description: "You have learned how to psychically sense an individual's mood or altered\
  \ mental state."
prerequisites: "Psychic Sensitivity or ability to cast psychic spells, Perception\
  \ 1 rank or Sense Motive 1 rank."
benefit: "You can use either Perception or Sense Motive when reading an emotion aura\
  \ with the read aura occult skill unlock. Reading a creature's emotion aura takes\
  \ you only a full-round action instead of 10 minutes, and if you succeed at your\
  \ check, you also determine whether that creature is currently affected by a fear\
  \ or mind-affecting effect and the relative strength of that effect (minor, moderate,\
  \ strong, as defined in detect magic). You don't learn the source of the effect\
  \ or the actual effect."
