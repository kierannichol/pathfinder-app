description: ""
prerequisites: "Bluff 1 rank, wild shape class feature, gnome."
benefit: "As a standard action, you can pantomime or describe predator- or prey-like\
  \ behavior, expend one of your uses of wild shape, and make a Bluff check. All creatures\
  \ within 30 feet that fail a Will save against your Bluff check DC regard you as\
  \ a figure of either fear or contempt (your choice applies to all affected creatures).\
  \ If you choose fear, the targets are frightened for 1 round per druid level. If\
  \ you choose contempt, the targets consider you harmless for 1 minute, ignoring\
  \ you unless you attack them or take a threatening action."
