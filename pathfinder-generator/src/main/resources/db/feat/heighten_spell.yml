prerequisites: ""
benefit: "A heightened spell has a higher spell level than normal (up to a maximum\
  \ of 9th level). Unlike other metamagic feats, Heighten Spell actually increases\
  \ the effective level of the spell that it modifies. All effects dependent on spell\
  \ level (such as saving throw DCs and ability to penetrate a lesser globe of invulnerability)\
  \ are calculated according to the heightened level."
