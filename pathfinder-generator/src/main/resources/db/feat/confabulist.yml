prerequisites: "Bluff 9 ranks, Sense Motive 9 ranks."
benefit: "When you fail to deceive someone with a Bluff check, you can immediately\
  \ attempt another version of the same basic deception against that creature at a\
  \ –5 penalty by downplaying the failed Bluff and quickly moving on to another one.\
  \ You cannot use this ability if the first Bluff was so egregious that further checks\
  \ would have been impossible (as per the Bluff skill). If you fail the second attempt,\
  \ you cannot retry the Bluff check and all further attempts to perpetrate that particular\
  \ deception are impossible."
normal: "When you fail a Bluff check against a creature, that creature is innately\
  \ suspicious. You take a –10 penalty on future attempts to deceive that creature,\
  \ or at the GM's discretion, such attempts may be impossible."
