id: "feat:familiar_bond"
name: "Familiar Bond"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Iron Will."
benefit: "You gain a familiar, as the wizard arcane bond class feature. You do not\
  \ gain the special ability the familiar normally grants its master, and the familiar\
  \ does not gain the deliver touch spells, scry on familiar, share spells, speak\
  \ with animals of its kind, or spell resistance special abilities. Otherwise, your\
  \ total Hit Dice are used as your wizard level for determining the familiar's abilities."
normal: ""
special: "If you have (or later gain) levels in a class that grants a familiar, whenever\
  \ you select a familiar, you can either base your familiar's abilities on your total\
  \ Hit Dice per this feat (including the restrictions on its special abilities),\
  \ or choose to apply only your levels in classes that grant a familiar (and thus\
  \ gain all the special abilities that familiar would grant based on those class\
  \ levels). You can never have more than one familiar."
