name: "Blood Drinker"
type: "RACIAL"
description: "Consuming blood reinvigorates you."
prerequisites: "Dhampir."
benefit: "Choose one humanoid subtype, such as “goblinoid\" (this subtype cannot be\
  \ “dhampir\"). You have acquired a taste for the blood of creatures with this subtype.\
  \ Whenever you drink fresh blood from such a creature, you gain 5 temporary hit\
  \ points and a +1 bonus on checks and saves based on Constitution. The effects last\
  \ 1 hour. If you feed multiple times, you continue to gain hit points to a maximum\
  \ of 5 temporary hit points for every three Hit Dice you have, but the +1 bonus\
  \ on Constitution-based skill checks and saving throws does not stack."
