description: ""
prerequisites: "Base attack bonus +1, medium armor proficiency."
benefit: "As a full-round action, you can shrug yourself into the largest and most\
  \ protective section of a suit of armor with which you are proficient. The armor\
  \ does not grant any magical benefits in this state, and its armor check penalty\
  \ and maximum Dexterity bonus to AC are both 2 worse than normal. When donned using\
  \ this feat, medium armor grants a +3 armor bonus, and heavy armor grants a +5 armor\
  \ bonus."
