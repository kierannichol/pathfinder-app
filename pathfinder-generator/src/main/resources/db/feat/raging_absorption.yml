name: "Raging Absorption"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You can absorb hostile spell energy to refuel your continued bloodrage."
prerequisites: "Ability to cast 2nd-level bloodrager spells, bloodrage class feature."
benefit: "While you are bloodraging, if you successfully save against a damaging arcane\
  \ spell that either targets you or includes you in its area, and you take no damage\
  \ from that spell, you can absorb a portion of its arcane energy to replenish your\
  \ bloodrage. You regain 1 round of bloodrage for every 2 levels of the spell you\
  \ successfully saved against. You cannot use this feat to regain more rounds of\
  \ bloodrage each day than your daily maximum number of rounds, nor can you ever\
  \ exceed your maximum number of rounds."
