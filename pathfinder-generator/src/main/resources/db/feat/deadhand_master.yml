id: "feat:deadhand_master"
name: "Deadhand Master"
type: "STYLE"
description: "Your death-infused punch drains life force from your foes."
prerequisites: "Wis 23, Deadhand Initiate, Deadhand Style, Improved Unarmed Strike,\
  \ Knowledge (religion) 14 ranks, ki pool class feature, nongood alignment."
benefit: "While using Deadhand Style, when you damage a living creature with an unarmed\
  \ strike, you can spend 2 points from your ki pool as a swift action to inflict\
  \ 2 temporary negative levels on your enemy with no saving throw. Effects that reduce\
  \ the ki cost also reduce the number of negative levels you inflict on your foe,\
  \ but effects that increase the ki cost do not increase the number of negative levels\
  \ you inflict. As long as the foe is affected by the temporary negative levels,\
  \ you can't recover the ki points you spent, effectively reducing the size of your\
  \ ki pool. The Fortitude save DC to remove the negative levels and prevent them\
  \ from becoming permanent is equal to 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier.\
  \ Once the negative levels become permanent or the foe removes them, you can recover\
  \ your spent ki points. If the foe dies before either happens, you can recover the\
  \ spent ki after 24 hours."
