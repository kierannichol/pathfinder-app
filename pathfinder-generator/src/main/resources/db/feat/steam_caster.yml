name: "Steam Caster"
type: "RACIAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Undine."
benefit: "You may increase the casting time of a fire spell to a full-round action,\
  \ infusing it with elemental power (spells with a casting time of 1 full-round action\
  \ or longer do not have an increased casting time). The spell is treated as if it\
  \ had the water descriptor. All fire effects of the altered spell instead manifest\
  \ as superheated steam. The altered spell works normally underwater without requiring\
  \ a caster level check. Unlike fire, the steam cannot ignite objects or set creatures\
  \ on fire. As the spell still deals fire damage, fire resistance or immunity still\
  \ applies to the spell's effects."
