type: "STYLE"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Con 15, Wis 15, Elemental Fist, Marid Style, Improved Unarmed Strike,\
  \ base attack bonus +11 or monk level 9th."
benefit: "You gain one additional Elemental Fist attempt per day. While using Marid\
  \ Style, you gain cold resistance equal to your base attack bonus, or monk level\
  \ plus base attack bonus gained from levels in classes other than monk, whichever\
  \ is higher. While denied your Dexterity bonus to AC you are also denied this resistance.\
  \ Creatures that take cold damage from your Elemental Fist attack must succeed at\
  \ a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) or become\
  \ entangled in ice for 1d4 rounds. The ice has hit points equal to three times your\
  \ base attack bonus or monk level, whichever is higher, and a break DC of 15 + your\
  \ base attack bonus or monk level, whichever is higher. Destroying or breaking the\
  \ ice ends the entangled condition."
