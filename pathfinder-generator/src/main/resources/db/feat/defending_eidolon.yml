name: "Defending Eidolon"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Shield ally feature."
benefit: "Whenever you are adjacent to your eidolon, you can choose for the eidolon\
  \ to take a –1 penalty on melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain\
  \ a +1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class. When your eidolon's base attack bonus reaches\
  \ +5, and for every +5 thereafter, the penalty increases by –1 and the dodge bonus\
  \ increases by +1. You must choose to use this feat when your eidolon is making\
  \ an attack or full-attack action with melee or natural weapons, and its effect\
  \ lasts until your eidolon's next turn, or until you are no longer adjacent to the\
  \ eidolon, whichever occurs first."
