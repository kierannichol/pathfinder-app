name: "Censoring Critical"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Critical Focus, base attack bonus +15."
benefit: "Whenever you score a critical hit against an opponent, the victim is unable\
  \ to speak for 1d4+1 rounds. This prevents spellcasters from using spells with verbal\
  \ components. A successful Fortitude saving throw reduces this muteness to 1 round.\
  \ The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus."
normal: ""
special: "You can apply the effects of only one critical feat to a given critical\
  \ hit unless you have Critical Mastery."
