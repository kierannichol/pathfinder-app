description: "Your channeled positive energy is irresistibly sweet to nearby undead."
prerequisites: "Channel positive energy class feature."
benefit: "As a standard action, you can channel positive energy to fascinate all undead\
  \ within 30 feet for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum\
  \ of 1). Undead that succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your\
  \ Charisma modifier) are unaffected. Channeling energy for this purpose does not\
  \ heal or harm creatures."
