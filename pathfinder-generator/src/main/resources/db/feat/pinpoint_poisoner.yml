id: "feat:pinpoint_poisoner"
name: "Pinpoint Poisoner"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "You deftly use specially prepared needles to apply poison for maximum\
  \ effect."
prerequisites: "Poison use class feature, Craft (alchemy) 6 ranks, Adder Strike, Improved\
  \ Unarmed Strike, Two-Weapon Fighting or flurry of blows class feature."
benefit: "When you use Adder Strike, you can instead poison up to two blowgun darts\
  \ that you can then use to strike your opponent in melee. (Drawing such darts is\
  \ a free action.) While holding these darts, you can spend a standard action to\
  \ attack with one or a full-attack action to attack with both. Such attacks are\
  \ considered melee touch attacks that deal 1d2 damage plus any bonuses you gain\
  \ on your normal unarmed strike damage, and they deliver the poison. You can instead\
  \ throw such darts as if they were shuriken, making your ranged attack rolls against\
  \ the target's AC."
normal: "Applying poison to a weapon or single piece of ammunition is a standard action."
