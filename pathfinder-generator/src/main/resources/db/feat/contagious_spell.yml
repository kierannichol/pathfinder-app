benefit: "A caster level check to dispel or remove a contagious spell that fails by\
  \ 5 or more causes it to spread from the original target to the creature that attempted\
  \ to remove it. The spell spreads to the new target regardless of its normal range\
  \ or any special targeting requirement like a melee or ranged touch attack. The\
  \ spell is treated as if you had just cast it on the new target. The new target\
  \ receives a saving throw or the benefit of spell resistance (if applicable) if\
  \ the spell normally allows it."

special: "A contagious spell can be identified normally as it is being cast with a\
