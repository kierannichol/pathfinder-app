benefit: "You can make Diplomacy and Intimidate checks to make creatures respond to\
  \ you with hostility. No matter which skill you use, antagonizing a creature takes\
  \ a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and has a DC equal\
  \ to 10 + the target's Hit Dice + the target's Wisdom modifier. You cannot make\
  \ this check against a creature that does not understand you or has an Intelligence\
  \ score of 3 or lower. Before you make these checks, you may make a Sense Motive\
  \ check (DC 20) as a swift action to gain an insight bonus on these Diplomacy or\
  \ Intimidate checks equal to your Charisma bonus until the end of your next turn.\
  \ The benefits you gain for this check depend on the skill you use. This is a mind-affecting\
  \ effect."
