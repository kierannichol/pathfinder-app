name: "Seeking Spell"
type: "METAMAGIC"
description: "You can cast spells that bend around barriers to reach their intended\
  \ destination."
prerequisites: ""
benefit: "A seeking spell's range can bend around obstacles to reach the intended\
  \ target. You can define the route yourself or unambiguously identify a target and\
  \ allow the spell to determine its own path. However, the spell fails if it would\
  \ have to travel farther than its maximum range to reach the identified target.\
  \ A ranged attack roll made to deliver a seeking spell is not subject to cover or\
  \ concealment. In order to benefit from this feat, the selected spell must have\
  \ a range greater than touch and target one or more creatures, or it must require\
  \ the caster to make a ranged touch attack."
