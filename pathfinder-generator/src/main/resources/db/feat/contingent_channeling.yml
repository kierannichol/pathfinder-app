id: "feat:contingent_channeling"
name: "Contingent Channeling"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You can imbue others with your healing energy so that they can use it\
  \ at the moment of greatest need."
prerequisites: "True healer class feature, Selective Channeling."
benefit: "You can use a standard action to touch an ally and expend one of your daily\
  \ uses of channel energy to create a repository of positive energy within that ally.\
  \ This repository contains the same number and type of dice as normal for your channel\
  \ energy feature, and it lasts for 1 minute. An ally who has such a repository can\
  \ use an immediate action to roll the repository's dice and regain a number of hit\
  \ points equal to the result. If an ally who has such a repository is reduced to\
  \ negative hit points, the repository triggers, allowing the ally to heal without\
  \ using an action."
