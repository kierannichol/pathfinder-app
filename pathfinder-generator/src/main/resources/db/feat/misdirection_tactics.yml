prerequisites: "Int 13, Combat Expertise, Deceitful, Bluff 4 ranks."
benefit: "While you are using the total defense action, if a melee attack would still\
  \ hit your AC, you can attempt a Bluff check with a DC equal to the foe's attack\
  \ roll as an immediate action. If you succeed at the check, you negate the attack\
  \ (treat it as a miss). If the attack still hits, you cannot use this feat against\
  \ the same opponent for 24 hours."
