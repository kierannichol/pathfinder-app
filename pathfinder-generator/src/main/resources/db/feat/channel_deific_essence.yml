name: "Channel Deific Essence"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Alignment Channel, channel energy 5d6, domain class feature, same\
  \ alignment as patron deity."
benefit: "As a standard action, you can expend a use of channel energy to select a\
  \ domain you have. You gain the ability associated with that domain from the invoke\
  \ deity spell for a number of rounds equal to your number of channel energy dice.\
  \ While this ability is active, taking actions directly opposed to your deity's\
  \ teachings or alignment causes you to take the penalties listed in invoke deity\
  \ and ends this effect. You can gain only one ability from this feat at a time,\
  \ and its effects do not stack with invoke deity."
