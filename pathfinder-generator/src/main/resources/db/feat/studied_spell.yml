benefit: "When casting a studied spell, designate one target affected by the spell.\
  \ Attempt an appropriate Knowledge check based on that target's creature type as\
  \ you cast the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the creature's CR based\
  \ on its race and not including any class levels or template (a creature that is\
  \ defined by class levels has an effective CR of 0 for this ability). If you succeed,\
  \ your studied spell ignores any energy resistance or damage reduction the target\
  \ has because of its race as well as any bonuses on saving throws against the spell\
  \ granted by the target's race (such as the bonus from a dwarf's hardy ability or\
  \ a halfling's halfling luck ability). Your studied spell doesn't ignore energy\
  \ resistance, damage reduction, or saving throw bonuses granted by other spells\
  \ and effects. If you fail the Knowledge check, the spell still has its normal effects."
