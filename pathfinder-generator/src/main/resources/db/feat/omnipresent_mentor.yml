prerequisites: "Cha 17, Inspiring Mentor, inspire competence bardic performance."
benefit: "By expending 4 rounds of your bardic performance at the start of the day,\
  \ you can instill one ally with your inspiring words. Select one skill in which\
  \ you possess ranks. Your ally gains the benefits of your inspire competence bardic\
  \ performance, regardless of distance, until the next time you replenish rounds\
  \ of bardic performance. This doesn't count as an active performance, so the effects\
  \ don't end if you start another performance."
