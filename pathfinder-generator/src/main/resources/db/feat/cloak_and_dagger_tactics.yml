name: "Cloak and Dagger Tactics"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Int 13, Cloak and Dagger Style, Cloak and Dagger Subterfuge, Combat\
  \ Expertise, Improved Dirty Trick, Vital Strike, Weapon Focus with the chosen weapon,\
  \ base attack bonus +16."
benefit: "While you are using Cloak and Dagger Style and wielding your chosen weapon,\
  \ whenever you hit an opponent that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC or that\
  \ you are flanking, or make an attack using Vital Strike (or its improved or greater\
  \ versions), you can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver check against that opponent\
  \ as a free action. If you succeed, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save\
  \ (DC = 10 + 1/2 your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier) or take an\
  \ additional penalty from the dirty trick selected from the following list: anchored\
  \ in place and unable to move from that square, confused, exhausted, or staggered.\
  \ This additional penalty lasts only 1 round, regardless of how long the dirty trick's\
  \ normal penalty lasts, and can be removed by the target with a standard action.\
  \ You can only attempt one free dirty trick combat maneuver check per round using\
  \ this feat."
