name: "Deep Diver"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You are accustomed to diving deeper than most would dare swim and can\
  \ do so with less risk of drowning than even other experienced swimmers."
prerequisites: "Endurance."
benefit: "You gain a +4 bonus on Acrobatics checks to reduce falling damage when diving\
  \ into water and on Perception checks in dim light or darkness underwater. When\
  \ attempting a Swim check to swim downward (at least 45 degrees down from the horizontal),\
  \ on a successful check you can swim half your speed as a move action, or your speed\
  \ as a full-round action. If you have a swim speed, it increases by 10 feet when\
  \ you spend a move action to swim only downward."
