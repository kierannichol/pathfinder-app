name: "Shield Gauntlet Style"
type: "STYLE"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Weapon Focus (gauntlet or spiked gauntlet), proficiency with bucklers\
  \ and light shields."
benefit: "When using this style, if you begin your turn wearing a gauntlet or spiked\
  \ gauntlet on your off hand, and you are not using that hand to hold or make attacks\
  \ with any other weapons or shield, you gain a +1 shield bonus to AC. You lose this\
  \ shield bonus whenever you attack with your gauntlet or hold a weapon or shield\
  \ in that hand. While receiving this shield bonus to AC, your gauntlet or spiked\
  \ gauntlet is treated as a buckler for the purpose of using other feats and abilities\
  \ (though you are also considered to have a free hand). This feat acts as the Improved\
  \ Unarmed Strike feat for the purpose of satisfying the prerequisites of the Deflect\
  \ Arrows and Snatch Arrows feats."
