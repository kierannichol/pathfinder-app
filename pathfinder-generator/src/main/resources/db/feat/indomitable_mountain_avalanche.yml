id: "feat:indomitable_mountain_avalanche"
name: "Indomitable Mountain Avalanche"
type: "STYLE"
description: "You are an impassable mountain, hurling your enemies back."
prerequisites: "Wis 15, Combat Reflexes, Improved Unarmed Strike, Indomitable Mountain\
  \ Peak, Indomitable Mountain Style, base attack bonus +9."
benefit: "If an opponent fails at a combat maneuver against you, you can use an attack\
  \ of opportunity to make a melee attack against the opponent using your highest\
  \ attack bonus. If the attack hits, instead of dealing damage, you can push the\
  \ opponent back 5 feet for every 5 by which it failed its combat maneuver check\
  \ (minimum 5 feet). Additionally, when you hit with an unarmed melee attack against\
  \ an opponent who provoked an attack of opportunity by failing its Acrobatics check\
  \ to move through a space you threaten, you can push the opponent back 5 feet instead\
  \ of dealing damage. The opponent moves back in a straight line, but stops before\
  \ hitting any obstacle or hazard."
