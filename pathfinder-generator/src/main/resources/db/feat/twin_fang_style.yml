description: "Your paired blades rend through armor."
prerequisites: "Dex 15, Quick Draw, Two-Weapon Fighting, base attack bonus +1, Acrobatics\
  \ 1 rank."
benefit: "Each time you make a full attack wielding a pair of daggers or a pair of\
  \ kama and hit a creature with both weapons, you reduce its armor bonus to AC by\
  \ 1 until the beginning of your next turn. This reduction stacks to a minimum armor\
  \ bonus of +0. For example, if you hit a creature wearing a chain shirt with two\
  \ primary attacks and two off-hand attacks, you would reduce its armor bonus to\
  \ AC from +4 to +2."
