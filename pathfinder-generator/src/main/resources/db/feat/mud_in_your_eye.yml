id: "feat:mud_in_your_eye"
name: "Mud in Your Eye"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Throw Anything."
benefit: "As a standard action when in urban or subterranean terrain, you can scoop\
  \ filth, sewage, mud, or similar grime off a nearby surface and hurl it at a foe\
  \ as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 5 feet. If the attack hits,\
  \ you can immediately attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against the target as\
  \ a free action; this dirty trick can be used only to blind the target. As a ranged\
  \ touch attack, this action provokes attacks of opportunity, even if your dirty\
  \ trick attempts normally wouldn't provoke such attacks (such as via the Improved\
  \ Dirty Trick feat)."
normal: ""
special: "A character with favored terrain (as the ranger class feature) can use this\
  \ feat when in any of his favored terrains in addition to urban and subterranean."
