type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Phantom class feature, spiritualist level 15th."
benefit: "Three times per day, as a standard action while it is fully manifested,\
  \ your phantom can attempt to enter and take control of a living creature; doing\
  \ so provokes an attack of opportunity. A creature can resist this influence with\
  \ a successful Will save (DC = 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma\
  \ modifier). A phantom can maintain this control for 1 minute per spiritualist level\
  \ you have, but the victim is allowed a new saving throw each minute."
