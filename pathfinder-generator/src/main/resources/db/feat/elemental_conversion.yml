type: "GENERAL"
description: "You can infuse your elemental spells with primal magic."
prerequisites: ""
benefit: "Once per day, when you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, electricity,\
  \ or fire damage, you can infuse the spell with primal magic and transform its elemental\
  \ energy at random. After you cast the spell but before its effects are resolved,\
  \ roll 1d4 to determine the new element (1 = acid, 2 = cold, 3 = electricity, 4\
  \ = fire). If you are in an area where primal magic is predominant, you can instead\
  \ use this ability once per hour."
