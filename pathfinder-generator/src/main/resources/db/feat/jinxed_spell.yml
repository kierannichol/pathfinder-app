id: "feat:jinxed_spell"
name: "Jinxed Spell"
type: "METAMAGIC"
description: "You can make a creature that fails its spell save suffer your jinx as\
  \ well."
prerequisites: "Any two metamagic feats, Halfling Jinx alternate racial trait."
benefit: "Any creature that fails its saving throw against a jinxed spell also suffers\
  \ the effects of your jinx. This feat has no effect on spells that do not allow\
  \ a saving throw. If the spell affects an area or multiple creatures, you must select\
  \ one creature to take the jinx, unless you have the Area Jinx feat; if you have\
  \ the Area Jinx feat, choose a jinx burst area within the spell's area or among\
  \ its targets and apply the jinx to those in the burst that failed their save."
