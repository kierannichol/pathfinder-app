id: "feat:bounding_hammer"
name: "Bounding Hammer"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "You can throw a hammer so it rebounds near you."
prerequisites: "Proficiency with hammer, base attack bonus +6."
benefit: "As a standard action, you may throw a hammer at an opponent within 20 feet.\
  \ If you hit (whether or not the attack damages the target), the hammer rebounds\
  \ off of the creature and lands in your square. If you have the Snatch Arrows feat,\
  \ you may choose to catch the hammer when it enters your square (though this does\
  \ not give you the ability to immediately throw the hammer). This ability may not\
  \ work against some creatures or in certain circumstances as determined by the GM;\
  \ for example, your weapon does not bounce off Incorporeal creatures (unless it\
  \ has the ghost touch ability), it may stick to creatures with the adhesive ability,\
  \ the slowing effect of fighting underwater prevents you from using this feat, and\
  \ so on."
normal: "A thrown weapon drops in the square where it hits your target."
