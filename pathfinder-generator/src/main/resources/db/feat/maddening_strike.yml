description: ""
prerequisites: "Wis 17, Cha 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, Maddening Style, Stunning\
  \ Fist, Knowledge (arcana) 8 ranks, ki pool class feature, nongood alignment."
benefit: "As a swift action, you can spend 1 point from your ki pool to imbue the\
  \ next unarmed strike you make on this turn with the maddening power of the spaces\
  \ between the stars. If that attack doesn't hit, you take 2 points of Wisdom damage.\
  \ If the attack hits, your opponent takes damage from your unarmed strike + 1d4+1\
  \ points of Wisdom damage. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character\
  \ level + your Wisdom modifier) reduces this to 2 points of Wisdom damage."
normal: ""
special: "If you are using the sanity system, when you miss with a Maddening Strike,\
  \ you take 4 points of sanity damage. If you hit, the target takes damage from the\
  \ unarmed strike plus 8 points of sanity damage (or 4 points of sanity damage on\
  \ a successful Will save)."
