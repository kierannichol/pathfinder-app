type: "GENERAL"
description: "Using the same divine energy as your lay on hands ability, you can heal\
  \ others at a distance."
prerequisites: "Lay on hands class feature."
benefit: "You may use your lay on hands to heal another creature at a range of 30\
  \ feet as a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You\
  \ must be able to speak and have a free hand to use this ability. The target heals\
  \ half the amount they would have healed if you had touched them, but gains the\
  \ benefits of your mercies as normal."
