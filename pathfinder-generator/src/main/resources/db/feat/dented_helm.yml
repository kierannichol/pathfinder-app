id: "feat:dented_helm"
name: "Dented Helm"
type: "RACIAL"
description: "Your helm protects you from hard hits."
prerequisites: "Hard-Headed, base attack bonus +6, dwarf."
benefit: "When wearing a helmet, you add +1 to your AC against critical hit confirmation\
  \ rolls. When a critical hit is confirmed against you, as an immediate action, you\
  \ can apply half of the damage from the attack to your helmet rather than yourself,\
  \ applying hardness as normal. If the damage destroys your helmet, any leftover\
  \ damage is applied to you. After using this feat, you are staggered until the end\
  \ of your next turn. You may not use this feat if your helmet has the broken condition\
  \ or the attack ignores armor bonuses to AC."
