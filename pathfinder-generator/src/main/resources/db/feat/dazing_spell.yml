name: "Dazing Spell"
type: "METAMAGIC"
description: ""
prerequisites: ""
benefit: "You can modify a spell to daze a creature damaged by the spell. When a creature\
  \ takes damage from this spell, they become dazed for a number of rounds equal to\
  \ the original level of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful\
  \ save negates the daze effect. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can\
  \ make a Will save to negate the daze effect. If the spell effect also causes the\
  \ creature to become dazed, the duration of this metamagic effect is added to the\
  \ duration of the spell."
