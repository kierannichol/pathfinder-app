type: "GENERAL"
description: "You can glean the interests of others and use that information to strengthen\
  \ your rhetoric."
prerequisites: "Int 19, Ironclad Logic, Diplomacy 5 ranks, Sense Motive 5 ranks."
benefit: "When you use Diplomacy to change the attitude of a character, you can first\
  \ attempt a Sense Motive check against that NPC to get a hunch, to determine whether\
  \ the character is under the influence of an enchantment, to use Sense Assumptions,\
  \ or to determine biases for a verbal duel. If you succeed at the Sense Motive check,\
  \ you gain a +2 bonus on the Diplomacy check, and if you learned any biases for\
  \ a verbal duel, you learn one additional bias of your choice. You do not worsen\
  \ an NPC's attitude if you fail a Diplomacy check by 5 or more."
