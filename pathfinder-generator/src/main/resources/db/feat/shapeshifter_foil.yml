prerequisites: "Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks or Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks, ability\
  \ to use any polymorph effect."
benefit: "A creature you deal damage to has difficulty using or maintaining polymorph\
  \ effects until the end your next turn. To use a polymorph effect it must make a\
  \ concentration check (DC 15 + twice the level of the effect). If you deal damage\
  \ to an opponent under a polymorph effect, that opponent must succeed at a Will\
  \ saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier) or be forced\
  \ back to its original form. If you score a critical hit against such an opponent,\
  \ no saving throw is allowed."
