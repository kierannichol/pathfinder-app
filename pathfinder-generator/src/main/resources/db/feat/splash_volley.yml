id: "feat:splash_volley"
name: "Splash Volley"
type: "TEAMWORK"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Base attack bonus +1."
benefit: "You initiate this feat whenever you throw a splash weapon into a square\
  \ within the reach of an ally who also has this feat and miss your target. Rather\
  \ than you rolling to see where the weapon lands, the abettor can try to redirect\
  \ it as an immediate action by making a melee touch attack against any adjacent\
  \ foe. If the abettor's attack hits that foe, the splash weapon impacts in the nearest\
  \ square the targeted foe occupies."
