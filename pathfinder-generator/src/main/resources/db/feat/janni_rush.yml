id: "feat:janni_rush"
name: "Janni Rush"
type: "STYLE"
description: "When you leap to the attack, your blows are like bolts from on high."
prerequisites: "Improved Unarmed Strike, Janni Style, Janni Tempest, Acrobatics 8\
  \ ranks, Perform (dance) 8 ranks."
benefit: "While using Janni Style, you are always considered to have a running start\
  \ when jumping. Further, if you jump as part of a charge and make an unarmed strike\
  \ against the designated opponent, a hit allows you to roll the unarmed strike's\
  \ damage dice twice and add the results together before adding modifiers (such as\
  \ from Strength) or extra dice (such as precision-based damage or dice from weapon\
  \ abilities). The extra damage dice are not multiplied on a successful critical\
  \ hit."
