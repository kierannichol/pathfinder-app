id: "feat:brute_assault"
name: "Brute Assault"
type: "STYLE"
description: "With brute force, you can bowl over and cripple opponents by treading\
  \ on them."
prerequisites: "Str 23, Int 13, Brute Stomp, Brute Style, Combat Reflexes, Improved\
  \ Overrun, Improved Trip, Improved Unarmed Strike, Vicious Stomp, base attack bonus\
  \ +10."
benefit: "While using Brute Style, when you successfully perform an overrun or trip\
  \ combat maneuver against an opponent that causes that opponent to fall prone, your\
  \ opponent takes 1d6 points of Strength damage, and its base speed is halved until\
  \ the Strength damage is healed. A successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your base\
  \ attack bonus) reduces the Strength damage to 1 point and negates the movement\
  \ speed reduction."
