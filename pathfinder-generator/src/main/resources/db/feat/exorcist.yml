id: "feat:exorcist"
name: "Exorcist"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You can stagger incorporeal and possessed creatures through sheer force\
  \ of will."
prerequisites: "Iron Will, can't have a patron deity."
benefit: "As a full-round action, you can recite the Laws of Man with such force and\
  \ dedication that you stagger those creatures that prey upon the bodies, minds,\
  \ and souls of mortals. When you use this ability, you must target one creature\
  \ within 30 feet to which you have line of sight. A successful Will save (DC = 10\
  \ + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) negates the effects of this feat."
