name: "Chilling Amplification"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "Your cold spells render their targets sluggish."
prerequisites: ""
benefit: "Whenever you cast a spell with the cold descriptor, you can take a â€“1 penalty\
  \ on attack rolls made with the spell and reduce the spell saving throw's DC by\
  \ 1 to cause any target that is dealt cold damage by the spell to have its movement\
  \ speed reduced by 5 feet and become unable to take 5-foot steps. This effect lasts\
  \ for 1 round + 1 round per 3 spell levels of the spell. You must choose to use\
  \ this feat before making an attack roll or before your targets attempt their saving\
  \ throws. This feat has no effect on spells that neither allow a saving throw nor\
  \ require an attack roll."
