name: "Linnorm Wrath"
type: "STYLE"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, Linnorm Style, Linnorm Vengeance,\
  \ base attack bonus +9 or monk level 9th."
benefit: "When you use the Linnorm Vengeance feat to allow an enemy to hit you, you\
  \ can make a retaliatory unarmed strike attack against that opponent as an immediate\
  \ action. This acts as an attack of opportunity, and counts against the number of\
  \ attacks of opportunity you can make each round. Additionally, once per day when\
  \ a melee attack deals enough damage to knock you unconscious or kill you, the attacker\
  \ must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level +\
  \ your Wisdom modifier) or be stunned for 1 round. This save occurs after you make\
  \ the retaliatory unarmed strike granted by the Linnorm Vengeance feat."
