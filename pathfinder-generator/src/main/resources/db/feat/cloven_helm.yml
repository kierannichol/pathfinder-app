name: "Cloven Helm"
type: "RACIAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Dented Helm, Hard-Headed, base attack bonus +11, dwarf."
benefit: "When wearing a helmet, you add +1 to your AC against critical hit confirmation\
  \ rolls; this benefit stacks with Dented Helm. When you use Dented Helm to deflect\
  \ a critical hit, you may apply all damage from the critical hit to your helmet\
  \ before applying any damage to yourself. If you take no damage, any additional\
  \ effects, such as critical feats or poison, are negated."
