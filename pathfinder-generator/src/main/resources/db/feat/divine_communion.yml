name: "Divine Communion"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "Your close, personal connection with your deity grants you insight into\
  \ his or her wishes."
prerequisites: "Wisdom 13, alignment must match that of your worshiped deity."
benefit: "Once per day as a swift action, you can ponder whether or not your deity\
  \ would approve or disapprove of a particular course of action, and whether that\
  \ action would impact your alignment. The GM decides if the action is one your deity\
  \ would approve of, and if it is, you gain an insight bonus equal to your Wisdom\
  \ modifier (minimum of +1) on any d20 roll made in association with that action\
  \ during this round. For every 3 ranks you have in Knowledge (religion), you can\
  \ use this ability an additional time per day, to a maximum of 6 times a day."
