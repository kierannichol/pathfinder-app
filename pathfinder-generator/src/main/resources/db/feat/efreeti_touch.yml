name: "Efreeti Touch"
type: "STYLE"
description: "Your knowledge of the secrets of the burning wind and blazing sun allows\
  \ you to collect flames into your hands and unleash them in a gout of elemental\
  \ fire."
prerequisites: "Con 15, Wis 17, Efreeti Style, Efreeti Stance, Elemental Fist, Improved\
  \ Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +13 or monk level 11th."
benefit: "While using Efreeti Style, as a standard action, you can spend two Elemental\
  \ Fist attempts to unleash a 15-foot cone-shaped burst of flame. Creatures caught\
  \ in the cone take your unarmed strike damage plus the fire damage from your Elemental\
  \ Fist and catch on fire. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level\
  \ + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from catching\
  \ on fire."
