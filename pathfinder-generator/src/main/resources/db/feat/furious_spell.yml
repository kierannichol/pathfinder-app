name: "Furious Spell"
type: "METAMAGIC"
description: "Your spells seethe with the ferocious intensity of your blood-red rage."
prerequisites: ""
benefit: "A furious spell that deals hit point damage adds twice the spell's original\
  \ level to the amount of damage dealt by the spell. Spells that affect multiple\
  \ targets deal the extra damage once to each target, regardless of whether the spell\
  \ deals its damage all at once or in multiple hits (in the latter case, add the\
  \ extra damage to the first hit against each target). In addition, a furious spell\
  \ can be cast while the caster is enraged, including during a barbarian rage or\
  \ while affected by a rage spell. Even a furious spell that requires an emotion\
  \ component can be cast while enraged. The caster gains a +2 circumstance bonus\
  \ on concentration checks and caster level checks related to casting a furious spell\
  \ if she is enraged."
