prerequisites: "Int 13, Knowledge (engineering) 2 ranks"
benefit: "When you take this feat, select two metamagic feats you do not yet have.\
  \ When casting a spell, you can perform the steps below to spontaneously apply the\
  \ effects of either or both of these metamagic feats, as well as any other metamagic\
  \ feats you have, to the spell without expending a higher-level spell slot. Using\
  \ a feat in this way increases the spell's casting time to the casting time it would\
  \ take if the character were a sorcerer or bard (sorcerers and bards using this\
  \ ability increase the spell's casting time by two categories); applying the Quicken\
  \ Spell metamagic effect negates the increased casting time but still contributes\
  \ to the modified spell's effective spell level. You can take this feat more than\
  \ once; each time, select two additional metamagic feats, adding their effects to\
  \ the list of possible effects you can apply to spells with this ability."
