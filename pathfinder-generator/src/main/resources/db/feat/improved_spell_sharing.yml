name: "Improved Spell Sharing"
type: "TEAMWORK"
description: "Your link with your companion creature allows you to share your magic\
  \ with it."
prerequisites: "Ability to acquire an animal companion, eidolon, familiar, or special\
  \ mount."
benefit: "When you are adjacent to or sharing a square with your companion creature\
  \ and that companion creature has this feat, you can cast a spell on yourself and\
  \ divide the duration evenly between yourself and the companion creature. You can\
  \ use this feat only on spells with a duration of at least 2 rounds. For example,\
  \ you could cast bull's strength on yourself, and instead of the spell lasting 1\
  \ minute per level on yourself, it lasts 5 rounds per level on yourself and 5 rounds\
  \ per level on your companion."
