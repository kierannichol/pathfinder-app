id: "feat:shaitan_earthblast"
name: "Shaitan Earthblast"
type: "STYLE"
description: "With a forceful stomp you release a blast of acid from the earth to\
  \ burn your enemies."
prerequisites: "Con 15, Wis 17, Elemental Fist, Improved Unarmed Strike, Shaitan Skin,\
  \ Shaitan Style, base attack bonus +13 or monk level 11th."
benefit: "While using the Shaitan Style feat, as a standard action, you can spend\
  \ two Elemental Fist attempts to unleash a 20-foot column of acid that has a 5-foot\
  \ radius and erupts from a point of origin within 30 feet of you. Creatures caught\
  \ in the column take your unarmed strike damage plus the acid damage from your Elemental\
  \ Fist and are staggered for 1 round. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your\
  \ character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a\
  \ target from being staggered"
