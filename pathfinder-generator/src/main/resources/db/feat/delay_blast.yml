name: "Delay Blast"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You can delay your kinetic blasts."
prerequisites: "Base attack bonus +3, kinetic blast class feature."
benefit: "When you use a kinetic blast, you can specify a number of rounds between\
  \ 1 and 5. When that number of rounds has passed, the kinetic blast takes effect\
  \ at the beginning of your turn. In the interim, you can take a standard action\
  \ that provokes attacks of opportunity to cause the blast to take effect earlier\
  \ than you initially selected. If you delay another blast while you already have\
  \ a delayed blast pending, the previous delayed blast dissipates harmlessly."
