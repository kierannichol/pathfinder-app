id: "feat:blinding_flash"
name: "Blinding Flash"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "You can temporarily blind your opponent by using your weapon or shield\
  \ to flash sunlight into its eyes."
prerequisites: "Dex 13, Combat Expertise."
benefit: "As a move action, you can expertly angle the blade of your weapon or shield\
  \ to reflect light into an opponent's eyes, dazzling your foe for 1 round. This\
  \ feat functions as a gaze attack, and the target must make a Fortitude save (DC\
  \ 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Dex modifier) to resist the effect. This\
  \ is a sight-dependent effect, and does not work on creatures that are already blinded\
  \ or creatures that do not rely on sight as their primary sense. You must be wielding\
  \ a weapon or shield with a polished or reflective surface in order to use this\
  \ feat. You must be in an area of bright light to use this feat."
