prerequisites: "Inspiration class feature, keen recollection class feature."
benefit: "Choose two skills that you either are trained in or can otherwise use untrained.\
  \ You must be able to use inspiration on these skills. When you use inspiration\
  \ with those skills, roll a d8 instead of a d6, or a d10 if you would normally roll\
  \ a d8. If you have the true inspiration class feature, you roll twice as many such\
  \ dice (2d8 or 2d10) as normal."
