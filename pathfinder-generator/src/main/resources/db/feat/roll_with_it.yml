name: "Roll With It"
type: "COMBAT"
description: "You know how to take a hit, even if your reaction sends you bouncing\
  \ and flying out of battle while shrieking at the top of your lungs."
prerequisites: "Goblin, Acrobatics 1 rank."
benefit: "If you are struck by a melee weapon you can try to convert some or all of\
  \ that damage into movement that sends you off in an uncontrolled bouncing roll.\
  \ To do so, you must make an Acrobatics check (DC = 5 + the damage dealt from the\
  \ attack) as an immediate action. If you succeed in this check, you take no damage\
  \ from the actual attack but instead convert that damage into movement with each\
  \ point equating to 1 foot of movement."
