name: "Planar Wild Shape"
type: "GENERAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Wild shape class feature, Knowledge (planes) 5 ranks."
benefit: "When you use wild shape to take the form of an animal, you can expend an\
  \ additional daily use of your wild shape class feature to add the celestial template\
  \ or fiendish template to your animal form. (Good druids must use the celestial\
  \ template, while evil druids must use the fiendish template.) If your form has\
  \ the celestial template and you score a critical threat against an evil creature\
  \ while using your form's natural weapons, you gain a +2 bonus on the attack roll\
  \ to confirm the critical hit. The same bonus applies if your form has the fiendish\
  \ template and you score a critical threat against a good creature."
