name: "Energized Wild Shape"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "Your wild shape form gains the benefits of one energy type for both\
  \ offensive and defensive purposes."
prerequisites: "Wis 19, base attack bonus +6, wild shape class feature."
benefit: "When you assume a wild shape form, choose one of the following energy types:\
  \ acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You gain resistance 10 to that energy type.\
  \ Also, one of your natural attacks deals an additional 1d6 points of damage of\
  \ the chosen energy type. If you choose a wild shape form that already has energy\
  \ resistance of the same type you choose, it increases by 5 instead. If you choose\
  \ a wild shape form that deals damage of the same energy type you choose, increase\
  \ the energy damage you deal by one die size (1d6 becomes 1d8, and so on)."
