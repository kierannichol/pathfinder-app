description: "You turn knowledge of your enemy into a flawless defense."
prerequisites: "Int 13, Kirin Strike, Kirin Style, Improved Unarmed Strike, Knowledge\
  \ (arcana) 12 ranks, Knowledge (dungeoneering, local, nature, planes, or religion)\
  \ 5 ranks."
benefit: "Whenever you make a Knowledge check to identify a creature, even when using\
  \ Kirin Style, you can take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent\
  \ you from doing so. While using Kirin Style against a creature you have identified\
  \ using that feat, if the creature ends its turn within your threatened area, you\
  \ can spend a use of your attacks of opportunity that round to move up to 5 feet\
  \ times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). You must end your move in a square\
  \ threatened by the creature. This move does not provoke attacks of opportunity."
