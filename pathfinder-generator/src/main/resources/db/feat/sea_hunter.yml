name: "Sea Hunter"
type: "RACIAL"
description: "Your blows knock swimming opponents off balance."
prerequisites: "Combat Expertise, merfolk."
benefit: "When you make a successful melee attack against a swimming target, as a\
  \ free action you can attempt to knock the target off balance. Treat this as a trip\
  \ combat maneuver. If you succeed, the target is considered off balance (see Table:\
  \ Combat Adjustments Underwater) until it recovers its balance, usually by making\
  \ a Swim check on its turn. This feat has no effect on creatures with a swim speed,\
  \ those using magic such as freedom of movement, and creatures that can't be tripped."
