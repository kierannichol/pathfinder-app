id: "feat:force_dash"
name: "Force Dash"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You can absorb the magic in your force spells to give you a concentrated\
  \ burst of speed."
prerequisites: "Base attack bonus +4, ability to cast 2nd-level arcane spells, ability\
  \ to cast at least one arcane force spell."
benefit: "As a swift action, you can sacrifice a prepared arcane force spell (or if\
  \ you are a spontaneous caster, a spell slot of the same level as an arcane force\
  \ spell you know) to give yourself an enhancement bonus to speed. The bonus gained\
  \ is equal to 10 feet × the level of the spell sacrificed. The bonus applies to\
  \ all forms of movement, and it lasts 1 round. If you charge while this bonus is\
  \ in effect, you do not take the normal –2 penalty to AC until the start of your\
  \ next turn."
