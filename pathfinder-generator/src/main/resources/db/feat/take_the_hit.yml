prerequisites: "Bonded Mind, base attack bonus +6."
benefit: "As long as an ally with the Bonded Mind feat is adjacent to you, you can\
  \ choose to absorb up to half of the hit point damage from any attack that strikes\
  \ him, as if subject to a shield other spell. Using this ability is an immediate\
  \ action, and it only applies to one attack, even if the ally is hit by multiple\
  \ attacks as part of the same action."
