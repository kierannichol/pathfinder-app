name: "Evolved Summoned Monster"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "The creatures you summon have evolved to have even greater abilities."
prerequisites: "Augment Summoning, Spell Focus (conjuration), ability to cast summon\
  \ monster I."
benefit: "Each time you cast a summon monster spell, you can select a 1-point evolution\
  \ other than pounce or reach from those available to a summoner's eidolon. Your\
  \ summoned creature gains this evolution. The summoned creature must conform to\
  \ any limitations of the evolution. (For instance, only a creature with a reach\
  \ of 10 feet or more can have the pull evolution.) Evolutions that grant additional\
  \ attacks or enhance existing attacks can be applied only to Medium or larger summoned\
  \ creatures."
normal: ""
special: "You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, select an additional\
  \ 1â€“point evolution for one of your summoned creatures. If you summon more than\
  \ one creature, you can choose to apply all the evolutions to a single summoned\
  \ creature, or split them between the creatures summoned."
