id: "feat:unyielding_ferocity"
name: "Unyielding Ferocity"
type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Con 19, ferocity"
benefit: "When you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, if you remain conscious from\
  \ your ferocity monster ability, you can make a full attack on your next turn (or\
  \ your current turn if you are reduced to 0 hit points on your own turn). If you\
  \ do, you push your body to the point that your mind becomes more primitive, and\
  \ you can no longer use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills\
  \ except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, or Ride, or any ability that requires patience\
  \ or concentration (such as spellcasting) until your hit points are raised above\
  \ 0."
normal: "When using the ferocity ability, you are staggered while you have fewer than\
  \ 0 hit points and thus can't make a full attack."
