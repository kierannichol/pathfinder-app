type: "COMBAT"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Str 25, Throw Anything or rock throwing, Improved Bull Rush, size\
  \ Large or larger."
benefit: "As a standard action, you can perform the awesome throw combat maneuver.\
  \ You do this by making a thrown weapon attack; if you don't have the Throw Anything\
  \ feat, you must use a large, bulky, and relatively regular-shaped object with a\
  \ hardness of at least 5 (such as a rock or treasure chest). If that attack hits\
  \ a corporeal opponent smaller than you, the opponent takes damage and is knocked\
  \ away, flying 10 feet in a straight line away from you and falling prone. If an\
  \ obstacle prevents the completion of your target's move, the target and the obstacle\
  \ each take 1d6 points of damage, and the target is knocked prone in a space adjacent\
  \ to the obstacle."
