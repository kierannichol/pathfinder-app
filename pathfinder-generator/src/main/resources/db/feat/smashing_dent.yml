description: ""
prerequisites: "Str 13, Improved Sunder, Smashing Crush, Smashing Style, Weapon Focus\
  \ with the chosen weapon, base attack bonus +6."
benefit: "While using Smashing Style, each time you damage a suit of armor with a\
  \ sunder combat maneuver, you reduce its armor bonus to its Armor Class by 1 and\
  \ increase its armor check penalty by 1. Armor cannot have its armor bonus to AC\
  \ reduced to less than 50% of its normal bonus or its armor check penalty more than\
  \ doubled. These reductions and increases both end when the damage dealt by the\
  \ sunder is repaired."
