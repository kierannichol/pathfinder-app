id: "feat:wrest_charge"
name: "Wrest Charge"
type: "GENERAL"
description: "You can extract a charge from otherwise depleted technology."
prerequisites: "Disable Device 5 ranks, Knowledge (engineering) 5 ranks"
benefit: "With a successful DC 20 Disable Device check, you can jury-rig a depleted\
  \ (but not destroyed) battery so it provides 1 more charge. Using this charge or\
  \ failing your check by 5 or more permanently depletes the battery. You can attempt\
  \ the same check to add 1 last charge to a discharged piece of timeworn technology.\
  \ Regardless of the outcome, no other attempts can be made, even by another person.\
  \ Using this feat takes 1 minute. You can attempt to wrest a charge as a move action\
  \ by taking a â€“10 penalty on your check. This feat does not stack with the charge\
  \ cycling deed."
