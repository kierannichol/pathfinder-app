benefit: "You may cause an instantaneous spell that affects an area to persist until\
  \ the beginning of your next turn. Those already in the area suffer no additional\
  \ harm, but other creatures or objects entering the area are subject to its effects.\
  \ A lingering spell with a visual manifestation obscures vision, providing concealment\
  \ (20% miss chance) beyond 5 feet and total concealment (50% miss chance) beyond\
  \ 20 feet."
