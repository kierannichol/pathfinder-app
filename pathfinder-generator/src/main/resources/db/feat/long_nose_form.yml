name: "Long-Nose Form"
type: "RACIAL"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Character level 3rd, tengu."
benefit: "Once per day, you can assume the form of a human whose nose is the length\
  \ of your beak. This spell-like ability functions as alter self with a caster level\
  \ equal to your level. While in this form you gain the scent ability and a +2 bonus\
  \ to your Strength score. Because your long nose in this form clearly indicates\
  \ you are not fully human, you do not gain the normal bonus to Disguise checks for\
  \ using a polymorph effect (however, you could possibly explain the nose as an unfortunate\
  \ curse or deformity, or hide it with an item such as a plague doctor's mask)."
