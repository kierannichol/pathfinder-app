type: "COMBAT"
description: "With a sly maneuver, you force a grappled opponent into the path of\
  \ an incoming attack."
prerequisites: "Dex 13, Improved Grapple, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus\
  \ +6."
benefit: "As an immediate action while you are grappling an adjacent creature, you\
  \ can make a grapple combat maneuver check against that creature to gain cover against\
  \ a single attack. If you are successful and the attack misses you, that attack\
  \ targets the creature you used as cover, using the same attack roll. You cannot\
  \ use this feat against a creature grappling you, and the cover you gain ends after\
  \ the attack you gained cover against is resolved."
