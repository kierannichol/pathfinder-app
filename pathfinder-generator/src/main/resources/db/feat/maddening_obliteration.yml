name: "Maddening Obliteration"
type: "STYLE"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Wis 19, Cha 15, Improved Unarmed Strike, Maddening Strike, Maddening\
  \ Style, Stunning Fist, Knowledge (arcana) 10 ranks, ki pool class feature, nongood\
  \ alignment."
benefit: "When you damage a living creature with an unarmed strike while using Maddening\
  \ Style, and you have at least 1 point in your ki pool, that creature suffers a\
  \ â€“2 penalty on saving throws against any confusion, madness, and insanity effects\
  \ (including your Maddening Strike) for 1 round. Additionally, if you reduce a creature\
  \ to fewer than 0 hit points with a Stunning Fist attack, you can spend 2 points\
  \ from your ki pool as a free action to obliterate your opponent, reducing their\
  \ body to fine dust as per disintegrate. A living creature can attempt a Fortitude\
  \ save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier) to negate this\
  \ effect."
normal: ""
special: "If you are using the sanity system, when you miss with a Maddening Strike,\
  \ you take 4 points of sanity damage. If you hit, the target takes damage from the\
  \ unarmed strike plus 8 points of sanity damage (or 4 points of sanity damage on\
  \ a successful Will save)."
