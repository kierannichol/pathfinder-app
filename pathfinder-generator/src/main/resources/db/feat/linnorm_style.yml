type: "STYLE"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +3 or monk level\
  \ 3rd."
benefit: "While using this style, you take a â€“2 penalty to your AC against melee attacks.\
  \ After a creature makes a melee attack against you, you can choose to add your\
  \ Wisdom bonus to the damage from your unarmed strikes against that creature, rather\
  \ than your Strength bonus. If you can normally add your Dexterity bonus to the\
  \ attack's damage, you can instead replace it with your Wisdom bonus. This lasts\
  \ until the beginning of the target creature's next turn."
