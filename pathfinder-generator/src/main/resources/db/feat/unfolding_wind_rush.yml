id: "feat:unfolding_wind_rush"
name: "Unfolding Wind Rush"
type: "STYLE"
description: "Thrown weapons fly from your hands as if blown by a gale, and you leave\
  \ behind a wake of wind as you move."
prerequisites: "Dex 13, Wis 13, Mobility, Perfect Style, Quick Draw, Unfolding Wind\
  \ Strike, base attack bonus +13 or monk level 13th."
benefit: "When using Perfect Style and wielding thrown weapons, you can combine a\
  \ full attack action with a single move action. You must forgo the attack at your\
  \ highest bonus but may take the remaining attacks as normal at any point during\
  \ your movement. You can spend 1 ki point as a swift action to create a path of\
  \ wind along your path of movement that functions as wind wall for 1 round; this\
  \ effect does not affect your ranged attacks."
