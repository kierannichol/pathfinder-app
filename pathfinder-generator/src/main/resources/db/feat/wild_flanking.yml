type: "TEAMWORK"
description: ""
prerequisites: "Power Attack, base attack bonus +4."
benefit: "When you are flanking an opponent with an ally who also possesses this feat,\
  \ you can throw yourself into your attacks in such a way that your opponent takes\
  \ extra damage, at the risk of these attacks striking your ally as well. When you\
  \ choose to use this feat, check the results of your attack roll against both your\
  \ opponent's AC and your ally's AC. If you hit your opponent, you deal bonus damage\
  \ as though you were using Power Attack. If you hit your ally, the ally takes no\
  \ damage from your attack except this bonus damage. It is possible to hit both your\
  \ enemy and your abettor with one attack. Extra damage from this feat stacks with\
  \ Power Attack."
