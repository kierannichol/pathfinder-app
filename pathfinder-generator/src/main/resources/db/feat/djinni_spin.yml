name: "Djinni Spin"
type: "STYLE"
description: "You can surround yourself with the power of the storm, spinning like\
  \ a hurricane to unleash a violent blast of electrical energy."
prerequisites: "Con 15, Wis 17, Djinni Style, Djinni Spirit, Elemental Fist, Improved\
  \ Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +13 or monk level 11th."
benefit: "While using Djinni Style, as a standard action you can spend two Elemental\
  \ Fist attempts to surround yourself with a whirlwind of electrified air. Creatures\
  \ adjacent to you take your unarmed strike damage plus the electricity damage from\
  \ your Elemental Fist and are deafened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save\
  \ (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half\
  \ and prevents a target from being deafened."
