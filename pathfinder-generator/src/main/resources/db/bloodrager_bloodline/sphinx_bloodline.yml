    \ (1d4 if you are Small) plus your Strength modifier. At 4th level, these claws\
    \ are considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.\
    \ At 8th level, the damage increases to 1d8 points (1d6 if you are Small). At\

    \ roar must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the bloodrager's character\
    \ level + his Charisma modifier) or become frightened for 1d6 rounds. At 10th\
    \ level, the bloodrager can instead cause the targets to be panicked or stunned\
    \ (bloodrager's choice) and deafened for the duration; at 16th level, the bloodrager\
    \ can instead cause the targets to be paralyzed for 1 round. Whether or not the\
    \ save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of the bloodrager's roar\
