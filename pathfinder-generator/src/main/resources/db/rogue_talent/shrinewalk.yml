type: "SP"
description: "A rogue with shrinewalk can create her own shrine simply by designating\
  \ an area in any urban region by placing a unique marking or rune on a wall or the\
  \ ground. This marking is not magical, and if it is defaced or erased, it can no\
  \ longer be used by the rogue (the marking can be hidden from view without removing\
  \ its usability, including painting over the marking in question). Once placed,\
  \ the rogue can use word of recall once per day to return to the shrine. A rogue\
  \ can maintain one shrine at a time; if a new marking is created in a new location,\
  \ the previous shrine becomes inactive."
