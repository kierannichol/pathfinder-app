description: "As a full-round action, the rogue can move up to her speed. If she successfully\
  \ reaches a location that offers her cover or concealment, any creature observing\
  \ her must attempt a Perception check opposed by the rogueâ€™s Stealth check. On a\
  \ failed check, the observer loses track of the rogue and fails to note where she\
  \ moved to. The rogue does not take a penalty on this Stealth check for moving up\
  \ to her speed."
