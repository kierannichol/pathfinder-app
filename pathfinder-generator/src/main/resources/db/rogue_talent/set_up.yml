description: "When you successfully hit a target with a sneak attack in melee, you\
  \ can choose to forgo your additional sneak attack damage to make the target more\
  \ vulnerable to one of your allies adjacent to it. The first melee attack that ally\
  \ makes against the target before the beginning of your next turn treats the target\
  \ as flanked, even if your ally is not flanking the target. This has no effect on\
  \ creatures you could not flank with that ally, even if the ally was properly positioned."
