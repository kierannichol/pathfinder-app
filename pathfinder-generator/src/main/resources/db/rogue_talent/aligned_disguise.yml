description: "When you use the disguise self spell-like ability, you can also alter\
  \ your alignment aura to deceive spells that discern alignment (such as detect evil)\
  \ for the duration of the disguise self effect. You can choose to detect as any\
  \ specific alignment, or to detect as no alignment at all. This ability does not\
  \ protect against spells or effects that cause harm based on alignment."
