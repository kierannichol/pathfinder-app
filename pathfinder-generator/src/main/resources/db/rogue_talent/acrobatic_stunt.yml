type: "EX"
description: "Once per day, when flanked by at least two opponents, a rogue with this\
  \ talent can, as an immediate action when any of the threatening opponents attacks\
  \ her, attempt an Acrobatics check against the highest CMD of the threatening creatures\
  \ plus 2 per threatening creature beyond the second. If successful, the rogue may\
  \ take a 5-foot step in any direction, so long as she remains within the reach of\
  \ the attacker triggering the movement. The rogueâ€™s final position is used to determine\
  \ whether the attacker benefits from flanking. On a failed check, the rogue falls\
  \ prone in her original position and the attack resolves as normal (the opponent\
  \ gains a +4 bonus for attacking a prone target)."
