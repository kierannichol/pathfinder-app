description: "As a swift action, you can expend a mote of movement to teleport some\
  \ part of a creatures body into the closest empty square chose by the jaunter, this\
  \ deals 1d6 points of damage + 1d6 points of damage for every two rogue class levels.\
  \ A successful Will Save (DC 10+1/2 the rogueâ€™s class level + her Charisma modifier)\
  \ results in half damage. The actual damage type is subject to GM determination\
  \ but the default is slashing, resulting from a portal slicing off a portion of\
  \ the victims exterior, a failed save usually resulting in more internal injury\
  \ but it is still subject to Damage Reduction unless it is overcome by magic and\
  \ slicing weapons."
