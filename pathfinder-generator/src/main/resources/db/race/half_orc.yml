description: "Often fierce and savage, sometimes noble and resolute, half-orcs can\
  \ manifest the best and worst qualities of their parent races. Many half-orcs struggle\
  \ to keep their more bestial natures in check in order to epitomize the most heroic\
  \ values of humanity. Unfortunately, many outsiders see half-orcs as hopeless abominations\
  \ devoid of civility, if not monsters unworthy of pity or parley."
