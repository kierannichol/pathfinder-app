description: "Often caught between the worlds of their progenitor races, half-elves\
  \ are a race of both grace and contradiction. Their dual heritage and natural gifts\
  \ often create brilliant diplomats and peacemakers, but half-elves are often susceptible\
  \ to an intense and even melancholic isolation, realizing that they are never truly\
  \ part of elven or human society."
