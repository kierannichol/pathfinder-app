description: "Tall, noble, and often haughty, elves are long-lived and subtle masters\
  \ of the wilderness. Elves excel in the arcane arts. Often they use their intrinsic\
  \ link to nature to forge new spells and create wondrous items that, like their\
  \ creators, seem nearly impervious to the ravages of time. A private and often introverted\
  \ race, elves can give the impression they are indifferent to the plights of others."
