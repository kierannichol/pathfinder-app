description: "These short and stocky defenders of mountain fortresses are often seen\
  \ as stern and humorless. Known for mining the earthâ€™s treasures and crafting magnificent\
  \ items from ore and gemstones, they have an unrivaled affinity for the bounties\
  \ of the deep earth. Dwarves also have a tendency toward traditionalism and isolation\
  \ that sometimes manifests as xenophobia."
