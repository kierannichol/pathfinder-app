name: "Bestow Auras"
description: "You transfer one or more of your paladin or antipaladin auras (such\
  \ as aura of courage and aura of resolve) to another creature. You retain the personal\
  \ effect of that aura, but the target becomes the center of the aura effect instead\
  \ of you. For example, if you transfer your aura of courage, you remain immune to\
  \ fear, but the target becomes the center of the aura that grants a +4 morale bonus\
  \ on saves against fear effects. If an aura functions only when you are conscious,\
  \ the transferred aura functions only when the target is conscious. If an aura functions\
  \ only when you expend uses of another ability (such as with aura of justice or\
  \ aura of vengeance), the transferred aura functions only if the target has that\
  \ other ability and expends uses of it to activate the aura."
