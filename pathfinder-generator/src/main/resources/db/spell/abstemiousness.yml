description: "Sometimes Irori smiles on his worshipers, granting them a reprieve from\
  \ physical hunger. This spell magically enhances a handful of simple food, imbuing\
  \ it with enough nutrition to satisfy a Medium or smaller creature for a full day.\
  \ The spell does not create food, and thus will not alone prevent someone from starving,\
  \ but it can extend even limited reserves for lengthy periods."
