name: "Fractions of Heal and Harm"
description: "This spell channels a portion of the next spell you cast into magic\
  \ that heals you. The next instantaneous area damage spell of 3rd level or lower\
  \ that you cast deals only 75% of its damage, but heals you of a number of hit points\
  \ equal to the remaining 25% of the spell's damage. For example, if you cast this\
  \ spell and followed it with a fireballthat would normally deal 40 hit points of\
  \ damage, the fireballinstead deals 30 hit points of damage and heals you of 10\
  \ hit points of damage. The spell affected by this spell must be cast before the\
  \ end of your next turn. This spell has no effect on spells that do not deal damage\
  \ or spells higher than 3rd level. This healing is treated as if you had been affected\
  \ by a cure or inflict spell (whichever would heal you), and is treated as the same\
  \ spell level as the area-affecting spell for the purpose of effects that relate\
  \ to the spell level of cure or inflict spells."
