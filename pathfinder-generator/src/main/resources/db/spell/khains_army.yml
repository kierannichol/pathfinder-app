description: "Originally created by the priest-king of Nemret Noktoria, the ghoul\
  \ Kortash Khain, for use by his minions to bolster their forces in battles against\
  \ their enemies, Khain's army has become a favorite of many necromancers throughout\
  \ Osirion and beyond. By scattering a handful of ghoul's teeth across the ground,\
  \ you cause 1d4+1 ghouls led by a single ghast to rise up from the ground around\
  \ you. The ghouls and their ghast leader must appear in squares adjacent to you,\
  \ but after that they follow your spoken commands unerringly."
