description: "You purge impure thoughts from the target's mind and fill him with exultant\
  \ relief at the forgiveness of his sins. Absolution ends all charm or compulsion\
  \ effects affecting the target (including harmless compulsions, such as heroism)\
  \ as per break enchantment. If the target was forced to perform any actions contrary\
  \ to his alignment, monk vows, paladin oath, or similar code of conduct by that\
  \ charm or compulsion effect, that action doesn't cause him to lose access to class\
  \ abilities, including divine spellcasting."
