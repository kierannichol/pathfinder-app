  \ 2d6 points of damage. The points are permanently lost until the target's limb\
  \ is restored by heal, limited wish, miracle, regenerate, or wish. Wither limb affects\
  \ only living creatures of the humanoid or monstrous humanoid type, or similar bipedal\
  \ creatures at the GM's discretion. You choose the limb affected. This spell's effects\
  \ stack, until all a target's arms and legs (or equivalent limbs) are withered."
