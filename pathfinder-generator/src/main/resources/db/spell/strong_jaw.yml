description: "Laying a hand upon an allied creature's jaw, claws, tentacles, or other\
  \ natural weapons, you enhance the power of that creature's natural attacks. Each\
  \ natural attack that creature makes deals damage as if the creature were two sizes\
  \ larger than it actually is. If the creature is already Gargantuan or Colossal-sized,\
  \ double the amount of damage dealt by each of its natural attacks instead. This\
  \ spell does not actually change the creature's size; all of its statistics except\
  \ the amount of damage dealt by its natural attacks remain unchanged."
