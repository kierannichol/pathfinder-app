description: "You cause the target's flesh to exude a layer of putrescent slime so\
  \ foul that the target is sickened (Fortitude negates) for the duration of the spell\
  \ and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. All creatures within 20 feet also become sickened\
  \ (Fortitude negates), and remain sickened for as long as they remain within 20\
  \ feet of the target and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. A creature that strikes the\
  \ target with a bite attack must succeed at an additional save or become nauseated\
  \ for 1d4 rounds. Creatures immune to poison are unaffected."
