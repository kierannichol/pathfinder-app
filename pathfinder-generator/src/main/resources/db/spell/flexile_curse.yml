name: "Flexile Curse"
description: "You curse your target with a withering aura that degrades its armor\
  \ and shield (if any). This reduces the hardness, armor bonus, and enhancement bonus\
  \ of any armor or shield worn by the target by 1. For every hour the target wears\
  \ a suit of armor or a shield, the hardness, armor bonus, and enhancement bonus\
  \ are reduced by an additional 1. If the armor or shield's hardness is reduced to\
  \ 0, anytime the target of the curse is struck while wearing that item, there is\
  \ a 20% chance that it gains the broken condition. If the enhancement bonus of magic\
  \ suit of armor or shield is reduced to 0, the armor or shield loses any other special\
  \ abilities it had."
