name: "Imprisonment"
description: "When you cast imprisonment and touch a creature, it is entombed in a\
  \ state of suspended animation (see the temporal stasis spell) in a small sphere\
  \ far beneath the surface of the ground. The subject remains there unless a freedom\
  \ spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search\
  \ by a crystal ball, a locate object spell, or some other similar divination does\
  \ not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but discern location does.\
  \ A wish or miracle spell will not free the recipient, but will reveal where it\
  \ is entombed. If you know the target's name and some facts about its life, the\
  \ target takes a â€“4 penalty on its save."
