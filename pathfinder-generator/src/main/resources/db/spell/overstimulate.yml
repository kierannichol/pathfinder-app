description: "You deprive a creature of the blissful oblivion of unconsciousness,\
  \ either to keep it going despite grievous injuries or to prolong its suffering.\
  \ For the duration of the spell, the target gains the ferocity ability (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Bestiary 300), allowing it to remain conscious and continue fighting even\
  \ if its hit point total is below 0. The target is still staggered and loses 1 hit\
  \ point each round, and the target still dies when its hit point total reaches a\
  \ negative amount equal to its Constitution score."
