description: "You draw upon your elven link to the wilderness to change the coloration\
  \ of yourself and your equipment to match that of your surroundings. This grants\
  \ you a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks and allows you to make Stealth checks\
  \ without cover or concealment, but only while you move no more than half your base\
  \ speed or less. If you move more than half your base speed on your turn, you gain\
  \ no benefit from this spell until the start of your next turn. If you make an attack,\
  \ this spell ends (as invisibility)."
