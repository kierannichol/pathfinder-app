name: "Iron Spine"
description: "You launch an ingot of iron at the target. If you succeed at a ranged\
  \ touch attack, the target's skeleton or exoskeleton turns into jagged shards of\
  \ cold iron. Whenever the target moves, it takes 1d6 points of piercing damage and\
  \ is sickened for 1 round as metal spines stab into its flesh. This damage is subject\
  \ to damage reduction, but it overcomes damage reduction as though it were a weapon\
  \ of cold iron and magic. A creature affected by this spell can choose to remain\
  \ motionless to avoid taking damage. Creatures with DR/cold iron or DR/cold iron\
  \ and magic affected by this spell are nauseated instead of sickened. This spell\
  \ has no effect on a creature that has neither a skeleton nor a hard carapace."
