name: "Desperate Weapon"
description: "You create a one-handed object that you might expect to see in your\
  \ current surroundings, which you can then use as an improvised weapon. The spell\
  \ conjures such an object near your hand such that you can retrieve it as you complete\
  \ the spell. No matter what sort of object you picked, it functions as a one-handed\
  \ improvised weapon appropriate for your size and that deals 1d6 points of damage\
  \ for a Medium creature (1d4 for Small creatures). The item deals the type of damage\
  \ you choose (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing) when casting the spell, though\
  \ the object you request must conform to the damage type."
