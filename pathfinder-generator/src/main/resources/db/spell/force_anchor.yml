name: "Force Anchor"
description: "You conjure an anchor of pure force that immediately skewers your target\
  \ on a successful ranged touch attack. If it hits, the attack deals the target 1d4\
  \ points of force damage per 2 caster levels (max 5d4) and the anchor becomes firmly\
  \ lodged in the target's torso. The anchor has no weight, but its wide flukes prevent\
  \ the target from moving through any space smaller than the creature's size. The\
  \ anchor also prevents incorporeal targets from moving through solid objects. Whenever\
  \ the target moves through a square occupied by another creature, the square counts\
  \ as 2 squares for the purpose of calculating movement, even if the square's occupant\
  \ is the target's ally."
