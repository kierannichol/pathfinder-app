description: "Cold iron shackles materialize around the target's limbs, reducing each\
  \ of the target's movement speeds by half. Any flying target has its maneuverability\
  \ worsened by two steps (from good to poor, for example, to a minimum of clumsy\
  \ maneuverability). Additionally, if the target has DR/cold iron or DR/cold iron\
  \ and magic, it is unable to use supernatural or spell-like means of movement (such\
  \ as dimension door, teleport, or tree meld) for the duration of the spell."
