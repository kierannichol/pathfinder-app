description: "You cover a solid surface with a layer of sticky glue. Anyone in the\
  \ area when the spell is cast must attempt a Reflex save. Those who fail become\
  \ entangled, but can break free by succeeding at a combat maneuver check or an Escape\
  \ Artist check as a standard action against the DC of this spell. The area of the\
  \ spell is considered difficult terrain. A creature moving through the glue must\
  \ succeed at a combat maneuver check or an Escape Artist check as part of its move\
  \ action (DC = the spell's DC). Creatures that fail lose their movement and become\
  \ entangled in the first square they enter."
