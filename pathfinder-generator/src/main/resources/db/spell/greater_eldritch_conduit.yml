description: "This spell functions like eldritch conduitsave for the differences listed\
  \ above and that the target must be within medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)\
  \ in order for you to use the conduit. Using a creature as a conduit for a spell\
  \ ends the greater eldritch conduit effect on that creature, but does not end the\
  \ effect for other eldritch conduits."
