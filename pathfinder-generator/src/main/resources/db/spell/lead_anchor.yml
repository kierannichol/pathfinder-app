name: "Lead Anchor"
description: "The target's buoyancy becomes and stays swiftly sinking, regardless\
  \ of how dense the target and its gear are. Among other effects, the target can\
  \ walk on the bottom, but she also needs to succeed at a DC 20 Swim check to swim\
  \ towards the surface and to stay above the bottom (see Buoyancy on page 43). This\
  \ makes lead anchor a useful spell both for exploring the sea floor and for drowning\
  \ an air-breathing foe in the water."
