description: "You steal the target's face, transforming yourself into a flawless imitation\
  \ of it. All of the target's facial features, vocal cues, and identifying physical\
  \ traits change, transforming it into an unremarkable member of its race and gender.\
  \ You transform into a perfect likeness of the target's true form, as if affected\
  \ by alter self, and gain a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate the original\
  \ subject of this spell; you take no penalties on this check if the original target\
  \ is of a different race, age, size, or gender."
