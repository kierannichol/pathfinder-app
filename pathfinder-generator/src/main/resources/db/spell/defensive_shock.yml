description: "Electrical energy floods your body, shocking the next creature that\
  \ touches you. Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon takes\
  \ 1d6 points of electricity damage per two caster levels (maximum 6d6). If the attacker\
  \ has spell resistance, it applies against this damage. Each time the spell discharges,\
  \ the number of damage dice it deals is halved (rounded down); when the spell's\
  \ damage dice reach 0, the spell ends."
