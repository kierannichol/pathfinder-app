description: "When you are struck by an opponent's natural attacks, the damage is\
  \ resolved as if the attack came from a creature one size smaller per 5 caster levels\
  \ (maximum of four size categories smaller at CL 20th). Refer to Table 3â€“1 in the\
  \ Pathfinder RPG Bestiary to determine an attack's altered base damage. If the creature's\
  \ natural attack deals nonstandard damage, refer instead to the Improved Natural\
  \ Attack feat on page 315 of the Bestiary. It is not possible to reduce the base\
  \ damage of a creature's natural attack below 1d2 with this spell."
