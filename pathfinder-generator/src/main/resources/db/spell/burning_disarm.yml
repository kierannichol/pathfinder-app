name: "Burning Disarm"
description: "This spell causes a metal object to instantly become red hot. A creature\
  \ holding the item may attempt a Reflex save to drop it and take no damage (even\
  \ if it is not their turn), otherwise the hot metal deals 1d4 points of fire damage\
  \ per caster level (maximum 5d4). Circumstances that prevent the creature from dropping\
  \ the item (such as a locked gauntlet) mean the creature gets no saving throw. The\
  \ heat does not harm the item, and it does not get hot enough or last long enough\
  \ to ignite flammable objects. The item cools to its previous temperature almost\
  \ instantly. If cast underwater, burning disarm deals half damage and boils the\
  \ surrounding water."
