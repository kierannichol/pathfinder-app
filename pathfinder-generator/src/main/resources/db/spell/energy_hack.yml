description: "You can cast this spell only when you take 10 or more points of acid,\
  \ cold, electricity, or fire damage from a spell or spell-like ability--this spell\
  \ has the same energy descriptors as the damaging effect. When you use a spell or\
  \ spell-like ability with the acid, cold, electricity, or fire descriptor or use\
  \ an arcanist exploit, arcane school power, bloodline power, magus arcana, or hex\
  \ that deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, you can choose to change the\
  \ energy type and descriptor to match one of the descriptors of energy hack. Any\
  \ other effect of that spell or power remains the same."
