description: "This spell functions as create demiplane, except the area is larger\
  \ and you can add more features to the plane. You can use this spell to expand a\
  \ demiplane you created with lesser create demiplaneor create demiplane(you do not\
  \ need to create an entirely new plane using this spell), in which case it has a\
  \ duration of 1 day/level. Alternatively, when cast within your demiplane, you may\
  \ add to your demiplane (or remove from it) one of the following features (or any\
  \ of the features described in create demiplane) with each casting of the spell,\
  \ in which case it has an instantaneous duration."
