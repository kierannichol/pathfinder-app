name: "Cyclic Reincarnation"
description: "This spell allows a dead creature that died no more than 1 year before\
  \ the casting of the spell to return to life in a body that closely resembles its\
  \ original body; it functions as reincarnate except as noted. Cyclic reincarnation\
  \ returns the dead creature to life in a new body of the same race that the target\
  \ belonged to in life, and the new body appears physically similar to the creature's\
  \ previous one, to the extent that the creature could be easily mistaken for its\
  \ own offspring or kin. If the affected creature isn't a humanoid, there is a 75%\
  \ chance that the creature returns to life as a youth of its race, gaining the young\
  \ creature simple template instead (or becomes a juvenile, in the case of dragons\
  \ and other creatures whose power is determined by their age category)."
