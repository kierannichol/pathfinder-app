name: "Wall of Ice"
description: "This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice,\
  \ depending on the version selected. A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied\
  \ by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when\
  \ created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex\
  \ save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that\
  \ the spell automatically fails. Fire can melt a wall of ice, and it deals full\
  \ damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly\
  \ melting a wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes."
