description: "You cause a creature's arm to waver and prevent it from striking another\
  \ creature. You can cast this spell when the target is about to make a melee attack\
  \ against another creature. On a failed saving throw, the target does not follow\
  \ through with its attack, and its entire action is wasted for the round. On a successful\
  \ saving throw, the target can make its attack, forcing its strike though the compulsion\
  \ but losing both accuracy and power, taking a –5 penalty on its attack and damage\
  \ rolls. Whether or not the target makes its initial save or not, it is subject\
  \ to a –2 penalty on attack and damage rolls against the creature it originally\
  \ targeted for the duration of the spell."
