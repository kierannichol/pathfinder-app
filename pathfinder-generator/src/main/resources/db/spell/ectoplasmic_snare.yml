name: "Ectoplasmic Snare"
description: "You unleash a writhing tendril of ectoplasm to grapple or entangle a\
  \ target creature. You must make a ranged touch attack to strike a target. If you\
  \ hit, the target can attempt a Reflex save. On a successful save, the target is\
  \ entangled for the duration of the spell and suffers no other effects. If the target\
  \ fails this saving throw, the tendril is more restrictive, making the target grappled\
  \ and dealing it 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage. Each round when you concentrate\
  \ to maintain the spell, the snare attempts a grapple combat maneuver check to maintain\
  \ the grapple. As normal when grappling, the snare gains a +5 bonus on grapple combat\
  \ maneuver checks against opponents it is already grappling. The snare's CMB is\
  \ equal to 6 + your caster level, and its CMD is equal to 16 + your caster level.\
  \ Since the ectoplasm passes between planes, this spell affects incorporeal and\
  \ ethereal creatures normally."
