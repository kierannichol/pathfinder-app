name: "Summon Laborers"
description: "Summon laborers summons one humanoid petitioner per caster level. These\
  \ petitioners hail from one plane of your choice and perform tasks at your direction.\
  \ The petitioners cannot fight or travel to dangerous lands, but do assist your\
  \ downtime activities (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign 8 4) within a settlement,\
  \ increasing the effect of Influence or Labor you spend by 50%, to a maximum of\
  \ 1 additional point of Influence or Labor for every 2 caster levels you possess.\
  \ This stacks with any increase to the effect of Influence or Labor that you receive\
  \ from your followers within the settlement where the downtime activity takes place\
  \ (if any). Summon laborers is a spell of the same alignment type as the plane from\
  \ which the summoned petitioners hail (chaotic and evil for the Abyss, lawful and\
  \ good for Heaven, and so on). Effects that increase the number of creatures summoned\
  \ by a spell (such as Superior SummoningUM) do not affect summon laborers."
