description: "The next time the target sleeps (within the next 8 hours), she dreams\
  \ of a rich feast with her favorite foods and drinks. When she awakens, she is sated\
  \ as if she had eaten a nutritious meal, regardless of what she dreamed she ate.\
  \ The target must sleep for at least 1 hour to gain the benefits of this spell.\
  \ Being awakened during this period interrupts the spell and cancels its effects."
