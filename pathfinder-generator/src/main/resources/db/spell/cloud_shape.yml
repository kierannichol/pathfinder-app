name: "Cloud Shape"
description: "This spell functions like gaseous form, except you assume the shape\
  \ of a Colossal cloud with a space of 30 feet. You choose the general appearance\
  \ of the cloud (white, stormy, fluffy, flat, and so on), after which your appearance\
  \ cannot be changed. Even the closest inspection cannot reveal that the cloud in\
  \ question is actually a magically concealed creature. To all normal tests you are,\
  \ in fact, a cloud, although a detect magicspell reveals a moderate transmutation\
  \ aura on the cloud. Your fly speed in cloud form is 30 feet."
