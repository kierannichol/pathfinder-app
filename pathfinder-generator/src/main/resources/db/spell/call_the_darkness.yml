    Effect: "This ritual must be cast on the Material Plane. The primary caster begins\
      \ the ritual by delineating the boundaries of the area to be affected using\
      \ the black diamond dust. The casters link hands and chant verses from Zon-Kuthon's\
      \ holy book, Umbral Leaves. Upon the ritual's completion, magical darkness fills\
      \ the designated area as the Material Plane and Shadow Plane blend together\
      \ there. The affected area thereafter exists simultaneously on both planes,\
      \ becoming an amalgam of the two. A thin layer of impenetrable darkness surrounds\
      \ the affected area, so it is impossible to see beyond the area's boundaries\
      \ into either plane. Colors appear faded in the area, but not completely black\
      \ and white as on the Shadow Plane. The area has the enhanced magic and impeded\
      \ magic traits of the Shadow Plane, but all other planar traits correspond to\
      \ those of the Material Plane. As long as the primary caster remains within\
      \ range of the designated area, this effect lasts for up to 10 minutes per character\
      \ level of the primary caster, but if the primary caster ever moves beyond the\
      \ range, the effect immediately ends."
