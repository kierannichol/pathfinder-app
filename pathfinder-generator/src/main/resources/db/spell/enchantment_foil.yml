description: "You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against enchantment effects. If\
  \ you succeed at a save against an enchantment effect, you identify the effect as\
  \ if you had succeeded at a Spellcraft check to do so. Furthermore, you can choose\
  \ to act as if you had failed your saving throw. If you do so, you gain a +20 bonus\
  \ on Bluff checks to convince others that you failed your save and are under the\
  \ enchantment's effects. A creature that attempts to use magic to detect this ruse\
  \ or to make you speak truthfully about it must succeed at a caster level check\
  \ (DC 15 + your caster level) to do so."
