description: "You bind spirits of ill fate to an object, focusing their wrath onto\
  \ the next creature that touches the object. When a creature touches the target\
  \ object, it can attempt a Will save to negate the spell's effect. Although a successful\
  \ save prevents the creature from becoming haunted, the haunt still resides within\
  \ the object, and targets either the next creature to touch the object or the same\
  \ creature again if it still holds the object after 24 hours. The haunt remains\
  \ within the object until a creature fails its save or the spell's duration ends."
