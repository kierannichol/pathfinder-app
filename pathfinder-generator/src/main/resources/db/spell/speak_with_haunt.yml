description: "You stir a haunt (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 242) to a limited\
  \ sense of awareness and consciousness, allowing it to answer questions. The spell's\
  \ range must reach any square within 10 feet of the haunt's area. You must be aware\
  \ of the haunt prior to casting the spell, and casting the spell does not trigger\
  \ the haunt. You can ask one question per 2 caster levels. The haunt's knowledge\
  \ is limited to what its original creature knew during life, including the languages\
  \ it spoke. A haunt often remembers the circumstance that led to its existence (though\
  \ this recollection might be from the original victim's perspective and therefore\
  \ not objective), what triggers it, and how it can be laid to rest (destroyed).\
  \ Answers are brief, cryptic, or repetitive, especially if the haunt is angry and\
  \ vindictive."
