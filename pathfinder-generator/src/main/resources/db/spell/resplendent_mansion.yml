description: "This spell creates a towering mansion. While casting the spell, you\
  \ hold an image of the mansion and its desired appearance in your mind. The mansion\
  \ can contain as many or as few rooms as you desire, and is decorated to match your\
  \ image. You can imagine a purpose for each room of the mansion, and the proper\
  \ accouterments appear within. Any furniture or other mundane fixtures function\
  \ normally for anyone inside the mansion, but cease to exist if taken beyond its\
  \ walls. No fixture created with this spell can create magical effects, but magical\
  \ devices brought into the mansion function normally."
