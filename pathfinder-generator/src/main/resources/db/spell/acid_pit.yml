name: "Acid Pit"
description: "This spell functions as create pit, except that it places a 5-foot-deep\
  \ pool of acid at the bottom of the pit. The pit has a maximum depth of 100 feet.\
  \ Creatures who fall into the pit take falling damage as normal (the acid counts\
  \ as a yielding surface), plus 2d6 points of acid damage per round spent in contact\
  \ with the acid. In addition, exposed items carried by a creature in the pit may\
  \ be harmed. Refer to Table 9â€“2: Items Affected by Magical Attacks (Core Rulebook216).\
  \ Items are affected one at a time in the order listed on the table, and must make\
  \ Fortitude saves after 3 consecutive rounds in the acid or gain the broken condition.\
  \ Objects with the broken condition (regardless of how they became broken) must\
  \ make a Fortitude saving throw each round spent within the acid or be destroyed.\
  \ The walls of the pit are quite slippery and have a Climb DC of 30."
