name: "Blood Mist"
description: "This spell summons forth a misty cloud of rust-red toxic algae. Any\
  \ creature within the mist is coated by it, turning the creature the same reddish\
  \ color. All targets within the mist gain concealment. Any creature within the mist\
  \ must save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage and become enraged, attacking any\
  \ creatures it detects nearby (as the â€œattack nearest creature\" result of the confused\
  \ condition). An enraged creature remains so as long as the spell is in effect.\
  \ A creature only needs to save once each time it is within the mist (though leaving\
  \ and returning requires another save)."
