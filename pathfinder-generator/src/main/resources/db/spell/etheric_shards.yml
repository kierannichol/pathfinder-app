name: "Etheric Shards"
description: "You harden interpenetrated ethereal substance into deadly transdimensional\
  \ razors that are invisible to normal sight. Movement through an area of etheric\
  \ shards is halved, even for incorporeal creatures, and creatures entering a 5-foot\
  \ cube filled with etheric shards take 1d8 points of piercing and slashing damage\
  \ and must succeed at a Reflex save or take 1 point of bleed damage. This bleed\
  \ damage stacks with itself and other sources of bleed damage. A creature standing\
  \ within an area of etheric shards takes no damage as long as it remains completely\
  \ motionless, but even the minor movements involved in attacking or defending in\
  \ combat force a stationary creature to attempt a Reflex save. If a stationary creature\
  \ succeeds at this save, it avoids damage completely for that round, but if it fails,\
  \ it takes hit point damage and bleed damage as though it had moved through the\
  \ square."
