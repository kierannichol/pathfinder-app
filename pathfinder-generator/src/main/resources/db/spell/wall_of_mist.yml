name: "Wall of Mist"
description: "With a whispered incantation, you conjure a stationary vertical wall\
  \ of misty vapor. The wall is straight, is 1 foot thick, and has a length up to\
  \ 10 feet per caster level. The wall obscures vision, granting concealment (20%\
  \ miss chance) against creatures on the other side of the wall. A creature that\
  \ shares a square with the wall counts as being on neither side of the wall and\
  \ neither benefits nor suffers from the concealment."
