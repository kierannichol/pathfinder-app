description: "You animate a rope, vine, or similar object so that it attempts to trip\
  \ any creature that comes near. The rope attacks anything in a 10-foot-square area\
  \ you designate. The rope does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Its CMB is\
  \ equal to your caster level +2. A tripped target that was running, jumping, or\
  \ charging takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Creatures aware of the tripvine\
  \ gain a +4 bonus to their CMD against it."
