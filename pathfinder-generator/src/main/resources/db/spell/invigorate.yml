description: "This spell banishes feelings of weariness. For the duration, the subject\
  \ takes no penalties from the fatigued or exhausted conditions. The effect of invigorateis\
  \ merely an illusion, however, not a substitute for actual rest or respite. When\
  \ the spell ends, the subject takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage, along with the\
  \ return of the original condition(s). A creature can be under the effects of only\
  \ one invigoratespell at a time; if it is cast a second time on that creature, the\
  \ first effect immediately ends."
