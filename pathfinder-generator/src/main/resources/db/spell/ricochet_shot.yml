name: "Ricochet Shot"
description: "You imbue a projectile weapon with the ability to ricochet any projectiles\
  \ that hit one target so that they also hit another. When the wielder ricochets\
  \ a projectile, she selects a primary target to attack. If she hits the primary\
  \ target, the projectile ricochets instead of being destroyed. The wielder can then\
  \ select a secondary target that is within 20 feet of the primary target. She makes\
  \ an attack roll against the secondary target at the same base attack bonus, but\
  \ does not gain the benefit from any enhancement bonuses or magic qualities on the\
  \ projectile. If the shot comes from a firearm, the ricochet targets normal AC rather\
  \ than touch AC."
