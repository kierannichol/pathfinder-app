description: "The target becomes smarter. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus\
  \ to Intelligence, adding the usual benefits to Intelligence-based skill checks\
  \ and other uses of the Intelligence modifier. Wizards (and other spellcasters who\
  \ rely on Intelligence) affected by this spell do not gain any additional bonus\
  \ spells for the increased Intelligence, but the save DCs for spells they cast while\
  \ under this spell's effect do increase. This spell doesn't grant extra skill ranks."
