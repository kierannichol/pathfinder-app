description: "This spell protects the target's soul by briefly enveloping the target\
  \ in an ethereal vault. The target gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against spells\
  \ and effects that would trap or redirect its soul (such as magic jar, soul bind,\
  \ and trap the soul) and effects that would transform the target into an undead\
  \ creature. The target is granted a save to negate such effects even if one is not\
  \ normally allowed. If it's cast on a living creature that then dies, the target's\
  \ body and spirit are protected by the spell for its duration. If it's cast on a\
  \ corpse within 1 round of death, the target's body and soul are both protected.\
  \ Otherwise, only the body receives the protection."
