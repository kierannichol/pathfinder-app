description: "You call upon the wild winds of the Abyssal atmosphere, howling with\
  \ the screams of damned and demented souls in torment. The area is filled with winds\
  \ of windstorm strength (Core Rulebook 439), blowing in a random direction each\
  \ round. Creatures within the area of effect are deafened as long as they remain\
  \ within the area and for 1d4 rounds thereafter; however, they continue to hear\
  \ the sounds of screams in their minds with painful intensity, causing them to become\
  \ shaken for as long as they remain deafened. A successful Will save negates the\
  \ shaken condition but not the deafness."
