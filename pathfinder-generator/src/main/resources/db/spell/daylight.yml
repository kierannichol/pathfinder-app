description: "You touch an object when you cast this spell, causing the object to\
  \ shed bright light in a 60-foot radius. This illumination increases the light level\
  \ for an additional 60 feet by one step (darkness becomes dim light, dim light becomes\
  \ normal light, and normal light becomes bright light). Creatures that take penalties\
  \ in bright light take them while within the 60-foot radius of this magical light.\
  \ Despite its name, this spell is not the equivalent of daylight for the purposes\
  \ of creatures that are damaged or destroyed by such light."
