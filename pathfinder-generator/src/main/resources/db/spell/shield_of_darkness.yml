description: "You shield yourself with darkness, reducing the illumination level in\
  \ your space to magical darkness and granting you total concealment. Your opponents\
  \ are automatically aware of which squares you occupy, preventing you from attempting\
  \ Stealth checks using this concealment unless every square adjacent to you has\
  \ an illumination level of darkness or lower. Shield of darkness does not hinder\
  \ your vision, and creatures that can see in magical darkness ignore this effect."
