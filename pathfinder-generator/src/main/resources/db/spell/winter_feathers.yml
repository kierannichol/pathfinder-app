name: "Winter Feathers"
description: "The target's feathers thicken and fluff up to ward against winter's\
  \ chill. The target suffers no harm from being in a cold environment, and can exist\
  \ comfortably in conditions as low as â€“50 degrees Fahrenheit without having to make\
  \ Fortitude saves. The creature's equipment is likewise protected. This spell doesn't\
  \ provide any protection from cold damage, nor does it protect against other environmental\
  \ hazards associated with cold weather (such as slipping on ice, blindness from\
  \ snow, and so on)."
