description: "When you cast this spell, you merge with an adjacent natural stone surface,\
  \ forming a 5-foot pocket within. If the stone surface does not have enough volume\
  \ to safely contain a 5-foot sphere of empty space, the spell fails. When created,\
  \ there is sufficient air within the pocket for up to one Medium creature to survive\
  \ for the spell's duration, including one additional Tiny or smaller creature, such\
  \ as a familiar. At the end of the spell's duration, you are immediately expelled\
  \ into the nearest available open space adjacent to the surface you merged with."
