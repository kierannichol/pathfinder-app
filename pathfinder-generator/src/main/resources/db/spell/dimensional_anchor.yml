description: "A green ray springs from your hand. You must make a ranged touch attack\
  \ to hit the target. Any creature or object struck by the ray is covered with a\
  \ shimmering emerald field that completely blocks extradimensional travel. Forms\
  \ of movement barred by a dimensional anchor include astral projection, blink, dimension\
  \ door, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, gate, maze, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport,\
  \ and similar spell-like abilities. The spell also prevents the use of a gate or\
  \ teleportation circle for the duration of the spell."
