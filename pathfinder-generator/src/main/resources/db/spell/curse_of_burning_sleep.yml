description: "You place a curse upon the target that triggers 1 hour after the next\
  \ time it falls asleep. When the curse is triggered, the creature bursts into flame,\
  \ taking 1d6 points of fire damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 8d6). Furthermore,\
  \ it catches on fire, taking 2d6 points of fire damage per round at the end of its\
  \ turn each round until the creature dies or is quenched as normal (Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Core Rulebook 444). If the target is still asleep, the fire damage from this spell\
  \ wakes it."
