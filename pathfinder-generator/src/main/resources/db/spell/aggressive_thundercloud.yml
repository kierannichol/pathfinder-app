description: "A crackling, spherical storm cloud flies in whichever direction you\
  \ point and deals electricity damage to those it strikes. It has a fly speed of\
  \ 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. If it enters a space that contains a creature,\
  \ the storm stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of electricity damage\
  \ to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. It provides\
  \ concealment (20% miss chance) to anything within it, and its flickering light\
  \ illuminates the same area a candle would."
