description: "You pin the target's shadow to its current location, causing the target\
  \ to become entangled and preventing it from moving farther than 5 feet from its\
  \ original position, as if its shadow were anchored to the terrain. Each round on\
  \ its turn, the target can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a full-round\
  \ action. A flying creature can only hover in place or fall while entangled in this\
  \ manner. This spell automatically fails when cast on a creature that doesn't throw\
  \ a shadow, and it ends if the creature is entirely in an area with no illumination."
