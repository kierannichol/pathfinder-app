  \ is not multiplied in the case of a critical hit. This effect immediately ends\
  \ if the weapon is submerged in water. This effect does not stack with the flamingor\
  \ flaming burstweapon special ability or any other effect that grants the weapon\
  \ extra fire damage. It does not function on weapons with the frostor icy burstweapon\
