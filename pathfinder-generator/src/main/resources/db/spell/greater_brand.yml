description: "This spell functions like brand, except that it inflicts 1d6 points\
  \ of damage when applied and cannot be removed, even temporarily. In addition, a\
  \ greater brandblazes as bright as a torch when brought within 30 feet of a visible\
  \ symbol of your faith. While the symbol is blazing, the recipient is sickened.\
  \ Like the effects of bestow curse, a greater brandcannot be dispelled, but it can\
  \ be removed by any means that removes a mark of justice."
