name: "Mage's Decree"
description: "You speak a short message (up to 25 words), and it is immediately transmitted\
  \ to each target, who hear it as clearly as if you were standing next to them. By\
  \ default, the spell targets every creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or greater\
  \ that is within the spell's range, but at your discretion, you can choose to restrict\
  \ the spell to certain creatures, causing it to either only deliver its message\
  \ to creatures meeting a certain criteria, or to deliver it to all creatures except\
  \ those meeting that criteria. The criteria must be something objective and observable.\
  \ For example, you could cause the mage's decree to reach only creatures of a certain\
  \ race. You can't choose recipients that rely on unobservable information, such\
  \ as creatures of a certain alignment or of a particular class."
