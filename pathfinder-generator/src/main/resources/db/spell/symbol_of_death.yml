description: "This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface.\
  \ When triggered, a symbol of death kills one or more creatures within 60 feet of\
  \ the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed\
  \ 150. The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures\
  \ with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the symbol becomes active\
  \ and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150\
  \ hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters\
  \ the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether\
  \ or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save\
  \ against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if\
  \ it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save\
  \ again."
