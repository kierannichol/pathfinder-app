description: "You focus your mind on blocking out pain, allowing your body to endure\
  \ punishments that would be otherwise unbearable. While under the effects of this\
  \ spell, you continue to register pain--you simply don't suffer the deleterious\
  \ effects such sensations bring. For example, if you were lit on fire as you slept,\
  \ you would still wake from the pain of burning even though some of the fire damage\
  \ you endured (perhaps all of it) would be negated by this spell."
