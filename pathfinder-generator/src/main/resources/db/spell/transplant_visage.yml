name: "Transplant Visage"
description: "This spell allows you to add a creature's stolen face to or remove such\
  \ a face that you've already applied from your own. Before casting this spell, you\
  \ must remove the face and eyes of a creature that has been dead no longer than\
  \ 1 minute per caster level and place it over your own. Once you cast transplant\
  \ visage, the creature's stolen skin magically melds with your own, making the expressions\
  \ and eye color on your new face seem perfectly natural. Your new appearance grants\
  \ you a +10 bonus on Disguise checks. Because the alteration made by transplant\
  \ visageis permanent, there is no residual magical aura, and your new appearance\
  \ is not recognized by detect spells. Transplant visagemay be cast innumerable times,\
  \ allowing a single caster to wear layers upon layers of stolen faces. However,\
  \ only the topmost face is visible at any one time."
