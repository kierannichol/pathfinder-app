name: "Greater Magic Aura"
description: "If cast on an object, this spell functions as magic aura, except that\
  \ if you have identified the unique spellcasting signatures of a specific individual\
  \ with greater detect magic or a similar spell, you can make the magic aura appear\
  \ to have been created by that individual. Alternatively, you can simply obscure\
  \ all identifiers, making it more difficult to determine who cast the spell. In\
  \ either case, if the object is the subject of a greater detect magic spell, any\
  \ Spellcraft check made to identify the unique spellcasting identifiers of the aura\
  \ automatically produce the result you chose unless the observer disbelieves the\
  \ spell with a successful Will save (as with magic aura, however, detect spells\
  \ don't grant a save to disbelieve)."
