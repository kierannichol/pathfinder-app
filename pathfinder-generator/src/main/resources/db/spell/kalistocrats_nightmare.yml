description: "You temporarily curse a creature so its touch lessens the value of coins\
  \ it touches. While under the effects of this curse, whenever the target touches\
  \ a coin of higher value than copper piece, that coin changes into a copper piece.\
  \ The change takes place over the course of the following minute, allowing the target\
  \ to interact with multiple coins before the effect of the curse becomes apparent.\
  \ The affected coins are permanently transmuted from their previous material (typically\
  \ gold or silver) into copper coins, though remove curse (which can affect up to\
  \ 50 coins with a single casting) or a similar spell can restore them to their previous\
  \ material."
