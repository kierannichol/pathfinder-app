name: "Misdirection"
description: "By means of this spell, you misdirect the information from divination\
  \ spells that reveal auras (detect evil, detect magic, discern lies, and the like).\
  \ On casting the spell, you choose another object within range. For the duration\
  \ of the spell, the subject of misdirection is detected as if it were the other\
  \ object. Neither the subject nor the other object gets a saving throw against this\
  \ effect. Detection spells provide information based on the second object rather\
  \ than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of the detection\
  \ succeeds on a Will save. For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree\
  \ if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral\
  \ in alignment, and so forth. This spell does not affect other types of divination\
  \ magic (augury, detect thoughts, clairaudience/clairvoyance, and the like)."
