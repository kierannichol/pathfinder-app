name: "Enter Image"
description: "You gain a dim impression of the activities around any object bearing\
  \ your face or form and can also project your consciousness into one such object\
  \ at a time, allowing you to observe or even interact with nearby creatures. This\
  \ spell allows you to leave your body and subconsciously monitor the immediate area\
  \ around any depiction of your image whether one, hundreds, or even thousands. Each\
  \ such image has the full range of your normal senses (sight, hearing, smell, etc.)\
  \ and you can make a Perception check to notice anything occurring nearby. The DC\
  \ of this check is always 10 greater than what it would be if you were actually\
  \ present at that location, so even if you would normally notice something automatically\
  \ (such as talking, normally a DC of 0), you would need to make a DC 10 Perception\
  \ check to notice it."
