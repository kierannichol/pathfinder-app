name: "Flesh Puppet Horde"
description: "This spell functions as flesh puppet, but can animate multiple zombies.\
  \ As noted in animate dead, you can't control more than 4 HD per caster level worth\
  \ of undead in total, nor can a single casting create more than 2 HD per caster\
  \ level. A separate string attaches to each zombie in your horde. Severing a zombie's\
  \ string reverts that zombie to a corpse, but doesn't end the spell for other zombies.\
  \ Because commanding a flesh puppet requires a swift action, you can issue commands\
  \ to only one zombie per round, though zombies you previously commanded continue\
  \ to follow their orders. Likewise, you can command only one zombie to speak per\
  \ round."
