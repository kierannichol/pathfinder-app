name: "Wall of Light"
description: "An immobile, blinding curtain of white light that blocks line of sight\
  \ springs into existence. The wall sheds bright light to a range of 60 feet in all\
  \ directions. A creature adjacent to the wall is blinded as long as it remains adjacent\
  \ plus an additional 1d4 rounds thereafter-closing its eyes or succeeding at a Fortitude\
  \ save negates the effect for 1 round. A creature that passes through the wall is\
  \ automatically blinded, even if its eyes are closed. A creature from the Plane\
  \ of Shadow gains 1d4 negative levels each round it spends within 5 feet of the\
  \ wall (Fortitude negates). Passing through the wall imposes a -4 penalty on the\
  \ save for that round. Twenty-four hours after gaining these negative levels, the\
  \ subject must attempt a new Fortitude saving throw for each negative level. If\
  \ a save succeeds, 1 negative level is removed. If it fails, the negative level\
  \ becomes permanent. Wall of light can be made permanent with permanency (with a\
  \ minimum caster level of 13th and cost of 11,000 gp)."
