description: "You create a hideous gray cloud, similar to fog cloud, that occasionally\
  \ crackles with foul-smelling bolts of sickly green lightning. Creatures in the\
  \ area must save or contract one of the following diseases: blinding sickness, bubonic\
  \ plague, cackle fever, demon fever, devil chills, filth fever, leprosy, mindfire,\
  \ red ache, shakes, or slimy doom (the disease is chosen by you when you cast the\
  \ spell and applies to all creatures that fail the save). The disease is contracted\
  \ immediately (the onset period does not apply) and is an instantaneous effect.\
  \ Use the disease's listed frequency to determine further effects, but the disease's\
  \ save DC increases by +2. For more information see the diseases section."
