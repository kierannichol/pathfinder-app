description: "This spell functions like shadow enchantment, except that it enables\
  \ you to create partially real, illusory versions of psychic, sorcerer, or wizard\
  \ enchantment spells of 5th level or lower. If the spell is recognized as a greater\
  \ shadow enchantment, it's only three-fifths (60%) as effective."
