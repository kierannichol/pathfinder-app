description: "You infuse the target mindless undead creature with power drawn from\
  \ the Shadow Plane, immediately granting it the advanced creature simple template.\
  \ It gains a +2 bonus on all rolls, including damage rolls, a +2 bonus to special\
  \ ability DCs, a +4 bonus to AC and CMD, and 2 additional hit points per Hit Die.\
  \ The undead creature's destructive instincts take hold for the duration of this\
  \ spell, and any attempts to control or command the undead creature have a 50% chance\
  \ of failing; if uncontrolled, the undead creature attacks any living creatures\
  \ it sees. This spell has no effect on undead creatures that already have the advanced\
  \ creature template."
