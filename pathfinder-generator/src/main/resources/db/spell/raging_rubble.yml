  \ a dangerous, rolling area of debris. The animated rubble has a space of 10 feet\
  \ and acts like a swarm, damaging (1d6 hit points) and distracting (DC 12) anything\
  \ within it. As a move action, you can direct the rubble to move up to 10 feet.\
  \ If the rubble is attacked, treat it as a Medium animated object with the young\
  \ creature simple template and the swarm subtype."
