description: "The focus of this spell flies upward above your head and takes a defensive\
  \ position within your space. It lunges at opponents, as if guided by a martially\
  \ trained hand, parrying and turning back melee attacks aimed at you, but does not\
  \ strike back at any opponent nor does it damage them. The weapon serves only as\
  \ a defense. While it protects you, you can cast spells without provoking attacks\
  \ of opportunity, without the need to cast them defensively."
