description: "Choose a single teamwork feat that you possess. You forge a link with\
  \ your allies, allowing them to gain the benefits of the chosen feat even if they\
  \ do not have it themselves. You must be a part of the group qualifying for a given\
  \ bonus for your allies to gain the benefits. For example, two of your allies flanking\
  \ an orc would gain no benefit from your Outflank feat, but an ally flanking the\
  \ orc with you would. Your allies' positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites\
  \ listed in the teamwork feat for either of you to receive the listed bonus."
