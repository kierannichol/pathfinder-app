description: "You place a willing subject into a cataleptic state. It remains aware\
  \ of its surroundings but is paralyzed, appearing dead unless observers make a DC\
  \ 20 Heal check. Hibernate delays the effects of poison, disease, and bleed effects\
  \ for the spell's duration, and half of any hit point damage suffered by the subject\
  \ is converted to nonlethal damage."
