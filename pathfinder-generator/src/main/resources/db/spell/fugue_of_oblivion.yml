    Effect: "The casters weave the target's name into a chant of nonsense rhyming\
      \ stories for 6 hours, as they slowly extract the target's memories into the\
      \ urn as a purple mist. The target loses all but the first class level she ever\
      \ gained (if any; this ritual doesn't affect racial hit dice), immediately reducing\
      \ or removing all level-dependent abilities as if the target were a 1st-level\
      \ character. In addition to the loss of her class levels, the target suffers\
      \ from total amnesia of the time in which she accrued those levels. The target\
      \ can gain experience and accrue new levels, though she must adhere to all the\
      \ same decisions she made previously with her missing levels (class, archetype,\
      \ skills, feats, and so on), even if she can't explain why she now makes such\
      \ decisions. In some cases, she might do so without meeting the requirements,\
      \ such as if her amnesia blocked an alignment change and she gained levels in\
      \ a class with an alignment restriction she no longer met; in this case, she\
      \ would gain the abilities but retain only those she would have as an ex-member\
      \ of the class. The rule that she must adhere to all previous decisions has\
      \ one exception: if the target is a psychic, she can gain the amnesiac archetype\
      \ as long as she could otherwise take it."
