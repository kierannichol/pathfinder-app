description: "You bolster your life energy. If the loss of hit points at the end of\
  \ a temporary effect that modifies your Constitution (such as barbarian's rage or\
  \ bloodrager's bloodrage) would cause you to become unconscious or kill you, you\
  \ gain temporary hit points equal to your caster level (maximum 10). Each casting\
  \ of this spell grants you temporary hit points only once."
