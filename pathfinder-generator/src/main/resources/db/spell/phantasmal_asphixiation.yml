description: "Your target must succeed at a Will save or believe it can no longer\
  \ breathe. An affected target must attempt a Fortitude save each round at the beginning\
  \ of its turn. The first time it fails the Fortitude save, it is staggered until\
  \ the next time it attempts a save against the spell. If the target fails a second\
  \ Fortitude save in a row, it falls unconscious for the spell's remaining duration.\
  \ The target breathes normally while unconscious, but is shaken for 1 minute upon\
  \ awakening. If the target succeeds at two Fortitude saves in a row, it shakes off\
  \ the spell's effects entirely. Otherwise, the target continues to attempt a save\
  \ each round until it falls unconscious or the spell ends. This spell has no effect\
  \ on creatures that don't need to breathe."
