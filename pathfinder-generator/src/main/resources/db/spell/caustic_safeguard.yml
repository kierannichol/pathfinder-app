description: "You imbue a single object with an acidic protective ward. Any creature\
  \ other than you that touches the object takes 1d6 points of acid damage per 2 caster\
  \ levels (maximum 10d6; Reflex half). Each time the spell discharges, the number\
  \ of damage dice it deals is halved (rounded down); when the spell's damage dice\
  \ reach 0, the spell ends. While casting this spell, you can touch up to one creature\
  \ per 4 caster levels, which allows them to handle the warded object without triggering\
  \ this spell."
