description: "You focus emotional energy and weave it into a shroud of hardened ectoplasm\
  \ around the weapon you touch, infusing it with a ghostly glow and great power.\
  \ The weapon becomes a ghost touch weapon, and gains one of the following additional\
  \ benefits, depending on the type of emotion you infuse into the weapon. If a special\
  \ ability wouldn't apply to the chosen weapon (such as vicious on a ranged weapon),\
  \ the weapon doesn't gain that benefit."
