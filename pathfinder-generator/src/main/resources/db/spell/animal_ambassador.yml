name: "Animal Ambassador"
description: "You compel a single animal to travel to a spot you designate and deliver\
  \ a message to a creature you identify. This spell is similar to animal messenger,\
  \ but can affect larger animals. In addition, the target animal is temporarily awakened\
  \ to sentience (as the awaken spell) for the duration of this spell, and it can\
  \ use its increased mental acuity to come up with creative solutions to overcome\
  \ obstacles to delivering its message. The awakened target animal speaks any one\
  \ language you know. In addition, you can imbue the animal with up to 5 ranks in\
  \ any of the following skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility),\
  \ Linguistics, or Sense Motive. It treats any of these skills that are class skills\
  \ for you as class skills. The number of ranks you imbue in any of these skills\
  \ can't exceed the target animal's Hit Dice nor the number of ranks you possess\
  \ in that skill."
