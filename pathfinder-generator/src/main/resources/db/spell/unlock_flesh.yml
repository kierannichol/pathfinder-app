description: "By touching a creature with a bladed instrument, you cause the creature's\
  \ flesh to loosen and slide against its skeletal moorings. A living creature touched\
  \ becomes staggered by the disturbing and uncomfortable sensation for 1 round per\
  \ level. Each round on its turn, the subject can attempt a new saving throw to end\
  \ the effect. This is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\
  \ A corporeal undead creature targeted by this spell instead takes 1d6 points of\
  \ damage per caster level (maximum 5d6 at 5th level) as wet, oozing chunks of flesh\
  \ slough off its desiccated bones (a successful Fortitude save halves this damage).\
  \ Incorporeal creatures, or creatures that do not have flesh, are immune to this\
  \ spell's effects."
