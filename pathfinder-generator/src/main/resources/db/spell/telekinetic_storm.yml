description: "You generate a storm of telekinetic energy that emanates from you, ripping\
  \ through the spell's area of effect with devastating force. Any creature caught\
  \ in the spell's radius takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6)\
  \ and is dazed and stunned for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save reduces the\
  \ damage by half and negates the dazed and stunned effects."
