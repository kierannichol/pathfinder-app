name: "Sense Fear"
description: "You sense the fear of those nearby, feeling it in the air around you.\
  \ You can detect spooked, shaken, scared, frightened, panicked, terrified, and horrified\
  \ creatures within 30 feet, and you immediately know what level of fear they are\
  \ experiencing. You determine the creatures' approximate direction from you, though\
  \ you do not sense a given creature's identity or know which squares the creatures\
  \ occupy. If you're within 5 feet of a creature whose fear you sense, you pinpoint\
  \ that creature's location, as if using blindsense."
