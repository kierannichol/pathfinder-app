description: "This spell renders a touched object waterproof for the duration of the\
  \ spell. The object must be no larger than 10 pounds per caster level. The spell\
  \ protects the object from any mundane liquids (such as alcohol or oil) but not\
  \ from magically created liquids. If this spell is cast on a creature, all of that\
  \ creature's equipment is rendered waterproof as long as it is carried by the target\
  \ creature. If the creature drops or discards an item, the item is no longer protected\
  \ by this spell, even if the targeted creature picks it up later."
