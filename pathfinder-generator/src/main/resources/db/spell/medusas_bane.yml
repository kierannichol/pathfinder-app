description: "This spell causes your eyes to take on a silvery mirror-like quality,\
  \ transforming your eyes into metallic-looking orbs that reflect the world you see.\
  \ Your vision is in no way impaired while this spell is in effect, but you are granted\
  \ immunity to gaze attacks for the spell's duration. As an immediate action, you\
  \ can reflect a creature's gaze back on itself, forcing the target of the gaze attack\
  \ to save against its own gaze weapon or be affected by it. This reflection bypasses\
  \ the typical immunity creatures with gaze attacks have to their own race's gaze\
  \ attack, but does not bypass any other resistances or immunities the creature might\
  \ have. Once you choose to reflect a gaze attack in this manner, the effect of medusa's\
  \ bane immediately ends."
