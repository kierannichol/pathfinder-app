    Effect: "The primary caster appeals to a local kami to ask for assistance in battle.\
      \ The casters must assemble a shrine within 100 feet of the kami's ward. Once\
      \ the ritual begins, the casters each utter a unique prayer to the kami, complete\
      \ with devotionals and explanations about why the kami's help is needed. If\
      \ the casting is successful, the kami manifests (as per summon monster V) and\
      \ fights alongside the casters. This kami uses the statistics for a kodama and\
      \ refuses to move farther than 1 mile from its ward."
