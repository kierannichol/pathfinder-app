    Effect: "The primary caster juggles the chaos emerald back and forth between his\
      \ hands, under his clothing, and between any secondary casters involved in the\
      \ ritual. As the ritual progresses, the primary caster's actions with the chaos\
      \ emerald become increasingly improbable (putting it into his mouth and pulling\
      \ it out of his ear, for example, or placing it into the cupped hands of one\
      \ secondary caster and removing it from the cupped hands of a different secondary\
      \ caster). If the ritual is successful, the chaos emerald disappears entirely,\
      \ and the primary caster gains the ability to inflict warpwaves like a protean\
      \ for the ritual's duration. The primary caster can inflict a warpwave on a\
      \ creature within 100 feet as a standard action. The target can negate the effects\
      \ of the warpwave with a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + half the primary\
      \ caster's character level + the primary caster's Charisma modifier). When the\
      \ duration expires, the chaos emerald reappears in the primary caster's possession--usually\
      \ in a hidden place, such as the bottom of a backpack or inside a hat."
