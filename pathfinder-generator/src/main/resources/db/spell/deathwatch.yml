description: "Using the powers of necromancy, you can determine the condition of creatures\
  \ near death within the spell's range. You instantly know whether each creature\
  \ within the area is dead, fragile (alive and wounded, with 3 or fewer hit points\
  \ left), fighting off death (alive with 4 or more hit points), healthy, undead,\
  \ or neither alive nor dead (such as a construct). Deathwatch sees through any spell\
  \ or ability that allows creatures to feign death."
