description: "This spell targets an area of earth, metal, stone, or wood, causing\
  \ long, serrated blades to shoot out from random points within the area of effect.\
  \ Any creature in the area when the spell is first cast must attempt a Reflex save\
  \ to avoid taking 3d8 points of piercing damage from the blades and an additional\
  \ 2d6 points of bleed damage. A creature that fails the save also has its speed\
  \ reduced by half for 24 hours or until the injured creature benefits from a â€œcure\"\
  \ spell (which restores lost hit points as normal). Another creature can remove\
  \ the penalty by succeeding on a Heal check against the spell's save DC as a standard\
  \ action."
