description: "You change outfits or create a disguise out of materials you are wearing\
  \ or carrying (potentially including a disguise kit). The spell can't alter your\
  \ body or change the structure of objects, but can style wigs, apply makeup or piercings,\
  \ and otherwise make use of tools to make superficial changes. In an instant, you\
  \ have a nonmagical disguise or clothing change. Attempt a Disguise check to determine\
  \ the effectiveness of the disguise."
