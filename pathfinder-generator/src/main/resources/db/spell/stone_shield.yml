description: "A 1-inch-thick slab of stone springs up from the ground, interposing\
  \ itself between you and an opponent of your choice. The stone shieldprovides you\
  \ with cover from that enemy until the beginning of your next turn, granting you\
  \ a +4 bonus to Armor Class and a +2 bonus on Reflex saving throws. If the opponent's\
  \ attack misses you by 4 or less, the attack strikes the shield instead. The stone\
  \ shieldhas hardness 8 and 15 hit points. If the shield is destroyed, the spell\
  \ ends and the shield crumbles away into nothingness. Spells and effects that damage\
  \ an area deal damage to the shield."
