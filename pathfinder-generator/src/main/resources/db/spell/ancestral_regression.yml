description: "The target drow transforms into a surface elf. The drow loses her darkvision\
  \ and light-blindness racial traits and gains the low-light vision racial trait\
  \ in their place. The alignment and personality of the drow are not affected by\
  \ the transformation, but the spell conceals her alignment as an undetectable alignmentspell.\
  \ The spell grants the target a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to pass as an elf,\
  \ though she appears to be an elven analog of herself and can be recognized as such\
  \ by other drow who know her."
