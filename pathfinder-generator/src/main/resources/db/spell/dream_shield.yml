description: "You ward the target's mind against intrusion and influence while she\
  \ is unconscious. While sleeping, the target is protected against divinations such\
  \ as nondetection and gains spell resistance equal to 10 + your caster level against\
  \ mind-affecting effects. In addition, the subject immediately receives another\
  \ saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spell or effect that\
  \ would possess or exercise direct mental control over her. This functions in all\
  \ respects like the second property of protection from evil but it applies regardless\
  \ of the alignment of the creature or object that created the possession or mental\
  \ influence effect."
