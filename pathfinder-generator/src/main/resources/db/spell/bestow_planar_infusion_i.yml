description: "This spell draws upon the latent planar energy of the caster's surroundings,\
  \ allowing her to temporarily infuse a creature with the plane's power. The touched\
  \ creature gains that plane's basic infusion for the spell's duration. This spell\
  \ has no effect if cast on the Material Plane, and it ends as soon as the spell's\
  \ target leaves the plane with which it has been infused. Details on planar infusions\
  \ can be found in each plane's Infusion section (listed here)."
