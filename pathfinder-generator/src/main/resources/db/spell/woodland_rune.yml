name: "Woodland Rune"
description: "Created by Ghorus as a safety measure to limit his enemies' movements,\
  \ this spell allows you to inscribe a powerful rune on any surface. Woodland rune\
  \ triggers when any non-plant creature (apart from the caster) moves within 30 feet\
  \ of the rune. When it's triggered, roots and branches sprout from the ground, catching\
  \ all creatures within a 30-foot burst of the rune and hindering their movement\
  \ as if they were moving through heavy undergrowth, though it does not provide concealment.\
  \ Plant creatures and creatures under the effect of woodland stride or freedom of\
  \ movement are not affected by this spell. In all other respects, this spell functions\
  \ as symbol of death."
