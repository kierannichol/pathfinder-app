description: "The transmuted creatures can tread on any liquid as if it were firm\
  \ ground. Mud, oil, snow, quicksand, running water, ice, and even lava can be traversed\
  \ easily, since the subjects' feet hover an inch or two above the surface. Creatures\
  \ crossing molten lava still take damage from the heat because they are near it.\
  \ The subjects can walk, run, charge, or otherwise move across the surface as if\
  \ it were normal ground."
