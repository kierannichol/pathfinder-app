description: "You create a luminescent sphere of orbiting energy that harms incorporeal\
  \ creatures and dispossesses them of any stolen bodies. An incorporeal creature\
  \ must succeed at a Will save to enter a space overlapping with the sphere; failure\
  \ means the creature cannot pass through the sphere, as though it were a wall of\
  \ force. If the incorporeal creature succeeds, it may pass through the sphere at\
  \ will, though if it ends its turn within the sphere, it takes a number of points\
  \ of force damage equal to 1d6 + 1 per caster level (maximum +10)."
