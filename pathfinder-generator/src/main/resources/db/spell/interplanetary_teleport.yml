name: "Interplanetary Teleport"
description: "This spell functions as teleport, except there is truly no range limit\
  \ and you do not need to have seen your destination, though you must have a solid\
  \ grasp of which world you wish to travel to (“the third planet from the sun\" is\
  \ an acceptable destination, but “a habitable world near that bright star\" is not).\
  \ If you have a specific location on a planet in mind, you arrive there without\
  \ a chance of failure; otherwise you arrive at a location that would not immediately\
  \ be life-threatening. If no such safe landing zone exists on the world, such as\
  \ someone attempting to travel into the sun without the proper precautions in place,\
  \ the spell simply fails."
