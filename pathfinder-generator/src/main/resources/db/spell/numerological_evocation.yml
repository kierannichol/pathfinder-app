name: "Numerological Evocation"
description: "You can use the Path of Numbers to calculate the latent magical energies\
  \ all around you and fire customized rays of elemental energy that damage nearby\
  \ targets. Roll 1d6 per 2 caster levels you possess. This is your dice pool. You\
  \ will use each die in the pool exactly once to customize numerological evocation.\
  \ Choose a number of dice in the pool, and match their results to the values in\
  \ the first column of the Eight Basic Energies table to determine the types of energy\
  \ damage the spell deals. You can allocate any number of dice in this manner, provided\
  \ you still have enough dice remaining for the subsequent steps."
