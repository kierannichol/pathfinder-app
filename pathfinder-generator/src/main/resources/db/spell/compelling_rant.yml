name: "Compelling Rant"
description: "You deliver a confusing but fascinating monologue, relaying conspiracies\
  \ or metaphysical revelations that confound your audience, throughout the spell's\
  \ casting time and as long as you concentrate. You take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain\
  \ when you begin the speech and can't reduce or prevent this damage in any way.\
  \ Each intelligent creature in the spell's area takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage\
  \ as their perceptions of reality realign with yours for the spell's duration. Listeners\
  \ with at least 5 HD can attempt a Will save to negate the effects. Your targets\
  \ view you with a friendly attitude and respond to criticism of you with irritation.\
  \ Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks to create doubt about your purpose in those\
  \ affected by the spell take a â€“4 penalty. The attitude of your targets regarding\
  \ any creature that criticizes you or your vision automatically changes one step\
  \ toward hostile; a Diplomacy check that fails by 5 or more reduces their attitude\
  \ further. Your targets retain the same alignment and their prior beliefs, in addition\
  \ to the ones you force on them. You can't force beliefs on a target if such beliefs\
  \ would be necessarily against the nature of its alignment and prior beliefs, but\
  \ targets are otherwise able to hold contradictory beliefs."
