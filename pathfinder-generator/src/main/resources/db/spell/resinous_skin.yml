description: "You coat your body with a resinous substance, protecting you from attacks\
  \ and binding weapons that strike you. You gain DR 5/piercing, as well as a +4 circumstance\
  \ bonus to your CMD against disarm attempts and on saving throws against effects\
  \ that cause you to drop something you are holding. Additionally, you gain a +2\
  \ circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks to initiate a grapple, maintain a\
  \ grapple, and pin a foe. Any enemy you grapple takes a â€“2 penalty on attempts to\
  \ break the grapple and to escape the grapple using Escape Artist. Any weapon, that\
  \ strikes you becomes stuck unless its wielder succeeds at a Reflex saving throw.\
  \ Such a weapon can be pulled free of you only with a successful Strength check\
  \ (DC = your saving throw DC for this spell). This spell has no effect on unarmed\
  \ strikes or natural weapons."
