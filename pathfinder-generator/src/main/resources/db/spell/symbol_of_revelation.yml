  \ with the shapechanger subtype, or creatures that have magically changed their\
  \ shape. These creatures are outlined by a pale light that functions like faerie\
  \ fire, except it lasts for 10 minutes per caster level; the symbol does not otherwise\
  \ reveal their true form. Once triggered, a symbol of revelationremains active for\
  \ 10 minutes per caster level."
