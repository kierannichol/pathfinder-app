name: "Vexing Miscalculation"
description: "You frustrate an opponent with ill fortune that leads even its most\
  \ accurate attacks astray. The target is unable to score critical threats for the\
  \ duration of this spell, even if the result of its roll would normally be a critical\
  \ threat. If the creature rolls a natural 20, the attack still hits regardless of\
  \ its opponent's AC, but the hit is not eligible for a critical confirmation roll.\
  \ Once a critical threat has been foiled by vexing miscalculation, the spell is\
  \ discharged."
