description: "This spell allows you to read written material in a quarter of the time\
  \ it would normally take to read it. If you use this spell in conjunction with comprehend\
  \ languages, you can read otherwise incomprehensible text four times faster than\
  \ the spell indicates. If the text is fragmented, is particularly difficult to understand,\
  \ or otherwise requires an ability check or skill check (such as a Linguistics check)\
  \ to read quickly or at all, this spell doesn't directly increase your reading speed,\
  \ but instead grants you a +8 bonus on the check. This bonus also applies to Research\
  \ checks when you research a particular topic within a library (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate\
  \ Intrigue 148)."
