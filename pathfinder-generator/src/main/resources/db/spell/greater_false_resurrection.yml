name: "Greater False Resurrection"
description: "This spell functions as false resurrection except that it calls a belier\
  \ devil with the young simple template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 85, 292) to possess\
  \ the body and all parts of false resurrection that function like resurrection instead\
  \ function like true resurrection. Attempts to identify greater false resurrection\
  \ with a skill check incorrectly identify it as true resurrection (see the ruse\
  \ descriptor). A fooled viewer mistakes greater false resurrection's aura as the\
  \ lingering aura of an instantaneous conjuration effect."
