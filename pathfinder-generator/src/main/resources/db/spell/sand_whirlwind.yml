description: "A whirling cloud of sand strikes the target, blinding it and hampering\
  \ its ability to speak. To speak while affected by the spell, the target must make\
  \ a Concentration check (DC equal to the DC of this spell). If the target tries\
  \ to cast a spell, the Concentration DC increases by the level of the spell being\
  \ cast. A successful Will save negates the blindness but not the speechhampering\
  \ effect."
