  \ wandering spirit) if you are a shaman, or your domain if you are a druid, beckoning\
  \ them forth to pay attention to your current location. For the duration of the\
  \ spell, all spells from your spirit magic list or domain list that are cast within\
  \ the affected area have their caster level increased by 1, and all spellcasters\
  \ casting such spells receive a +4 insight bonus on their concentration checks for\
  \ those spells only."
