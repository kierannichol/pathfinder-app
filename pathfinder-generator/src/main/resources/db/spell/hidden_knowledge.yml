description: "This subtle but useful spell allows you to safeguard important knowledge--even\
  \ from yourself. While casting this spell, you recite one piece of knowledge (up\
  \ to a maximum of 50 words). Upon completion of the spell's casting, you transfer\
  \ the knowledge from your mind to your skin in the form of an intricate, runic tattoo\
  \ placed anywhere you choose on your body. The knowledge disappears utterly from\
  \ your mind, and you might not realize you forgot something. The magic of the spell\
  \ patches over gaps in your memory with recollections from the past. Until the spell's\
  \ duration ends, the knowledge is lost to you. When you cast this spell, you decide\
  \ how long you wish the spell's duration to be, up to a maximum duration of 1 day\
  \ per level."
