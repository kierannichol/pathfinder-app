name: "Forceful Strike"
description: "You cast this spell as you strike a creature with a melee weapon, unarmed\
  \ strike, or natural attack to unleash a concussive blast of force. You deal normal\
  \ weapon damage from the blow, but also deal an additional amount of force damage\
  \ equal to 1d4 points per caster level (maximum of 10d4). The force of the blow\
  \ may be enough to knock the target backward as well. To determine if the target\
  \ is pushed back, make a combat maneuver check with a bonus equal to your caster\
  \ level to resolve a bull rush attempt against the creature struck. You do not move\
  \ as a result of this free bull rush, but it can push the target back if it defeats\
  \ the target's CMD. A successful Fortitude save halves the force damage and negates\
  \ the bull rush effect."
