name: "Symbol of Storms"
description: "This spell functions as symbol of death, except that when triggered,\
  \ a 30-foot-radius centered on the symbol fills with hurricane-force winds (75 mph).\
  \ Each round, a bolt of lightning that deals 10d6 points of electricity damage strikes\
  \ a random creature within the area. A successful Reflex save halves this damage.\
  \ Unlike symbol of death, symbol of storms has no hit point limit. Regardless of\
  \ the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 30 feet from a symbol\
  \ of storms can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions,\
  \ such as reading the rune). Once triggered, a symbol of storms remains active for\
  \ 1 minute per caster level."
