description: "Ithuna Vardsdottir claims to have unearthed this ancient prayer in a\
  \ ruined temple of Desna, though Pathfinders have reported the use of similar magic\
  \ in Irrisen among the White Witches. While the name of this spell is sharesister,\
  \ it works equally well on male or female creatures--both targets of the spell must\
  \ simply be of the same gender."
