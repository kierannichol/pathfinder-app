description: "Pyrotechnics turns a fire into a burst of blinding fireworks or a thick\
  \ cloud of choking smoke, depending on your choice. The spell uses one fire source,\
  \ which is immediately extinguished. A fire so large that it exceeds a 20-foot cube\
  \ is only partly extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based\
  \ creature used as a source takes 1 point of damage per caster level."
