description: "You cause metal to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness,\
  \ form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a\
  \ successful Strength check to open, at your option). A vehicle grinds to a halt\
  \ and ceases to operate. Warped ranged weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon\
  \ imposes a â€“4 penalty on attack rolls."
