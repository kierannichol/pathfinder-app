description: "With a touch, you enchant a shield and enable it to protect its wielder\
  \ from hostile spells. The shield grants spell resistance 10 + your caster level\
  \ against spells so long as the shield can be interposed between the wielder and\
  \ the spell effect. A spell shielddoes not provide spell resistance against area\
  \ effect spells such as fireball, but does provide a +5 bonus on Reflex saving throws\
  \ against such spells."
