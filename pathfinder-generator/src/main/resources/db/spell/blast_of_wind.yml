name: "Blast of Wind"
description: "With a spiraling gesture of your hand and a forceful exhalation, you\
  \ create a brief but fierce (90 mph) blast of wind. This spell functions as gust\
  \ of wind, except all creatures within the area are treated as though they were\
  \ one size category smaller for the purpose of determining how the spell affects\
  \ them. For every 4 caster levels beyond 7th, creatures in the area are treated\
  \ as an additional size category smaller (to a maximum of three size categories\
  \ smaller at 15th level)."
