description: "You instantly change the appearance of the subjects and then maintain\
  \ that appearance for the spell's duration. You can make the subjects appear to\
  \ be anything you wish. The subjects look, feel, and smell just like the creatures\
  \ the spell makes them resemble. Affected creatures resume their normal appearances\
  \ if slain. You must succeed on a Disguise check to duplicate the appearance of\
  \ a specific individual. This spell gives you a +10 bonus on the check."
