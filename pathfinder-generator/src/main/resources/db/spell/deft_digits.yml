description: "You animate the target of the spell, manipulating the glove with your\
  \ own hand from a distance. The glove moves as you direct it with a fly speed of\
  \ 30 feet and average maneuverability. Directing the glove is a standard action,\
  \ though the glove can move up to its speed and perform a task in the same action.\
  \ You can attempt Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks using the glove, though\
  \ attempting these checks at a distance increases the normal skill check DCs by\
  \ 5, or by 20 if you do not have line of sight to the object you are manipulating.\
  \ The glove can also lift or drag objects using your caster level as your Strength\
  \ score. The glove cannot wield weapons or make attacks effectively while this spell\
  \ is in effect. If you cast this spell on a magical glove, its innate magic is suppressed\
  \ for the duration of the spell."
