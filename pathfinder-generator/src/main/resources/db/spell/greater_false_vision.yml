name: "Greater False Vision"
description: "This functions similarly to false vision, but instead of placing the\
  \ illusion on a nearby area, you can tie it to a specific individual, and can do\
  \ so from great distances. The spell can be cast at any distance. The difficulty\
  \ of the save depends on your knowledge of the subject and what sort of physical\
  \ connection (if any) you have to that creature. The target gains the same bonuses\
  \ and penalties on its Will save to resist this spell as the bonuses and penalties\
  \ that apply to the scrying spell (including a +5 bonus if the target is on another\
  \ plane)."
