name: "Face of the Devourer"
description: "You transform the target's face into a hideous shape, such as a half-melted\
  \ visage with insect legs instead of teeth, seeping pits instead of eyes, and suckered\
  \ tongues dangling from its misshapen mouth. You do not choose what shape the target's\
  \ face takes, and the shape is different every time you cast the spell. This transformation\
  \ does not interfere with the target's senses or its ability to breathe, though\
  \ it might prevent it from speaking. The target gains a +4 circumstance bonus on\
  \ Intimidate checks."
