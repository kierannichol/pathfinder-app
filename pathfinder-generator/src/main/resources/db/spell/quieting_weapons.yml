name: "Quieting Weapons"
description: "The target weapons and any ammunition they fire make no sound as part\
  \ of their normal functions as a weapon. For instance, a firearm's firing would\
  \ not make an explosive sound, but if you cast this spell on a creature's bite attack,\
  \ it would not prevent it from vocalizing from its mouth. The first time a creature\
  \ is struck by a weapon affected by this spell, it must succeed at a Will save (SR\
  \ applies to this effect) or it becomes unable to make noise louder than a whisper\
  \ (Perception DC 10 to hear) whether vocally or by other means for the duration\
  \ of the effect. Because the creature can still whisper, this doesn't interfere\
  \ with verbal spell components. Whether it succeeds or fails its saving throw, the\
  \ creature is immune to further effects from this casting of quieting weapons."
