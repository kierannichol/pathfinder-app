name: "Greater Seeds of Influence"
description: "This spell functions as seeds of influence, except that if the target\
  \ is protected by a spell that grants immunity, spell resistance, or a saving throw\
  \ bonus against a divination or mind-affecting spell you cast on the target, you\
  \ can attempt caster level checks to dispel each such effect before applying the\
  \ effects of those protections against the spell. The DC of the caster level check\
  \ to dispel each effect is equal to 11 + the effect's caster level. Such spells\
  \ cast on the target while greater seeds of influence is active grant no protection\
  \ against greater seeds of influence."
