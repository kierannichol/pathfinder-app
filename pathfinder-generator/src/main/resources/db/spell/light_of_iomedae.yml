description: "With this spell, you create shafts of blue light that illuminate all\
  \ undead creatures in the area. Affected undead take a â€“20 penalty on all Stealth\
  \ checks. Invisible undead are not made visible by this effect, but the light does\
  \ make it easy to pinpoint the exact squares in which such undead are located (they\
  \ still retain the 50% miss chance granted by invisibility). Thelight of Iomedaeincreases\
  \ light levels by one step in a 5-foot radius around an affected undead creature.\
  \ Once an undead is affected, it remains illuminated as long as remains within the\
  \ spell's range, even if it leaves the spell's original radius, until the spell's\
  \ duration ends."
