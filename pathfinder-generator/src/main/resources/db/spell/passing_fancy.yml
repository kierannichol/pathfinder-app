name: "Passing Fancy"
description: "Taldor's infamous Lion Blades imported this spell from the ninja clans\
  \ of Minkai, and both groups use it to great effect when maneuvering among the shallow\
  \ upper classes. When you cast the spell, you dictate one specific topic or recent\
  \ event and instill a magical obsession with that subject within the target. An\
  \ affected creature becomes fascinated by the topic, and becomes completely focused\
  \ on discussing the event with anyone nearby, possibly wandering off or distracting\
  \ unaffected creatures. Passing fancy has no effect on a creature with an Intelligence\
  \ of 2 or less."
