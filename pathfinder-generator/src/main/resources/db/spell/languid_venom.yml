name: "Languid Venom"
description: "You greatly extend the time it takes for the poison you touch to take\
  \ effect, giving that poison an onset time up to 1 hour per caster level. (You touch\
  \ the poison's container, so you don't risk exposing yourself to a contact poison.)\
  \ The target doesn't attempt a saving throw when initially exposed to the languid\
  \ venom, but instead saves at the end of the poison's onset time. If the poison\
  \ is neutralized or otherwise cured prior to the end of its onset time, it is rendered\
  \ harmless. Failing saves against multiple doses of languid venom have the normal\
  \ cumulative effect for poisons (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 558)."
