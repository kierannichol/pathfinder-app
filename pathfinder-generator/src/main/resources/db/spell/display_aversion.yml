name: "Display Aversion"
description: "This spell functions like minor image, except it always creates an animated\
  \ illusion of you presenting to a vampire a material, object, or sound that it is\
  \ averse to, such as garlic, a holy symbol, or bells ringing. You specify what aversion\
  \ the illusion depicts when you cast the spell. The vampire reacts to the illusion\
  \ as if it were real; it can overcome the effect by succeeding at a disbelief save\
  \ or a normal Will save against the illusion's DC (instead of the normal DC 25 to\
  \ overcome its revulsion). The illusion is only quasireal and cannot otherwise affect\
  \ creatures."
