description: "This spell causes even commonly used objects to become conundrums. When\
  \ cast on a creature, the target loses all weapon and shield proficiencies. The\
  \ target also forgets how to use all spell-completion, spell-trigger, and use-activated\
  \ magic items, as well as any mundane items used as part of a skill check, imposing\
  \ a â€“5 penalty on all ability and skill checks attempted with such items. These\
  \ effects last for 1 round per level. As a move action, the target can attempt a\
  \ skill check to negate the effects of this spell for one object. Weapons, shields,\
  \ and mundane objects require a successful Craft skill check of the type required\
  \ to craft the item in question, with a DC equal to the spell's save DC. Magic items\
  \ require a successful Spellcraft or Use Magic Device skill check against the spell's\
  \ save DC."
