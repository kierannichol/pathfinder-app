description: "With a gesture, you muffle sound around the target, making it unable\
  \ to yell or otherwise make loud noises. This does not affect spellcasting by the\
  \ target. The target can still use sonic effects, but the DC of these effects decreases\
  \ by 2. The target gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against sonic effects. The\
  \ target gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks."
