description: "You grant the creature touched the ability to breathe with ease air\
  \ that is contaminated with ash, spores, smoke, dust, or the like. The creature\
  \ suffers no ill effects from natural airborne irritants or contaminants and gains\
  \ a +4 bonus on saving throws against magical effects that involve any of these\
  \ contaminants. In addition, the creature can see through magical obscuring effects\
  \ caused by dense ash, smoke, fog, or similar concealment up to a distance of 60\
  \ feet, although this spell does nothing to enhance sight in dark or shadowy conditions.\
  \ You can cast this spell on multiple creatures, but if you do, divide the duration\
  \ evenly among all the creatures you touch (to a minimum duration of 10 minutes\
  \ per target)."
