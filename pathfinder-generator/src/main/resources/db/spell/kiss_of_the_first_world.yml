description: "This spell--a favorite of fey spellcasters--is traditionally bestowed\
  \ with a kiss, though all that's really required to gift someone with a kiss of\
  \ the First Worldis a touch. This spell infuses a living creature with a surge of\
  \ positive energy from the First World, filling the target with the raw energies\
  \ of life. The exact effects of this spell vary, depending on the nature of the\
  \ creature touched. Constructs are immune to the effects of this spell."
