name: "Tactical Formation"
description: "This spell increases the effectiveness of a group's formation in battle.\
  \ When cast, all creatures under the effect of the spell must be adjacent to one\
  \ another, forming an unbroken chain of squares (which may include creatures sharing\
  \ the same square). This chain does not need to be a straight line. Each target\
  \ in the chain receives a +2 deflection bonus to AC as long as the targets stay\
  \ adjacent to at least one other creature affected by the spell; moving more than\
  \ 5 feet from another target ends the spell with respect to that creature only.\
  \ For example, a cleric could cast it on himself and four dwarves blocking a 20-foot-wide\
  \ corridor; the cleric can move freely from the left side of the formation to the\
  \ right side (whether in front of or behind the other targets) and not break the\
  \ spell as long as he stays within 5 feet of at least one of them."
