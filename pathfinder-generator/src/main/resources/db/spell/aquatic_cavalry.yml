description: "You summon a school of hippocampi (one plus one per 3 caster levels,\
  \ to a maximum of six at 15th level) to serve as combat-trained mounts. The hippocampi\
  \ avoid combat if possible but defend themselves if attacked. If any hippocampus\
  \ attacks, the remaining duration of the spell changes from 1 hour per level to\
  \ 1 round per level (so if a full 4 hours remained, the hippocampi last for only\
  \ 4 more rounds)."
