description: "A 4-foot-long, blazing, forked bolt of electricity springs forth from\
  \ your hand. You wield this spear-like bolt as if it were a trident (you are considered\
  \ proficient with the bolt). Attacks with Gozreh's tridentare melee touch attacks.\
  \ The bolt deals 1d8 points of electricity damage + 1 point per 2 caster levels\
  \ (maximum +10). Since the bolt is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply\
  \ to the damage. The bolt can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw,\
  \ dry sticks, and cloth."
