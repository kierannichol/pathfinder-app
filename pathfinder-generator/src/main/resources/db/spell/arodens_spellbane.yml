description: "One of many spells originally created by the Last Azlanti before he\
  \ became a god, Aroden's spellbanecreates an area within which spells selected by\
  \ you simply do not function. Select one spell per five caster levels at the time\
  \ of casting. The spells selected cannot be changed after the spell is cast. Aroden's\
  \ spellbaneotherwise functions like antimagic field, except its emanation only prevents\
  \ the functioning of the selected spells. Only the exact spells mentioned are affected--a\
  \ spellbaneset to prevent the casting of summon nature's ally IIwould not prevent\
  \ castings of summon nature's ally Ior summon nature's ally III. If you move into\
  \ an area where a previously cast spell you have selected as a banned spell is in\
  \ effect, that spell is affected as if by antimagic field. If the spell affects\
  \ a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check\
  \ against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out."
