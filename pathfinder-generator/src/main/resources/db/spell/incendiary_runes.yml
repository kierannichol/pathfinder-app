description: "This spell functions as explosive runes, except it creates a small surge\
  \ of flames rather than an explosion of force. The runes automatically deal 1d6\
  \ points of fire damage to any creatures and objects in adjacent squares, and those\
  \ creatures and objects catch fire unless they succeed at Reflex saves."
