description: "The joints of a creature affected by this spell stiffen and swell, making\
  \ movement painful and slow. The target takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per\
  \ caster level. Additionally, the target takes a â€“4 penalty to Dexterity and its\
  \ movement speed decreases by 10 feet; these additional effects last for 1 minute\
  \ per caster level, though another creature can spend 1 minute and attempt a DC\
  \ 25 Heal check to end them early. A successful save halves the nonlethal damage\
  \ and negates the penalty to Dexterity and movement."
