name: "Message"
description: "You can whisper messages and receive whispered replies. Those nearby\
  \ can hear these messages with a DC 25 Perception check. You point your finger at\
  \ each creature you want to receive the message. When you whisper, the whispered\
  \ message is audible to all targeted creatures within range. Magical silence, 1\
  \ foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of\
  \ wood or dirt blocks the spell. The message does not have to travel in a straight\
  \ line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between you and the\
  \ subject, and the path's entire length lies within the spell's range. The creatures\
  \ that receive the message can whisper a reply that you hear. The spell transmits\
  \ sound, not meaning; it doesn't transcend language barriers. To speak a message,\
  \ you must mouth the words and whisper."
