description: "You infuse the target with power from the Abyss, granting it the fiendish\
  \ creature simple template. The swarm gains DR 5/good if it has at least 5 Hit Dice,\
  \ or DR 10/good it if has at least 11 HD. It gains cold resistance 5 and fire resistance\
  \ 5 if it has at least 5 HD, or cold resistance 10 and fire resistance 10 if it\
  \ has at least 11 HD. It gains spell resistance equal to its CR + 6. Once per day,\
  \ it can smite good (as a swift action against a good opponent, the vermin adds\
  \ its Charisma bonus to its attack rolls and its HD to its damage rolls until the\
  \ opponent is dead). If the targeted vermin is under your command, it automatically\
  \ fails its saving throw against this spell. This spell has no effect on vermin\
  \ that already have the fiendish creature simple template."
