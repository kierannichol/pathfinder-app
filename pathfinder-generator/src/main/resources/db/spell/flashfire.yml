description: "You cause flames to spring up in the area of effect. These flames deal\
  \ 1d6 points of fire damage for every 3 caster levels you have (maximum 5d6) to\
  \ each creature that enters a burning area or begins its turn in the area; these\
  \ creatures also catch on fire. A creature that succeeds at a Reflex save negates\
  \ the damage and avoids catching on fire. The area and all adjacent 5-foot squares\
  \ are smoky, providing concealment within. You can concentrate as a standard action\
  \ to ignite one 5-foot square adjacent to a currently burning square. Heavy precipitation\
  \ (including sleet storm) ends the spell. Strong and severe winds spread each square\
  \ of flashfire downwind by one square each round, but windstorm-force or stronger\
  \ winds extinguish the fires."
