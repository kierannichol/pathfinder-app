description: "Ammunition in the target firearm generates less of an explosive charge\
  \ when fired. With such ammunition, the firearm's range increment is halved and\
  \ the firer takes a â€“2 penalty on damage rolls. If aware of this spell's effect\
  \ prior to firing the altered ammunition (a DC 16 Spellcraft check to identify the\
  \ spell being cast or similar effect), the firearm's user can spend a standard action\
  \ to clear the altered ammunition from the firearm. Doing so destroys that ammunition."
