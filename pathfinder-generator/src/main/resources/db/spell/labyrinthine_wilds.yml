    Effect: "The primary caster must prepare for this ritual by walking a path along\
      \ the outer edge of the desired area--an act that likely takes longer than the\
      \ ritual casting time. As the primary caster walks this path, she must periodically\
      \ mark the area with tiny runes. Once the primary caster returns to her starting\
      \ point, and assuming the area she outlined is less than 2 square miles per\
      \ character level she has, the actual casting of the ritual can begin. At this\
      \ point, all casters cross the threshold to enter the region and then begin\
      \ following a series of erratic paths, each using the material component divining\
      \ runes as they wander aimlessly. Completing this ritual creates a powerful\
      \ obfuscating effect, affecting creatures entering the area surrounded by the\
      \ primary caster's initial walk."
