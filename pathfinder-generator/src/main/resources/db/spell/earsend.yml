description: "You cause one of your ears to tear itself free of your body and transform\
  \ into a fly-like magical creature you control. This functions like skinsendUM,\
  \ except your ear is a Fine construct with a fly speed equal to your base speed\
  \ and a bonus on Fly checks equal to half your caster level. Your sense of hearing\
  \ functions from your animated ear as if it were connected to your head, allowing\
  \ you to hear as well as you normally could from your animated ear's vantage point."
