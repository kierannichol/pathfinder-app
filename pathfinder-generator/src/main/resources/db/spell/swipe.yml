description: "By flicking a finger in the appropriate direction and proclaiming ownership,\
  \ you attempt to magically wrest an item from the target's grip and summon it to\
  \ your hand. To claim an object held by an opponent, you must make a CMB check--this\
  \ check has a bonus equal to your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma\
  \ modifier (whichever is highest). If you fail this check, the target retains the\
  \ item and the spell fails. If you succeed, the item teleports into one of your\
  \ free hands or comes to rest at your feet."
