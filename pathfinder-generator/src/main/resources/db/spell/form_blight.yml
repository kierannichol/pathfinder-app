    Effect: "The primary caster leads a grueling session of incantations and feats\
      \ of physical prowess throughout a specific type of terrain. Example terrain\
      \ types include (but are not limited to) cave, desert, forest, mountain, sewer,\
      \ swamp, or tundra. This ritual corrupts the affected area, summoning forth\
      \ a blight (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 6 38) associated with the terrain as well\
      \ as turning the affected area into the blight's cursed domain. The DC for skill\
      \ checks associated with this ritual is 24 plus the CR of the associated blight\
      \ (for example, DC 37 for a desert blight, DC 40 for a tundra blight, and so\
      \ on). During the ritual's enactment, the primary caster guides any secondary\
      \ casters through the terrain, defiling the area with blasphemous words from\
      \ a long-extinct, primordial language. A bone altar, often assembled from sacrificed\
      \ animals or humanoids, must stand at the center of the area to be affected,\
      \ and is the starting and ending point of the ritual. Once the surrounding area\
      \ is suitably prepared, the primary caster deposits the preserved hearts into\
      \ the altar. If the ritual is successful, the associated blight bubbles forth\
      \ from within the altar, formed from the alchemical soup that the altar contains."
