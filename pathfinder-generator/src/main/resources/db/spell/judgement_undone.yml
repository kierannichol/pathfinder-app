description: "This powerful, elaborate, and risky spell undoes Pharasma's judgment,\
  \ returning a willing petitioner to its mortal life. This spell must be cast on\
  \ the plane to which the petitioner was sent, and the petitioner must be present\
  \ for the entire casting. In addition, the caster must provide a specific object\
  \ that the petitioner valued deeply in its mortal life as a focus for the spell.\
  \ This is different for every petitioner and usually requires research to discover,\
  \ although those who knew the petitioner well in life can often identify the item\
  \ easily. At the completion of the spell's casting, the petitioner returns to the\
  \ mortal form it had as a young adult, with all of its memories and class levels\
  \ (or equivalent statistics) intact."
