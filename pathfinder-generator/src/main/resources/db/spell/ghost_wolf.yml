description: "This spell conjures a Large, quasi-real, wolflike creature made of roiling\
  \ black smoke. It functions as phantom steed, except as noted above. In addition,\
  \ the creature radiates an aura of fear. Any creature with fewer than 6 Hit Dice\
  \ within 30 feet (except the ghost wolfâ€˜s rider) must make a Will save or become\
  \ shaken for 1d4 rounds (this is a mind-affecting fear effect). A creature that\
  \ makes its Will save is unaffected by the steed's fear aura for 24 hours."
