description: "This potent curse weighs upon the target's soul, hastening a living\
  \ creature's journey to the Boneyard upon death or weakening an undead creature's\
  \ animating force. A living creature that dies during the spell's duration cannot\
  \ be affected by breath of life or similar effects, and the period during which\
  \ attempts to restore the target to life can succeed is reduced to 1 hour/level\
  \ (for raise dead), 1 day/level (for resurrection), or 10 days/level (for true resurrection).\
  \ Reincarnate and similar effects work normally on a creature killed under this\
  \ spell's effects."
