  \ this spell, you channel the fury and the abilities of thanatotic titans, gaining\
  \ some of their abilities for a short period of time. When you hit a creature capable\
  \ of casting divine spells, that creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or\
  \ be unable to cast divine spells for 1d4 rounds and be shaken for the same duration.\
  \ If the save is successful, the target is instead shaken for only 1 round."
