name: "Fire Sneeze"
description: "This spell causes you to begin sneezing gouts of fire that can not only\
  \ set creatures ablaze but also drop them flat on their backs. Once you cast this\
  \ spell, you must sneeze each round as a standard action--you can take no other\
  \ standard action as long as this spell is in effect, nor can you take full-round\
  \ actions. Each time you sneeze, you produce a 10-foot-long cone of fire and wind.\
  \ All creatures caught in this cone take 2d6 points of fire damage--a successful\
  \ Reflex save halves this damage. Any creature that fails to resist this spell with\
  \ a Reflex save must immediately make a DC 12 Fortitude save or be knocked prone\
  \ by the blast of wind associated with the sneeze."
