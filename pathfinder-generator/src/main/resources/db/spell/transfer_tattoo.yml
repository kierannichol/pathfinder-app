name: "Transfer Tattoo"
description: "With this spell, you can transfer one magic tattoo from one creature\
  \ to another. A target that isn't willing to have his tattoo removed or to receive\
  \ the transferred tattoo can resist this spell with a Fortitude save--if successful,\
  \ the transfer fails and the caster of this spell is staggered for 1 round by the\
  \ backlash of magical energy. A tattoo can be transferred from a dead creature in\
  \ this manner to a living host, provided the body has been dead no longer than one\
  \ hour per caster level."
