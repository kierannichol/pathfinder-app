description: "This spell creates an animated replica of the target drawn from the\
  \ target's subconscious. This living memory is an animated form of the target's\
  \ negative thoughts and emotions and is intent on destroying the target entirely.\
  \ The living memory appears to be an exact replica of the target creature, but upon\
  \ inspection it is obviously a construct. It uses the statistics of a clockwork\
  \ angel except that it has an Intelligence of 10 and does not have the clockwork\
  \ trait, the enhance weapon ability, or vulnerability to electricity. If the living\
  \ memory is destroyed, it vanishes entirely, including any replicas of equipment."
