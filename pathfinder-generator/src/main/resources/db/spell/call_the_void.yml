description: "This spell surrounds you with an aura of nothingness that channels the\
  \ mysterious energies of the Dark Tapestry. Creatures adjacent to you when this\
  \ spell is cast and at the start of your turn take 2d6 points of damage. In addition,\
  \ creatures affected by your aura are fatigued, cannot breathe, and cannot speak\
  \ or cast spells with somatic components. Creatures adjacent to you are allowed\
  \ a Reflex save to halve the damage and negate the fatigue effect, but cannot breathe\
  \ or speak regardless of whether their save is successful as long as they are adjacent\
  \ to you."
