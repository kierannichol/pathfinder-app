name: "Fungal Blisters"
description: "When you cast this spell, horrible, fungal growths sprout forth all\
  \ over your body. You develop 1d2+1 of these blisters per 2 caster levels. Each\
  \ time you are dealt more than 5 points of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage\
  \ from a single attack, one of these blisters bursts, releasing a cloud of harmful\
  \ spores in a 5-foot-radius burst centered on you. These spores enter the lungs\
  \ of all living creatures within the cloud that need to breathe and deal 1d6+1 points\
  \ of damage for every 2 caster levels you have (Fortitude negates). This is a disease\
  \ effect, and you and plants aren't affected by the spores. It is possible for more\
  \ than one blister to burst in a single round. If you are reduced to 0 or fewer\
  \ hit points, all remaining blisters burst, and the resulting spores deal the cumulative\
  \ amount of damage."
