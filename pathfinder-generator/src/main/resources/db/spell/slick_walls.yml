name: "Slick Walls"
description: "You coat all walls and ceilings within the spell's area with a slick\
  \ substance. The DC of all Climb checks for the affected surfaces increases by twice\
  \ your caster level (maximum +20). Creatures cannot take 10 on Climb checks while\
  \ scaling the affected surfaces, even if they have a climb speed or other ability\
  \ that would normally allow taking 10. This spell has no effect on magical walls\
  \ or surfaces, such as the sides of a hole created with create pitAPG."
