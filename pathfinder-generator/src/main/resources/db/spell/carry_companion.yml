description: "You touch an animal or magical beast that has a helpful attitude toward\
  \ you, instantly transforming the creature into a miniature figurine of stone, small\
  \ enough to fit into the palm of your hand. Creatures with an attitude of less than\
  \ helpful will not tolerate this spell, and it automatically fails to work on them.\
  \ An intelligent animal or magical beast must be a willing subject in order for\
  \ this spell to take effect. Any items that the creature wears (such as a harness\
  \ or saddle) or carries (such as those stowed in saddlebags) are transformed along\
  \ with the creature."
