name: "Covetous Aura"
description: "Anytime a harmless (so noted by a spell's saving throw description)\
  \ spell of 3rd level or lower is cast within a covetous aura's area of effect, you\
  \ may choose to immediately gain the benefit of that spell as if it had also targeted\
  \ you. The intended target still gains the effect of the spell. You gain the benefits\
  \ of this duplicated spell only if the caster is in range of the covetous aura.\
  \ Each time a covetous aura duplicates a spell effect, the remaining duration of\
  \ the covetous aura is reduced by a number of rounds equal to the spell level of\
  \ the spell effect that is duplicated."
