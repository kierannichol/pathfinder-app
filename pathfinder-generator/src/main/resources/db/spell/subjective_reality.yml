description: "Choose one object, creature, or force you can see within long range\
  \ (400 ft. + 40 ft./level). You alter your perceptions to become convinced the target\
  \ is an illusion. For you, the target becomes transparent and does not create sound\
  \ or smell. Until the spell ends, you can move through the target unimpeded and\
  \ the target can move through you. The target's nonmagical attacks cannot harm you,\
  \ and the target's magical attacks deal half damage to you. The target's non-damaging\
  \ magical abilities have a 50% chance not to affect you, and you are immune to all\
  \ its sonic, language-dependent, and scentbased attacks. However, your attacks deal\
  \ no damage to the target, and your magical abilities do not affect the target at\
  \ all. You or the target can affect each other normally through intermediaries.\
  \ For instance, while the target would be immune to the direct effects of your earthquake\
  \ spell, if the spell caused a room's ceiling to collapse, the target would not\
  \ be immune to the effects of the collapse."
