name: "Rune of Rule"
description: "Investigations into the ancient and mysterious traditions of the seven\
  \ virtues of rule of the lost human empire of Azlant, which were later corrupted\
  \ by the runelords into the more familiar seven deadly sins, inspired the Cyphermages\
  \ to develop the runes of rule. This spell allows you to place a rune upon another\
  \ creature that can then be used to aid it at a later time. You determine the spell's\
  \ effect at the time of casting by using your finger to paint a specific rune on\
  \ the recipient's body with a dose of specially prepared paint worth 25 gp. The\
  \ inscribed rune lasts for 24 hours or until the spell is activated. Unless otherwise\
  \ noted, the creature upon which the rune of rule has been inscribed can activate\
  \ it at any time as a swift action. If the spell effect isn't used, all markings\
  \ associated with the rune disappear and the effect fades. You can never place the\
  \ spell upon yourself--it must be bestowed on someone else. The seven runes of rule,\
  \ along with their specific effects when the user activates them, are listed below.\
  \ A creature can bear only one rune of rule at a time."
