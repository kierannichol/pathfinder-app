description: "You test a creature's purity of convictions by exposing it to a sheet\
  \ of divine fire. Unless the target's alignment is within one step of your deity's,\
  \ the spell deals 1d6 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d6 points of\
  \ damage). Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from\
  \ divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to firebased\
  \ attacks. Additionally, if the target has an element of its alignment that is in\
  \ direct opposition to your (chaos opposes law and evil opposes good), you can also\
  \ attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target as a free action."
