description: "You draw upon the memories of the targets to create a visual disguise\
  \ for yourself that only they can see. When you cast the spell, you choose an emotion\
  \ from the table below. Each target perceives you as a creature it feels that way\
  \ toward. If it doesn't feel that way toward anyone, it instead perceives you as\
  \ a stranger with features likely to evoke that emotion (e.g., if you choose respect,\
  \ a guard who was taught to respect her elders but who currently knows no elders\
  \ might see you as an elderly version of yourself). Since you don't know how you\
  \ will appear to each target, you must match your actions and statements to fit\
  \ with the illusion as best you can. While the spell grants a +10 bonus on Disguise\
  \ checks like disguise self does, you also take a –5 penalty on Disguise checks\
  \ until you can get a sense of who the target thinks you are. Each target who fails\
  \ to disbelieve the phantasm and is fooled by your Disguise check takes a –2 penalty\
  \ on Sense Motive checks to notice your lies, and each emotion choice grants you\
  \ an additional benefit against such targets, as listed in the table below. Emotion\
  \ Effect Fear +4 bonus on Intimidate checks Hate +2 bonus on attack rolls, -2 penalty\
  \ to AC Lust +4 bonus on Sleight of Hands checks Respect +4 bonus on Diplomacy checks\
  \ Trust +4 bonus on Bluff checks"
