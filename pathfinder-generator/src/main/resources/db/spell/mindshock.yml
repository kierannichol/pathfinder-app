description: "You charge yourself with violent psychic energy so attacks you make\
  \ with weapons, natural weapons, and unarmed strikes cause the target to recall\
  \ pain suffered in the past. Such attacks deal 1d4 points of nonlethal damage in\
  \ addition to their normal damage, though creatures immune to mind-affecting or\
  \ pain effects ignore this additional damage. In addition, when you confirm a critical\
  \ hit, the target is confused for 1 round by the pain. Creatures immune to critical\
  \ hits, mind-affecting, or pain effects ignore the confusion. Even if you confirm\
  \ multiple critical hits while this spell is in effect, an individual creature can\
  \ only be confused by a single casting of mindshock once."
