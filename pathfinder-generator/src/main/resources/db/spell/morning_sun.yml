description: "This spell conjures a miniature sphere of sunlight, approximately the\
  \ size of a human fist, at a desired location within range. The sphere sheds bright\
  \ light in a 60-foot-radius burst. Creatures that take penalties in bright light\
  \ do so while within the sphere's area of illumination. Creatures that start their\
  \ turns within the area of illumination and that are damaged or destroyed by sunlight\
  \ must succeed at a Fortitude save or become staggered until 1d4+1 rounds after\
  \ they leave the affected area. Non-creatures, such as hazardous fungi and mold\
  \ that are destroyed by sunlight, become inert for the duration of the spell. The\
  \ sphere cannot be moved from the place it was cast. The sphere deals 10d6 points\
  \ of fire damage to anything it touches and anything that passes within 5 feet of\
  \ it. A successful Reflex save reduces this damage by half."
