description: "The target creature's blood becomes poisonous. Anytime the target takes\
  \ piercing or slashing damage, a spray of acidic blood spurts from its body in the\
  \ direction of the opponent who inflicted the wound. This blood travels in a 10-foot\
  \ line, striking the first creature or object it touches. A creature struck by the\
  \ blood is exposed to black adder venom and must save against the poison as normal,\
  \ with a DC equal to the spell's DC."
