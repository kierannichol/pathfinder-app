description: "You create an extradimensional link between yourself and one summoned\
  \ creature you control that allows you to switch places. After casting master's\
  \ escape, you can teleport to your summoned creature's space as a swift action,\
  \ causing your summoned creature to teleport to your former space. If your summoned\
  \ creature is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points before you can use this spell's effect,\
  \ you can teleport to a space that you can see within 30 feet as an immediate action.\
  \ After using either of these effects, the spell ends. A summoner can target his\
  \ eidolon with this spell."
