name: "Authenticating Gaze"
description: "Your understanding of the written word becomes analytical and discerning.\
  \ You gain an insight bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +10) on Appraise\
  \ checks to determine the value of books and scrolls and on Linguistics checks to\
  \ detect forgeries, and you can attempt a Linguistics check to detect a forged document\
  \ at a glance, rather than taking the normal 1 round of examination per page. In\
  \ addition, you immediately detect whether written works within 30 feet and within\
  \ your line of sight have a magical aura and the strength of any such auras, as\
  \ though you had concentrated on each written work for 1 round using detect magic."
