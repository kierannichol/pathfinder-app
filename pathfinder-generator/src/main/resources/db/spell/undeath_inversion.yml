description: "You alter an undead creature's energy affinity so that it takes damage\
  \ from negative energy and gains healing from positive energy, as if it were a living\
  \ creature. If the target was able to channel negative energy or produce negative\
  \ energy effects (such as inflict spells), these abilities produce positive energy\
  \ instead, healing living targets and harming the undead. The target cannot impose\
  \ negative levels on other creatures for the duration of the spell. The target's\
  \ creature type does not change, and it is still considered an undead creature.\
  \ Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to end the\
  \ effect. This is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity."
