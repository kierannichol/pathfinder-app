description: "When you cast this spell, you conjure a single ball of sticky mud and\
  \ launch it at an enemy's face as a ranged touch attack. If the mudball hits, the\
  \ target is blinded. Each round at the beginning of its turn, a creature blinded\
  \ by this spell can attempt a Reflex saving throw to shake off the mud, ending the\
  \ effect. The mudball can also be wiped off by the creature affected by it or by\
  \ a creature adjacent to the creature affected by it as a standard action."
