name: "Lend Judgment"
description: "You create a conduit of divine knowledge and outrage between you and\
  \ an ally. That ally gains the benefit of one of your active judgments (as do you).\
  \ If you cannot use a judgment (for example, if you are not in combat, are frightened\
  \ or unconscious, and so on) or change judgments, the ally loses the benefit of\
  \ the judgment. If you have multiple judgments active, the ally gains only one,\
  \ chosen when you cast this spell."
