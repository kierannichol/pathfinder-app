name: "Firebrand"
description: "You mark several allies with a flaming rune. This rune does not cause\
  \ damage, and sheds light as if it were a torch. While the firebrandburns, any creature\
  \ it marks is immune to damage from any fire spell you cast. All of the target's\
  \ weapons (both natural and manufactured) inflict +1d6 points of fire damage on\
  \ a hit (this bonus fire damage stacks with any amount of fire damage a creature's\
  \ weapons might already inflict). At any point during the spell's duration, a creature\
  \ bearing a firebrandcan launch a beam of fire at any target within 30 feet as a\
  \ swift action. This ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 6d6 points\
  \ of fire damage. Once a creature uses its firebrandto fire a ray in this manner,\
  \ the effects of the spell end for that creature."
