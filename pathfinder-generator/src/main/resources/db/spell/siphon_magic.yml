description: "This spell attempts to transfer a magical effect from a creature you\
  \ touch to yourself. When you touch the creature, siphon magicattempts to end one\
  \ ongoing spell that has been cast on that creature, as if via a targeted dispel\
  \ magic. If you know the specific spell effect you wish to target, you can name\
  \ that spell effect to target that specific spell; otherwise siphon magic begins\
  \ with the highest-level spell in effect and works its way down through all spells\
  \ affecting the target until it dispels one or runs out of effects, as per dispel\
  \ magic."
