description: "You immediately discover some of the spells that the target knows or\
  \ has prepared. The number of spells revealed to you is equal to your caster level.\
  \ The target's lowest-level spells are revealed first--ignoring 0-level spells--in\
  \ a random order. Once all of the target's 1st-level spells are revealed, the spell\
  \ begins revealing 2nd-level spells, then 3rd-level spells. This spell does not\
  \ reveal spells of 4th level or higher, nor does it reveal spelllike abilities or\
  \ other special abilities. If cast on a creature that is not a spellcaster, that\
  \ has only 0-level spells or spells of 4th level or higher prepared, that has expended\
  \ all of its spells, or that has not prepared any spells that day, the spell has\
  \ no effect."
