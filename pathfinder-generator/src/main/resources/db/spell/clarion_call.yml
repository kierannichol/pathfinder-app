description: "The subject of this spell gains two benefits. First, the affected creature\
  \ gains the ability to create a sound like the blast of a mighty horn or trumpet\
  \ simply by miming the action of sounding one. Second, the subject can speak in\
  \ a booming voice that carries easily over great distances, lowering the DC of any\
  \ check to hear what is said by â€“15. This spell is particularly prized by battlefield\
  \ commanders and champions who wish to make themselves clearly heard or gain the\
  \ attention of their allies or foes."
