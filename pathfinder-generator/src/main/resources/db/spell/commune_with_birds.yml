name: "Commune with Birds"
description: "You utter a question in the form of a low-pitched bird call that can\
  \ be heard up to a mile away, and can understand the responses given by birds in\
  \ the area. Over the next 10 minutes, the birds reply as if you had asked them the\
  \ question using speak with animals, giving you a general consensus answer to the\
  \ question based on their knowledge. For example, you could ask if there is drinkable\
  \ water in the area, the location of predators or other creatures, directions to\
  \ a mountaintop or other natural feature, and so on, and the local bird communities\
  \ would answer to the best of their ability."
