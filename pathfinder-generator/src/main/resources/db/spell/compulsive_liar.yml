description: "The target becomes unable to speak the truth. Lies the target speaks\
  \ don't need to be convincing, nor do they even need to be consistent, but they\
  \ can't be true as far as the target is aware. This extends to non-verbal communication,\
  \ such as hand signs or written notes. The spell allows talking in metaphors and\
  \ talking about fictional figures."
