name: "Honeyed Tongue"
description: "This spell augments your diplomacies. While under the effects of spell,\
  \ you roll two dice each time you make a Diplomacy check to change a creature's\
  \ attitude, taking the highest roll. If this results in a roll low enough to reduce\
  \ the creature's attitude by a step, that creature gets some clue that you are manipulating\
  \ it with a spell. Alternatively you can cast this spell before making a Diplomacy\
  \ check to gather information, gaining a +5 competence bonus on the check."
