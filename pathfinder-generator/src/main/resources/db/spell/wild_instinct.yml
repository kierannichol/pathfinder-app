description: "This spell sharpens your senses, allowing you to perceive threats you\
  \ would otherwise miss. You become aware of sounds and smells you would normally\
  \ overlook, and even retain the ability to detect threats when soundly asleep. For\
  \ the duration of the spell, you gain a +5 bonus on Perception checks to act in\
  \ a surprise round. Additionally, you don't take a penalty on Perception checks\
  \ while sleeping, and can choose to wake if you notice a threat while asleep."
