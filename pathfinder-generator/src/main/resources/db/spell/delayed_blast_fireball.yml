name: "Delayed Blast Fireball"
description: "This spell functions like fireball, except that it is more powerful\
  \ and can detonate up to 5 rounds after the spell is cast. The burst of flame deals\
  \ 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). The glowing bead created\
  \ by delayed blast fireball can detonate immediately if you desire, or you can choose\
  \ to delay the burst for as many as 5 rounds. You select the amount of delay upon\
  \ completing the spell, and that time cannot change once it has been set unless\
  \ someone touches the bead. If you choose a delay, the glowing bead sits at its\
  \ destination until it detonates. A creature can pick up and hurl the bead as a\
  \ thrown weapon (range increment 10 feet). If a creature handles and moves the bead\
  \ within 1 round of its detonation, there is a 25% chance that the bead detonates\
  \ while being handled."
