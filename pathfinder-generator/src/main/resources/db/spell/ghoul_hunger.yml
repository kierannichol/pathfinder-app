name: "Ghoul Hunger"
description: "You awaken an unnatural hunger in the target, compelling it to fall\
  \ upon a nearby helpless or dead humanoid creature and begin eating its flesh. The\
  \ target defends itself normally but takes no other actions while eating. The target\
  \ does not take extraordinary risks to satisfy this urge (it wouldn't jump over\
  \ a pit or swim through lava to reach a suitable victim). If the target can't fulfill\
  \ this urge on its next turn, the spell fails. Each round on its turn, the target\
  \ can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect."
