description: "You contact the spirits of your ancestors and use their great wisdom\
  \ to bolster your own knowledge. Consulting with the spirits is a full-round action.\
  \ If you consult with the spirits before making a Knowledge check, you gain a +4\
  \ insight bonus on the check. If you have already failed at a Knowledge check, you\
  \ may consult with your ancestors and make another attempt. The insight bonus on\
  \ these checks increases to +6 at caster level 7th and +8 at caster level 11th.\
  \ You may consult with the spirits for this purpose as often as you like while the\
  \ spell remains in effect. Only you can hear the spirits speak to you."
