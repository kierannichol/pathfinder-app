description: "This spell functions like gaseous form, except the target becomes a\
  \ visible swirl of hot ash and smoke instead of harmless translucent gas. The target\
  \ gains the fire subtype. Any creature that begins its turn sharing a space with\
  \ the target takes 2d6 points of fire damage and must make a Fortitude save (DC\
  \ 15, + 1 per previous check) or suffer the effects of smoke inhalation."
