name: "Cushioning Bands"
description: "Invisible bands of force encircle vital areas of the target. The bands\
  \ resist crushing forces and impacts without interfering with movement. The target\
  \ gains DR 2/piercing or slashing and takes half damage from constriction, falling,\
  \ and being buried, as well as from similar crushing effects such as crushing hand.\
  \ Grapple checks for attacks other than constricting (such as pinning or swallowing\
  \ whole) are not affected. Once the spell has blocked 12 points of damage per caster\
  \ level (to a maximum of 120 points at 10th level), it is discharged. The bands\
  \ have no effect on incorporeal attacks unless they deal damage from constriction\
  \ or crushing, or unless the attacks would be subject to damage reduction."
