description: "You alter wind force in the area surrounding you. You can make the wind\
  \ blow in a certain direction or manner, increase its strength, or decrease its\
  \ strength. The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell ends or\
  \ until you choose to alter your handiwork, which requires concentration. You may\
  \ create an â€œeye\" of calm air up to 80 feet in diameter at the center of the area\
  \ if you so desire, and you may choose to limit the area to any cylindrical area\
  \ less than your full limit."
