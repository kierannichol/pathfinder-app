description: "You give a creature the ability to deal bleed damage when making natural\
  \ attacks so long as the attack deals slashing or piercing damage. This bleed damage\
  \ for each attack is equal to one-half your caster level (limited to the creature's\
  \ maximum damage with that attack), though bleed damage does not stack. When two\
  \ or more attacks deal bleed damage, take the worse effect."
