name: "Harmless Form"
description: "You transform the target into a harmless animal of the same approximate\
  \ body type. The form assumed must be one considered unobtrusive by local communities,\
  \ such as a cat, a dog, a hunting hawk, a horse, or a rat. This transformation can\
  \ reduce the target by up to two size categories, but cannot make an animal smaller\
  \ than Tiny. It cannot increase the size of the target or give it new natural attacks\
  \ or new forms of movement. The spell otherwise functions as beast shape II."
