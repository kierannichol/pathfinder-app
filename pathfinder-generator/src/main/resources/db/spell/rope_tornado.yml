description: "A spiraling twister of tornado-force wind surges forth from your palm,\
  \ unbalancing those it rushes over. Creatures on the ground within the area are\
  \ knocked prone. A flying creature within the spell's area must instead succeed\
  \ at a DC 25 Fly check or plummet to the ground, taking the appropriate amount of\
  \ falling damage. Creatures that are Huge or larger in size gain a +2 bonus on their\
  \ Reflex saves, while creatures that are Medium or smaller in size take a â€“2 penalty."
