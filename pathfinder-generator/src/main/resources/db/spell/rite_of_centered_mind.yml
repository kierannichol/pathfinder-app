description: "You heighten your awareness of your own thoughts, allowing you to more\
  \ easily resist outside influences. You gain a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws\
  \ to resist mind-affecting effects. This resistance bonus is increased to +2 if\
  \ the effect is an emotion or fear effect. Additionally, at any time during the\
  \ spell's duration, whenever you fail a saving throw to resist a mind-affecting\
  \ effect, you can expend the spell's remaining duration as an immediate action in\
  \ order to reroll that saving throw. You must take the second result, even if it's\
  \ worse. The +2 resistance bonus granted by the spell applies to the reroll, but\
  \ after you make this reroll, the spell ends."
