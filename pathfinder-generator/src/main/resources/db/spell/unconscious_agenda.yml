name: "Unconscious Agenda"
description: "This spell plants a subconscious directive in the target's mind that\
  \ forces him to act as you dictate when specific circumstances arise. The target\
  \ humanoid can be either conscious or unconscious, but must understand your language.\
  \ Upon casting this spell, you must state a course of action you wish the target\
  \ to take. This course of action must be described in 20 words or fewer. You must\
  \ then state the condition under which you wish the target to take this action,\
  \ also describing it in 20 or fewer words. Actions or conditions more elaborate\
  \ than 20 words cause the spell to fail. Unconscious agenda cannot compel a target\
  \ to kill himself, though it can compel him to perform exceedingly dangerous acts,\
  \ face impossible odds, or undertake almost any other course of activity. You cannot\
  \ issue new commands to the target after the spell is cast."
