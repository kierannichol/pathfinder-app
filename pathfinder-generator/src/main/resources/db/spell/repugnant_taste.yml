description: "The target creature begins sweating a foul liquid that makes it repugnant\
  \ to most living creatures. When a creature deals damage to the affected creature\
  \ with a bite attack or the swallow whole ability, it must succeed at a Fortitude\
  \ saving throw or become nauseated until the end of its next turn. After a creature\
  \ has become nauseated by this spell, each subsequent failed saving throw against\
  \ the spell instead gives it the sickened condition until the end of its next turn."
