name: "Wall of Suppression"
description: "You create a wall of glittering motes that suppresses or even negates\
  \ any magical effect passing through it. The wall appears to have no actual substance\
  \ and does not physically obstruct or impede anything attempting to move through\
  \ it. However, the wall exerts a powerful anti-magical effect. Any magic item or\
  \ magical spell or effect of your caster level or lower that passes through the\
  \ wall is suppressed for 1 round per level. Spells or effects with durations expire\
  \ normally, even while thus suppressed. A spell or effect with a duration greater\
  \ than that of the suppression effect resumes functioning normally when the suppression\
  \ ends. The wall affects all magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities,\
  \ magical items, and any effects stemming from them that pass through the wall.\
  \ The wall does not suppress a creature's ability to cast spells, use spell-like\
  \ abilities, or any other sort of limited-use abilities even if the wall suppresses\
  \ a particular application of those abilities. However, if a creature with magical\
  \ abilities that are constant or otherwise always active passes through the wall,\
  \ those abilities are suppressed for the normal duration."
