description: "With a touch, you cause a glowing rune to appear on a single weapon,\
  \ granting that weapon the flamingproperty (and allowing it to cause an extra 1d6\
  \ points of fire damage on a successful hit). If you are using the judgment class\
  \ feature, your weapon gains the flaming burstproperty instead. The spell functions\
  \ only for weapons that you wield. If the weapon leaves your hand for any reason,\
  \ the spell effect ends. The effects of this spell do not stack with any existing\
  \ flamingor flaming burstweapon property that the target weapon may already possess."
