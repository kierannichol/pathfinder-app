description: "When you cast this spell, you fall into a trance and become helpless\
  \ as long as you continue concentrating. Choose any one Knowledge skill other than\
  \ arcana or planes. Your mind is placed in telepathic contact with a nalfeshnee\
  \ demon skilled at that particular Knowledge skill, in addition to arcana and planes.\
  \ Each round that you continue to concentrate, you may ask the nalfeshnee one question\
  \ and it will answer as best it can. If you ask a question about arcana or planes,\
  \ the nalfeshnee has a +23 bonus to the skill check. If you ask about the Knowledge\
  \ skill you selected, the nalfeshnee has a +20 bonus. It cannot answer questions\
  \ pertaining to other Knowledge skills--to do so, you must cast the spell again."
