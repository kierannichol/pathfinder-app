description: "Drawing upon positive energy, you emulate some of a paladin's power\
  \ to smite undead. Choose one undead creature as your target. Your melee attacks\
  \ against that target gain a bonus equal to your Charisma or Wisdom modifier, whichever\
  \ is higher, on your attack rolls, and a bonus equal to your caster level on damage\
  \ rolls. Your melee attacks also bypass the target's damage reduction. These bonuses\
  \ do not stack with the bonuses from a paladin's smite."
