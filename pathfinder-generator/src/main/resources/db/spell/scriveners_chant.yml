name: "Scrivener's Chant"
description: "This spell imbues a quill with animate energy and rapidly transcribes\
  \ words from one page to another. The quill copies a written work at the rate of\
  \ one normal-sized page per minute. The Linguistics skill can be used to make a\
  \ convincing copy, but otherwise the reproduction is written in the hand of the\
  \ caster. You must concentrate upon the material being duplicated for the spell's\
  \ duration and provide new blank pages as required. The scrivener's chant requires\
  \ blank paper and a quill or other writing materials, in addition to the material\
  \ components."
