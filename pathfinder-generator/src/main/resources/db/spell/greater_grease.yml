  \ must form a continuous area, each part of which must be within the spell's range.\
  \ When you use this spell to create a greasy coating on items, no two of the targeted\
  \ items can be more than 30 feet apart. You cannot target both items and surfaces\
  \ with a single casting of this spell."
