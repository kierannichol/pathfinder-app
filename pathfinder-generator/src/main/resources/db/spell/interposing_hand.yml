name: "Interposing Hand"
description: "Interposing hand creates a Large magic hand that appears between you\
  \ and one opponent. This floating, disembodied hand then moves to remain between\
  \ the two of you, regardless of where you move or how the opponent tries to get\
  \ around it, providing cover (+4 AC) for you against that opponent. Nothing can\
  \ fool the hand--it sticks with the selected opponent in spite of darkness, invisibility,\
  \ polymorphing, or any other attempt at hiding or disguise. The hand does not pursue\
  \ an opponent, however."
