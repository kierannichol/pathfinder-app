description: "This spell functions as symbol of death, except all creatures within\
  \ 60 feet of the symbol of healinginstead are bathed in positive energy and heal\
  \ 2d8 points + 1 point of damage per caster level (maximum +15). Undead and other\
  \ creatures harmed by positive energy instead take 2d8 points of damage + 1 point\
  \ per caster level (maximum +15); a Will save reduces this damage by half. A creature\
  \ can only be healed or harmed by the symbol once in any 24-hour period. Once triggered,\
  \ the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per caster level."
