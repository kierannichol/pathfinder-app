name: "Lover's Vengeance"
description: "You inspire yourself or a lover to a vengeful rage against a chosen\
  \ enemy, who must be a creature that has wronged you in some way. If cast on you,\
  \ the next time you are in combat with that enemy, you gain the benefits of a rage\
  \ spell. If cast on a lover, he or she gains the benefits of a rage spell the next\
  \ time the lover is in combat against your enemy. This variant of the spell must\
  \ be cast within 1 hour of an intimate encounter with the target. The rage effect\
  \ lasts 1 round per level. If the creature that triggers the rage effect is one\
  \ of your lovers or ex-lovers, the benefits granted by the rage spell double. This\
  \ spell counts as a contingency spell on the target for the purpose of multiple\
  \ contingent effects. Worshipers of Calistria are fond of using this spell, and\
  \ many keep the effect running whenever possible."
