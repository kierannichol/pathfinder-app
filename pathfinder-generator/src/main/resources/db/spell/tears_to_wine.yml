name: "Tears to Wine"
description: "Legend claims runelords used this spell to literally benefit from drinking\
  \ the tears of their captured foes. This spell turns nonmagic liquids--including\
  \ spoiled, rotten, diseased, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated drinks, tears,\
  \ seawater, and similar fluids--into mead or wine of average quality. This spell\
  \ does not prevent subsequent natural decay or spoilage. Unholy water and similar\
  \ liquids of significance are spoiled by tears to wine, but the spell has no effect\
  \ on creatures of any type or on magic potions."
