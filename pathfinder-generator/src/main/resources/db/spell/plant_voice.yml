description: "You grant one plant creature the ability to speak, hear, and understand\
  \ any of the languages you know. If you know more than one language, you may grant\
  \ the plant creature up to one language per 2 caster levels and you decide which\
  \ languages to grant when the spell is cast. This spell does not cause the plant\
  \ creature to be predisposed toward you in any way, but allows you to interact with\
  \ them with Charisma-based skills normally. Plant creatures with an Intelligence\
  \ score of 2 or lower can communicate and understand only the simplest of concepts,\
  \ such as “friend,\" “food,\" and “danger.\" This spell has no effect on ordinary\
  \ plants and fungus."
