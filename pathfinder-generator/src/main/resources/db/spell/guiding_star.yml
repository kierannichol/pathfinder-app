description: "You form a bond with your surroundings when you cast this spell. For\
  \ the remaining duration of the spell you can always, as a standard action, determine\
  \ your approximate distance from that area as well as the direction you must travel\
  \ in order to reach it. You cannot determine the location of the area if you are\
  \ on a different plane. The area counts as \"very familiar\" for the purposes of\
  \ teleportor similar spells. You can only attune yourself to one location at a time.\
  \ If you cast the spell at another spot you lose the ability to locate your original\
  \ area."
