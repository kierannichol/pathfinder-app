name: "Aram Zey's Focus"
description: "Aram Zey created this spell for use by his students, both to increase\
  \ their confidence in their skills and to ensure more of them survived encounters\
  \ with deadly traps. If you don't have the trapfinding class ability, this spell\
  \ grants you the trapfinding ability of a rogue of half your character level. If\
  \ you have the trapfinding ability granted by class levels, however, this spell\
  \ grants you a +5 competence bonus on all Disable Device checks made to disarm mechanical\
  \ (but not magical) traps. While under the effects of Aram Zey's focus, whenever\
  \ you trigger a trap by rolling poorly on a Disable Device check, you may roll a\
  \ second Disable Device check. This new roll uses the same modifiers as the first\
  \ roll. If your second roll is high enough to avoid accidentally springing the trap,\
  \ you avoid setting it off, but still fail to disarm it. Each time you take advantage\
  \ of this feature, the remaining duration of the spell is reduced by 1 minute--if\
  \ less than a minute's worth of duration remains, the spell ends as soon as you\
  \ reroll your Disable Device check."
