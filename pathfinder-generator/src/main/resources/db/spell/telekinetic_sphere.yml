name: "Telekinetic Sphere"
description: "This spell functions like resilient sphere, but the creatures or objects\
  \ caught inside the globe created by the spell are made nearly weightless. Anything\
  \ contained within a telekinetic sphere weighs only one-sixteenth of its normal\
  \ weight. You can telekinetically lift anything in the sphere that normally weighs\
  \ 5,000 pounds or less. The telekinetic control extends from you out to medium range\
  \ (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) after the sphere has succeeded in encapsulating\
  \ its contents."
