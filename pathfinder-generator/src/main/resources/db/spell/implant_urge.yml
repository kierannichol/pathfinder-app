name: "Implant Urge"
description: "You make the target unconsciously desire a goal you define when you\
  \ cast this spell. The DC of any Diplomacy check to ask the target to act in a way\
  \ that it believes will lead it toward that goal decreases by 5. The target takes\
  \ a â€“2 penalty on saving throws against mind-affecting effects that compel it to\
  \ act in a way that it believes will lead it toward that goal. Spells that reveal\
  \ the target's goals or thoughts reveal the implanted urge as the target's most\
  \ important goal and the target does not register as thinking of anything else as\
  \ long as it is presented with the focus of its urge or a way to move toward its\
  \ goal. Anyone studying the target's thoughts can notice the implanted nature of\
  \ this urge with a successful caster level check."
