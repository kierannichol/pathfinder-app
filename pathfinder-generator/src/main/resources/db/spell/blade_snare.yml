description: "This spell creates an invisible magic field that does not stop weapons\
  \ (whether manufactured or natural) from moving toward you, but impedes their motion\
  \ when they are retracted. When you are hit with a melee attack, attempt a caster\
  \ level check against your opponent's CMD. If your check succeeds, your opponent's\
  \ attacking weapon or body part becomes caught in the field, as if magically affixed\
  \ to your body. If your check fails, your opponent may retract its weapon."
