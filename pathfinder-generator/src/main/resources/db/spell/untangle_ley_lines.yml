    Effect: "The primary caster burns the incense in a perimeter around the witchgate\
      \ to soothe the site, then peels back the dimensional fabric, finds the knotted\
      \ ley lines, delicately unwinds them, steadies their energies, and closes the\
      \ rift. If the ritual is successful, the ley lines return to normal, forcing\
      \ the witchgate that tangled them to collapse. All casters automatically become\
      \ attuned to the unraveled ley lines, gaining a +5 bonus on skill checks to\
      \ cast occult rituals until they leave a 1-mile radius of the destroyed witchgate."
