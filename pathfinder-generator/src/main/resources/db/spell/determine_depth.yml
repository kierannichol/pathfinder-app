name: "Determine Depth"
description: "With a touch, you can determine the exact thickness of a wall, ceiling,\
  \ or other solid barrier, measuring from the point you are touching to the direct\
  \ opposite side of the barrier in a straight line. You can only detect depths or\
  \ widths of up to 10 feet per caster level (maximum 200 feet at 20th level); amounts\
  \ in excess of this limit are detected as being the maximum you are able to detect.\
  \ So, for example, a 5th-level wizard using this spell on a 60-foot-thick wall would\
  \ detect that the wall is 50 feet thick."
