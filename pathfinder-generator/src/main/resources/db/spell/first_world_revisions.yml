description: "This spell functions as ancestral regressionARG, except as noted above\
  \ and as follows. The wayang loses her darkvision racial trait and gains the low-light\
  \ vision racial trait in its place. The alignment and personality of the wayang\
  \ are not affected by the transformation, but the spell conceals her alignment as\
  \ per undetectable alignment. Unlike ancestral regression, this spell grants the\
  \ target a +20 bonus on Disguise checks to pass as a gnome; even though the wayang\
  \ appears as a gnomish analog of herself, the differences between gnomes and wayangs\
  \ are great enough that she cannot be mistaken for a gnome by other wayangs who\
  \ know her."
