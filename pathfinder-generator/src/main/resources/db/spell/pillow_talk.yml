name: "Pillow Talk"
description: "This spell can be cast only on a sleeping creature, which must be present\
  \ for the full duration of the casting time. You grant the semblance of wakefulness\
  \ to the target, allowing it to answer questions. You can ask one question per 2\
  \ caster levels. The target's knowledge is limited to what it normally knows, including\
  \ the languages it speaks. Answers are brief, cryptic, or repetitive, especially\
  \ if the creature would have opposed you when awake. If the target succeeds at a\
  \ Will save, it awakens (unless some force is preventing it from being awake, such\
  \ as magic or drugs), and it remains aware of the first question you asked. If the\
  \ target has been subject to pillow talk within the past week, the new spell fails.\
  \ While your questions don't otherwise wake the target, this spell does nothing\
  \ to prevent other sounds or stimulus from waking the target. A target who sleeps\
  \ through the spellcasting and duration of the spell has no memory of it taking\
  \ place, but a target who awakens before the spell ends remembers every question\
  \ asked and what answers it gave."
