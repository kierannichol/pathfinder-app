name: "Familiar Figment"
description: "You create an illusory duplicate of your familiar that moves erratically\
  \ around your familiar's space, frequently moving through the familiar's body with\
  \ a blurring effect that makes it indistinguishable from the real creature. Attacks\
  \ against the familiar have a 50% miss chance; attacks that miss instead target\
  \ the familiar figment, which reacts as if damaged as appropriate to the attack\
  \ but unlike a mirror imageis not destroyed when struck. This spell does not grant\
  \ your familiar concealment or prevent it from being targeted by spell effects that\
  \ do not require an attack roll."
