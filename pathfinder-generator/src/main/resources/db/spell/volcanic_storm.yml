description: "Chunks of hot volcanic rock and clumps of ash pound down when this spell\
  \ is cast, dealing 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of fire damage\
  \ to every creature in the area. This damage only occurs once, when the spell is\
  \ cast. For the remaining duration of the spell, heavy ash rains down in the area.\
  \ Creatures inside this area take a â€“4 penalty on Perception skill checks and the\
  \ entire area is treated as difficult terrain. At the end of the duration, the rock\
  \ and ash disappear, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage dealt)."
