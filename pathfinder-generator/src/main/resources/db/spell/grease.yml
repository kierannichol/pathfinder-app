description: "A grease spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease.\
  \ Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex\
  \ save or fall. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half\
  \ normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move that round\
  \ (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it\
  \ falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their\
  \ turn do not need to make this check and are not considered flat-footed."
