name: "Twine Double"
description: "As simulacrum, except you can only duplicate yourself, and the duplicate\
  \ is created from cloth and twine rather than ice and snow. The double looks exactly\
  \ like you except its eyes are balls of twine (DC 10 Perception check to recognize\
  \ double's strange eyes). It wears clothing and gear that appear exactly like what\
  \ you are wearing at the time of casting. Its copies of your magic items are nonfunctional\
  \ but radiate magic and have the same auras as your items. Its aura is identical\
  \ to yours. Attempts to scry you while the double exists have a 50% chance of targeting\
  \ the double instead of you."
