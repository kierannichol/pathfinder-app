description: "When you cast this spell, your salivary glands transform and instantly\
  \ fill with potent venom. Make a ranged touch attack against a single target in\
  \ range; if you hit, the target is affected by a dose of breath of the mantis god\
  \ (see page 158). The Fortitude save DC for this poison is the same as the spell's\
  \ DC, not the standard save DC for the poison."
