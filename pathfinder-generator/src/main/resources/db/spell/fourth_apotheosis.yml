    Effect: "For those who wish to go further than merely becoming a half-fiend, a\
      \ fourth ritual exists. The primary caster's fiendish lord grants no vision\
      \ or advice to begin this ritual--the primary caster must take it upon herself\
      \ to honor her patron in a manner appropriate to that fiend's interests and\
      \ areas of concern. Once every year, on the anniversary of the day the primary\
      \ caster completed the third apotheosis, she can perform a special ceremony\
      \ that recounts her accomplishments over the past year and culminates in a significant\
      \ sacrifice (usually consisting of the sacrifice of an important member of an\
      \ enemy faith,or of a lawful or good outsider; in either case, the sacrifice\
      \ must be at least CR 9). If this ritual is a success, the primary caster transforms\
      \ into a full-fledged fiend: she loses all benefits of her previous race and\
      \ the half-fiend template but can immediately apply all of her class levels\
      \ to her new fiendish race (for example, a human fighter 10 could become a vrock\
      \ fighter 10). The type of fiend that she transforms into depends on both the\
      \ nature of her chosen fiendish patron and the GM's discretion, but it should\
      \ generally not have a total number of Hit Dice more than twice her original\
      \ Hit Dice. The primary caster generally gets only one chance at the fourth\
      \ apotheosis, for failure results in her death; however, should she be restored\
      \ to life, she can attempt the fourth apotheosis again."
