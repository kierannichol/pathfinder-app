name: "Slave to Sin"
description: "This spell allows you to reach into an evil creature's mind to expose\
  \ and exploit its susceptibility to whichever of the seven so-called â€œdeadly sins\"\
  \ it is most susceptible to. The targeted creature must succeed at a Will save or\
  \ it is overwhelmed with an inability to repress urges to indulge in whatever sin\
  \ most closely mirrors its personality, and a glowing rune appears upon the creature's\
  \ body (usually the brow), identifying the sin. (The GM adjudicates which rune manifests\
  \ on the creature's body, as appropriate.)"
