name: "Youthful Appearance"
description: "You make your target look like a younger version of itself. You select\
  \ how much younger it looks (for example, “10 years\" or “as a young adult\"). You\
  \ cannot otherwise change details of the target's appearance other than those directly\
  \ associated with aging (for example, gray hair returns to its original color).\
  \ The target cannot appear so much younger that it changes size. This spell does\
  \ not affect any age-based modifications to ability scores or other age-related\
  \ effects."
