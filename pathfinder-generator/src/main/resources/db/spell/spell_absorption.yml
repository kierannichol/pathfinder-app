  \ either dispel magicor normal means) while spell absorptionis in effect, you absorb\
  \ the countered spell and use it to regain spells you have already cast. If you're\
  \ a wizard, you regain the use of any single spell that you have cast since the\
  \ last time you prepared spells. If you're a sorcerer, you regain a single spell\
  \ slot. The spell recovered or spell slot regained must be of an equal level or\
  \ lower than the spell you counterspelled."
