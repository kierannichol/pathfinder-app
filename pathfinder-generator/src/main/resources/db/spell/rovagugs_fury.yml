description: "You create a minor earthquake that can trip creatures. Attempt a single\
  \ combat maneuver check and apply the result against the CMD of every creature in\
  \ the area. If your roll equals or exceeds a creature's CMD, that creature is knocked\
  \ prone. This trip attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity (though you\
  \ do provoke one for casting the spell), nor are you knocked prone if you fail the\
  \ check by 10 or more. Unlike with a regular trip attack, you can trip any creature\
  \ touching the ground, regardless of size. Improved Trip does not affect this spell\
  \ in any way. Though the earthquake is small and focused on the ground, if the area\
  \ is particularly unstable, the spell might cause items to topple, stones to shake\
  \ loose from the walls or ceiling, and so on at the GM's discretion."
