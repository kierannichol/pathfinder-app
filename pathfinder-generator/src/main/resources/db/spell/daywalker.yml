name: "Daywalker"
description: "You reshape the substance of a willing undead creature to resemble a\
  \ living, breathing creature of the same size. This is a physical change to the\
  \ undead creature's bone, flesh, or incorporeal ectoplasm, adding new flesh or bone\
  \ and even hair, teeth, and blood, all of which demonstrate false signs of life\
  \ that mimic a living creature's breathing and other physiological processes. An\
  \ incorporeal undead creature using daywalker ceases to be incorporeal for the duration\
  \ of the spell, gaining a physical corpse body. Creatures interacting with the undead\
  \ can attempt a Perception check (DC = 30 or DC = 21 + the undead's Disguise modifier,\
  \ whichever is higher) to realize that the signs of life are false, and a close\
  \ examination with a Heal check always reveals the truth of the dead flesh."
