name: "Wall of Bone"
description: "This spell creates a vertical wall of skeletal arms that attaches itself\
  \ to any solid surface. The wall of bone works identically to wall of stone except\
  \ as noted above and in this spell description. The wall of bone is 1 inch thick\
  \ per 4 caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. The wall\
  \ created must be vertical, and must rest upon a firm foundation. It cannot be used\
  \ to bridge a chasm, for instance, or to act as a ramp. Each 5-foot square of the\
  \ wall has hardness 4 and 7 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall\
  \ whose hit points drops to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through\
  \ the wall with a single attack, the DC of the Strength check is equal to 15 + 2\
  \ per inch of thickness."
