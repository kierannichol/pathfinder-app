description: "An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into\

  \ 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage\
  \ to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears,\
  \ and to all creatures in the area on your turn each round. In addition, the wall\
  \ deals 2d6 points of fire damage + 1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum\
  \ +20) to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead\
