name: "Conjure Deadfall"
description: "You conjure a large metal cube covered in sharp spikes. If you conjure\
  \ the block so that it appears in midair, it immediately plummets downward onto\
  \ all creatures below it. When you cast this spell, you select the size of the square\
  \ area you wish it to affect. If you choose to create a deadfall over a single 5-foot\
  \ square, the block deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per caster level (maximum\
  \ 15d6) to each creature in the area. A deadfall over a 10-foot square deals 1d6\
  \ points of bludgeoning damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 7d6), a deadfall over\
  \ a 15- foot square deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per 3 caster levels (maximum\
  \ 5d6), and so on, to a maximum size of a 25- foot square. Only creatures that are\
  \ on the outer edge of the area affected by a conjure deadfall spell can attempt\
  \ Reflex saves to avoid the effect; creatures whose space does not touch the edge\
  \ of the deadfall do not receive a save."
