description: "An overwhelming feeling of loss overcomes the targets, and their allies'\
  \ words sound bleak and hollow. Regardless of actual allegiances, affected creatures\
  \ no longer count as allies for other creatures and always count as enemies for\
  \ the purposes of abilities, effects, and spells that differentiate between allies\
  \ and enemies, such as flanking or spells such as bane or bless. Allies of an affected\
  \ creature must succeed at a melee touch attack to affect the subject with touch\
  \ spells, and an affected creature cannot voluntarily fail a saving throw even if\
  \ the effect is harmless (such as cure light wounds). An affected creature still\
  \ counts as her own ally and can target herself with abilities, effects, and spells\
  \ normally."
