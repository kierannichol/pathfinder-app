name: "Burst with Light"
description: "The target becomes filled with intense magical light, taking 2d6 points\
  \ of damage as the light bursts from its wounds and orifices (if the target is an\
  \ undead creature, it instead takes 2d8 points of damage). In addition, the creature\
  \ radiates bright light in a 30-foot radius and increases the light level by one\
  \ step for an additional 30 feet beyond that area--darkness becomes dim light, dim\
  \ light becomes normal light, and normal light becomes bright light. Creatures that\
  \ take penalties in bright light take them while within the 30-foot radius of this\
  \ magical light. A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the light\
  \ effect."
