name: "Thought Echo"
description: "When you cast this spell, you establish a mental echo of up to 25 words.\
  \ Any attempt to read the surface thoughts of the target creature reads only this\
  \ mental echo unless the caster succeeds at a caster level check (DC = 11 + your\
  \ caster level). If you cast thought echo on yourself, the DC is instead equal to\
  \ 15 + your caster level. In addition, when casting this spell upon yourself, you\
  \ can change the echoed thoughts by taking a standard action and concentrating."
