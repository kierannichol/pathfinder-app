description: "You can communicate with any creature that is not mindless. As long\
  \ as you can be heard, your speech is understandable to all creatures, each of which\
  \ hears you as though you were conversing in its language or other natural mode\
  \ of communication, and you hear their responses as though in your own native language.\
  \ You may ask questions and receive answers, though this spell does not make creatures\
  \ more friendly or cooperative than normal, and non-sentient creatures may give\
  \ limited responses. While using truespeak, your language-dependent effects can\
  \ affect any creature that is not mindless."
