name: "Rumormonger"
description: "You utter a brief anecdote or bit of news as the verbal component of\
  \ this spell and track its progress through a social gathering or other crowd. When\
  \ someone who heard the rumor directly from you and repeated the rumor is within\
  \ your range, they glow silver to your sight, though this glow doesn't occur if\
  \ the creature is in disguise (unless it was in the same disguise at the time of\
  \ casting). You can choose to follow the rumor by selecting any such creature in\
  \ range, at which point the creatures who heard the rumor from you no longer glow\
  \ silver, and now the creatures who heard the rumor from your chosen creature glow\
  \ silver instead. You can follow the rumor's path until you reach a creature that\
  \ heard the rumor but didn't repeat it (or repeated it incorrectly). The glow identifies\
  \ only creatures who heard the same information you conveyed. Minor cosmetic changes\
  \ in the rumor don't interrupt the chain, but when the rumor no longer resembles\
  \ the information you imparted, the trail stops and the spell ends."
