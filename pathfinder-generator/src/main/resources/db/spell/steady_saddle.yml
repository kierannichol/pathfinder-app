name: "Steady Saddle"
description: "A saddle affected by this spell becomes more comfortable to sit in,\
  \ and the magic stabilizes any shaking motion caused by riding at a high speed.\
  \ For the duration of the spell, the penalty to use ranged weapons while mounted\
  \ in the target saddle decreases by 2. This stacks with the benefit of the Mounted\
  \ Archery feat and similar effects. Furthermore, the DC for any concentration check\
  \ required as a result of the mount's movement decreases by 2."
