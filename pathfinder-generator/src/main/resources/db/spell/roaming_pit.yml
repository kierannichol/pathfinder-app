description: "This spell functions as create pitAPG, except the pit is capable of\
  \ movement. As a move action, you can direct the pit to move up to 20 feet, though\
  \ it must always remain on a horizontal surface large enough to accommodate its\
  \ area. If the pit's movement causes it to share a space with a creature on the\
  \ same horizontal surface, that creature must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or\
  \ fall into the pit. Any creature that avoids falling into the pit when it reaches\
  \ its new destination moves to the nearest safe space. Creatures that fall into\
  \ the pit move with it if it is relocated."
