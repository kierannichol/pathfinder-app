description: "You call upon the primordial power of ancient megafauna to boost the\
  \ size of your target. Because of its connection to living creatures of the distant\
  \ past, the spell does not function on outsiders, undead, and summoned creatures.\
  \ Your target grows to legendary proportions, increasing in size by one category.\
  \ The creature's height doubles and its weight increases by a factor of 8. The target\
  \ gains a +6 size bonus to its Strength score and a +4 size bonus to its Constitution\
  \ score. It gains a +6 size bonus to its natural armor, and DR 10/adamantine. Its\
  \ carrying capacity changes to reflect its new size. The creature's equipment and\
  \ weapons, if any, also increase in size. Any enlarged item that leaves the creature's\
  \ possession returns to its original size (though thrown weapons and ammunition\
  \ deal damage at their enlarged size before returning to their true proportions)."
