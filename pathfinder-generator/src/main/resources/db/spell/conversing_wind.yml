name: "Conversing Wind"
description: "This spell functions as whispering wind, except it can carry responses\
  \ and doesn't end after delivering its first message. After the wind completes its\
  \ initial message, it waits for 1 round, then copies what it hear, and returns at\
  \ the same speed and by the same route. It delivers what it heard to the location\
  \ where the spell was originally cast. The wind continues back and forth in this\
  \ way until the duration ends or the spell is dismissed."
