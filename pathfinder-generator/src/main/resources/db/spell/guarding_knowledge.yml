description: "Upon casting this spell, choose a specific variety of monster (red dragon\
  \ rather than dragon) and one of its special attacks that you have successfully\
  \ identified with a Knowledge check or otherwise researched, such as a cockatrice's\
  \ petrification ability or a spider swarm's poison. You gain a +4 insight bonus\
  \ on saving throws against the selected special attack. The bonus does not apply\
  \ to saves against other monsters' abilities of the same name, spell-like abilities,\
  \ or special attacks derived from class levels or equipment. If you use a trophy\
  \ from a monster of the exact same variety as an optional material component, the\
  \ bonus increases to +6."
