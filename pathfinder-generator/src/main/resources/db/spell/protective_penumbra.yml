description: "This spell keeps the target slightly in shadow. A target with light\
  \ blindness, light sensitivity, or vulnerability to sunlight (such as vampires and\
  \ wraiths) may ignore penalties from those qualities. The spell gives the target\
  \ a +2 bonus on saving throws against nonmagical hazards related to bright light,\
  \ such as glare or sunburn."
