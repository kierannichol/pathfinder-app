description: "This spell fills the area with violet flames that scour an area clean\
  \ of life--especially of the corrupted life of the Abyss. Creatures (and foliage)\
  \ in the area take 1d8 points of fire damage per 2 caster levels you possess (maximum\
  \ 7d8) unless they are outsiders with the chaotic and evil subtypes or are otherwise\
  \ tainted by demons, in which case they instead take 1d6 points of fire damage per\
  \ caster level (maximum 15d6). This fire damage ignores the fire resistance granted\
  \ by the demon subtype, but it does not penetrate any other form of fire resistance\
  \ or immunity."
