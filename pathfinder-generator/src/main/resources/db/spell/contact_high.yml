description: "While under the effects of a drug, you can duplicate those effects in\
  \ others. You can touch another creature once per round (this requires a melee touch\
  \ attack if the target is unwilling). When touched, the target begins experiencing\
  \ the effects of the same drug by which you are currently affected (select one,\
  \ if you are under the influence of more than one drug). The target doesn't take\
  \ any ability damage or risk addiction from the drug."
