name: "Pox of Rumors"
description: "You curse the target to attract negative assumptions and rumors of a\
  \ sort you specify when you cast the spell. If the target fails the initial save\
  \ to negate the curse, every day that it spends in a settlement, it must attempt\
  \ a Will save. If it fails, it accidentally says or does something that makes others\
  \ assume the rumor you specified is true in some way that is unflattering or incriminating.\
  \ If the creature is not aware of the nature of the rumors, it takes a â€“4 penalty\
  \ on these secondary saves. After the first failed save, the attitude each resident\
  \ in the settlement has regarding the target is worsened by one step. For each additional\
  \ failure, the target becomes the victim of focused harassment. A group of residents\
  \ taunts or attacks the creature, potentially sending the authorities to investigate\
  \ if the rumor indicates criminal guilt."
