description: "With a melee touch attack you can dispel an illusion or return a creature\
  \ to its natural form. This functions as dispel magicdirected at the effect in question,\
  \ except you receive a +2 enhancement bonus on your dispel check and you can only\
  \ dispel illusions or changes in form created by supernatural effects or spells.\
  \ If multiple effects are changing the creature's appearance, you can dispel one\
  \ such effect for every four caster levels you possess, starting with the highest\
  \ caster level spells and proceeding to spells with lower caster levels. The caster\
  \ level for supernatural abilities such as change shape is equal to the target creature's\
  \ Hit Dice. A creature returned to its natural form by banish seemingis prevented\
  \ from changing its form again for a number of rounds equal to your caster level."
