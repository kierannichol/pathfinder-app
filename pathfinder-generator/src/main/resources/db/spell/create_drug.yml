description: "The caster conjures into being one of the following drugs: aether, flayleaf,\
  \ opium, pesh, scour, shiver, or zerk. (At the GM's discretion, other drugs of similar\
  \ power can be included on this list.) The drug doses the caster creates with this\
  \ spell must be used within 1 minute of being conjured, or they dissolve into worthless\
  \ dust or evaporate into noxious but fleeting vapors, though the effects of the\
  \ drug may last far longer if taken before it decays."
