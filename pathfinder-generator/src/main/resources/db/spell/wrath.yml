description: "You focus your anger against an enemy. Choose one enemy creature that\
  \ you can see. You gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls\
  \ against that designated creature for every three caster levels you have (at least\
  \ +1, maximum +3). You also receive this bonus on caster level checks made to overcome\
  \ the creature's spell resistance, if any. At 12th level, you gain the benefits\
  \ of the Improved Critical feat on attack rolls made against the designated creature.\
  \ This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat range\
