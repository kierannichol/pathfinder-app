name: "Pack Empathy"
description: "You create an instinctual connection between the targets. Each can sense\
  \ the others' overall emotional states, which allows them to communicate basic emotional\
  \ concepts (such as alerting each other of danger due to increased stress). Once\
  \ the spell has been cast on the subjects, the distance between them and the caster\
  \ doesn't affect the spell as long as they are on the same plane of existence. If\
  \ a subject leaves the plane, or if it dies, the spell ceases to function for it."
