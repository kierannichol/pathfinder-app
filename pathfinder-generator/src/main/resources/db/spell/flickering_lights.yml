name: "Flickering Lights"
description: "You cause the illumination in the area to seem to flicker erratically,\
  \ fluctuating between absolute darkness and blinding brightness. The level of light\
  \ in the area changes at the start of each creature's turn, as determined by rolling\
  \ a percentile die and consulting the following table. d% Illumination Level 1-10\
  \ Supernatural darkness 11-25 Darkness 26-50 Dim light 51-90 Normal light 91-00\
  \ Bright light Even darkvision can't see through supernatural darkness (as deeper\
  \ darkness). Bright light affects creatures with light blindness or light sensitivity.\
  \ For the purpose of superseding its effects with higher-level light or darkness\
  \ spells, flickering lights counts as a light spell when it increases the ambient\
  \ light level and a darkness spell when it decreases the ambient light level."
