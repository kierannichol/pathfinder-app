name: "Scintillating Wall"
description: "You create a vibrant wall of hypnotic light and color. The wall does\
  \ not impede movement or line of sight in any way. Creatures moving through the\
  \ wall must succeed at a Will save or become fascinated. Each round, on its turn,\
  \ a fascinated creature can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a full-round\
  \ action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A creature that succeeds\
  \ at the save against the fascination effect is no longer affected if it remains\
  \ within the wall, but it must attempt a new saving throw if it leaves the area\
  \ and later moves through the wall again. Creatures adjacent to the wall and creatures\
  \ moving through the wall that succeed at their save against fascination are dazzled."
