description: "Through careful regulation of your body's mystical energies, thoughtful\
  \ control of your poise and balance, and the focus in your mind on the surety of\
  \ each and every step you take, you are able to make your steps lighter than air.\
  \ This grants you the benefits of air walk, except as noted above. Additionally,\
  \ at any time during the spell's duration, you can expend the spell's remaining\
  \ duration as a swift action in order to gain a fly speed of 120 feet with perfect\
  \ maneuverability for 1 minute. After this time, the spell ends."
