description: "Your voice becomes suffused with magic so that you can harm your opponents\
  \ with but a word. As a standard action, you can target one opponent within 30 feet\
  \ with a ranged touch attack by speaking to it, dealing an amount of damage equal\
  \ to 1d6 + your Strength or Charisma modifier, whichever is higher. The damage dealt\
  \ is bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and can be reduced by damage reduction.\
  \ Each attack you make reduces the spell's remaining duration by 1 minute. If an\
  \ attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends after\
  \ the attack resolves."
