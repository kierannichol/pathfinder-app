description: "For the spell's duration, the caster gains a reservoir of luck with\
  \ a total number of points equal to 1 point per 2 caster levels. During the spell's\
  \ duration, the caster can spend 1 point from this reservoir when making an attack\
  \ roll or skill check to add a +1d8 luck bonus to the d20 roll's result. This bonus\
  \ can be added before or after the roll or check's result is revealed, and if this\
  \ bonus is large enough to turn a failure into a success, the roll succeeds. The\
  \ spell instantly ends when all points are expended or when it is cast on the target\
  \ again."
