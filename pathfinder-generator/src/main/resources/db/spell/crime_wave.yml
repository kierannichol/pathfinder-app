description: "You instill overwhelming avarice in the targets and impel them toward\
  \ a wild spree of larceny. Creatures affected by a crime wave must roll percentile\
  \ dice each round to determine what action they take. d% Behavior 1–25 Act normally,\
  \ but with suspicion toward others. The target doesn't benefit from or provide benefits\
  \ with teamwork feats and the aid another action. If a creature attempts to use\
  \ a harmless spell or effect on the target, there is a 50% chance the target tries\
  \ to avoid that effect as best as possible (taking an attack of opportunity against\
  \ a spellcaster, requiring a successful attack roll on a touch spell, or attempting\
  \ a saving throw). 26–50 Attempt a stealAPG combat maneuver or Sleight of Hand check\
  \ to steal a random valuable object from the nearest creature (or a nearby unattended\
  \ object, if obviously of great value), moving adjacent to that creature or object\
  \ as needed. Once an affected creature has stolen an item, further results of 26–\
  50 cause the affected creature to flee, focusing all of its efforts on escaping\
  \ with its loot and fighting to prevent the stolen object from being taken. 51–\
  75 Attempt to break, destroy, or deface the nearest unattended manufactured object\
  \ or structure. If the object or structure is too difficult to damage, the affected\
  \ creature instead vandalizes or otherwise defaces its appearance. 76–100 Attack\
  \ the nearest creature (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the affected\
  \ creature's self). A character affected by a crime wave who is unable to carry\
  \ out the indicated action moves toward the nearest source of cover or concealment\
  \ and attempts a Stealth check to hide. Affected creatures with the ability to turn\
  \ invisible (including through the use of magic items or spells) do so instead of\
  \ attempting a Stealth check."
