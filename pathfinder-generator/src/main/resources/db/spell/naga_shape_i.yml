name: "Naga Shape I"
description: "Whenever you cast this spell, you can assume the form of any type of\
  \ Large naga (including most nagas, but not royal nagas), though not the form of\
  \ a specific individual. In effect, you transform into a Large serpent, gaining\
  \ a +4 size bonus to your Strength, a â€“2 penalty to your Dexterity, and a +4 natural\
  \ armor bonus. Unlike with beast shape II, however, you keep your own head when\
  \ using this spell and can cast spells with verbal and somatic components, even\
  \ though the naga form doesn't have hands."
