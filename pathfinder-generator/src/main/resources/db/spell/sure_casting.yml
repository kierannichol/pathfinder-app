description: "You gain temporary insight into your enemies' magical defenses. When\
  \ you next cast a spell before the end of the next round, treat your caster level\
  \ as 5 higher than normal for the purpose of overcoming spell resistance. This bonus\
  \ doesn't increase any other effects that depend on caster level, such as the spell's\
  \ damage or range, and affects only the first spell cast after sure casting."
