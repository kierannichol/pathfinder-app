description: "You learn the answers to a specific set of questions about a creature\
  \ so long as you have access to at least one drop of its blood. You can cast this\
  \ spell on the blood of the living or the dead, but living or undead creatures are\
  \ entitled to a saving throw to resist the spell. You can cast the spell on dried\
  \ or fresh blood. Once you cast the spell the answers to the following four questions\
  \ appear on any flat surface you designate (a wall, a piece of paper, and so on).\
  \ Who are you? (The name by which the creature is most commonly known) What are\
  \ you? (Gender, race, profession/role) How was your blood shed? (Brief outline of\
  \ the events that caused its wound, to the best of the victim's knowledge) When\
  \ was your blood shed? These answers always appear in a language you can read even\
  \ if the creature cannot speak that or any language."
