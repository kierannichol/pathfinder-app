description: "You alter an item's aura so that it registers to detect spells (and\
  \ spells with similar capabilities) as though it were nonmagical, or a magic item\
  \ of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify. If the object bearing\
  \ magic aura has identify cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes\
  \ that the aura is false and detects the object's actual qualities if he succeeds\
  \ on a Will save. Otherwise, he believes the aura and no amount of testing reveals\
  \ what the true magic is."
