description: "You must sacrifice a creature just as you finish casting this spell.\
  \ When the sacrifice dies, its blood or ichor pools and hardens into a single red\
  \ bloodstone. This bloodstone contains the essence and spirit of the sacrificed\
  \ creature, allowing anyone holding the stone to activate the creature's highest-level\
  \ activated racial spell-like ability, taking the actions necessary to activate\
  \ the stored spell-like ability. Any creature who holds the stone can activate it,\
  \ but the stone can be used only once per day (or the frequency of the creature's\
  \ spell-like ability, whichever is less). If a creature has several racial spell-like\
  \ abilities of the same spell level, choose randomly from among them to determine\
  \ which one is stored in the bloodstone. The bloodstone can only store racial spell-like\
  \ abilities that emulate a spell, including altered spells, like invisibility (self\
  \ only), but not unique spell-like abilities possessed by the creature. Abilities\
  \ with altered effects are still altered, so a creature activating the bloodstone\
  \ for greater teleport (self only) would affect only itself and a bloodstone storing\
  \ summon monster II (Small fire elemental only) would still only be able to summon\
  \ a Small fire elemental. Additionally, the bloodstone can't store spell-like abilities\
  \ that duplicate spells with expensive components costing more than 250 gp."
