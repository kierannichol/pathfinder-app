    Effect: "This ritual can be cast only during the vernal equinox. The primary caster\
      \ binds the person to be sacrificed in magically treated ivy and then places\
      \ the settlement model on top of the person's body. Next, the primary caster\
      \ slits the sacrifice's throat with a knife and then smears the blood all over\
      \ the ivy. As the casters chant, the ivy grows and destroys the model of the\
      \ settlement. If the ritual succeeds, tendrils of the ivy lash out at all of\
      \ the casters before diving into the ground and reemerging throughout the ritual's\
      \ area of effect. Vines and other plants appropriate to the region grow over\
      \ all buildings and structures in the area, dealing damage to them at a rate\
      \ of 3 hit points every 10 minutes, ignoring their hardness. A typical wooden\
      \ building can withstand 100 points of damage before being wrecked, while a\
      \ typical stone building can withstand 150 points of damage before its complete\
      \ destruction. The plants do not deal damage to creatures directly, though creatures\
      \ that remain in a building may be injured if it collapses. Heavily fortified\
      \ stone structures, such as castles and city walls, are sturdy enough to withstand\
      \ this ritual. Any magical building or room receives a Fortitude save to repel\
      \ the plants."
