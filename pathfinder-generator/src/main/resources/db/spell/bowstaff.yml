description: "The bow that is touched takes on the rigidity and toughness of forged\
  \ steel, allowing it to be used as a melee weapon. The spell allows a shortbow to\
  \ be used as a club or a longbow to be used as a quarterstaff, although the bow\
  \ retains its normal hit points and hardness. The bow's enhancement bonus, if any,\
  \ applies on melee attack and damage rolls. Additional weapon special weapon qualities\
  \ also apply to melee attacks if such qualities can be added to a melee weapon."
