name: "Greater Illusion of Treachery"
description: "This spell functions as illusion of treachery except that it also conceals\
  \ your own actions (as illusion of calmUC) and renders invisible all spell effects\
  \ and ranged attacks originating from you until they reach the attack's target (this\
  \ doesn't cause the attack's target to be unable to avoid the attack, as they still\
  \ see the attack originating from the spell's target)."
