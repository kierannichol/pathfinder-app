    Effect: "This ritual must be cast at dawn beneath the open sky on the Material\
      \ Plane. The ritual must be performed at a site of Sarenite worship (such as\
      \ a dervish house, shrine, or temple of Sarenrae) that has hosted active worship\
      \ services for at least 52 consecutive weeks. The primary caster holds aloft\
      \ the rose-gold scimitar, and the secondary casters stand around him and begin\
      \ spinning in place. The primary caster recites 23 verses from Sarenrae's holy\
      \ text, The Birth of Light and Truth, taking a sip from the potion of cat's\
      \ grace between each stanza. After the last verse is completed, the secondary\
      \ casters whirl around the primary caster, each anointing the rose-gold scimitar\
      \ with blessed sunflower seed oil. Upon the successful completion of the ritual,\
      \ all the casters are filled with the spirits of dervish heroes, becoming faster,\
      \ stronger, tougher, and more skilled in combat. Each caster gains a +4 enhancement\
      \ bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution; a +2 dodge bonus to AC; and\
      \ a +2 sacred bonus on all saving throws. The caster's base attack bonus is\
      \ equal his character level (which may give the caster multiple attacks). If\
      \ the caster's base attack bonus is already equal to his character level, he\
      \ gains one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus when making a\
      \ full-attack action. In addition, any scimitar wielded by a caster is treated\
      \ as if it has the keen weapon special ability. In exchange, each caster temporarily\
      \ loses his ability to cast spells, save for those from the conjuration (healing)\
      \ school."
