name: "Detect Radiation"
description: "You detect radiation in the surrounding area. You see radioactive auras\
  \ as a glowing green shimmer in the air that emanates from radioactive objects;\
  \ the brighter and more intense the green, the more powerful the radioactivity.\
  \ This glow does not provide illumination or allow you to see in darkness, apart\
  \ from being able to see the glow itself. The spell can penetrate barriers, but\
  \ 3 feet of dirt or wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or a thin sheet\
  \ of lead blocks it--although radiation can seep into such barriers, causing them\
  \ to become radioactive (and thus visible to the spell) in time."
