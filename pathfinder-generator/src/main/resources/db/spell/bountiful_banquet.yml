description: "You conjure a beautiful and delicious feast with hors d'oeuvres, four\
  \ courses worth of food, and plentiful drink. The food appears on ornate serving\
  \ trays or in exquisite covered tureens, as appropriate to each type of dish. Place\
  \ settings and serving utensils also appear--enough for each creature that will\
  \ participate in the feast--along with elegant tablecloths and table linens. The\
  \ spell doesn't create furniture, but the feast does adapt to appear on top of existing\
  \ tables (or similar objects in the environment)."
