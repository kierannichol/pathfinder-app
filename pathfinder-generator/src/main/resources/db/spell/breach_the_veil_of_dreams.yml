    Effect: "This ritual must be cast at night on the Material Plane. The casters\
      \ drink the wormwood wine and begin chanting the incantation as the incense\
      \ burns. The casters mix the ashes with the grave earth and use the mixture\
      \ to draw a threshold with a keyhole. They then insert the key into this door\
      \ as the incantation is completed. Success indicates the casters pass through\
      \ the portal and enter a random location on the Dimension of Dreams."
