description: "You may only cast this spell if you currently have a familiar. You place\
  \ your soul into the body of your familiar, and your familiar's soul is placed in\
  \ your body. This functions as if you possessed your familiar using magic jar; your\
  \ familiar simultaneously possesses your body in the same manner. You can't freely\
  \ transfer your soul between your body and your familiar's--if you choose to return\
  \ to your body as a standard action, the spell ends. If either body is killed, both\
  \ spirits return to their original bodies, the spell ends, and the original owner\
  \ of the slain body dies."
