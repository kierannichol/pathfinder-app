name: "Temporal Regression"
description: "When you complete this spell, note your current location and condition,\
  \ including your hit point total and any ongoing conditions affecting you as well\
  \ as their durations (e.g. poison, sickened, ability damage, and spell effects).\
  \ This spell creates a beacon in space-time that's imperceptible to anyone but you.\
  \ As a standard action while you are within range of the beacon before the spell's\
  \ duration expires, you can discharge the spell to transport yourself back to the\
  \ marked location and restore yourself to the condition you were in when you cast\
  \ the spell; this does not restore any expended items, charges, or spells you may\
  \ have used during that time. This does not reverse effects for anyone else, and\
  \ to bystanders it appears as though you teleported to the beacon location and regained\
  \ conditions you had when the beacon was set. Temporal regression strains your body;\
  \ when the spell is discharged, you gain 1 temporary negative level for every 2\
  \ rounds that passed since you cast the spell. These negative levels disappear after\
  \ 24 hours."
