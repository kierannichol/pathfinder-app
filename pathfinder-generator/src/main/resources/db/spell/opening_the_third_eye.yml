    Effect: "Through a ceremony of meditation and recitation, the casters of this\
      \ ritual become psychically attuned. Casters who don't have levels in an occult\
      \ class gain the following benefits. Each caster can choose one knack from the\
      \ psychic class's spell list and an additional knack for every 5 character levels\
      \ that caster possesses (to a maximum of 5 knacks at 20th level). The casters\
      \ can cast these knacks at will. If a caster is trained in a skill with an occult\
      \ skill unlock, she can use that skill's occult unlock. Casters who do have\
      \ levels in an occult base class gain the following benefits. If a caster is\
      \ trained in a skill with an occult skill unlock, she gains a +4 insight bonus\
      \ on checks with that skill when using its occult skill unlock. If a caster\
      \ is untrained in a skill with an occult skill unlock, she can still use that\
      \ skill's occult unlock. Each of the ritual's casters can choose to dismiss\
      \ this ritual's effects for themselves individually."
