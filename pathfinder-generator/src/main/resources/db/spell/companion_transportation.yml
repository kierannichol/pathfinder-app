description: "You trade places with the other target, teleporting as if you were both\
  \ affected by dimension door. Both you and the other target arrive in a square you\
  \ choose in the other's former space. If the targets are different sizes, they must\
  \ appear in locations that cover previously occupied squares. As with dimension\
  \ door, after casting this spell, you can't take any other actions until your next\
  \ turn, and the other target is staggered until the end of its next turn due to\
  \ the transposition."
