name: "Fey Form I"
description: "You assume the form of a Small or Medium creature of the fey type. Your\
  \ base speed changes to match the new form's base speed, with a maximum speed of\
  \ 60 feet (even if the chosen fey form has a base speed in excess of that speed).\
  \ If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain those abilities:\
  \ climb speed 30 feet, fly speed 30 feet (average maneuverability), swim speed 30\
  \ feet, darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, scent, and boot stomp. If the form\
  \ you assume has the aquatic subtype, you can breathe air and water. If the creature\
  \ has any weaknesses, you gain those weaknesses. If a listed ability depends on\
  \ an item (as is the case with boot stomp), this spell transforms the nearest counterpart\
  \ among your worn gear into that item."
