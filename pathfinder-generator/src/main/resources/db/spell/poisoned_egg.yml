name: "Poisoned Egg"
description: "You transform the contents of a normal egg into a single dose of small\
  \ centipede poison (injury; saveDC 11; frequency1/round for 4 rounds; effect1 Dex;\
  \ cure1 save). The poison reverts to a normal egg at the end of the spell's duration\
  \ (the reverted egg substance is harmless unless the poisoned creature is vulnerable\
  \ to eggs). The egg may be raw or cooked but must be whole and not empty when you\
  \ cast the spell. When applying the poisoned egg's contents to a weapon, the wielder\
  \ has no chance of poisoning herself, as though she had the poison use class feature."
