    Effect: "By repairing damaged magical runes and realigning the energies based\
      \ on the gate's planetary position, the caster reactivates a dormant aiudara.\
      \ A reactivated gate automatically reconnects with its linked twin, acting as\
      \ a two-way gate (as per the spell) between the locations. The caster knows\
      \ the gate's password--which might be anything from an Elven phrase to a song's\
      \ refrain to a spell--from the research required to learn this ritual. All other\
      \ creatures who use this gate must also know the password to access the gate's\
      \ magic after it has been reactivated."
