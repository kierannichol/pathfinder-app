name: "Disfiguring Touch"
description: "With a touch, you cause the victim of this spell to suffer a painful\
  \ curse that causes it to grow hideously disfigured. The physical appearance of\
  \ the deformity is subject to the caster's whim (most demon worshipers choose deformities\
  \ that reflect their Abyssal patron's shape or form). The target takes one of the\
  \ following penalties. –2 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1). –2 penalty on\
  \ attack rolls or saving throws. Land speed reduced by 5 feet. You may also invent\
  \ other effects, but they should be no more powerful than those described above."
