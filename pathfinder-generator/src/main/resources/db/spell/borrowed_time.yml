description: "A creation of the archmage Nex, this spell allows you to reach ahead\
  \ in time and draw alacrity from the future at the expense of your own health. For\
  \ the duration of this spell, you gain an extra swift action you can use only during\
  \ your turn. You can't use this swift action to take a second immediate action between\
  \ turns, but you can use it to take a swift action the turn after you've taken an\
  \ immediate action. Each time you take an extra swift action in this fashion you\
  \ take 1 point of Constitution damage. If you're immune to ability damage, you take\
  \ 5 points of hit point damage instead. When the spell ends, you are staggered for\
  \ 1d4+1 rounds from the temporal backlash."
