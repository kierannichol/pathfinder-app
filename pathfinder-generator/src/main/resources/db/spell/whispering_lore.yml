description: "Upon casting this spell, you are able to gain knowledge from the land\
  \ itself. As you walk through the terrain, it whisper information in a language\
  \ you understand, though the whispering is so rambling it is hard to distinguish\
  \ useful information. This whispering grants you a +4 insight bonus on a single\
  \ Knowledge skill type appropriate to the type of terrain you are in. If you are\
  \ within a cold, desert, forest, jungle, mountain, plains, swamp, or water environment,\
  \ you gain the bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks. If you are within an underground\
  \ environment, you gain the bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering) checks. If you are\
  \ within an urban environment, you gain the bonus on Knowledge (local) checks. If\
  \ you are on a plane other than the Material Plane, you gain the bonus on Knowledge\
  \ (planes) checks. If you enter a new terrain, you lose the previous terrain's skill\
  \ bonus and gain the new bonus."
