name: "Illusory Crowd"
description: "This spell creates an illusion of a stationary group of people milling\
  \ about. They can be of any humanoid race or ethnicity you are familiar with, and\
  \ they speak a language of your choice that you know. To anyone not paying close\
  \ attention, their conversations sound perfectly normal but are in fact repetitive\
  \ and essentially meaningless. The crowd appears to be a group of typical citizens,\
  \ and cannot duplicate any specific group, guild, or military squad."
