description: "You call a single vermlek demon (Lords of Chaos 54) to invade and inhabit\
  \ the body of the target corpse, taking on its likeness. The vermlek can remain\
  \ on the Material Plane indefinitely as long as it has a body to inhabit; however,\
  \ if it remains outside of a host for more than 1 minute, it's banished back to\
  \ the Abyss. The vermlek's initial attitude towards you is friendly, but you must\
  \ succeed at an opposed Charisma check to convince it to obey your commands, similar\
  \ to a charmed creature. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on this Charisma check\
  \ if you offer it a fresh humanoid corpse to inhabit."
