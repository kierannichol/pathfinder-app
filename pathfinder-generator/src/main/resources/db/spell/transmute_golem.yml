name: "Transmute Golem"
description: "You turn one type of golem into another. The golem must be willing--it\
  \ must be commanded to transform by its master or must be a creature able to make\
  \ informed decisions that opts to submit to the spell. You must provide various\
  \ powdered metals with a value equal to 150% of the difference in creation costs\
  \ between the old and new type of golem, even if the new golem type is cheaper to\
  \ create. Both types of golems must share the same subtypes, if any. You cannot\
  \ transmute a golem into a new type of golem with a CR higher than your caster level."
