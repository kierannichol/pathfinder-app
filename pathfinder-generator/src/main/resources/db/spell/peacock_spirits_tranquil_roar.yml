  sections:
    Effect: "The primary caster begins by using a peacock feather to dust a circle\
      \ of crushed malachite around a building or sacred site and calls forth hushed\
      \ whispers--the murmuring chastisement of the secretive Peacock Spirit--to blot\
      \ out invasive magics that overhear or reveal secrets. Anyone attempting to\
      \ cast a divination or enchantment spell or spell-like ability that detects\
      \ thoughts or compels the truth within the area of effect, or that targets the\
      \ area of effect with a remote sensing spell such as scrying, must first make\
      \ a successful Will save. Failure indicates the spell is lost and the effect's\
      \ caster takes 1d6+8 points of damage as the Peacock Spirit turns the invasive\
      \ magic back upon her. Success indicates the effect occurs normally. A caster\
      \ who successfully saves is unaffected further by the Peacock Spirit's Tranquil\
      \ Roar ritual for 24 hours or until she leaves and reenter the area of effect."
