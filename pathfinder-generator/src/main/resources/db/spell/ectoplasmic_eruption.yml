description: "A cascading avalanche of pale, swirling ectoplasmic matter erupts from\
  \ a point you select. All creatures in the area when the spell is cast take 6d6\
  \ points of bludgeoning damage and are entangled for a number of rounds equal to\
  \ your caster level. This spell passes between planes, so it affects ethereal and\
  \ incorporeal creatures normally."
