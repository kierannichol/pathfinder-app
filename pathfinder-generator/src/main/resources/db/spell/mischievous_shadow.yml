name: "Mischievous Shadow"
description: "You direct spirits into the shadows of creatures. The shadows of creatures\
  \ that fail their Will saving throws appear slightly different for the duration\
  \ of the spell, bearing small horns, unusually long and slender arms, or other small\
  \ discrepancies. This spell does not work on creatures that do not cast shadows\
  \ or reflections. At will as an immediate action (but no more often than once every\
  \ 10 minutes), a mischievous shadow can interfere with its host's actions or the\
  \ actions of adjacent creatures by interacting with their shadows in ways that affect\
  \ their physical counterparts, such as grabbing the shadow of a crossbow to redirect\
  \ the physical weapon's aim. Each disruption either imposes a â€“8 penalty on a single\
  \ attack roll, combat maneuver check, or Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check,\
  \ or requires a spellcaster to succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + spell\
  \ level) or lose a spell being cast. If you are within range of the spell effect,\
  \ you can decide how these shadows interfere; otherwise, their actions are timed\
  \ and decided by the GM as needed, typically manifesting during important or crucial\
  \ roles. Each time a mischievous shadow makes such a disruption, the spell's haunt-like\
  \ manifestation occurs during that round."
