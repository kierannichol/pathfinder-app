description: "You pass judgment on your enemies' intentions and punish them with holy\
  \ power. Each creature in the spell's area takes 1d8 points of damage per spell\
  \ level, determined by the most powerful effect with the evil descriptor either\
  \ affecting that creature or in its spell repertoire. A caster who prepares spells\
  \ takes this damage based on the highest-level evil spell he prepared that day,\
  \ even if he already cast that spell. A spontaneous spellcaster takes this damage\
  \ based on the highest-level evil spell she knows, even if she has no remaining\
  \ spell slots available to cast that spell. A creature with evil spell-like abilities\
  \ takes this damage based on the highest-level evil spell-like ability it can use.\
  \ A creature who doesn't cast spells but is the willing beneficiary of evil spells\
  \ takes this damage based on the highest-level evil spell currently affecting it,\
  \ including spells that affect an area such as desecrate. A creature subject to\
  \ the harmful effects of an evil spell are unaffected unless it voluntarily accepted\
  \ the spell's effects."
