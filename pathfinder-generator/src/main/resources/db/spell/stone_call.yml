description: "A rain of dirt, gravel, and small pebbles fills the area, dealing 2d6\
  \ points of bludgeoning damage to every creature in the area. This damage only occurs\
  \ once, when the spell is cast. For the remaining duration of the spell, this debris\
  \ covers the ground, making the entire area difficult terrain. At the end of the\
  \ duration, the rocks disappear, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage\
  \ dealt)."
