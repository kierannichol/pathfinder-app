name: "Infuse Effigy"
description: "This spell infuses an effigy with a powerful curse that targets a specific\
  \ type of creature associated in some way with the effigy itself. When you cast\
  \ this spell, it remains in effect until it is discharged. Once you cast infuse\
  \ effigy, you cannot prepare a new 4th-level spell to replace it or cast another\
  \ spell with its spell slot until you dismiss the infuse effigy spell or until it\
  \ is discharged against a foe. If the number of 4th-level spells that you can cast\
  \ decreases, and that number drops below your current number of infuse effigyspells,\
  \ the more recently cast infuse effigyspells in excess of the number of 4th-level\
  \ spells you can now cast are dispelled."
