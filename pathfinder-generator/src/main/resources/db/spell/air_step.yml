name: "Air Step"
description: "This spell functions as air walk, except you can rise no higher than\
  \ 1 foot off the ground, you cannot pass over liquid, and the air you walk on is\
  \ less stable than solid ground. When walking on air, you ignore difficult terrain\
  \ that is less than 1 foot high, you do not trigger effects based on weight (such\
  \ as a pressure plate), and any creature trying to track you through areas you crossed\
  \ with this spell takes a –10 penalty on its Perception or Survival check to do\
  \ so. However, because of the instability of the air you walk on, your speed is\
  \ reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet) and you take a –4 penalty on Acrobatics,\
  \ Climb, and Ride checks."
