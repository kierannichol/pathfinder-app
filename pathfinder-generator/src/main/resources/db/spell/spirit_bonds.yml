name: "Spirit Bonds"
description: "You heighten your awareness of up to one willing creature or object\
  \ per 3 caster levels, each of which must be within 30 feet of you during the entire\
  \ hour you spend preparing spells and casting spirit bonds. By concentrating on\
  \ one of these creatures or objects as a full-round action, you can learn its direction\
  \ and relative distance from your location, provided that it is on the same plane.\
  \ In the case of a creature, you can also learn the state of its emotion or health\
  \ aura as a full-round action (see page 198 of Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures\
  \ for more information about auras). In the case of an object, you can also get\
  \ a sense of how damaged it is, similar to reading the health aura of a creature,\
  \ or, in the case of a magic item that must be activated, you can learn when it\
  \ was last activated (a full-round action in either case)."
