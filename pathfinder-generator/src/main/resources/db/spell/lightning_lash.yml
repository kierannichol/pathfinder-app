name: "Lightning Lash"
description: "You create a crackling lash of unholy lightning that flickers and flashes\
  \ in your hand like a whip, shifting color in response to your mood and will. Once\
  \ per round, you can make a melee touch attack with the lightning lash against a\
  \ target within 15 feet. If the attack is successful, it deals 1d6 points of electricity\
  \ damage and 1d6 points of damage from divine power (similar to flame strike), and\
  \ allows you to attempt a trip combat maneuver check as a free action against your\
  \ target (using your caster level as your CMB)."
