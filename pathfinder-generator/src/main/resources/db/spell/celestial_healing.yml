name: "Celestial Healing"
description: "You anoint a wounded creature with the blood of an outsider with the\
  \ good subtype (such as an angel) or holy water, giving it fast healing 1. The target\
  \ radiates the aura of a good creature for the duration of the spell and can sense\
  \ the righteousness of the magic, though this has no long-term effect on the target's\
  \ alignment. If the target has its own evil aura, this is not suppressed by celestial\
  \ healing, and can also be detected normally."
