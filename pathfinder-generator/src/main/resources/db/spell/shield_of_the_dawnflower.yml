name: "Shield of the Dawnflower"
description: "You create a disk of sunlight on one arm. Any creature that strikes\
  \ you with a melee attack deals normal damage, but also takes 1d6 points of fire\
  \ damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). Creatures with reach weapons\
  \ are not subject to this damage if they attack you. The shield provides illumination\
  \ as if it were a continual flame spell. You can only have one instance of this\
  \ spell in effect at a time. It does not stack with similar damaging aura spells\
  \ such as fire shield."
