description: "You invigorate your allies, who can hustle (Core Rulebook 170) as long\
  \ as you continue to sing or chant (which requires your concentration). This movement\
  \ counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and\
  \ fatigue. You can concentrate on this spell and hustle at the same time."
