description: "Your teeth extend and sharpen, transforming your mouth into a maw of\
  \ razor-sharp fangs. You gain a bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage plus\
  \ your Strength modifier. If you confirm a critical hit with this attack, it also\
  \ deals 1 point of bleed damage. If you already have a bite attack, your bite deals\
  \ 2 points of bleed damage on a critical hit. You are considered proficient with\
  \ this attack. If used as part of a full-attack action, the bite is considered a\
  \ secondary attack, is made at your full base attack bonus â€“5, and adds half your\
  \ Strength modifier to its damage."
