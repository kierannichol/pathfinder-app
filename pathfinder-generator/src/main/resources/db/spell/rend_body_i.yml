description: "You lacerate the body of the target creature with telekinetic force,\
  \ rending it limb from limb. The target creature takes 1d6 points of damage per\
  \ caster level you have (maximum 10d6 points of damage). If this spell deals an\
  \ amount of damage to the target equal to more than half its maximum hit point total,\
  \ one of the target's limbs (determined randomly) is gruesomely ripped from the\
  \ target's body and flies 15 feet away from the creature in a random direction.\
  \ The target then takes 1 point of bleed damage per 2 caster levels you have. The\
  \ bleeding can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal check or the application of\
  \ any effect that heals hit point damage, but the limb can be restored only by powerful\
  \ healing effects such as heal or regeneration. If the damage reduces the target's\
  \ hit points to below 0, all of its limbs are affected in this fashion."
