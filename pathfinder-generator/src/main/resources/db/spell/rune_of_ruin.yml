description: "You curse a magic item, such as magical clothing, a suit of armor, or\
  \ a weapon. The object is reduced to 1/4 its normal hit point total, gains the broken\
  \ condition, and appears damaged and worn. If it grants a numeric bonus, such as\
  \ a +2 deflection bonus to AC, that bonus is reduced by 1 for every 3 caster levels\
  \ you possess, to a minimum of +0. Other magical qualities fail to work 50% of the\
  \ time when called upon, so a resistance bonus on saves or a weapon's flaming special\
  \ ability could fail each time the item is used."
