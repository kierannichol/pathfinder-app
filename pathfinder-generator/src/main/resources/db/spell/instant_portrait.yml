name: "Instant Portrait"
description: "You touch a surface and produce a painted portrait of either yourself\
  \ or a creature you can see without needing to attempt a Craft (painting) check.\
  \ The surface to be affected must be relatively flat, such as a piece of paper or\
  \ a wall. The image can be any color of your choice, but is monochromatic. While\
  \ it is of too poor a quality to sell, it is otherwise accurate enough to recognize\
  \ the subject or to serve as a target for the enter image spell. The portrait reflects\
  \ your perception of the creature depicted, including any disguises, magical or\
  \ mundane, that the subject is wearing at the time of the painting's creation. The\
  \ portrait is only as durable as normal paint and can be removed by mundane means."
