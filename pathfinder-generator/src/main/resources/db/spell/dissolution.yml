description: "You touch a Tiny or smaller item, causing the item to vanish as if it\
  \ did not exist at all. The item doesn't take damage or otherwise gain any condition;\
  \ it simply ceases to be visible to or interact with the world in any way, as if\
  \ it no longer existed. The oil vanishes with the item and leaves no residue, nor\
  \ does it affect surfaces that handle or hold the item during its application. No\
  \ spell or ability short of miracle or wish can locate or affect the item while\
  \ it is under the effect of this spell. Though the item seems to not exist while\
  \ under the effects of this spell, its own reality is consistent (it ages normally,\
  \ and any ongoing effects upon it continue normally). The target object can be one\
  \ size larger than Tiny for every 5 caster levels above 5th you possess."
