name: "Thunderous Footfalls"
description: "This spell makes the target creature's footfalls shake the ground violently\
  \ as he trundles, which may knock down smaller creatures as he passes by, though\
  \ it also makes the target slower on land. The target's land speed is reduced by\
  \ half (round down to the nearest 5-foot increment), but each time he moves overland\
  \ adjacent to a creature that is at least one size category smaller than he is,\
  \ that creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be knocked prone."
