  \ within 60 feet of you are affected by an enchantment effect. To your eyes only,\
  \ a creature under the effects of an enchantment spell glows with a simple white\
  \ light around its head. You can immediately discern whether the brightness of the\
  \ light is faint, moderate, strong, or overwhelming depending on the highest spell\
  \ level of enchantment currently in effect (as per detect magic). Enchantments of\
  \ the charm or compulsion subschool glow with a scarlet or emerald hue, respectively."
