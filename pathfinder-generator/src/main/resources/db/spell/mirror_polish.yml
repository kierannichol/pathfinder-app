name: "Mirror Polish"
description: "You polish a metal item until it is reflective enough to be used as\
  \ a mirror. This does not prevent the item from later damage or corrosion that would\
  \ ruin the mirrored surface. The spell can be cast only on a metal item with a fairly\
  \ smooth and contiguous surface, such as a breastplate, a helm, a shield, or a sword,\
  \ but not a mace, chainmail, or scale mail."
