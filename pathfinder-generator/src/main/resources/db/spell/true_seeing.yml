description: "You confer on the subject the ability to see all things as they actually\
  \ are. The subject sees through normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors\
  \ hidden by magic, sees the exact locations of creatures or objects under blur or\
  \ displacement effects, sees invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through\
  \ illusions, and sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things.\
  \ Further, the subject can focus its vision to see into the Ethereal Plane (but\
  \ not into extradimensional spaces). The range of true seeing conferred is 120 feet."
