name: "Undetectable Trap"
description: "You shroud a single trap with a powerful illusion to make it more difficult\
  \ to locate. Spells like detect magic can't locate any magic aura from either the\
  \ target trap or from undetectable trap. Furthermore, a character under the effect\
  \ of the find traps spell doesn't receive an automatic chance to locate the target\
  \ trap when she comes within 10 feet of it, and the bonus on Perception checks from\
  \ find traps doesn't apply to attempts to notice the target trap. Add 1/2 your caster\
  \ level to the DC for any creature without the trapfinding class ability to notice\
  \ the target trap with Perception checks."
