description: "This spell was developed by an Aldori Academy student after several\
  \ weeks of observing (and occasionally joining) Restov barroom brawls. You draw\
  \ on your mind's hidden reserves, instantaneously mastering advanced combat techniques.\
  \ When you cast this spell, choose a combat feat. You must meet all prerequisites\
  \ for this feat, treating your magus level as your base attack bonus for this purpose.\
  \ For the duration of this spell, you are treated as if you had the chosen feat.\
  \ Once you cast this spell, you cannot change the chosen feat (or any decisions\
  \ related to that feat) for additional castings of this spell on the same day."
