description: "This spell functions like shadow transmutation, except it can mimic\
  \ greater polymorph instead of polymorph. The illusory attacks and special abilities\
  \ of any shape assumed using greater shadow transmutation deal three-fifths (60%)\
  \ damage to nonbelievers, and nondamaging effects are 60% likely to work against\
  \ nonbelievers."
