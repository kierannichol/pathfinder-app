description: "You create an area of healing mud. Water, earth, sand, and dust thicken\
  \ into a wet mud. The mud functions as difficult terrain and does not sink if created\
  \ in water unless weighed down by more than 100 pounds per caster level you have.\
  \ Each round a creature begins its turn in or on the mud, the mud restores 1 hit\
  \ point to it; this healing is unaffected by effects that increase a creature's\
  \ healing. A creature that rests partially or completely submerged in this mud for\
  \ 1 full minute is also healed of 1d4 points of ability damage to an ability score\
  \ of its choice. A creature can be healed of ability damage this way only once per\
  \ day."
