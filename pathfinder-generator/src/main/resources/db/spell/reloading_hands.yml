description: "Once per round, phantom hands load a single ranged weapon or firearm\
  \ with conjured ammunition. This ammunition counts as magical for overcoming damage\
  \ reduction and attacking incorporeal creatures, but is the standard for its type\
  \ (a normal bullet or pellets and black powder in the case of firearms). Conjured\
  \ ammunition ceases to exist 1 round after it is removed from the weapon, or at\
  \ the end of the duration, whichever comes first."
