name: "Mass Invisibility Bubble"
description: "This functions as per invisibility bubble, but the spell affects the\
  \ areas of each target creature, regardless of the creature's size. The effect moves\
  \ with the group and is broken when anyone in the group attacks. Individuals in\
  \ separate bubbles can't see each other. The spell is broken for any individual\
  \ who moves more than 180 feet from the nearest member of the group. If only two\
  \ individuals are affected, the one moving away from the other one loses its invisibility.\
  \ If both are moving away from each other simultaneously, they both become visible\
  \ when the distance between them exceeds 180 feet."
