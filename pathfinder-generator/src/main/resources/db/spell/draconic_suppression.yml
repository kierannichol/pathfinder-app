description: "A dragon that fails its saving throw cannot use its breath weapon for\
  \ the duration of the spell and is treated as one age category younger for determining\
  \ which special abilities it can use. For example, an ancient green dragon would\
  \ revert to the special abilities of a very old dragon and lose access to its miasma\
  \ ability and its dominate person spell-like ability. This spell has no effect on\
  \ a dragon's armor class, feats, frightful presence, hit points, physical attacks,\
  \ saving throws, senses, size, skills, spellcasting, or statistics."
