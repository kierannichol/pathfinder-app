description: "This spell brings into being a shimmering, sword-like plane of force.\
  \ The sword strikes at any opponent within its range, as you desire, starting in\
  \ the round that you cast the spell. The sword attacks its designated target once\
  \ each round on your turn. Its attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your\
  \ Intelligence bonus or your Charisma bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively)\
  \ with an additional +3 enhancement bonus. As a force effect, it can strike ethereal\
  \ and incorporeal creatures. It deals 4d6+3 points of force damage, with a threat\
  \ range of 19–20 and a critical multiplier of ×2."
