name: "Blood Money"
description: "You cast blood money just before casting another spell. As part of this\
  \ spell's casting, you must cut one of your hands, releasing a stream of blood that\
  \ causes you to take 1d6 points of damage. When you cast another spell in that same\
  \ round, your blood transforms into one material component of your choice required\
  \ by that second spell. Even valuable components worth more than 1 gp can be created,\
  \ but creating such material components requires an additional cost of 1 point of\
  \ Strength damage, plus a further point of damage for every full 500 gp of the component's\
  \ value (so a component worth 500–999 gp costs a total of 2 points, 1,000–1,500\
  \ costs 3, etc.). You cannot create magic items with blood money."
