description: "A flutter of subtle, telekinetic force causes your target to drop a\
  \ single nonmagical carried item weighing no more than 1 pound per caster level,\
  \ such as a coin purse, a key ring, or a loose object in its pocket. The target\
  \ must succeed at a Perception check against the spell's save DC to notice the dropped\
  \ item. You select what item the target drops as long as you can see both your target\
  \ and the item you wish to affect. This use of the spell can't cause a target to\
  \ lose a held item or anything it is wearing, including jewelry."
