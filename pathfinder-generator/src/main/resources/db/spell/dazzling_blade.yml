description: "Dazzling blade makes a weapon appear dazzlingly shiny, as if crafted\
  \ from pure silver and heavily polished. In combat, the flashing movements of a\
  \ dazzling blade become almost hypnotic. The wielder of a weapon under the effects\
  \ of dazzling blade gains a +1 competence bonus on all Bluff checks made to feint\
  \ in combat. The wielder also gains a +1 competence bonus on all CMB checks made\
  \ to disarm a foe, and a +1 competence bonus to his CMD against disarm attempts\
  \ made against the weapon bearing the dazzling blade effect. This bonus increases\
  \ by +1 for every 3 caster levels, to a maximum bonus of +5 at 12th level."
