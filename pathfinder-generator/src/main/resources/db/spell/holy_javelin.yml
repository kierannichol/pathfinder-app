name: "Holy Javelin"
description: "You create a shimmering javelin of holy energy to hurl at an enemy as\
  \ a ranged touched attack. The javelin deals 1d6 points of damage to an evil creature\
  \ on a successful attack; it dissipates harmlessly against creatures of any other\
  \ alignment. Each time a creature starts its turn while impaled by the javelin,\
  \ it takes another 1d6 points of damage. For every 4 caster levels you have, the\
  \ javelin remains in the creature for an additional round (to a maximum of 5 rounds\
  \ at 18th level). While the creature remains impaled, it takes a â€“2 penalty on attack\
  \ rolls and skill checks. As a move action, the creature (or another adjacent creature)\
  \ can attempt to pull the javelin out (causing it to immediately disappear) with\
  \ a DC 12 Strength check."
