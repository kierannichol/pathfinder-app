name: "Wall of Nausea"
description: "You create a transparent, shimmering wall through which creatures and\
  \ objects appear to be wildly distorted to viewers. Any creature that passes through\
  \ the wall is immediately assailed by overwhelming vertigo, becoming nauseated for\
  \ 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save; if nauseated, the creature must\
  \ also succeed at a DC 12 Acrobatics check or fall prone. Creatures gain partial\
  \ concealment (20% miss chance) against creatures on the other side of the wall."
