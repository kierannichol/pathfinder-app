  \ chosen descriptor, and any thrown weapons or ammunition that pass through the\
  \ augmenting wall as part of a ranged attack deal 1d6 points of energy damage of\
  \ the specified type in addition to their normal damage. The wall has no effect\
  \ on melee weapons or items not thrown as part of an attack."
