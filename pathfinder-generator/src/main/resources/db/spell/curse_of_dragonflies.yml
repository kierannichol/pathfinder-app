description: "You invest a target with cursed elemental energy, making the open skies\
  \ anathema to it. If the affected creature ever tries to fly more than 5 feet above\
  \ the ground, paper insects erupt from the air around the creature to interfere\
  \ with its movement. The affected creature's flight maneuverability decreases by\
  \ one step for every 3 caster levels you have. A creature whose maneuverability\
  \ would be brought below clumsy must land at the end of its turn each round or fall."
