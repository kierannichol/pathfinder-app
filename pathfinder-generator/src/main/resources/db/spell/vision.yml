description: "This spell functions like legend lore, except that it works more quickly\
  \ and produces some strain on you. You pose a question about some person, place,\
  \ or object, then cast the spell. If the person or object is at hand or if you are\
  \ in the place in question, you receive a vision about it by succeeding on a caster\
  \ level check (1d20 + 1 per caster level; maximum +25) against DC 20. If only detailed\
  \ information on the person, place, or object is known, the DC is 25, and the information\
  \ gained is incomplete. If only rumors are known, the DC is 30, and the information\
  \ gained is vague. After this spell is complete, you are fatigued."
