name: "Prosperous Room"
description: "The targeted room is enchanted to have magical appeal for customers,\
  \ an increase in the workflow of its employees, or the generation of additional\
  \ materials to work with. While this spell is in effect, the targeted room produces\
  \ 1 more Goods, Labor, Influence, or Magic than it already does. If the room produces\
  \ multiple types of capital, it produces an additional capital of each type. If\
  \ the room generates gp, it generates 25% more. Only the capital that the room normally\
  \ generates increases-- rooms that do not already generate Magic, for instance,\
  \ do not generate Magic because of this spell."
