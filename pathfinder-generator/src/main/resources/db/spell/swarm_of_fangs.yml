name: "Swarm of Fangs"
description: "You summon a swarm consisting of thousands of animate, flying teeth\
  \ in a 10-foot-by-10-foot cube. These fangs attack all creatures within the swarm's\
  \ area. You can summon the swarm so that it shares an area with other creatures,\
  \ and you can move the swarm up to 40 feet each round as a move action. If you choose\
  \ not to move the swarm, it automatically moves up to 40 feet to envelop the nearest\
  \ creature (including you) if it has not already done so."
