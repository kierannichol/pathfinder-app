name: "Neutralize Poison"
description: "You detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. If\
  \ the target is a creature, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level)\
  \ against the DC of each poison affecting the target. Success means that the poison\
  \ is neutralized. A cured creature suffers no additional effects from the poison,\
  \ and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse instantaneous\
  \ effects, such as hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don't\
  \ go away on their own."
