description: "There are seven variants of this spell, one for each of the Thassilonian\
  \ schools of magic. Each functions like sepia snake sigil(and counts as that spell\
  \ for the purpose of combining other spells that hide or garble text), except instead\
  \ of trapping the subject, the triggered sigil's effect depends on this spell's\
  \ school. This effect lasts for 1 day/level. This is a curse effect that can be\
  \ removed via remove curse."
