description: "This spell functions as fireball except you can cause the bead of fire\
  \ to originate from anywhere you can see within range. You can choose a number of\
  \ squares within the area up to your Intelligence bonus (for magi, occultists, or\

  \ flames; the controlled fireball deals minimum damage in those squares."
