description: "The targeted creature becomes susceptible to a repeat use of your harmful\
  \ hexes, even if you could not otherwise target that creature with a particular\
  \ hex for a certain time period. For example, normally after you target a creature\
  \ with a charm hex, you cannot target it again for 1 day. But after casting this\
  \ spell on a creature, you could try the charm hex repeatedly as long as the spell\
  \ persists. The end of this spell has no effect on any active or ongoing hex on\
  \ a creature. For example, if the creature failed its save against a second use\
  \ of your charm hex, it remains charmed for the normal duration, even if the spell\
  \ expires before the hex does."
