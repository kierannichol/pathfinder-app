description: "You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other\
  \ spot within range. You always arrive at exactly the spot desired--whether by simply\
  \ visualizing the area or by stating direction. After using this spell, you can't\
  \ take any other actions until your next turn. You can bring along objects as long\
  \ as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional\
  \ willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum\
  \ load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two\
  \ Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth.\
  \ All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least\
  \ one of those creatures must be in contact with you."
