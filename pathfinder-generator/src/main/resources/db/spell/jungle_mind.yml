description: "You merge your mind into the jungle's social hierarchy, mystically establishing\
  \ yourself as a master of wild beasts and an apex predator. You attain knowledge\
  \ about the general animal population in a radius of 1 mile as commune with nature,\
  \ and you then select one type of animal (such as birds, cats, snakes, or fish).\
  \ For the duration of the spell, you can sense the location, movement, and size\
  \ of creatures of this type in the area, though you can't discern species or individual\
  \ identity. In addition, you improve the starting attitude of animals of the chosen\
  \ type by one step for the duration of the spell."
