description: "Your target's vision becomes impaired as if the light level were one\
  \ step lower, treating bright light as normal light, normal light as dim light,\
  \ and dim light as darkness. In addition, the subject gains no benefit from darkvision,\
  \ low-light vision, or the see in darkness ability. The subject gains a +4 bonus\
  \ on saving throws to resist the blind or dazzled condition caused by bright light\
  \ (such as flare). Remove blindness/deafness dispels night blindness."
