description: "This spell functions as heroism, except that you can reverse the spell\
  \ by issuing a special command as a standard action if you are within medium range\
  \ (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) of the target. The target loses the bonuses\
  \ and instead takes a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks\
  \ until the spell's duration ends (no save)."
