name: "Sand Table"
description: "Sand table allows you to create a scale model of the battlefield surrounding\
  \ your position, showing numbers of troops, their relative positions, and their\
  \ movement as if you were observing from a great height overhead (1,000 feet up).\
  \ You cast the spell upon a table or other flat surface and cause the model to appear\
  \ upon a 5-foot-by-5-foot section of that table or surface. It reflects accurate\
  \ terrain and topography, though it doesn't identify fine topographical features\
  \ or concealed or hidden topography. It also indicates all normally visible Small\
  \ or larger creatures within the area of effect, but it doesn't provide identifying\
  \ characteristics of those creatures; each creature appears as an indistinct speck,\
  \ under 1 millimeter in each dimension."
