description: "You create a wave of thunder and force, either in a 10-foot-radius burst\
  \ centered on you or in 30-foot cone-shaped burst. Creatures in the area take 3d6\
  \ points of sonic damage and are pushed away as if bull rushed. Make a combat maneuver\
  \ check and apply its results to each creature in the area. Your CMB for this bull\
  \ rush is equal to your caster level plus your Charisma modifier. This bull rush\
  \ does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A discordant blastcannot penetrate\
  \ a silencespell (or any similar magical silence effect)."
