name: "Arid Refuge"
description: "You conjure a small stone building on any relatively flat nonliving\
  \ surface at least 20 feet square that can support its weight (such as the ocean\
  \ floor or an underwater ridge). The outline of a door is marked on one wall of\
  \ your choice or on the roof. You and anyone you designate as the spell is cast\
  \ can pass through the door, which is actually an opaque membrane of force that\
  \ keeps the surrounding atmosphere from entering the structure. Creatures you have\
  \ not designated can force their way through the door with a successful DC 28 Strength\
  \ check. The shelter is as strong as a normal stone building, resists flames and\
  \ fire as if it were stone, and is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort\
  \ cast by siege engines or giants)."
