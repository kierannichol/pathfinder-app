name: "Globe of Tranquil Water"
description: "Upon casting this spell, a rippling bubble of calm water extends outward\
  \ from you to a radius of 20 feet and remains centered on you when you move. The\
  \ bubble blocks all natural and magical precipitation such as rain, snow, and hail\
  \ (including spells such as ice storm). This bubble also pushes out any fog or mist\
  \ within the area, though it does not affect temperature and can't block natural\
  \ or magical lightning."
