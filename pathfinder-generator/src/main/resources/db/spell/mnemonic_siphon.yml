name: "Mnemonic Siphon"
description: "You inscribe a rune on the target object. The rune remains dormant until\
  \ the object finds its way into the hands of a spellcaster, at which point the rune\
  \ steals one of that creature's spells and passes the knowledge back to you. The\
  \ stolen spell is selected randomly. An object inscribed with this rune is affected\
  \ as though by the spell magic aura. Additionally, if a creature in possession of\
  \ the object casts a spell that appears on your spell list, there is a 10% chance\
  \ that the mnemonic siphon absorbs that spell, causing it to fail as though it had\
  \ been successfully countered. Whenever the mnemonic siphon absorbs a spell in this\
  \ fashion, it causes the knowledge of the absorbed spell to appear directly in your\
  \ mind. You can use this knowledge to prepare the spell if you have an unused spell\
  \ slot capable of casting it. You can also use the knowledge to write the spell\
  \ into a spellbook or teach it to your familiar. This knowledge remains in your\
  \ mind for 24 hours, after which time it is lost. The mnemonic siphon is capable\
  \ of absorbing up to 1 spell per 2 caster levels you have before being discharged.\
  \ If you are not capable of learning a stolen spell normally, the knowledge is useless\
  \ to you."
