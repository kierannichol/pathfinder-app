name: "Air of Authority"
description: "You gain an unmistakable air of authority, which clouds creatures' minds\
  \ and causes them to believe that you are their direct superior. Each creature with\
  \ whom you attempt to leverage your newfound authority receives a Will save to disbelieve\
  \ the illusion. Otherwise, it treats you as it would its direct superior. Creatures\
  \ with different direct superiors see you in different ways, which can potentially\
  \ lead to conflicts that allow additional saving throws (for instance, if a cook\
  \ sees you as the head chef, he might be quite perplexed to see the vizier treating\
  \ you as if you were the king)."
