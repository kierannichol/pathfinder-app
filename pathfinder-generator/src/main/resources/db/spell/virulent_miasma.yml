name: "Virulent Miasma"
description: "Virulent miasma creates fog like fog cloud, except that the vapors carry\
  \ the taint of disease. Living creatures take a â€“4 penalty on saving throws against\
  \ disease effects as long as they remain within the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after\
  \ leaving. This effect of the spell allows a Fortitude save to negate it, and it\
  \ is subject to spell resistance. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw against\
  \ the fog (or ignores the fog due to spell resistance) is not affected and need\
  \ not make further saves even if it remains in the fog."
