description: "A white, 15-foot-long lash of ghostly evanescence appears from your\
  \ hand. This weapon is treated as a ghost touch whip with no enhancement bonus.\
  \ You can wield it as a whip as if you were proficient. Attacks with a ghost whip\
  \ are resolved as incorporeal touch attacks. The whip affects only creatures you\
  \ attack with it, passing through objects and other creatures in its path and thereby\
  \ allowing you to ignore cover between you and your target. When a ghost whip attack\
  \ passes through total cover, the target is treated as having total concealment\
  \ (50% miss chance). Against incorporeal and undead creatures, a ghost whip deals\
  \ lethal damage and can be used to perform drag or reposition combat maneuvers (in\
  \ addition to a whip's normal disarm and trip maneuvers). A ghost whip cannot be\
  \ disarmed or sundered."
