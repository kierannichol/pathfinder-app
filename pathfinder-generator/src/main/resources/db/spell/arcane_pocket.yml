name: "Arcane Pocket"
description: "With a touch, you conjure an extradimensional space inside a pouch or\
  \ pocket. The pocket acts as a bag of holding, except it can hold only 10 pounds\
  \ per caster level. Regardless of what is placed into the pocket, it weighs 3 pounds.\
  \ Unlike a bag of holding, the pocket created by this ability cannot be overloaded\
  \ or ruptured--any additional material simply spills out of the top--nor does it\
  \ have any special interaction with other kinds of extradimensional spaces."
