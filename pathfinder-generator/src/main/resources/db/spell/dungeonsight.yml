description: "You receive a clear and memorable view of the layout of chambers, barriers,\
  \ and connecting passages within the area of effect. This spell does not reveal\
  \ the contents or inhabitants of any of these locations, only the basic architecture\
  \ of the space. For example, a staircase leading up to a pair of doors would be\
  \ apparent, but the iron golems guarding the doors would not. This spell does identify\
  \ the locations of secret doors and hidden passages but gives no clue as to the\
  \ means of opening or accessing them."
