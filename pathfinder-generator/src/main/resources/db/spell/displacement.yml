description: "The subject of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true\
  \ location. The creature benefits from a 50% miss chance as if it had total concealment.\
  \ Unlike actual total concealment, displacement does not prevent enemies from targeting\
  \ the creature normally. True seeing reveals its true location and negates the miss\
  \ chance."
