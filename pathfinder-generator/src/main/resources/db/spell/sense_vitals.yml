description: "This spell makes your eyes shine blood red and allows you to see the\
  \ vital areas and weak points of creatures within 30 feet of you as a warm glow.\
  \ This allows you to use any manufactured weapon to make sneak attacks, as the rogue\
  \ ability of the same name, dealing an additional 1d6 points of damage; this additional\
  \ damage increases by 1d6 for every 3 caster levels you possess beyond 3rd, to a\
  \ maximum of +5d6 at 15th level. This additional damage stacks with other sources\
  \ of precision damage."
