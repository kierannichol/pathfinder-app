name: "Gravity Bow"
description: "Gravity bowsignificantly increases the weight and density of arrows\
  \ or bolts fired from your bow or crossbow the instant before they strike their\
  \ target and then return them to normal a few moments later. Any arrow fired from\
  \ a bow or crossbow you are carrying when the spell is cast deals damage as if one\
  \ size larger than it actually is. For instance, an arrow fired from a Medium longbow\
  \ normally deals 1d8 points of damage, but it would instead deal 2d6 points of damage\
  \ if fired from a gravity bow. Only you can benefit from this spell. If anyone else\
  \ uses your bow to make an attack the arrows deal damage as normal for their size."
