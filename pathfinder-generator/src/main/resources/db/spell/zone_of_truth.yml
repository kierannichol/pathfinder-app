description: "Creatures within the emanation area (or those who enter it) can't speak\
  \ any deliberate and intentional lies. Each potentially affected creature is allowed\
  \ a save to avoid the effects when the spell is cast or when the creature first\
  \ enters the emanation area. Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment. Therefore,\
  \ they may avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a\
  \ lie, or they may be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the\
  \ truth. Creatures who leave the area are free to speak as they choose."
