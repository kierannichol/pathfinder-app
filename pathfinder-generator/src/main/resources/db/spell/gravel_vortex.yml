description: "You create a hail of tiny pieces of rock and dust that batter and scrape\
  \ against all things in the area, dealing 5d6 points of bludgeoning damage. This\
  \ damage is dealt only once, on the round the spell is cast. For the remaining duration\
  \ of the spell, fine dust rains down in the area. Creatures other than stone giants\
  \ inside this area take a â€“4 penalty on Perception skill checks, and the entire\
  \ area is treated as difficult terrain. At the end of the spell's duration, the\
  \ gravel and dust disappear, leaving no trace of their presence."
