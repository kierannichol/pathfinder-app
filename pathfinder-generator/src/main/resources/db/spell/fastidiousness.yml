description: "While protected by fastidiousness, your person and your equipment stay\
  \ clean and dry. Dust and moisture slough off immediately; even when you are completely\
  \ soiled, your appearance reverts to a pristine state over the course of 1 minute.\
  \ While this spell offers no protection against most attacks, staying constantly\
  \ sanitary grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on Fortitude saving throws against\
  \ inhaled and ingested diseases."
