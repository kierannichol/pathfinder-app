description: "This spell grants you a sixth sense. Once during the spell's duration,\
  \ you may choose to use its effect. This spell grants you an insight bonus equal\
  \ to your caster level (maximum +25) on any single attack roll, combat maneuver\
  \ check, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. Alternatively, you can\
  \ apply the insight bonus to your AC against a single attack (even if flat-footed).\
  \ Activating the effect doesn't take an action; you can even activate it on another\
  \ character's turn. You must choose to use the moment of prescience before you make\
  \ the roll it is to modify. Once used, the spell ends. You can't have more than\
  \ one moment of prescience active on you at the same time."
