description: "You teleport up to one ally per five caster levels to your location.\
  \ You determine which allies you want to teleport at the time of casting; these\
  \ allies have 1 round to decide to allow or refuse your spell, and they teleport\
  \ immediately upon accepting. Allies are teleported as if you had cast teleport\
  \ on them (your current location is at least â€œstudied carefully\" for this purpose),\
  \ appearing in a puff of brimstone in a space adjacent to you. If you are in combat\
  \ and your allies were not, your allies may roll initiative upon arrival but are\
  \ not considered flat-footed even though they have not taken any actions. The spell\
  \ does not function in areas warded against intrusion by evil creatures (such as\
  \ a magic circle against evil effect)."
