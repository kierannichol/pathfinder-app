name: "Calistria's Guardian Wasps"
description: "You summon a wasp swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 275) that builds a\
  \ 10-foot-by-10-foot nest in the place you designate--typically under the eaves\
  \ of a house, amid the rafters of a tavern, or in another obscured place. The wasp\
  \ swarm takes the spell's casting time to build its nest; if the swarm is disrupted\
  \ in any way (such as by being attacked) before you finish casting this spell, the\
  \ wasps disappear and the spell fizzles."
