description: "The target of this spell sees and hears a stream of past scenes and\
  \ pieces of conversations related to local people and events. The flashes are so\
  \ brief that it is impossible to identify individual people or places, but when\
  \ the target concentrates on a particular topic or individual, she can piece together\
  \ a coherent narrative told in a multitude of changing voices in her mind."
