description: "You can mold the ephemeral substance of the Outer Planes, mutating one\
  \ summoned creature that you control to better suit your needs. Select up to two\
  \ of the following abilities and grant them to the target for the spell's duration:\
  \ burrow 30 feet, climb 40 feet, constrict, darkvision 90 feet, ferocity, fly 60\
  \ feet (average maneuverability), grab, jet, low-light vision, poison, rake, scent,\
  \ swim 60 feet, trample, trip, or water breathing. Additionally, instead of selecting\
  \ an ability, you can replace one of the target's primary natural attacks with another\
  \ natural attack that deals the same amount of damage, such as replacing a Medium\
  \ target's bite attack (1d6) with a gore attack (1d6). If you choose to alter a\
  \ creature's natural attacks, all attacks of the chosen type are altered. A summoner\
  \ can target his eidolon with this spell."
