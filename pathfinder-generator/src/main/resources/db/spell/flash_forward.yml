description: "You cheat the laws of time and enter into combat before reverting back\
  \ to your original position. As part of the action to cast the spell, you make a\
  \ charge attack against an enemy. You make this charge attack normally, accounting\
  \ for terrain, obstacles, attacks of opportunity, attack rolls, and damage rolls.\
  \ At the end of your charge action, you instantly teleport back to your original\
  \ location as a free action. Any damage or conditions dealt by you or to you during\
  \ this action are real and remain when you return to your original location."
