description: "You create one or more 5-foot cubes of temporal possibility where your\
  \ timeline overlaps with those of your parallel existences. As a free action, you\
  \ can summon a duplicate of yourself (not including any animal companions, familiars,\
  \ intelligent items, or other creatures) from an alternate timeline in one of the\
  \ cubes you can see, which lasts until the end of your turn. This duplicate has\
  \ your statistics (though its hit points equal your caster level), threatens all\
  \ squares adjacent to it, and has any teamwork feats you have. Although the duplicate\
  \ appears with all of the equipment you currently carry, it cannot use any of its\
  \ equipment and all its equipment disappears when the duplicate does. This duplicate\
  \ cannot voluntarily move from the space in which it's summoned. During its brief\
  \ existence, a duplicate can use the aid another action once to assist you, but\
  \ it cannot take any other type of action. Once a duplicate disappears, the cube\
  \ of temporal possibility it occupied dissipates."
