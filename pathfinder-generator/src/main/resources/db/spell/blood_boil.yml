name: "Blood Boil"
description: "The temperature of the target creature's blood (or other similar body\
  \ fluid) begins to rise over the next 3 rounds during the caster's turn. Each round\
  \ starting with the first, the target creature attempts a new saving throw at the\
  \ start of the caster's turn to resist that round's effect. A successful save does\
  \ not end the spell effect, but does prevent that round's effect. On the round that\
  \ this spell is cast, the target becomes fatigued. On the next round, as the blood\
  \ temperature begins to rise, the target's capillaries burst, dealing 1d6 points\
  \ of Constitution damage to the target. On the third and final round, the target's\
  \ blood begins to boil; the spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (to\
  \ a maximum of 15d6), and--if the target is still alive--the target becomes exhausted\
  \ rather than fatigued."
