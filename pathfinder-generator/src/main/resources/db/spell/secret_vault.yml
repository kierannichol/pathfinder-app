name: "Secret Vault"
description: "This spell functions like secret chest, except it affects a small structure,\
  \ vault, or oversized chest. Living creatures within a secret vault don't cause\
  \ the spell to fail. While the vault is stored on the Ethereal Plane, living creatures\
  \ within the vault don't need to eat, drink, or breathe, but they can't leave the\
  \ vault except via magic such as plane shift. The vault used as a focus for secret\
  \ vault must cost at least 25,000 gp, and its replica costs 250 gp. A secret vault\
  \ has only a 1% cumulative chance per day of becoming irretrievably lost after 360\
  \ days."
