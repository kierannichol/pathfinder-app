description: "An invisible, mobile field surrounds you and prevents creatures from\
  \ approaching you. You decide how big the field is at the time of casting (to the\
  \ limit your level allows). Any creature within or entering the field must attempt\
  \ a save. If it fails, it becomes unable to move toward you for the duration of\
  \ the spell. Repelled creatures' actions are not otherwise restricted. They can\
  \ fight other creatures and can cast spells and attack you with ranged weapons.\
  \ If you move closer to an affected creature, nothing happens. The creature is not\
  \ forced back. The creature is free to make melee attacks against you if you come\
  \ within reach. If a repelled creature moves away from you and then tries to turn\
  \ back toward you, it cannot move any closer if it is still within the spell's area."
