description: "You conjure a tremendous area of shadow to obscure moonlight within\
  \ the area, creating something akin to a lunar eclipse. The light level is lowered\
  \ by two steps (though unlike deeper darkness, areas of normal light or dimmer become\
  \ normal darkness rather than supernaturally dark). Lycanthropes in the area must\
  \ make a Will save every round or revert to their humanoid forms. In addition, lycanthropes\
  \ attempting to assume animal or hybrid form within the affected area take a â€“5\
  \ penalty on Constitution checks to do so."
