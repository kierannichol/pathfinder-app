description: "An invisible sphere of magic surrounds you, clouding the minds of creatures\
  \ in the area so they regard even the strangest actions as innocuous. For example,\
  \ if you and your allies are beating a member of the city guard for information,\
  \ creatures within the area don't think this is unusual or cause for alarm; if your\
  \ ally is aiming a crossbow at the queen from a balcony, the affected creatures\
  \ accept this as normal and unworthy of concern. Any hostile actions by you or your\
  \ allies against a creature or its allies break the effect of the spell for that\
  \ creature. When the spell ends (or when the affected creatures move outside of\
  \ the range of the emanation), observers see things normally but altered perceptions\
  \ from the earlier events remain. Each mention of the events as noteworthy (such\
  \ as being questioned about them by an authority figure) allows the target another\
  \ Will save to break the effect and remember things normally."
