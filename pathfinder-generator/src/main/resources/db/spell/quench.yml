description: "Quench is often used to put out forest fires and other conflagrations.\
  \ It extinguishes all nonmagical fires in its area. The spell also dispels any fire\
  \ spells in its area, though you must succeed on a dispel check (1d20 +1 per caster\
  \ level, maximum +15) against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells\
  \ is 11 + the caster level of the fire spell."
