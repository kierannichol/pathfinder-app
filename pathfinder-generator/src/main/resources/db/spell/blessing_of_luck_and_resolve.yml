description: "A favored blessing of halfling clerics, this spell grants its target\
  \ a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. If the target has the\
  \ fearless racial trait, it is immune to fear instead. If the target fails a saving\
  \ throw against fear, it can end the spell as an immediate action to reroll the\
  \ save with a +4 morale bonus, and must take the new result, even if it is worse."
