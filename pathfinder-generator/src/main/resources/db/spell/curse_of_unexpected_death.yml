name: "Curse of Unexpected Death"
description: "You curse one living creature with a chance of instant and unexpected\
  \ death. When you cast this spell, your hand seethes with eerie gray fire. You must\
  \ succeed at a melee touch attack to touch the target, at which time the fire buries\
  \ itself within the target's body and disappears. On the round you touch the creature\
  \ and once per minute thereafter, roll 1d100. On a result of 01–05, the spell is\
  \ triggered and the creature takes 8d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level;\
  \ the creature can attempt a saving throw to reduce the damage to 2d6 points of\
  \ damage + 1 point per caster level. On a result of 06–100, nothing happens."
