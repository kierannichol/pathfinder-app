name: "Heavy Water"
description: "You cause a volume of water to become heavier than normal. Swimming\
  \ in or through such water requires a Swim check with a DC equal to the saving throw\
  \ DC of this spell; even creatures with a swim speed must attempt this check. Success\
  \ allows a creature to swim at up to half its speed as a full-round action; a creature\
  \ cannot swim as a move action while in an area of heavy water. If a creature fails\
  \ its Swim check by 4 or less, it makes no progress. If it fails by 5 or more, it\
  \ goes underwater. All Perception checks to see through the affected water take\
  \ a â€“10 penalty. All ships sailing through an area of heavy watermove at half speed."
