description: "This spell functions in any natural terrain on the Material Plane. It\
  \ redirects the flow of water in the ground toward the surface at the designated\
  \ point, creating a permanent water source similar to a natural spring. The spring\
  \ discharges 5 gallons of pure drinking water per caster level each hour. If the\
  \ shape of the terrain is suitable, a pond forms around the spring. If there is\
  \ already a natural spring within 1 mile, its water output is reduced by an amount\
  \ equal to the water produced by this spell's spring. A spring that has its water\
  \ output reduced to 0 gallons per hour dries up and ceases to be a spring."
