description: "This spell functions as hide from undead, except the spell does not\
  \ immediately end if a warded creature attempts to turn or command undead, channels\
  \ positive energy, touches an undead creature, or attacks any creature. Instead,\
  \ when the warded creature takes one of these actions, an intelligent undead creature\
  \ can attempt another Will saving throw to negate the effects of the spell."
