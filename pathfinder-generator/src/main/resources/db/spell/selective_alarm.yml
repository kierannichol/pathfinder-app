name: "Selective Alarm"
description: "This spell functions as alarm, except that you can tweak the spell to\
  \ be more discerning in what types of creatures or objects trigger the alarm. Instead\
  \ of being triggered whenever a creature of Tiny size or larger enters the warded\
  \ area, you can set whatever triggering conditions you wish, as long as they are\
  \ based on observable phenomenon. For example, you could cause the selective alarmto\
  \ trigger when creatures of a certain race (such as orcs, bugbears, or kobolds)\
  \ enter the area, or whenever a group of four or more creatures enters the area\
  \ together, or when a metal object is brought into the area. You can't choose triggering\
  \ conditions that rely on unobservable information, such as having it triggered\
  \ when creatures of a certain alignment enter the area, nor could you have the alarm\
  \ be triggered by “something worth more than 5,000 gp\" entering the area, or even\
  \ “a weapon\" entering the area, because an item's value and classification as a\
  \ weapon is subjective, and might vary from one person to the next."
