    Effect: "The primary caster channels the experiences of her previous lives into\
      \ a vessel of her current life, gaining meaningful insight from her forgotten\
      \ past. The breath of forgotten life ritual must be cast within a location of\
      \ great significance to the primary caster, such as her childhood home or marriage\
      \ shrine. The primary caster meditates on her current life by focusing on the\
      \ mirror and recalling her past deeds in reverse chronological order, while\
      \ any secondary casters act out the scenes she describes. After the casting\
      \ time, the primary caster's reflection in the mirror changes to an image of\
      \ one of her past forms. This image describes its own deeds, which are relevant\
      \ to the primary caster's immediate future and grant her a +2 insight bonus\
      \ to her Armor Class and on initiative checks for the ritual's duration. The\
      \ primary caster also gains the ability to cast legend lore as a spell-like\
      \ ability once within the following week."
