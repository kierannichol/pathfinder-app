name: "Sheet Lightning"
description: "You create a dazzling flash of electricity that fills the target area.\
  \ Sheet lightning inflicts 1 point of electricity damage to all creatures within\
  \ the area of effect (no save). The true power of the spell, though, lies not in\
  \ the damage it inflicts but in the overwhelming pain the lightning creates. The\
  \ sudden flash and jolt dazes living creatures for 1 round if they fail a saving\
  \ throw. Creatures that save are instead dazzled for 1 round. Any creature wearing\
  \ metal armor takes a â€“2 penalty to its saving throw against this spell."
