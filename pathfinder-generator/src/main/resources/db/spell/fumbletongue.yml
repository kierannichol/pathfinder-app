description: "This enchantment causes a creature to be unable to speak intelligibly.\
  \ Any effort the target makes to talk, in any language, comes out as a useless mix\
  \ of unconnected words and noises. Even magic words are affected to some extent;\
  \ the target has a 20% spell failure chance for any spell it attempts to cast with\
  \ verbal components, and a 20% chance to incorrectly use a command word to activate\
  \ a magic item. This spell has no effect on telepathic communication, or the vocalizations\
  \ of creatures that lack a spoken language."
