description: "Bleed effects on the target immediately end when this spell is cast,\
  \ and no blood flows out when the target is damaged by a slashing or piercing weapon.\
  \ The target takes the full amount of damage from attacks, but because the wounds\
  \ produce no blood, they do not attract creatures with the ability to sense blood,\
  \ such as sharks. If the target suffers another bleed effect while this spell is\
  \ in effect, the bleed effect ends and the spell is immediately dismissed."
