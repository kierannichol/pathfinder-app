description: "You mend the target's injuries, curing 3d8 hit points + 1 point per\
  \ caster level (maximum +15) as cure serious wounds, but leaving its body laced\
  \ with a subtle toxin that remains inert until you activate it. A target that decides\
  \ to attempt the Will save and succeeds is healed for half (as cure serious wounds)\
  \ and negates the toxin. Otherwise, you can activate the toxin by concentrating\
  \ on the spell as a standard action, at which point the victim takes 1d3 points\
  \ of Strength damage per round for 6 rounds. Once the poison is active, the target\
  \ can attempt a Fortitude save each round to negate that round's damage and end\
  \ the affliction. If you don't trigger the poison for 1 hour, the spell ends and\
  \ leaves the target unharmed."
