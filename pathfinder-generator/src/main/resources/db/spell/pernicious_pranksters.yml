description: "You summon intangible forces of whimsy to perform a variety of tricks\
  \ and pranks upon your foes. Each round on your turn (including the round you cast\
  \ this spell), these incorporeal pranksters perform a single dirty trick, disarm,\
  \ steal, or trip combat maneuver against one of your foes within the spell's range.\
  \ The whimsical forces have a bonus on combat maneuver checks equal to your caster\
  \ level + your primary spellcasting ability score modifier (Intelligence for wizards,\
  \ Charisma for sorcerers, etc.). Unless the target of the combat maneuver can see\
  \ invisible creatures or forces, the spell gains an additional +4 bonus on combat\
  \ maneuver checks."
