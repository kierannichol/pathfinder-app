name: "Stone Discus"
description: "You create a stone discus, which flies at an enemy. You can create one\
  \ discus, plus one additional discus at 7th and 11th caster levels. For each discus\
  \ you create, you decide whether its edge is blunt (and deals bludgeoning damage)\
  \ or sharp (and deals slashing damage). Each discus requires a ranged attack to\
  \ hit and deals 4d6 points of damage. The discuses can be launched at more than\
  \ one target, but all must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and\
  \ launched simultaneously."
