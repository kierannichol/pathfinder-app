name: "Unbreakable Heart"
description: "The target creature gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against\
  \ mind-affecting effects that rely on negative emotions (such as crushing despair,\
  \ rage, or fear effects) or that would force him to harm an ally (such as confusion).\
  \ If the target is already under such an effect when receiving this spell, that\
  \ effect is suppressed for the duration of this spell. It does not affect mind-affecting\
  \ effects based on positive emotions (such as good hope or the inspire courage bard\
  \ ability). A creature can still be charmed or otherwise magically controlled while\
  \ under this spell's effects, but if such a creature ever receives a new saving\
  \ throw against that effect as a result of being ordered to attempt to harm or otherwise\
  \ oppose a true ally, he can roll that saving throw twice and take the better result\
  \ as his actual roll. Calm emotions counters and dispels unbreakable heart."
