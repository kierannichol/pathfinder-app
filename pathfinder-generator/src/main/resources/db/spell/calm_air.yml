name: "Calm Air"
description: "This spell calms the air and disperses fog, dust, and other particles.\
  \ The wind force in the area is reduced in strength by one step per 4 caster levels\
  \ (to a minimum wind force of light) and clouds are dispersed, although parts of\
  \ nonmagical clouds that extend beyond the area are not affected. If a magical cloud\
  \ or wind's point of origin is inside the area of a calm air spell, the whole effect\
  \ is suppressed; otherwise, only the part inside the area is suppressed. Suppression\
  \ still counts against the duration of a wind or cloud effect. Magical wind and\
  \ cloud effects are suppressed only if you succeed at a caster level check (DC 11\
  \ + effect's caster level). You can move the calm air effect by concentrating as\
  \ a standard action."
