name: "Anthropomorphic Animal"
description: "You transform the touched animal into a bipedal hybrid of its original\
  \ form with a humanoid form, similar to how a lycanthrope's hybrid form is a mix\
  \ of a humanoid and animal form. The animal's size, type, and ability scores do\
  \ not change. It loses its natural attacks except for bite (if it had one as an\
  \ animal), all types of movement other than its land speed, and special attacks\
  \ that rely on its natural attacks. One pair of its limbs is able to manipulate\
  \ objects and weapons as well as human hands do; limbless animals like snakes temporarily\
  \ grow a pair of arms. The creature's Intelligence increases to 3, and it gains\
  \ the ability to speak one language you know. It is not considered proficient in\
  \ any manufactured weapons. It can attack with unarmed strikes, dealing unarmed\
  \ strike damage for a creature of its size (unless it has a bite attack, which is\
  \ a natural attack)."
