description: "This spell works like mirror image, except the illusory doubles it creates\
  \ discharge an electric shock when destroyed. An opponent that uses a melee attack\
  \ to destroy one of your images takes 2d6 points of electricity damage. You must\
  \ overcome a target's spell resistance the first time you deal this electricity\
  \ damage to it. Failure renders the target immune to damage from this spell."
