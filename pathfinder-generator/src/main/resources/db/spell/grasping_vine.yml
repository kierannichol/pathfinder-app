name: "Grasping Vine"
description: "You cause a long, thin vine to sprout from your body--typically from\
  \ the center of your chest or from the palm of an outstretched hand. As a standard\
  \ action, you can direct the end of the vine to move to any square within 20 feet\
  \ of you and perform one of the following tasks: deliver a touch spell that you\
  \ cast after the vine has grown, pick up an unattended object weighing 20 pounds\
  \ or less, give a held object to another creature, attempt to disable a trap or\
  \ lock using your Disable Device modifier with a â€“2 penalty, or perform any other\
  \ task that the GM deems reasonable. The vine does not threaten squares and cannot\
  \ make attacks of opportunity, nor can it wield weapons."
