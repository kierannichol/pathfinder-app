name: "Drain Poison"
description: "By touching a weapon against the fang of a poisonous creature and casting\
  \ this spell, you drain 1 dose of the creature's poison, which is magically applied\
  \ to your weapon without risk of poisoning yourself. The poison remains on the weapon\
  \ until either it strikes a creature, you touch the weapon, or you wipe off the\
  \ poison. It otherwise functions exactly like a dose of a manufactured poison applied\
  \ to a weapon. You can use this spell with natural as well as manufactured weapons.\
  \ This spell does not prevent you from exposing yourself to the poison if you roll\
  \ a natural 1 on an attack roll while the poison is applied to your weapon."
