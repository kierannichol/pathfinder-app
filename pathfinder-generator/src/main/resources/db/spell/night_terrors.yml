description: "The target of this spell gains no benefit from normal or magical sleep,\
  \ writhing in a series of nightmares that torture its psyche and diminish its ability\
  \ to perform strenuous tasks. The target doesn't heal ability or hit point damage\
  \ naturally and can't prepare spells or regain spell slots. After one night of poor\
  \ sleep, the target is fatigued (or exhausted if it was fatigued before trying to\
  \ rest). A creature affected by this spell doesn't recover from the fatigued or\
  \ exhausted condition inflicted by this spell after resting, nor do spells such\
  \ as lesser restoration provide any respite. Each restless night, the target takes\
  \ 1d4 points of Wisdom damage, which also can't be recovered by magic while night\
  \ terrors is active."
