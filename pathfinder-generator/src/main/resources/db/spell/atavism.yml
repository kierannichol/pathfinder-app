description: "By bringing forth the primeval ancestry of the target animal, you awaken\
  \ a savage engine of destruction. The animal immediately gains the advanced creature\
  \ simple template. It gains a +2 bonus on all rolls, including damage rolls and\
  \ special ability DCs, a +4 bonus to AC and CMD, and +2 hit points per HD. The animal's\
  \ primal instincts take hold for the duration of this spell--if the animal knows\
  \ tricks granted by the Handle Animal skill, it loses access to all of those tricks\
  \ save for â€œattack.\" This spell has no effect on animals that already have the\
  \ advanced creature template."
