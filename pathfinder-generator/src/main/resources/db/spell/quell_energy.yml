description: "You reduce the target creature's ability to tap into a single energy\
  \ type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) of your choice. This reduces damage\
  \ of the selected type the creature deals with spells, spell-like abilities, and\
  \ supernatural abilities by 10 points. Multiple castings of this spell stack. Damage\
  \ from sources other than the creature, such as objects and magic items, is not\
  \ reduced. If the damage of one of the creature's effects is negated entirely, any\
  \ additional effects associated with that damage (such being stunned by sound burst\
  \ or set on fire by a fire elemental) are also negated. At 13th level, you reduce\
  \ the target's damage by 20 points, and at 19th level, you reduce the target's damage\
  \ by 30 points."
