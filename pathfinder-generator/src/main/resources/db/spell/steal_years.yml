name: "Steal Years"
description: "You temporarily drain youth and vitality from the target and channel\
  \ it into yourself. If the target fails its Fortitude save, it physically ages 1d4\
  \ years per two caster levels (maximum 5d4), and you decrease your age by the same\
  \ number of years. If this changes the age category of you or the target, only adjust\
  \ physical ability scores. This effect cannot bring your age to lower than the minimum\
  \ age of adulthood for your race (see page 169 of the Core Rulebook). This stolen\
  \ youth does not actually change your age or prolong your life; you will still die\
  \ at your allotted time, no matter how youthful you appear. Likewise, the spell\
  \ does not add to the target's true age, and cannot make the target die of old age."
