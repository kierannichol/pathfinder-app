description: "This spell functions as black tentacles, except the tentacles blindly\
  \ grasp at the targets' eyes and ears, and tug at their hair, clothes, and equipment.\
  \ Instead of grapple attempts, the tentacles attempt dirty trick combat maneuver\
  \ checks (CMB = your caster level + 4 [the tentacles' Strength bonus] + 1 [the tentacles'\
  \ size bonus]). Roll on the following table to determine the effect of a successful\
  \ dirty trick combat maneuver check."
