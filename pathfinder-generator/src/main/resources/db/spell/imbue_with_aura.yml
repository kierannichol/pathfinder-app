description: "You infuse another creature with your divine aura, causing the target\
  \ to radiate an aura identical to your own clerical aura. The target's actual alignment\
  \ is not changed, but spells like detect evilor detect gooddetect only the aura,\
  \ not the creature's actual alignment. For the duration of this spell, effects influenced\
  \ by the target's alignment function according to the imposed aura, not the creature's\
  \ actual aura. When the spell ends, the target's aura returns to normal, and alignment-affecting\
  \ magic affects it according to its actual alignment."
