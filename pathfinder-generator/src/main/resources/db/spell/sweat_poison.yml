description: "Glands along your neck, back, or wrists swell and exude a viscous injury\
  \ poison (save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure\
  \ 1 save). You are not immune to this poison, and unless you have the poison use\
  \ class feature or a similar ability, you are at risk of poisoning yourself. You\
  \ can apply this poison to a weapon as a move action, and each dose you apply reduces\
  \ the remaining duration of this spell by 1 minute. If doing so would reduce the\
  \ remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends, and any applied poisons\
  \ retain their potency only until the end of your turn. When you apply the poison,\
  \ you can choose to reduce the spell's remaining duration by 2 or more additional\
  \ minutes (maximum = your caster level) in order to enhance that dose of poison.\
  \ For every 2 minutes of duration expended, the poison's save DC increases by 1,\
  \ the number of rounds it lasts increases by 1/2 (round down), and the number of\
  \ saves required to cure it increases by 1/4 (round down). If you have the toxic\
  \ skin alternate racial trait (Advanced Race Guide 190), you can expend one daily\
  \ use as a free action to enhance this spell's poison's damage to 1d3 Strength and\
  \ its starting save DC to 15."
