description: "While subject to this spell, the targets find that forested areas become\
  \ helpful instead of hindering. The targets suffer no hindrances to movement and\
  \ suffer no penalties on Acrobatics and Stealth checks from undergrowth in forested\
  \ terrain. Furthermore, forested overgrowth imposes a miss chance 10% lower than\
  \ normal."
