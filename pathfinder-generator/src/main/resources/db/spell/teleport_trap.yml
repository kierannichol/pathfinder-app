name: "Teleport Trap"
description: "Teleport trap wards an area, redirecting all teleportation into or out\
  \ of the area to a specific point within the area determined by you at the time\
  \ of casting. The destination must be an open space on a solid surface. The spell's\
  \ area overlaps walls and other solid and liquid objects (preventing intruders from\
  \ bypassing the ward by teleporting into a wall or through similar means). A teleporting\
  \ creature that is affected by a teleport trap can resist the effect with a Will\
  \ save--if the save is successful, the creature simply doesn't teleport at all (but\
  \ the use of the teleport effect is still consumed)--either to the intended location\
  \ or the teleport trap's actual destination. A DC 27 Knowledge (arcana) allows such\
  \ a creature to recognize the teleport trap's presence, but does not reveal the\
  \ trap's linked destination."
