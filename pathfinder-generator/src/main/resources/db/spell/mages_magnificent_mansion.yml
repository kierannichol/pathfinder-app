description: "You conjure up an extradimensional dwelling that has a single entrance\
  \ on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry point looks like a faint\
  \ shimmering in the air that is 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. Only those you designate\
  \ may enter the mansion, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when\
  \ you enter. You may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have\
  \ passed beyond the entrance, they are in a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers\
  \ beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm."
