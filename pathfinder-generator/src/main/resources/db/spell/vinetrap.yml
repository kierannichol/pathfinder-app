name: "Vinetrap"
description: "Vines choked with thorns, blossoms, leaflets, and other floral debris\
  \ burst to life on and around the subject of this spell, winding around limbs and\
  \ armor and making it progressively more difficult for the subject to maneuver.\
  \ When this spell is cast, the subject may attempt a Reflex save. Success indicates\
  \ that the vines fail to take root and the spell has no effect. On a failed save,\
  \ the subject's base speed is immediately reduced by 5 feet. Each round thereafter,\
  \ the subject must make another successful Reflex save or his speed is reduced by\
  \ another 5 feet. This occurs each round until he is reduced to a speed equal to\
  \ half of what it was before the spell was cast."
