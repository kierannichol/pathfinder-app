name: "Blurred Movement"
description: "This spell functions as blur, except that the blurring occurs only when\
  \ you move at least 10 feet on your turn and ceases at the end of your movement.\
  \ It is therefore mainly used to thwart attacks on your turn, such as attacks of\
  \ opportunity. If you move at least twice your speed on your turn, the blurring\
  \ lasts until the start of your next turn."
