name: "Sign of Wrath"
description: "A giant, glowing symbol of wrath appears below you, forcibly repulsing\
  \ all nearby creatures. All creatures within the area of effect take 1d6 points\
  \ of force damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and are subjected to a bull rush\
  \ that attempts to push them directly away from you. The blast's bull rush effect\
  \ has a CMB bonus equal to your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma\
  \ modifier (whichever is highest). You are unaffected by both the spell's damage\
  \ and its bull rush effect, and may select up to one creature per 4 caster levels\
  \ to also be ignored by the spells effects."
