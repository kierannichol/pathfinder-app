description: "You become invisible (as greater invisibility, a glamer), and at the\
  \ same time, an illusory double of you (as major image, a figment) appears. You\
  \ are then free to go elsewhere while your double moves away. The double appears\
  \ within range but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires concentration\
  \ beginning on the first round after the casting). You can make the figment appear\
  \ superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don't notice an image\
  \ appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in different\
  \ directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were\
  \ real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so."
