name: "Decrepit Disguise"
description: "You make an object seem like a worthless version of itself. A masterwork\
  \ or magic sword could seem to be a useless, rusting, discarded blade, and a luxurious\
  \ throne could appear to be a decrepit wooden chair. If used against an attended\
  \ object, the wielder can immediately attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect.\
  \ Decrepit disguise counters and dispels quintessence."
