name: "Sacred Nimbus"
description: "You are surrounded by a nimbus of golden light shaped like your god's\
  \ holy symbol or a symbol of your faith. Any evil creature striking you with unarmed\
  \ strikes, natural weapons, or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the\
  \ same time, the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level\
  \ (maximum +15). Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to\
  \ this damage if they attack you. Spell resistance applies against this damage.\
  \ You also take half damage from magical attacks with the evil descriptor. If such\
  \ an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful\
  \ saving throw."
