description: "The caster can transfer the effects of afflictions such as curses, diseases,\
  \ and poisons from the target creature to himself. This spell can also transfer\
  \ the blinded, deafened, fatigued, nauseated, shaken, and sickened conditions. All\
  \ aspects of the transferred afflictions (save DCs, remaining duration, removal\
  \ conditions, and so on) remain the same, but affect the caster instead of the original\
  \ target. After transferring the affliction or condition, the caster is free to\
  \ cure it in any way he can."
