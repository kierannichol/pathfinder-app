description: "The target weapon becomes a reservoir of spiritual energy, fueling its\
  \ destructive power by drawing in a tiny fragment of the essence of each creature\
  \ it is used to defeat. When the targeted weapon is used to reduce a living creature\
  \ to 0 or fewer hit points, it gains a +1 profane bonus on damage rolls. This bonus\
  \ increases by 1 for each creature reduced to 0 hit points or fewer with that weapon,\
  \ up to a maximum bonus equal to 1/2 your caster level."
