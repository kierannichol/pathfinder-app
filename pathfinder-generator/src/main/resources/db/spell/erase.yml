name: "Erase"
description: "Erase removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll\
  \ or from one or two pages of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces. With this spell,\
  \ you can remove explosive runes, a glyph of warding, a sepia snake sigil, or an\
  \ arcane mark, but not illusory script or a symbol spell. Nonmagical writing is\
  \ automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it. Otherwise,\
  \ the chance of erasing nonmagical writing is 90%."
