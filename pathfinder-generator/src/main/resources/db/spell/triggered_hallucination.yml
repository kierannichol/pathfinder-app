name: "Triggered Hallucination"
description: "This spell functions as audiovisual hallucination, except that this\
  \ spell's phantasm has no apparent effect until a specific condition occurs. You\
  \ must overcome the target's spell resistance to plant the triggered hallucination,\
  \ but the target doesn't attempt a Will save to disbelieve the illusion until the\
  \ condition occurs (at which point it receives an automatic Will save, as with audiovisual\
  \ hallucination). The phantasm can include auditory, olfactory, visual, tactile,\
  \ and thermal elements, including intelligible speech."
