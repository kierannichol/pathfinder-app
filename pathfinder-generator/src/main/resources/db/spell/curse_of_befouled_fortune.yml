name: "Curse of Befouled Fortune"
description: "You curse the target, making it incredibly unlucky. While affected by\
  \ curse of befouled fortune, the target can't receive luck bonuses or benefit from\
  \ effects that grant it the ability to roll multiple times and take the higher result\
  \ (like the swashbuckler's charmed life ability). The target also can't choose a\
  \ die result, such as taking 10 or 20 in lieu of rolling (as per the bard's lore\
  \ master ability). Finally, the first time each turn the target would succeed at\
  \ an attack, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and use the worse\
  \ of the two results."
