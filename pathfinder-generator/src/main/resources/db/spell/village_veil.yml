description: "You throw an illusion over an area to make creatures that view or interact\
  \ with it believe it has suffered some great catastrophe or calamity that renders\
  \ it utterly worthless for their needs. You must set a few general guidelines when\
  \ casting the spell as to the nature of this disaster (fire, tornado, bandit raid,\
  \ plague, etc.), after which the illusion fills in the remaining details to make\
  \ it seem realistic. When casting the spell, you can grant creatures with particular,\
  \ clearly identifiable physical traits (race, gender, age category, etc.) immunity\
  \ to this spell. This allows all such eligible creatures to perceive the true nature\
  \ of the affected area instead of its illusory appearance. Creatures without this\
  \ immunity that fail their saving throws always perceive the affected area as having\
  \ absolutely nothing of interest or worth to them. Unless they have reason for suspicion,\
  \ they always move on without closely investigating the area. Creatures with sufficient\
  \ reasons for suspicion who do choose to investigate the area gain another saving\
  \ throw, this one with a +2 bonus, as they enter the village and directly interact\
  \ with the illusion."
