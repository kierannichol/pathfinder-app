name: "Reinvigorating Wind"
description: "You exhale deeply, creating a gentle magical wind that invigorates any\
  \ allies in the affected area, as follows. Any sleeping allies immediately wake\
  \ up. Fascinated allies are shaken free of the fascinate effect. Flat-footed allies\
  \ no longer count as flat-footed even if they have not acted yet. The duration of\
  \ effects that cause any allies to be confused, frightened, paralyzed, slowed, or\
  \ stunned is decreased by 1d4 rounds (roll separately for each target). If the duration\
  \ of any such effect is reduced to 0 rounds or fewer, the effect ends for that ally.\
  \ Finally, any allies lying prone may stand up as an immediate action, provoking\
  \ attacks of opportunity as normal."
