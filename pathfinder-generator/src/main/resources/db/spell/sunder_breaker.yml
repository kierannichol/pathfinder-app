description: "You place an invisible ward upon the target. The next time a creature\
  \ succeeds at a sunder combat maneuver against the target, the attacker's weapon\
  \ takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). If the attacker used\
  \ a natural weapon for the sunder, the attacker takes half this damage. Spell resistance\
  \ applies to this damage. The attacker can attempt a Fortitude save to halve this\
  \ damage."
