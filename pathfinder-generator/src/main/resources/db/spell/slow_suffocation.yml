name: "Slow Suffocation"
description: "The target is unable to breathe and is treated as if she is holding\
  \ her breath (see the rules for suffocation). Strong stimulants, effects that increase\
  \ the target's Constitution, or physical trauma (such as taking 10 or more points\
  \ of damage from a single attack) negate the spell immediately. Creatures that do\
  \ not need to breathe are immune to this spell. The target is considered to have\
  \ taken a dose of pesh for the purpose of addiction and withdrawal effects. Canny\
  \ sahir use this spell to subtly kill enemies, as the spell mimics a pesh overdose."
