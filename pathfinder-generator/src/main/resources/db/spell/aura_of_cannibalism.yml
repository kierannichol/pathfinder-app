description: "You emanate an aura that saps the strength of others of your kind and\
  \ channels their energy into you. Each round that a creature starts its turn in\
  \ the spell's area and shares both your creature type and at least one subtype you\
  \ possess (if any), that creature must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 points\
  \ of damage. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage\
  \ you deal with this spell (maximum 10 + your caster level). These temporary hit\
  \ points go away when the spell ends."
