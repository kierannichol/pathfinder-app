description: "You can sense the location of a target creature within range if it is\
  \ also within 10 feet of a living plant or fungus. You must be able to target the\
  \ creature by tangible qualities such as its build, clothing texture, size, or tracks,\
  \ but you need not have line of effect to your target. The fungus or plants near\
  \ the target serve as a scrying sensor for this spell. Your senses of hearing, smell,\
  \ and touch extend to all fungus and plants within 10 feet of the target, allowing\
  \ you to gauge the size and shape of nearby objects and potentially to overhear\
  \ conversations in which the target is currently participating. Your scent ability\
  \ and tremorsense extend through this scrying sensor if you have them, but any other\
  \ special senses you might have do not. For 1 day after casting this spell, you\
  \ gain a +5 insight bonus on Survival checks to track creatures you sensed via the\
  \ spell. You can dismiss this bonus on Survival checks."
