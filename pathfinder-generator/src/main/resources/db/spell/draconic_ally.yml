name: "Draconic Ally"
description: "You create a semi-living intelligent draconic servant that loyally obeys\
  \ and serves you. Treat this servant as a pseudodragon with all of the abilities\
  \ granted by one of the following spells: form of the alien dragon I, form of the\
  \ dragon I, or form of the exotic dragon I. Your draconic ally can use its breath\
  \ weapon once per day. Once conjured, the creature is not limited to the spell's\
  \ range, and can go a considerable distance to carry out missions at your command.\
  \ The draconic ally speaks one language of your choice that you know. You cannot\
  \ have more than one draconic ally at a time. As long as a previous ally exists,\
  \ you cannot successfully cast this spell again. If you have a breath weapon, you\
  \ can cast this spell as a standard action by expending one use of your breath weapon\
  \ as a free action when you cast the spell."
