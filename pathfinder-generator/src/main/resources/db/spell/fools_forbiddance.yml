description: "Through your antics and performance, you create an area of warding that\
  \ adversely affects all enemies that dare enter it. When an enemy creature enters\
  \ the area it must make an immediate Will saving throw. If it fails, the creature\
  \ is confused as long as it is in the area and for 1 round after it leaves. If it\
  \ succeeds on the saving throw, the creature is staggered as long as it is in the\
  \ area and for 1 round after it leaves."
