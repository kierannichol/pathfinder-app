description: "You gain access to the subject's memories and knowledge. You can attempt\
  \ to learn the answer to one question per round. A successful Will save ends the\
  \ spell. Otherwise, the creature can attempt a Bluff check with a DC equal to 11\
  \ + your Sense Motive modifier. If it fails its Bluff check, you gain the answer\
  \ you desire. If it succeeds at its check, you gain no information. If it succeeds\
  \ by 5 or more, it answers whatever it chooses, and you believe that wrong answer\
  \ to be true. Your questions are purely telepathic inquiries, and the answers to\
  \ those questions are imparted directly to your mind. You and the target don't need\
  \ to speak the same language, though less intelligent creatures may yield up only\
  \ appropriate sensory images in answer to your questions."
