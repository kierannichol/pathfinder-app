name: "Pessimism"
description: "You erode the target's confidence and instill a sense of despair. This\
  \ fear of failure manifests as a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability\
  \ checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls. Additionally, the target can't\
  \ gain morale bonuses of any kind while the spell remains in effect. No amount of\
  \ achievement counters the spell's effects--the target simply explains away positive\
  \ events with a self-critical perspective."
