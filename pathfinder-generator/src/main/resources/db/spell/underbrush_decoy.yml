description: "You cause a plant to rustle noisily, distracting nearby creatures. You\
  \ can attempt a Bluff check to create a distraction to hide, using your caster level\
  \ + your Wisdom modifier in place of your total Bluff skill bonus and applying the\
  \ result to all creatures within 30 feet. You count the target as distracted, as\
  \ do any creatures that knew about your distraction in advance. Creatures might\
  \ not be distracted if they detect you casting the spell or otherwise anticipate\
  \ your subterfuge."
