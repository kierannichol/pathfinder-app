description: "Your animal companion's bite attack deals an additional 1d4 points of\
  \ acid damage, and the acid deals another 1d4 points of acid damage to the target\
  \ on the next round. The acid continues to deal damage for 1 additional round per\
  \ 4 caster levels (to a maximum of 6 total rounds at caster level 20th). This ongoing\
  \ acid damage doesn't stack from multiple attacks, but the duration resets if a\
  \ newer bite would cause the ongoing damage to last longer than the duration remaining\
  \ from a previous one. The acid does not harm the animal companion."
