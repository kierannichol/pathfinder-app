name: "Psychonaut Manifestation"
description: "You take a mental journey through the doors of perception to enter an\
  \ altered state of consciousness. Despite this hallucinatory transmigration being\
  \ entirely unreal, your mind and body fully react to it. You gain a +4 alchemical\
  \ bonus to a random ability score, as well as a corresponding –2 penalty. If the\
  \ bonus applies to Strength, the penalty applies to Intelligence, and vice versa.\
  \ If the bonus applies to Dexterity, the penalty applies to Wisdom, and vice versa.\
  \ If the bonus applies to Constitution, the penalty applies to Charisma, and vice\
  \ versa. Each round as a standard action, you can explore the nooks and crannies\
  \ of your imagination to further alter your corporal self. If you do so, attempt\
  \ a Will save against the spell's save DC. If you succeed, randomly select another\
  \ ability score and change the alchemical bonus and associated penalty accordingly.\
  \ If you fail, you are dazed for 1 round instead as your mind reels from learning\
  \ unexpected truths about yourself."
