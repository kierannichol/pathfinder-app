name: "Reveal True Shape"
description: "You reveal the true form of a magically disguised or transformed creature,\
  \ whether the target's transformation is physical (such as polymorph) or illusory\
  \ (such as disguise self). The spell does not force the creature into its true form,\
  \ but rather creates a perfect illusion of the creature's true form that overlaps\
  \ it and hides the disguised form completely, making the true form visible to all\
  \ observers. For the duration of the spell, if the target changes shape or uses\
  \ illusion to disguise its appearance, observers can still see its true form, though\
  \ once the spell runs out any illusions or shape changes made by the target in the\
  \ meantime immediately take effect. This spell does not reveal invisible creatures,\
  \ overcome effects such as blur and displacement, or penetrate mundane disguises."
