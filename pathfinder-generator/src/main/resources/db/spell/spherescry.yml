name: "Spherescry"
description: "This spell allows remote viewing through spheres that have previously\
  \ consumed some portion of the spellcaster's body: a single digit of a finger or\
  \ toe at a minimum. The caster can view and listen to events within a 20-foot radius\
  \ of the associated sphere; this radius follows the sphere if the sphere moves.\
  \ Unlike a true scrying spell, no other spells operate through the associated sphere,\
  \ but spherescry produces no indication of its activity on the target and cannot\
  \ be discovered by normal methods of magical detection."
