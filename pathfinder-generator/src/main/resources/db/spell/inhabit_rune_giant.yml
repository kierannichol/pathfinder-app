    Effect: "The ritual allows the primary caster to inhabit the body of a rune giant\
      \ that she knows firsthand as if using possession. The rune giant must be within\
      \ 100 miles per character level of the primary caster when the ritual is complete.\
      \ The rune giant receives no save against this effect. Unlike possession, the\
      \ primary caster can use all of her own abilities as well as the rune giant's\
      \ abilities while possessing the rune giant, and the primary caster can choose\
      \ to use either her own or the rune giant's base attack bonus or base save bonuses.\
      \ While the primary caster inhabits the rune giant, the rune giant gains 5 bonus\
      \ hit points per character level of the primary caster."
