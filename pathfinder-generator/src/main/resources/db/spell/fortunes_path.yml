description: "You predict events in your near future. Visions of the foretold events\
  \ appear in the mirror after you cast this spell. Roll d% and add your caster level\
  \ (maximum 10) to determine results this spell returns, as listed below. d% Result\
  \ 1-15 The mirror is murky. You foresee nothing specific. 16-35 You inaccurately\
  \ predict a major event similar to the major events described in the 76â€“100 result.\
  \ 36-50 You accurately predict a minor event likely to happen in the following week\
  \ with no context, such as the chance meeting of an acquaintance, discovery of interesting\
  \ but inapplicable information, victory in a minor game of chance, or the like.\
  \ Alternatively, you predict an event so likely to happen that it might be obvious,\
  \ such as the birth of a child or the collapse of a poorly built structure. 51-75\
  \ You accurately predict a generally positive or negative event to happening in\
  \ the following week in a broad category such as academic, battle, domestic, political,\
  \ professional, romantic, social, or travel. The details of the prediction should\
  \ provide enough context for you to determine how your actions in the past week\
  \ have influenced the happening. 76-100 You accurately predict a major event likely\
  \ to happen in the next week. For example, you might foresee an enemy ambush, the\
  \ discovery of sought-after information, or inclement weather causing significant\
  \ travel delay (though this spell would not show you the event's exact details).\
  \ At the GM's discretion, the vision might depict the location of the event."
