description: "The transmuted creature becomes wiser. The spell grants a +4 enhancement\
  \ bonus to Wisdom, adding the usual benefit to Wisdom-related skills. Clerics, druids,\
  \ and rangers (and other Wisdom-based spellcasters) who receive owl's wisdom do\
  \ not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Wisdom, but the save DCs\
  \ for their spells increase."
