name: "Synesthesia"
description: "You overstimulate the senses of the affected creature, causing its senses\
  \ to interfere with another. While a creature is under the effects of this spell,\
  \ sensory input is processed by the wrong senses, such that noise triggers bursts\
  \ of colors, smells create sounds, and so on. The affected creature moves at half\
  \ speed, has a 20% miss chance on attacks, and takes a â€“4 penalty to AC and on skill\
  \ checks and Reflex saves. Successful spellcasting while affected requires a concentration\
  \ check with a DC equal to this spell's save DC plus the level of spell being cast."
