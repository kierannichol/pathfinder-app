description: "Resurgent transformationgrants you the ability to recover from deadly\
  \ wounds with restored vitality and a will to fight, but at a price. Once cast,\
  \ resurgent transformationlies dormant for up to 1 hour per level until you are\
  \ reduced to one-quarter hit points or less. Once triggered, you immediately gain\
  \ a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution and Strength, damage reduction 5/--, and\
  \ the benefits of a hastespell. In addition, you heal 4d8 points of damage + 1 point\
  \ per caster level (maximum +25). Resurgent transformationcan even save you from\
  \ death by healing the damage from an otherwise mortal wound, though it does not\
  \ prevent death from massive damage or from causes other than hit point loss. Your\
  \ mental faculties are impaired by this magical transformation, however, causing\
  \ 1d4 points of Intelligence and Wisdom damage."
