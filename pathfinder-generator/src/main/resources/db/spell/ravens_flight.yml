name: "Raven's Flight"
description: "You can cast this spell only if it is the first action you take on your\
  \ turn. In a burst of shadowy feathers, you turn into a Tiny blurred shape reminiscent\
  \ of a black raven until the beginning of your next turn. You gain a fly speed of\
  \ 50 feet with good maneuverability, and apply appropriate size modifiers (though\
  \ your ability scores don't change). Until the beginning of your next turn, you\
  \ can take only the 5-foot step, move, run, or withdraw actions. If the spell is\
  \ dispelled while you are still aloft, the power of flight dissipates slowly; you\
  \ float downward 60 feet on your next turn, then fall any remaining distance."
