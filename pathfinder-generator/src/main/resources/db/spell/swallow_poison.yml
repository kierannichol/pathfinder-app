name: "Swallow Poison"
description: "A special gland grows on the inside of your throat, which absorbs any\
  \ poisons that you ingest, and can be used to expel them in a toxic spray. Any time\
  \ you consume ingested poison during the spell's duration, you can roll a caster\
  \ level check against the poison's save DC in order to harmlessly absorb the poison,\
  \ ignoring its effects. The spell can absorb up to 1 dose of poison per 3 caster\
  \ levels, after which the gland is unable to process any more poison, and any further\
  \ doses of ingested poison affect you normally."
