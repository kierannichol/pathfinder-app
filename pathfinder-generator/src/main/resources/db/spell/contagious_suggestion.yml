name: "Contagious Suggestion"
description: "This spell functions as per suggestion, except the target can pass on\
  \ the enchantment to other targets. The target is compelled to communicate your\
  \ suggestion to another creature, forcing the new target to attempt a saving throw\
  \ as if it were the initial target. If a secondary target successfully saves, the\
  \ suggestion effect on the initial target isn't negated. If a secondary target fails,\
  \ it is placed under the same compulsion as the initial target and can further spread\
  \ the suggestion. This spell can affect a total number of Hit Dice of creatures\
  \ equal to your caster level. Creatures that save against this spell cannot be affected\
  \ by that particular casting of contagious suggestion for 24 hours."
