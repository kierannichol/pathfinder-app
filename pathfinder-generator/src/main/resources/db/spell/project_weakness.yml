description: "You curse the target with the weaknesses of your kind of vampirism.\
  \ The creature reacts to garlic, mirrors, ringing bells, sunlight, and so on as\
  \ if it were a vampire of the same type as you. This cannot kill the target; anything\
  \ that would kill it (such as a lengthy exposure to sunlight if you are a moroi\
  \ vampire) renders it helpless until the curse or the harmful effect is removed.\
  \ The target gains none of the benefits of being a vampire (such as fast healing\
  \ or requiring special ways to be permanently killed), only the penalties."
