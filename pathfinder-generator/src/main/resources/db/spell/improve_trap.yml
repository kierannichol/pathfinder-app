name: "Improve Trap"
description: "When this spell is cast upon a trap, it improves one specific element\
  \ of the trap chosen at the time of casting. The caster can improve the trap in\
  \ any of the following ways (each one raises the trap's CR by +1). Increase DC of\
  \ the Perception check required to locate the trap by +5. Increase DC of the Disable\
  \ Device check required to disarm trap by +5. Increase the trap's attack bonus or\
  \ saving throw by +2. To cast this on a trap, you must know that the trap exists\
  \ and its precise location. A trap can only have one improvement from this spell\
  \ at a time. A second casting changes the improvement on the trap, but does not\
  \ add another improvement."
