description: "You temporarily alter the target's memory (similar to modify memory)\
  \ to eliminate, change, or implant a memory of up to 1 hour in length. When the\
  \ duration of this expires, the target's real memory returns, and the false memory\
  \ fades to little more than a vague outline, like a dream. This false memory seems\
  \ true to the target, so effects that detect lies or force the target to speak the\
  \ truth (as the subject understands it) don't detect the falsehood."
