description: "When you cast this spell, you must hold out a miniature model of the\
  \ ship you intend to create. The spell assembles a ship from raw materials conjured\
  \ from other planes, taking a shape similar to the miniature ship in your hand.\
  \ The miniature ship must be elaborately carved and worth 10% of the price of the\
  \ type of ship it represents. The ship comes with all equipment necessary for sailing\
  \ or rowing the ship but provides no crew or cargo. If you attempt to conjure the\
  \ ship into a location where there isn't a sufficient amount of water to keep the\
  \ ship afloat, the spell fails. The ship displaces all water and Medium or smaller\
  \ aquatic animals within its space when it appears, but the location must be otherwise\
  \ unoccupied at the time of casting the spell. You can cast this spell again to\
  \ extend the duration of the conjured ship, replacing the remaining duration with\
  \ the new spell's duration. When the spell's duration ends or the spell is dismissed,\
  \ the ship instantly stops moving and then falls apart over the course of a minute."
