description: "You invisibly inscribe a small mark or short message (no more than 25\
  \ words) on a creature or object, similar to the way arcane mark works. The sign\
  \ can be no more than 6 inches across, and if it's a written message, it can be\
  \ in any language you can read and write at the time of the spell's casting. As\
  \ you cast the spell, you can define one auditory, olfactory, tangible, or visual\
  \ criterion--such as all creatures wearing green bands on their left arms or only\
  \ creatures who smell of lavender or only orcs--that allows designated creatures\
  \ within 30 feet to see the secret sign."
