description: "When cast, this spell prevents divination spells from detecting or locating\
  \ the target and also renders the affected target invisible (as the invisibility\
  \ spell). The spell does not prevent the subject from being discovered through tactile\
  \ means or through the use of devices. Creatures affected by sequester become comatose\
  \ and are effectively in a state of suspended animation until the spell ends."
