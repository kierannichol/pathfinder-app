description: "As part of the casting of this spell, you must deal 1 point of piercing\
  \ or slashing damage to yourself to release your blood. This causes you to take\
  \ 1 point of bleed damage. While the spell is in effect, all sharks, feeders in\
  \ the depths, and creatures with the blood frenzy ability in the area gain a +2\
  \ bonus to Strength and Constitution and take a â€“2 penalty to AC. This is treated\
  \ as blood frenzy for the purposes of other feats and effects, and doesn't stack\
  \ with the effects of actual blood frenzy. If you cease bleeding, the spell immediately\
  \ ends."
