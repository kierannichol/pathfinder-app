    Effect: "This ritual is cast as part of constructing a campsite. The primary caster\
      \ and any secondary casters work to secure a 30-foot perimeter around a central\
      \ campfire. The fire is ringed with ritualistic warding stones, which are required\
      \ as foci to complete the ritual. These warding stones can be used only once\
      \ every 7 days, though the primary caster can purchase additional sets of stones\
      \ if she wishes to create multiple campsites during that time. If the ritual\
      \ is successful, several effects occur for the duration of the ritual or until\
      \ the primary caster decides to dispel the ritual (a full-round action)."
