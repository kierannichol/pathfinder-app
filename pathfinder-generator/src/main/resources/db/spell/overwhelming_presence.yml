name: "Overwhelming Presence"
description: "Your presence inspires incredible awe in those nearby. A creature that\
  \ fails a save against this spell falls to the ground and prostrates itself before\
  \ you, believing it bows before a divine presence. A flying creature incapable of\
  \ hovering must land immediately in order to prostrate itself. These creatures are\
  \ considered to be helpless for the duration of the spell. Each round on its turn,\
  \ a target of this spell may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect; this\
  \ is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A creature\
  \ that recovers from this spell early after being affected by it for at least 1\
  \ round takes 1d6 points of Wisdom drain and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. A creature\
  \ that makes the initial save to resist this spell is merely staggered for 1 round."
