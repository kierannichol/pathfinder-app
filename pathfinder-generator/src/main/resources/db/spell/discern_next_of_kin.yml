description: "You can scan the thoughts of one individual and learn the names and\
  \ locations of the target's living relatives, as well as the attitude of the target\
  \ toward those relatives (and vice versa). You learn about one relative per round\
  \ you concentrate on the target. For example, you might learn that the target's\
  \ father's name is Jarn, the father lives on a nearby farm, and the target and his\
  \ father don't get along. Since this spell reads the target's mind, you can learn\
  \ only what the target knows or believes."
