name: "Hallucinatory Decor"
description: "You transform the decor of a courtyard, structure, or other edifice\
  \ to meet your highest standards and personal tastes. Objects and architectural\
  \ elements remain in the same configuration--a chair remains a chair--but can look,\
  \ sound, and smell like a different physical material and artistic style. You cannot\
  \ change the appearance of natural terrain, but landscaped areas such as a garden\
  \ or orchard can be affected. This spell functions in all other ways as hallucinatory\
  \ terrain."
