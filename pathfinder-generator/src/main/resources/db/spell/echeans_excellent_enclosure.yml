description: "You call into being around you an invisible barrier of force within\
  \ which magic cannot persist. Within the area of the spell, effects are suppressed\
  \ and creatures are affected as by antimagic field. An immobile sphere of impenetrable\
  \ force surrounds the field, equivalent in all ways to a spherical wall of force,\
  \ including its immunity to dispel magic and vulnerability to a sphere of annihilation\
  \ or rod of cancellation. The barrier has hardness 40 and 20 hit points per caster\
  \ level, and can be damaged by both mundane attacks and spells cast from outside\
  \ the field. If the bubble of force is destroyed, the spell's duration ends."
