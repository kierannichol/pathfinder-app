name: "Detect Psychic Significance"
description: "You detect the presence of psychically significant items in your vicinity.\
  \ Such items are those that might have significant psychic imprints or histories\
  \ that can be read by the psychometry occult skill unlock (see page 196), or items\
  \ under the effects of the charge object or implant false reading spells. Items\
  \ within range that contain significant psychic energy spark a recognition in your\
  \ mind's eye, but no other information is imparted. This spell doesn't automatically\
  \ detect magic items or strongly aligned items, though such items often have storied\
  \ histories and might have had previous owners who possessed psychic abilities."
