description: "You wrap the target in a mantle of summery air, within which the ambient\
  \ temperature never falls below 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Creatures with the cold subtype\
  \ that start their turns in the area take an amount of fire damage equal to 1d4\
  \ points + 1 point per 2 caster levels (maximum 1d4+5) with no saving throw. Each\
  \ time an evil dragon, fey, or giant takes damage from the spell, it must succeed\
  \ at a Will saving throw or become shaken for 1 round. Creatures attempting to cast\
  \ a cold spell in the area must succeed at a Will save or the spell fails. Succeeding\
  \ at one such save to cast a spell allows a creature to continue casting cold spells\
  \ in the area for the spell's remainder."
