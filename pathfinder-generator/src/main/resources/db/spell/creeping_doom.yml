description: "This spell summons four massive swarms of biting and stinging insects.\
  \ These swarms appear adjacent to one another, but can be directed to move independently.\
  \ Treat these swarms as centipede swarms with the following adjustments. The swarms\
  \ have 60 hit points each and deal 4d6 points of damage with their swarm attack.\
  \ The save to resist their poison and distraction effects is equal to the save DC\
  \ of this spell. Creatures caught in multiple swarms only take damage and make saves\
  \ once."
