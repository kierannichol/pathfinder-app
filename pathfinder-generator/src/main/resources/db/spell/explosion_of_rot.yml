description: "You call forth a burst of decay that ravages all creatures in the area.\
  \ Even nonliving creatures such as constructs and undead crumble or wither in this\
  \ malignant eruption of rotting energy. Creatures in the area of effect take 1d6\
  \ points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and are staggered for 1d4 rounds.\
  \ A target that succeeds at a Reflex saving throw takes half damage and negates\
  \ the staggered effect. Plant creatures are particularly susceptible to this rotting\
  \ effect; a plant creature caught in the burst takes a â€“2 penalty on the saving\
  \ throw and takes 1 extra point of damage per die."
