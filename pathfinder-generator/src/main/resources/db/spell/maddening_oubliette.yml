id: "spell:maddening_oubliette"
name: "Maddening Oubliette"
description: "The target is transported to a dark and dank prison in some unspecified\
  \ horrific demiplane, where tentacles writhe around, clawed fingers grab at the\
  \ creature (though they deal no damage), and harsh, whispering voices speak blasphemies\
  \ and maddening secrets. At the end of each round within this terrifying oubliette,\
  \ the target can attempt a Will saving throw in order to escape the prison. The\
  \ saving throw has a penalty equal to the number of rounds the target has spent\
  \ in the oubliette (minimum –1 and maximum –5). If the target succeeds at its saving\
  \ throw, it returns to its former space. If that space is occupied or otherwise\
  \ unavailable, the target is shunted to the nearest available space. When the target\
  \ returns from the oubliette, it is confused for a number of rounds equal to the\
  \ number of rounds of imprisonment (minimum 1), unless it was confined in the oubliette\
  \ for 10 or more rounds, in which case the target is affected as if it were subject\
  \ to an insanity spell instead."
