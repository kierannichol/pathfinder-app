description: "You give the target a mental urge to kill its nearest ally, which it\
  \ obeys to the best of its ability. The target attacks its nearest ally on its next\
  \ turn with a melee weapon or natural weapon. If necessary, it moves to or charges\
  \ to the nearest ally in order to make this attack. If it is unable to reach its\
  \ closest ally on its next turn, the target uses its turn to get as close as possible\
  \ to the ally."
