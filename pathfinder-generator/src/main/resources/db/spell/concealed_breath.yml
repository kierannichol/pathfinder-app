name: "Concealed Breath"
description: "This spell allows affected creatures to hold their breath freely without\
  \ negative effects or risk of suffocation. Divide the duration evenly among all\
  \ creatures touched. A creature that doesn't need to breathe because of this spell\
  \ is not at risk of drowning and is immune to effects that require breathing, such\
  \ as inhaled poisons. This does not grant immunity to cloud or gas attacks that\
  \ don't require breathing. While a creature is holding its breath, it can't speak\
  \ or cast spells with a verbal component (unless it's using Silent Spell). This\
  \ spell does not prevent a creature from breathing normally; it just removes the\
  \ need for the creature to breathe."
