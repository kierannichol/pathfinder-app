description: "This spell enhances your spells that bring the dead back to life. If\
  \ you cast raise dead, the target creature is restored to full hit points. If you\
  \ cast breath of life, that spell can revive a dead target as long as you cast it\
  \ within a number of rounds equal to half your caster level, and the healing effect\
  \ is treated as if the spell were empowered with the Empower Spell feat. Casting\
  \ any of these spells discharges the invigorating repose spell."
