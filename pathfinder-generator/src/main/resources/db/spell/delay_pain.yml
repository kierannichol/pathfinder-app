description: "You override the target's ability to feel pain. Pain effects (such as\
  \ pain strikeand symbol of pain) do not affect the target until this spell's duration\
  \ has expired. This does not negate any physical damage, ability damage, or ability\
  \ drain that a pain effect has already done, but it does negate ongoing penalties\
  \ from pain while the spell lasts."
