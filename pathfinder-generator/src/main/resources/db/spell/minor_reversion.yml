description: "You create an imperfect replica of yourself within the Akashic Record\
  \ at the time the spell is cast. You must currently have a number of hit points\
  \ equal to or greater than half your maximum hit points to cast the spell. If at\
  \ any time during the duration of the spell you are brought below half your maximum\
  \ hit points, you can end this spell as an immediate action to absorb strength from\
  \ your replica and immediately regain a number of hit points equal to 1d8 plus 1\
  \ point per caster level (maximum +5)."
