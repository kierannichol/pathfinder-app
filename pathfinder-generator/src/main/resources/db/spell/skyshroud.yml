description: "The caster designates the area of a hemisphere within the spell's range.\
  \ If a solid object would block the creation of the hemisphere (such as a ceiling\
  \ or wall), the spell instead conforms to the geometry of the location up to the\
  \ maximum area of effect for the spell. The hemisphere displays an image of the\
  \ sky as it appears directly above where the spell was cast. This effect bypasses\
  \ natural impediments, such as rock or stone, that would obstruct the targeted location\
  \ from the sky."
