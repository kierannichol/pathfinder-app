description: "You cause ammunition, including shuriken, to exude radiant energy. Creatures\
  \ that take penalties in bright light take these penalties for 1 round after being\
  \ struck by such ammunition. Undead and creatures harmed by sunlight take an additional\
  \ 1d6 points of damage from such projectiles. This extra damage and half of any\
  \ other damage you deal with an affected projectile results directly from radiant\
  \ energy and is not subject to damage resistance. Such a projectile sheds light\
  \ as if it were a sunrod for 1 round after it is fired or thrown."
