name: "Tidal Surge"
description: "If you cast tidal surge on land, you create an onrushing surge of water\
  \ 10 feet high in a 30-foot cone that deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for\
  \ every 2 caster levels you have (maximum 10d6 at 20th level) and extinguishes all\
  \ nonmagical fires in the area. Magical fire effects in the area of a tidal surge\
  \ are affected as if you had cast dispel magic. In addition to taking damage, creatures\
  \ that fail their Reflex saves are pushed 1d4Ã—5 feet away from you, and Medium or\
  \ smaller creatures are also knocked prone."
