name: "Greater Shout"
description: "This spell functions like shout, except that the cone deals 10d6 points\
  \ of sonic damage (or 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level, maximum 20d6,\
  \ against exposed brittle or crystalline objects or crystalline creatures). It also\
  \ causes creatures to be stunned for 1 round and deafened for 4d6 rounds. A creature\
  \ in the area of the cone can negate the stunning and halve both the damage and\
  \ the duration of the deafness with a successful Fortitude save. A creature holding\
  \ vulnerable objects can attempt a Reflex save to negate the damage to those objects."
