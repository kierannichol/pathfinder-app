description: "With a single primal howl, you strike fear in your opponents. Until\
  \ the end of the spell's duration, you treat those affected by it as if they were\
  \ your favored enemy, gaining a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against\
  \ them, and a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival\
  \ checks against them. If an affected creature is already one of your favored enemies,\
  \ it is shaken instead. This is a mind-affecting fear effect."
