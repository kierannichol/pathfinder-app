description: "The target gains a +2 enhancement bonus to its Strength. Once per round\
  \ as a free action, the target can choose to increase the enhancement bonus by 2\
  \ for 1 round; if it does so, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and the spell's\
  \ duration decreases by 1 additional round. For every 5 caster levels you have,\
  \ the target can choose to increase the enhancement bonus by an additional 2, taking\
  \ an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and decreasing the duration by 1\
  \ additional round per increase to the Strength bonus, to a maximum enhancement\
  \ bonus of +10 and 4d6 points of nonlethal damage at caster level 15th. The subject\
  \ can't spend more rounds than remain in the duration. When the spell ends, the\
  \ subject becomes fatigued."
