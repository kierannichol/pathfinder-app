description: "Your height immediately doubles, and your weight increases by a factor\
  \ of eight. This increase changes your size category to the next larger one. You\
  \ gain a +4 size bonus to Strength and Constitution and take a â€“2 penalty to your\
  \ Dexterity. You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your natural armor. You gain DR\
  \ 5/evil (if you normally channel positive energy) or DR 5/good (if you normally\
  \ channel negative energy). At 15th level, this DR becomes 10/evil or 10/good (the\
  \ maximum). Your size modifier for AC and attacks changes as appropriate to your\
  \ new size category. This spell doesn't change your speed. Determine space and reach\
  \ as appropriate to your new size."
