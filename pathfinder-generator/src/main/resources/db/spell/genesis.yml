description: "You create an immobile, finite demiplane with limited access. Demiplanes\
  \ created by this spell are very small. At first, the demiplane grows at a rate\
  \ of 1-foot-radius per day, up to a 180-foot radius. You determine the environment\
  \ in the demiplane, reflecting most any desire you can visualize, such as atmosphere,\
  \ water, temperature, and the shape of the terrain. The spell cannot create life,\
  \ nor can it create buildings. If desired, these must be brought in by some other\
  \ fashion."
