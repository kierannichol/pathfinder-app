name: "Sow Thought"
description: "You plant an idea, concept, or suspicion in the mind of the subject.\
  \ The target genuinely believes that the idea is his own, but is not required to\
  \ act upon it. If the idea is contrary to the target's normal thoughts (such as\
  \ making a paladin think, \"I should murder my friends\") the target may suspect\
  \ mind-altering magic is at play. The idea must be fairly clear, enough so that\
  \ it can be conveyed in one or two sentences. You do not need to share a common\
  \ language for the spell to succeed, but without a common language you can only\
  \ sow the most basic rudimentary ideas."
