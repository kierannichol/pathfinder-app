name: "Vomit Swarm"
description: "You vomit forth a swarm of spiders that attacks all other creatures\
  \ within its area. The swarm begins adjacent to you, but if no living creatures\
  \ are within its area, it moves in one direction of your choosing at its normal\
  \ speed. You can move the swarm or change the swarm's direction by spending a standard\
  \ action to concentrate on the swarm, otherwise it continues moving in its current\
  \ direction. If your caster level is at least 7th, you can vomit forth a swarm of\
  \ wasps instead. Finally, if your caster level is at least 13th, you can vomit forth\
  \ a swarm of army ants."
