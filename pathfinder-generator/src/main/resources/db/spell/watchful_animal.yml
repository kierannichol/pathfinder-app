description: "You place a scrying sensor on your animal companion or familiar. This\
  \ allows the animal companion or familiar to function as if it were an insect summoned\
  \ by the greater insect spyUI spell. The animal companion or familiar does not change\
  \ shape, nor does it lose the ability to make its own decisions, but it receives\
  \ orders and gives answers as per insects summoned by that spell, and you can sense\
  \ its direction and distance and receive sensory input from it as with that spell."
