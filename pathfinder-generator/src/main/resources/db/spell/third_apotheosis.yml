    Effect: "At some point after the primary caster contacts her fiendish patron (typically\
      \ after she succeeds at the second ritual, but sometimes before), the fiend\
      \ sends the primary caster a vision of a task she must complete (such as freeing\
      \ a bound evil outsider from a Material Plane prison or assassinating a powerful\
      \ cleric of a good-aligned religion). This task is typically one of significance\
      \ to the fiend, and in many cases it is one that the primary caster has no hope\
      \ of completing until she grows more powerful. There is no time limit for how\
      \ long the primary caster has to complete this task, but she must perform weekly\
      \ devotions to her fiendish patron in the intervening time in the form of regular\
      \ worship and continued atrocities in the fiend's name. Additional burned offerings\
      \ to the demon, assaults on innocents, and betrayals of allies are popular choices.\
      \ Once the assigned task is completed, the primary caster can perform the third\
      \ apotheosis. Unlike the first and second rituals, the third apotheosis allows\
      \ for the use of secondary casters, yet it carries a much greater risk for failure.\
      \ If the primary caster succeeds, she permanently gains the half-fiend template\
      \ and becomes eligible to undertake the fourth apotheosis."
