name: "Amplify Stench"
description: "You amplify your natural stench special ability--its save DC increases\
  \ by 2, and creatures that fail their saving throws against your stench become nauseated\
  \ rather than sickened. If your stench ability normally causes a creature to become\
  \ nauseated (such as with the foul stench ability), the radius of your stench doubles\
  \ instead. This spell has no effect if you don't possess the stench special ability."
