description: "Alchemists have tried for centuries to recreate Artokus Kirran's feat\
  \ of genius that created the sun orchid elixir. Although they have yet to unlock\
  \ the elixir's exact formula, their efforts have not been entirely wasted. One by-product\
  \ of their experiments was the orchid's dropformula. This extract, distilled from\
  \ a much-diluted drop of the nectar of a sun orchid flower, can transform an alchemist's\
  \ mutagen into a potent healing tonic."
