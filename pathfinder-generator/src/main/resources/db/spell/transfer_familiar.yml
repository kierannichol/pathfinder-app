  \ You, your familiar, and the target creature must all be touching each other when\
  \ you cast this spell. The target gains all the benefits and abilities normally\
  \ associated with having a familiar, including the ability to share spells, speak\
  \ with the familiar, and so on. You lose all of these benefits for the duration\
  \ of the spell. If the target already has a familiar, the spell fails."
