description: "When casting this spell, choose a single skill that you have at least\
  \ one rank in. The target gains a +2 insight bonus on skill checks with this skill\
  \ and is considered trained in that skill. The insight bonus increases by 1 for\
  \ every four levels of the caster (maximum +6). Furthermore, once before the spell's\
  \ duration, the target can choose to roll two checks and take the greater result.\
  \ Doing so ends the spell's other effects."
