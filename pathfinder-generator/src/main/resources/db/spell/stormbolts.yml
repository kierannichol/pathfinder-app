description: "When you cast this spell, lightning spills forth from your body in all\
  \ directions. The bolts do not harm natural vegetation or creatures in the area\
  \ you wish to exclude from damage. Any other creatures within the area take 1d8\
  \ points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d8) and are stunned for\
  \ 1 round. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the stun effect."
