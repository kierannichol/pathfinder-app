description: "If you succeed at a ranged touch attack, you burn your handprint onto\
  \ the flesh of a creature, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage. The mark can be placed\
  \ on any exposed portion of the creature, typically the head or forearm. The flesh\
  \ around the handprint becomes rough and scaly, like the hide of a lizard. It also\
  \ glows with a green radiance (shedding light as a torch) when brought within 60\
  \ feet of you. While the handprint glows, the target takes a -2 penalty to AC against\
  \ your attacks and on saving throws to resist any spell you cast or spell-like ability\
  \ you use."
