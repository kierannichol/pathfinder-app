description: "With this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body, provided\
  \ that its death occurred no more than 1 week before the casting of the spell and\
  \ the subject's soul is free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not\
  \ willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to\
  \ return receives no saving throw."
