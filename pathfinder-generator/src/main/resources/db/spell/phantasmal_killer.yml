name: "Phantasmal Killer"
description: "You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable\
  \ to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject's subconscious mind\
  \ into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast.\
  \ Only the spell's subject can see the phantasmal killer. You see only a vague shape.\
  \ The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save\
  \ fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude\
  \ save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes\
  \ 3d6 points of damage."
