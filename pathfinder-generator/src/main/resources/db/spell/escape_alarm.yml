name: "Escape Alarm"
description: "You place a ward on an area that notifies you when a creature exits\
  \ it. This functions as alarm, except as noted. It alerts you when a creature leaves,\
  \ rather than enters, the area, and you can't select a password to bypass its effects.\
  \ Instead, when you place an escape alarm, you can attune up to one additional creature\
  \ per caster level to the spell. You are automatically attuned to your own escape\
  \ alarm and don't count against the limit. Attuned creatures can enter and exit\
  \ the spell's area without triggering the alarm. If you select a mental alarm rather\
  \ than an audible one, all attuned creatures receive the mental alert when someone\
  \ exits the warded area."
