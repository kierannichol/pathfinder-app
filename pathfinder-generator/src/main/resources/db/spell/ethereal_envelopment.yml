name: "Ethereal Envelopment"
description: "This spell is similar to ethereal envelope, but it allows you to shunt\
  \ an unwilling creature to the Ethereal Plane and seal it there within a cocoon\
  \ of misty ethereal fibers. If the target fails its save, it's forced into a cataleptic\
  \ meditative state as if unconscious. However, each round at the end of its turn,\
  \ it can attempt a Will save to awaken itself from this meditation. Once the target\
  \ awakens, it is considered pinned, treating your caster level as your CMB and your\
  \ CMD as 10 + your caster level + your ability modifier for your primary spellcasting\
  \ ability score. A successful grapple combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check\
  \ leaves the creature grappled rather than pinned but doesn't allow it to escape.\
  \ However, a trapped creature can attack the cocoon as described in the ethereal\
  \ envelope spell description."
