description: "The target takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round as its\
  \ skin loosens and splits. Once it has taken 5 or more points of Constitution damage\
  \ in this way, its skin falls off to reveal its musculature. The creature ceases\
  \ taking Constitution damage, but takes a â€“4 penalty on saving throws against disease,\
  \ pain effects, or poison, and on Charisma-based skill checks with the exception\
  \ of Intimidate and Use Magic Device. The creature's skin regrows rapidly--once\
  \ its Constitution damage is fully healed, its skin becomes intact once again and\
  \ the penalties end."
