name: "Wracking Ray"
description: "A ray of sickly greenish-gray negative energy issues forth from the\
  \ palm of your hand. Make a ranged touch attack against the target. A creature hit\
  \ by this spell is wracked by painful spasms as its muscles and sinews wither and\
  \ twist. The subject takes 1d4 points of Dexterity and Strength damage per 3 caster\
  \ levels you possess (maximum 5d4 each). This spell cannot reduce an ability score\
  \ below 1. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage."
