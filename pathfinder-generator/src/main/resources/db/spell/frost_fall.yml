description: "The area of this spell is covered in chilling frost, dealing 2d6 points\
  \ of cold damage to all creatures within it. Creatures that the spell initially\
  \ damages must succeed at a Fortitude save or become staggered for 1 round. The\
  \ area remains chilled for the spell's duration. Any creature that starts your turn\
  \ within the spell's area takes 1d6 points of cold damage (Fortitude saving throw\
  \ for half) but does not become staggered even on a failed saving throw."
