name: "Sympathetic Vibration"
description: "By attuning yourself to a freestanding structure, you can create a damaging\
  \ vibration within it. Once it begins, the vibration deals 2d10 points of damage\
  \ per round to the target structure, bypassing hardness. You can choose at the time\
  \ of casting to limit the duration of the spell; otherwise it lasts for 1 round\
  \ per level. If the spell is cast upon a target that is not freestanding, the surrounding\
  \ stone dissipates the effect and no damage occurs."
