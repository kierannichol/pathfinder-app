description: "Your touch causes a single creature's skin to produce fibrous tissue\
  \ that sutures the creature's wounds, rapidly closing them and leaving jagged scars\
  \ where the wounds were. The process is painful, and converts 2d6 points of damage\
  \ + 1 point per caster level (maximum +5) into nonlethal damage. If the target creature\
  \ is immune to nonlethal damage, the spell fails. Damage resistance against nonlethal\
  \ damage reduces the amount of damage converted. This effect counts as healing for\
  \ the purpose of stopping bleed damage. Kuthites are especially fond of this spell,\
  \ as it gives them permanent physical reminders of the all too brief pain they endured."
