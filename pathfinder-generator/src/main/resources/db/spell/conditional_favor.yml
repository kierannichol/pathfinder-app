name: "Conditional Favor"
description: "You must cast this spell immediately before casting another spell on\
  \ the same creature, eliciting a promise or warning against a behavior and binding\
  \ the target to the paired spell. If you don't cast a paired spell, conditional\
  \ favor has no effect. The paired spell must be from the abjuration, conjuration\
  \ (healing), enchantment, or transmutation school or subschool, and must be cast\
  \ on a willing creature. If the spell's recipient violates the oath or prohibition\
  \ while conditional favor remains in effect, the paired spell is undone as if never\
  \ cast. If the spell was a healing spell, the hit point damage or condition you\
  \ removed returns immediately, even if the subject has enjoyed subsequent rest or\
  \ healing. Poisons, diseases, curses, restored ability damage, and negative levels\
  \ removed by the paired spell return as well."
