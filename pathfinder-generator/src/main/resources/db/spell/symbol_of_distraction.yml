name: "Symbol of Distraction"
description: "This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures\
  \ within the radius of a symbol of distraction instead become fascinated by the\
  \ symbol for 10 minutes per caster level. Unlike symbol of death, symbol of distraction\
  \ has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of distraction simply remains\
  \ active for a duration of 10 minutes Ã— your caster level. All fascinated creatures\
  \ move toward the symbol of distraction, trying to remain within the symbol's area\
  \ of effect. If the symbol leads affected creatures into a dangerous area, each\
  \ fascinated creature can attempt an additional Will saving throw, with success\
  \ indicating it is no longer fascinated. If a creature's view of the symbol is completely\
  \ blocked, it is immediately freed of the symbol's effect."
