description: "When you cast this spell, flammable liquid oozes from your pores, dripping\
  \ onto the ground and spontaneously combusting. The flame does not harm you. During\
  \ this spell's duration, each time you leave your space, you create a trail of fire\
  \ that burns within the spaces you move through for 1 round before it burns out.\
  \ You can leave up to 60 feet of flame trail each round, assuming you are Small\
  \ or Medium. If you are larger than Medium, the maximum trail length is reduced\
  \ based on your size. If you are Large, you can leave a trail up to 30 feet long\
  \ (and 10 feet wide), and if you are Huge, you can leave a trail up to 15 feet long\
  \ (and 15 feet wide); even larger casters can only leave a trail up to 10 feet long\
  \ (and as wide as your space) each round. You choose where to leave a flame trail."
