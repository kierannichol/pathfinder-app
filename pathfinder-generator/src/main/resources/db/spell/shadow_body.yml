name: "Shadow Body"
description: "You exchange the crude matter of your material body with the insubstantial\
  \ essence of the Plane of Shadow, becoming a living shadow yourself. You are visible\
  \ as an unattached shadow in bright light or normal light, but you gain total concealment\
  \ in dim light or darkness. Against creatures with darkvision, you gain concealment\
  \ rather than total concealment. Your shadow body is incorporeal for most purposes,\
  \ though you can't fly or pass through solid objects or creatures. However, you\
  \ can move at your normal speed along any surface, including horizontal and vertical\
  \ surfaces and liquids, and you are never slowed by difficult terrain. Your size\
  \ doesn't change."
