description: "You place an invisible ward upon an object that is triggered the first\
  \ time a creature tries to move the object from its current location. The next creature\
  \ to touch the object is cursed to become obvious to everyone around it. The creature\
  \ must succeed at a Will save or be surrounded in an aura of twinkling red light\
  \ that functions as faerie fire (spell resistance applies). The curse bestowed by\
  \ this spell cannot be dispelled, but a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle,\
  \ remove curse, or wish spell can remove it."
