name: "Tailwind"
description: "You compel the wind to push the targets in a direction of your choice.\
  \ The subjects can hustle during local and overland movement without risk of fatigue.\
  \ If the subjects are flying, the first 20 feet of movement each round in the chosen\
  \ direction does not count against their movement for the round. Each creature remains\
  \ affected only while within 120 feet of every other subject. You can change the\
  \ tailwind's direction once per hour by concentrating as a standard action. This\
  \ spell has no effect underwater."
