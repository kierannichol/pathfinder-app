name: "Dancing Lights"
description: "Depending on the version selected, you create up to four lights that\
  \ resemble lanterns or torches (and cast that amount of light), or up to four glowing\
  \ spheres of light (which look like will-o'-wisps), or one faintly glowing, vaguely\
  \ humanoid shape. The dancing lights must stay within a 10-foot-radius area in relation\
  \ to each other but otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward\
  \ or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. The lights can\
  \ move up to 100 feet per round. A light winks out if the distance between you and\
  \ it exceeds the spell's range."
