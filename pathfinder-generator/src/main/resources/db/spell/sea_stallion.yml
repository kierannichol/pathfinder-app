description: "This spell functions as sea steed, but as long as you stay mounted on\
  \ the target, you also gain the amphibious quality and your melee attacks function\
  \ as if you were under the effect of freedom of movement. The benefits you gain\
  \ from this spell are not polymorph effects. If you dismount from the target, you\
  \ retain the amphibious quality for up to 1 minute, but not the other benefits.\
  \ You regain all of the benefits once you mount the target creature again."
