description: "You transfer a single hex you know to the target, and give that target\
  \ the ability to use the hex. The transferred hex's variable characteristics function\
  \ according to your level, not the level of the recipient. Only a creature with\
  \ Intelligence and Wisdom scores of at least 9 can receive this effect. To use this\
  \ hex, the target must be able to speak and move freely. Once it uses the hex, the\
  \ spell ends (though any effects of the hex still last for the full duration). You\
  \ can transfer only a hex--not a major or grand hex--with this ability."
