description: "Remove curse can remove all curses on an object or a creature. If the\
  \ target is a creature, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level)\
  \ against the DC of each curse affecting the target. Success means that the curse\
  \ is removed. Remove curse does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon,\
  \ or suit of armor, although a successful caster level check enables the creature\
  \ afflicted with any such cursed item to remove and get rid of it."
