description: "You cause a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. The wall\
  \ inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient\
  \ to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a\
  \ creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape\
  \ its edges to fit the available space."
