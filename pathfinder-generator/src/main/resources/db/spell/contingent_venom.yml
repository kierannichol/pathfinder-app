name: "Contingent Venom"
description: "This spell functions as languid venom, but you can stipulate a specific\
  \ condition or circumstance that will end the poison's onset time and cause it to\
  \ take effect. The conditions for triggering the poison can be as general or as\
  \ detailed as desired, but the triggers must be visual or audible (as per magic\
  \ mouth) or else based on physical contact with or consumption of a specific object,\
  \ substance, or creature. This triggering condition can either result in the immediate\
  \ onset of the poison, or cause the poison to take effect a number of rounds after\
  \ being triggered no greater than 1 round per caster level. You must make all decisions\
  \ involving triggering when you cast contingent venom, and you can't change those\
  \ decisions later."
