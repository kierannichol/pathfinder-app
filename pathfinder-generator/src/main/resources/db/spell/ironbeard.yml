name: "Ironbeard"
description: "This spell causes a brushy beard of stiff iron to erupt from the face\
  \ of a willing target. The ironbeardgrants a +1 armor bonus to AC, and this bonus\
  \ stacks with any armor worn by the creature. The ironbeardmay also be used as a\
  \ weapon equivalent to cold iron armor spikes. The ironbeardmakes it difficult to\
  \ speak, so any spellcasting with a verbal component has a 20% spell failure chance."
