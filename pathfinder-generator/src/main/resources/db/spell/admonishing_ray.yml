description: "You blast your enemies with rays of nonlethal force. You may fire one\
  \ ray, plus one additional ray for every four levels you possess beyond 3rd (to\
  \ a maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack\
  \ to hit and deals 4d6 points of nonlethal damage. This is a force effect. The rays\
  \ may be fired at the same or different targets, but all rays must be fired simultaneously\
  \ and aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other. The rays hit about as hard\
  \ as a punch from a strong adult human, and can knock away unattended objects weighing\
  \ up to 10 pounds if that amount of force could normally do so."
