name: "Dancing Darkness"
description: "You create either up to four spheres of darkness that each reduce the\
  \ illumination level by one step within a 20-foot-radius, or one dimly lit, vaguely\
  \ humanoid shape. Each sphere of dancing darkness must stay within a 10-foot-radius\
  \ area of one another but can otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required):\
  \ forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. The darkness\
  \ can move up to 100 feet per round. The effect winks out if the distance between\
  \ you and it exceeds the spell's range."
