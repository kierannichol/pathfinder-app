name: "Gaseous Form"
description: "The subject and all its gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent.\
  \ Its material armor (including natural armor) becomes worthless, though its size,\
  \ Dexterity, deflection bonuses, and armor bonuses from force effects still apply.\
  \ The subject gains DR 10/magic and becomes immune to poison, sneak attacks, and\
  \ critical hits. It can't attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material,\
  \ or focus components while in gaseous form. This does not rule out the use of certain\
  \ spells that the subject may have prepared using the feats Silent Spell, Still\
  \ Spell, and Eschew Materials. The subject also loses supernatural abilities while\
  \ in gaseous form. If it has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged\
  \ harmlessly when the gaseous form spell takes effect."
