    Effect: "Before this ritual can be cast, the casters must reach deep into the\
      \ target's mind to extract the most personally heinous torture the target could\
      \ imagine, and then the casters must inflict it upon the target during the casting.\
      \ This often involves whips, spiked chains, barbed hooks, or other torturous\
      \ elements usually constructed from the target's own skin and viscera. While\
      \ the target endures this torture, it must recite the parable of Nidal's pact\
      \ with Zon-Kuthon while the casters alternatingly chant epic poetry vaguely\
      \ detailing the Midnight Lord's travels behind reality and the unfathomable\
      \ horrors that he is capable of inflicting on the target's soul. If the target\
      \ does not cower in fear at these descriptions, the ritual fails."
