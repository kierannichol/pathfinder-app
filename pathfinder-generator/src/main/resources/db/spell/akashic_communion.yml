name: "Akashic Communion"
description: "You attempt to obtain a glimpse of some specific event from the Akashic\
  \ Record (Occult Adventures 244), the extraplanar repository of all experiences\
  \ that have ever occurred. This allows you to attempt one Knowledge skill check\
  \ of your choice per 3 caster levels you have, each with a +10 insight bonus. You\
  \ are treated as trained in any Knowledge skills used for these checks, and can\
  \ use this spell to reroll a Knowledge skill check you have already failed. The\
  \ GM rolls these Knowledge checks in secret, as the Akashic Record is incredibly\
  \ remote, and impressions gleaned from the distant repository are sometimes skewed\
  \ when received. On a natural 1, the resulting answer is wildly inaccurate."
