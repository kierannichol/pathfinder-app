description: "You render the affected creature supernaturally delicious, making it\
  \ the preferred target for animalistic monsters, as well as biting insects, stray\
  \ animals, and vermin. A creature that makes a successful bite attack against or\
  \ otherwise ingests a portion of the victim (such as with drain blood or swallow\
  \ whole) gains a number of temporary hit points equal to half your caster level.\
  \ These temporary hit points last for 1 hour. A creature cannot gain temporary hit\
  \ points from this spell more than once per day, no matter how many times it bites\
  \ your target or how many different cursed targets it bites."
