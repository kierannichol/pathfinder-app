description: "During the height of the Empire of Taldor's expansionism, Taldan wizards\
  \ developed this spell with the idea that it might make pacifying their â€œuncivilized\"\
  \ conquests easier. While the spell has since fallen out of favor with Taldans,\
  \ it is much embraced by others, bards and Pathfinders in particular."
