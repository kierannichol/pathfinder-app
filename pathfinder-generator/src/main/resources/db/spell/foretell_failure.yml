description: "You cast this spell immediately before you would take an action that\
  \ requires a d20 roll, such as a skill check, attack roll, or ability check. The\
  \ action must be something you can complete in a single round. The spell magically\
  \ informs you whether the action will succeed if you roll a 10 or better on the\
  \ d20 roll involved. If the action would be successful under those circumstances,\
  \ you must take the action. If the action would not be successful, you can take\
  \ a different action."
