description: "A statue spell turns the subject to solid stone, along with any garments\
  \ and equipment worn or carried. In statue form, the subject gains hardness 8. The\
  \ subject retains its own hit points. The subject can see, hear, and smell normally,\
  \ but it does not need to eat or breathe. Feeling is limited to those sensations\
  \ that can affect the granite-hard substance of the individual's body. Chipping\
  \ is equal to a mere scratch, but breaking off one of the statue's arms constitutes\
  \ serious damage. The subject of a statue spell can return to its normal state,\
  \ act, and then return instantly to the statue state (a free action) if it so desires\
  \ as long as the spell duration is in effect."
