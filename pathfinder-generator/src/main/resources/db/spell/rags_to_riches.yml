description: "The target object is enhanced to function as a masterwork item. In addition\
  \ to any bonuses for the masterwork quality, the object gains other bonuses. Skill\
  \ kits and other equipment add an additional +1 insight bonus for every 4 caster\
  \ levels you possess to skill checks made with them that already receive a bonus\
  \ from the skill kit. Armor and weapons gain temporary hit points equal to your\
  \ caster level. If the object already has an enhancement bonus, this bonus increases\
  \ by 1. If the object of the spell has hardness, that hardness increases by 5."
