name: "Open/Close"
description: "You can open or close (your choice) a door, chest, box, window, bag,\
  \ pouch, bottle, barrel, or other container. If anything resists this activity (such\
  \ as a bar on a door or a lock on a chest), the spell fails. In addition, the spell\
  \ can only open and close things weighing 30 pounds or less. Thus, doors, chests,\
  \ and similar objects sized for enormous creatures may be beyond this spell's ability\
  \ to affect."
