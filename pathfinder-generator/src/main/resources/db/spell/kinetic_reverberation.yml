description: "This spell converts the momentum and force from melee attacks made against\
  \ the target of the spell, reflecting them back upon the attacker's weapon. After\
  \ making a successful melee attack against the target, an attacker must make a Fortitude\
  \ saving throw for the weapon used. If the weapon fails the save, it takes damage\
  \ equal to the damage rolled against the target. Creatures using natural attacks\
  \ or unarmed strikes are unaffected by this spell."
