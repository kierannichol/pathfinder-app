name: "Sequester Thoughts"
description: "Sequester thoughts allows you to erase a creature's memory of either\
  \ an event lasting not more than 1 minute per caster level or all of its knowledge\
  \ about a single topic (using the GM's discretion as to what constitutes a single\
  \ topic). For example, you could erase a single battle from a creature's memory,\
  \ or all knowledge of a plot to assassinate a king. The memories you remove are\
  \ stored within the gem used at the time of casting. If the gem is shattered, the\
  \ memories return to the creature as long as the two are within 30 feet of each\
  \ other. Once sequester thoughtshas been cast, the spell remains active on the gem\
  \ and can be dispelled (which shatters it). No portion of the spell remains active\
  \ on the target creature, and the target does not radiate magic as a consequence\
  \ of the spell, nor can its memories be returned by dispelling the creature or subjecting\
  \ it to antimagic. If the gem is shattered or dispelled out of range from the creature,\
  \ the thoughts sequestered within are forever lost save by the use of wish, miracle,\
  \ or the like."
