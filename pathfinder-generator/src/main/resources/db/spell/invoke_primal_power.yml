description: "This spell must be cast as you activate wild shape to assume the form\
  \ of an animal of at least Large size. When you assume the animal form, it takes\
  \ on many of the primal characteristics of the savage, prehistoric creatures that\
  \ dwell in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords. When this spell's duration expires, you\
  \ return to your natural form automatically--in effect, you shorten the duration\
  \ of that use of wild shape to the duration of this spell when you cast invoke primal\
  \ power."
