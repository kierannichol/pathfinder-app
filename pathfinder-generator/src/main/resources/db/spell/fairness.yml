description: "Humanoid creatures affected by this spell must trade fairly with others\
  \ to the best of their knowledge. If they know the fair value (or even an estimated\
  \ fair value) of a good or service, they cannot participate in a trade if it would\
  \ benefit one side unfairly, and must attempt to stop such trades from occurring,\
  \ preventing them from cheating another while under the influence of this spell.\
  \ The symbol of Abadar appears above the heads of those affected by this spell,\
  \ making those affected and unaffected by the spell immediately apparent."
