description: "You call forth a fast-moving wave that batters all creatures in its\
  \ path and leaves the target area flooded. Each creature in the area must succeed\
  \ at a Reflex save or take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per 2 caster levels\
  \ (maximum 10d6). The wave also attempts a bull rush combat maneuver against all\
  \ creatures of any size within its area of effect. Attempt a single combat maneuver\
  \ check and apply the result to each creature within the area. Your CMB for this\
  \ bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma\
  \ modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush attempt doesn't provoke attacks\
  \ of opportunity."
