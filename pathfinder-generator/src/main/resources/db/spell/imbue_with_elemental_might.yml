description: "This spell functions like imbue with spell ability, except you transfer\
  \ the use of your elemental assault ability to the target. The target must have\
  \ an Intelligence score of at least 5 to use the ability. The imbued elemental assault\
  \ functions exactly like yours, except the ability's duration is based on the target's\
  \ level or Hit Dice. Once you cast this spell, you cannot use your elemental assault\
  \ ability until the duration of the spell is over."
