description: "You telekinetically launch an ally across the battlefield to anywhere\
  \ within this spell's range. While moving, your ally is flying just above the ground\
  \ unless you wish otherwise. Movement from this spell provokes attacks of opportunity\
  \ as normal, although you can lift your ally over objects or out of enemy reach,\
  \ as long as your ally remains within this spell's range. If your ally lands adjacent\
  \ to an opponent, he can spend an immediate action to make a melee attack against\
  \ that opponent with a +2 bonus on the attack roll."
