name: "Final Sacrifice"
description: "You disrupt the conjuring energies within a summoned creature, causing\
  \ it to violently explode. If the target fails its Fortitude save, it is immediately\
  \ slain and all creatures within 20 feet of the target take 1d4 points of damage\
  \ per spell level of the summoning spell that conjured the target. This damage is\
  \ fire damage unless the target creature has the cold or water subtype, in which\
  \ case it's cold damage. Creatures caught in this explosion take half damage if\
  \ they succeed at their Reflex saves against this spell's DC. Final sacrifice can\
  \ detonate a summoner's eidolon, though an eidolon receives a +4 bonus on its Fortitude\
  \ save unless the spell is cast by the eidolon's own summoner. If this spell targets\
  \ an eidolon, creatures within 20 feet of the eidolon take an amount of damage equal\
  \ to 1d4 + 1/2 the caster level of the summoner who controlled the eidolon."
