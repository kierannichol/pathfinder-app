description: "The Shoanti revere more than the deities of distant planes, but also\
  \ the animals and natural forces of the rugged lands they call home. Shoanti spellcasters\
  \ have learned ways to call upon the might of their quahs' totem creatures in times\
  \ of need. A character must have been raised by the Shoanti and be considered part\
  \ of a quah to be able to cast this spell. Characters with access to this spell\
  \ can only summon creatures revered by the quah they are a part of, as noted on\
  \ the following lists. Except as noted above, this spell functions as summon nature's\
  \ ally III."
