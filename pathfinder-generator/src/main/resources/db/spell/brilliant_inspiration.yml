description: "You open a link between your mind and the subject's mind, giving advice\
  \ and encouragement for as long as the spell is in effect. Each time the subject\
  \ of the spell makes an attack roll, ability check, or skill check, it rolls two\
  \ d20s and takes the better result. If any roll is a natural 20, the spell's effect\
  \ ends--your brilliant advice is spent."
