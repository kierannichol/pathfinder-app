description: "You temporarily suppress the most powerful qualities of a magical item.\
  \ This item can be any object you suspect bears a magical enchantment, but if the\
  \ targeted item is not magical, your spell has no effect. The spell reduces the\
  \ object's caster level by an amount equal to your caster level, to a minimum of\
  \ 0. If the item grants a competence, deflection, enhancement, insight, luck, morale,\
  \ natural armor, profane, resistance, or sacred bonus, the bonus is reduced by 1\
  \ for every 4 caster levels the item loses. If the item's caster level is reduced\
  \ to 0, all its magic qualities are suppressed (as if dispelled) for the duration\
  \ of the spell. This spell has no effect on artifacts."
