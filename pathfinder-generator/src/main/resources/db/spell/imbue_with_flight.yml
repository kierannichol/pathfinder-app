description: "You grant a touched Large or smaller object the ability to fly at a\
  \ speed of 40 feet with average maneuverability. It can ascend at half speed and\
  \ descend at double speed. The targeted object flies as you direct it, using your\
  \ Fly skill for any difficult maneuvers. You must be within close range (25 ft.\
  \ + 5 ft./2 levels) of the object to direct it, and moving it requires a move action.\
  \ If not directed, the object hovers in place (no Fly check required). The maximum\
  \ weight of the object and anything carried by it is 500 pounds per caster level\
  \ (maximum 10,000 pounds)."
