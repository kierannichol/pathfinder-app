description: "This spell grants the target the ability to swim through the air. If\
  \ the target has a swim speed, it can move through the air at that speed. Otherwise,\
  \ it must succeed at Swim checks to move as normal. Still air is treated as calm\
  \ water, light or moderate wind is treated as rough water, strong or severe wind\
  \ is treated as stormy water, and the target cannot swim through stronger winds\
  \ (Core Rulebook439). This spell does not grant the ability to breathe air to creatures\
  \ that normally can't."
