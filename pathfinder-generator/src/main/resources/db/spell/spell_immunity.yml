description: "The warded creature is immune to the effects of one specified spell\
  \ for every four levels you have. The spells must be of 4th level or lower. The\
  \ warded creature effectively has unbeatable spell resistance regarding the specified\
  \ spell or spells. Naturally, that immunity doesn't protect a creature from spells\
  \ for which spell resistance doesn't apply. Spell immunity protects against spells,\
  \ spell-like effects of magic items, and innate spell-like abilities of creatures.\
  \ It does not protect against supernatural or extraordinary abilities, such as breath\
  \ weapons or gaze attacks."
