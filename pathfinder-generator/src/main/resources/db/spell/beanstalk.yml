description: "When casting this spell, you must plant the material components in soil.\
  \ When you do, at the end of casting, a large beanstalk rises up from the ground.\
  \ It's strong enough to support Huge or smaller creatures weighing no more than\
  \ 2,000 pounds total, and has enough handholds and footholds that it can be climbed\
  \ as if it were knotted rope (Climb DC 5). At the end of the spell's duration, the\
  \ beanstalk withers and dies at an accelerated rate, leaving nothing more than a\
  \ pile of compost."
