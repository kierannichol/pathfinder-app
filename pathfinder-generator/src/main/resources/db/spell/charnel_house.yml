description: "By sacrificing a living creature, you create the grisly illusion of\
  \ viscera and gore splattered about the nearby area. When the casting time is complete,\
  \ the walls drip with blood and the floor is slick with unidentifiable lumps of\
  \ meat and other signs of a massacre. Anyone entering the area must attempt a Will\
  \ save or be sickened for 1d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. If a creature\
  \ succeeds at its save, it can see the semi-real nature of the illusion."
