description: "This spell forms an invisible bubble that filters all speech coming\
  \ from inside the affected area so that creatures outside hear a completely different\
  \ version of the conversation. The bubble also disguises lip movements to match\
  \ the false conversation. Any creature listening to the conversation for at least\
  \ 1 round can attempt a DC 15 Sense Motive check to realize that the apparent conversation\
  \ doesn't actually make any sense. The bubble also obscures the verbal components\
  \ of spells cast within the area so it's impossible to identify spells by their\
  \ verbal components alone, and anyone outside the bubble attempting a Spellcraft\
  \ check to identify a spell cast within the bubble takes a â€“5 penalty on the check.\
  \ Furthermore, the bubble renders any language-dependent spells and effects used\
  \ within the bubble ineffective against creatures outside the area."
