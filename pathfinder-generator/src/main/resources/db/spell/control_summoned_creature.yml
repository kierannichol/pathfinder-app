name: "Control Summoned Creature"
description: "You seize control of a summoned creature by disrupting the bond between\
  \ it and the caster who summoned it. If the creature fails its save, you may command\
  \ it as if you had summoned it. The original caster can attempt to regain control\
  \ of the creature as a standard action by making an opposed Spellcraft check against\
  \ you. When your spell ends, control reverts to the original summoner. If the summoning\
  \ spell ends before this spell ends, the remaining duration of this spell is lost."
