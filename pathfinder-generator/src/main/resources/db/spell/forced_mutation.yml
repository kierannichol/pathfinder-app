description: "The body of the target creature twists and distorts, reshaping into\
  \ a grotesque figure. Because of the disfigurement, the creature takes a â€“4 penalty\
  \ to Constitution and Charisma. The creature also receives one of the following\
  \ deformities (your choice) from the list in the mutant acquired template: blind,\
  \ deaf, fragile, fractured mind, lame, poor ability (applied to your choice of Strength,\
  \ Dexterity, Intelligence, or Wisdom), spasms, and useless arm. The deformity is\
  \ subject to all limitations described in the mutant template (for example, this\
  \ spell cannot impose the lame deformity on a creature with a base speed slower\
  \ than 20 feet)."
