description: "When you cast this spell, you instantly know the direction of north\
  \ from your current position. The spell is effective in any environment in which\
  \ â€œnorth\" exists, but it may not work in extraplanar settings. Your knowledge of\
  \ north is correct at the moment of casting, but you can get lost again within moments\
  \ if you don't find some external reference point to help you keep track of direction."
