name: "Dust Ward"
description: "You ward a magic item against other creatures who try to learn to use\
  \ or copy it. When you cast the spell, you designate one creature type, subtype,\
  \ or a specific individual. If the item is worn or carried for 1 continuous hour\
  \ or more by a creature that doesn't match the designation, the dust ward disintegrates\
  \ the item into worthless gray dust. This destruction also occurs if the creature\
  \ attempts to study the item in order to learn its properties or how to magically\
  \ craft it (a miracle or wish spell used on the gray dust can still reveal this\
  \ information). The destruction of the item doesn't harm the creature wearing or\
  \ carrying the item (although the item's destruction may put the creature in harm's\
  \ way, such as if a magical rope were being used to cross a chasm at the time).\
  \ If the offending creature wears or carries the item for less than 1 hour and passes\
  \ it to a different creature, the countdown to the item's destruction starts over."
