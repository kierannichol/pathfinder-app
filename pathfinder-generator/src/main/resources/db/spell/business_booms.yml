description: "You may cast this spell immediately prior to spending 1 day of downtime\
  \ to promote a business (see page 85 of Ultimate Campaign). The spell is cast on\
  \ a building you wish to promote, which is magically bestowed with magical decorations\
  \ and other improvements that make it generally more appealing, and it is treated\
  \ as seeing increased activity for the spell's duration. If the spell is cast on\
  \ a building that you do not promote immediately thereafter, the spell is expended\
  \ with no effect."
