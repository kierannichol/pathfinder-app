name: "Reckless Infatuation"
description: "You fill your target with feelings of intense infatuation for a specific\
  \ individual known to the target. At the time of the casting, you designate a single\
  \ creature as the focus of the target's desire. Thereafter, the target does all\
  \ it can to remain within 30 feet of the object of its desire. If the target moves\
  \ outside this range, it gains the staggered condition until it is again near the\
  \ focus of its desire. If remaining within 30 feet of the focus of its affection\
  \ would place the target in obvious physical danger, the target can attempt a second\
  \ save to break the spell's effect."
