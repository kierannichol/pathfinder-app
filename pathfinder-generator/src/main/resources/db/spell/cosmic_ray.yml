description: "You fling a ray of deadly cosmic energy at the target creature. If you\
  \ succeed at a ranged touch attack with the ray, the target takes 1d6 points of\
  \ damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) and must make a Fortitude save. On a failed\
  \ save, the target becomes sickened for 1 round per caster level and emits toxic\
  \ cosmic energy for as long as it is sickened; any creature that comes within 5\
  \ feet of the affected target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = spell's DC)\
  \ or become sickened for 1 round per 2 caster levels."
