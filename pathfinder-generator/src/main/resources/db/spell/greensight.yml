description: "The target of this spell gains the ability to see up to 60 feet through\
  \ thick plant matter as though it were transparent. Greenery, leaves, and vines--even\
  \ lichen, moss, and slime--offer no concealment to the recipient's sight, though\
  \ her vision still can be blocked by solid wood, such as trees or wooden structures.\
  \ Undergrowth does not grant concealment to a creature against a target of the effects\
  \ of greensight."
