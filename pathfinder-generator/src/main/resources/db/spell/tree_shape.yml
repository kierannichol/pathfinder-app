name: "Tree Shape"
description: "This spell allows you to assume the form of a Large living tree or shrub\
  \ or a Large dead tree trunk with a small number of limbs. The exact type of tree,\
  \ as well as its appearance, is completely under your control. Even the closest\
  \ inspection cannot reveal that the tree in question is actually a magically concealed\
  \ creature. To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a detect\
  \ magic spell reveals a faint transmutation on the tree. While in tree form, you\
  \ can observe all that transpires around you just as if you were in your normal\
  \ form, and your hit points and save bonuses remain unaffected. You gain a +10 natural\
  \ armor bonus to AC but have an effective Dexterity score of 0 and a speed of 0\
  \ feet. You are immune to critical hits while in tree form. All clothing and gear\
  \ carried or worn changes with you. You can dismiss tree shape as a free action\
  \ (instead of as a standard action)."
