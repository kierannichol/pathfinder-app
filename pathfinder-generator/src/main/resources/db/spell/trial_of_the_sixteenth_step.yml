    Effect: "In order to enact this ritual, the primary caster must interact with\
      \ at least one creature capable of channeling positive energy to heal living\
      \ creatures. This subject must have at least one use of channel energy remaining\
      \ for the day. The primary caster then engages in a ritual of deception, eroding\
      \ the subject's faith and siphoning it away into the focus item. This requires\
      \ equal amounts of subterfuge and religious knowledge on the part of the primary\
      \ caster, who ensures the subject willingly concedes matters of faith without\
      \ entirely forsaking her deity."
