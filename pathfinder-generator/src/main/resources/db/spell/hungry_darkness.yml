description: "This spell creates an area of intense blackness, as deeper darkness,\
  \ but filled with unseen chewing teeth and ravenous maws. Any creatures beginning\
  \ its turn within the hungry darknessis gnawed and slashed by these unseen fangs\
  \ of force, dealing 3d6 points of force damage and 2 points of Constitution damage\
  \ per round. Once a creature leaves the cloud, it continues to take 1d6 points of\
  \ bleed damage each round until it receives magical healing or enters an area of\
  \ bright light. Spell resistance can prevent damage from the hungry darkness but\
  \ not against the darkness it creates."
