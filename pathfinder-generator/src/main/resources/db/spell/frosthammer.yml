description: "You create a warhammer of magically hardened ice and send it hurling\
  \ toward the target. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to strike the target.\
  \ If hit, the target takes 1d8 points of damage per 2 caster levels you possess\
  \ (maximum 5d8); half this damage is bludgeoning damage, half is cold damage. The\
  \ frosthammer counts as having a +1 enhancement bonus for the purpose of bypassing\
  \ DR. If the target takes any bludgeoning damage from the hammer, you may attempt\
  \ a trip combat maneuver check against that target, except you may use your caster\
  \ level instead of your BAB and your spellcasting ability modifier (Wisdom for clerics,\
  \ and so on) instead of your Strength modifier."
