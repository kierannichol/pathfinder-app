description: "This spell temporarily imbues a potable liquid (including elixirs, extracts,\
  \ potions, and poisons) with an intoxicant. The caster must succeed at a caster\
  \ level check in order to affect magic liquids and poisons (DC = 10 + item level\
  \ for magic liquids, DC equal to the poison's save DC for a poison); otherwise,\
  \ the spell fails. If the caster succeeds, the liquid also assumes a flavor according\
  \ to what the caster desires, but the effect on the imbiber is the same. An imbiber\
  \ of a liquid affected by ferment must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw at the\
  \ spell's save DC or take a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and\
  \ skill checks for the remaining duration of the spell. Additionally, the DC of\
  \ any skill check to identify a magic liquid or poison under the effects of this\
  \ spell increases by 5."
