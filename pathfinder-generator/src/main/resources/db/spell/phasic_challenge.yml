description: "You select one enemy and one willing ally as targets. The enemy gains\
  \ a new Will saving throw at the beginning of each turn, and on a successful saving\
  \ throw the spell ends. Both targets remain visible and audible, and can see and\
  \ hear other creatures, but cannot physically interact with any creature save one\
  \ another. Spells or weapon attacks from the affected creatures impact only each\
  \ other, though spells might affect terrain or other factors not related to other\
  \ creatures. If one of the creatures becomes unconscious or dies, or if the effect\
  \ is dispelled, the effect ends for both of them."
