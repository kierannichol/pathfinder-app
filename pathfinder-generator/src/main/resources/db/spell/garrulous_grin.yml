description: "This Nidalese spell plants a seed of supernatural fear deep in a subject's\
  \ mind, causing self-doubt, stuttering, and evasiveness. Affected creatures have\
  \ difficulty meeting anyone's gaze and seem dishonest or guilty. The target takes\
  \ a â€“4 penalty on Bluff and Diplomacy checks to convince another of the truth of\
  \ her words, and on Diplomacy or Intimidate checks to influence another creature's\
  \ attitude."
