description: "You mark the target with a black marking on its skin; the mark's exact\
  \ appearance determined by you, but can be no larger than your hand. The black markfunctions\
  \ as a mark of justice, and when the mark is activated, the target becomes shaken\
  \ anytime it is on or in the water more than a 5 feet from shore. In addition, as\
  \ long as the black markis active, the target is affected as if subject to nature's\
  \ exile, but all creatures with the aquatic or water subtype or with a swim speed\
  \ are made hostile, even those not of the animal type, though non-aquatic animals\
  \ are not."
