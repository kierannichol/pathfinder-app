description: "You curse the target to suffer unbearable heat. On a failed saving throw,\
  \ the target is immediately subjected to severe heat , takes 1d4 points of nonlethal\
  \ damage, and is suffering from heatstroke (fatigued). The target must save every\
  \ 10 minutes as normal for severe heat (starting at DC 15 rather than the DC of\
  \ this spell). Because this heat is internal, the target cannot avoid it using the\
  \ normal methods for escaping heat dangers such as Survival checks or finding shade."
