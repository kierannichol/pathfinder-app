description: "A rare spell without verbal components, lipstitchsews the target's lips\
  \ tightly together if it fails a saving throw, such that no clear speech, bite attacks,\
  \ spellcasting, or use of command words is possible. The target takes 1d6 points\
  \ of damage as the stitches weave through flesh. The victim can still make enough\
  \ noise to be heard at a distance with a DC 10 Perception check."
