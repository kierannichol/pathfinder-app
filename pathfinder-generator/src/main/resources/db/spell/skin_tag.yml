name: "Skin Tag"
description: "You mix a malign spirit into a piece of food, a drink, or some other\
  \ item to be consumed (including alchemical items, potions, elixirs, or similar\
  \ items). The skin tag spell discharges when the item is consumed, affecting the\
  \ creature that used the item unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save. The spirit\
  \ embeds itself somewhere in the affected creature's skin, forming a painless set\
  \ of wrinkles and tags of skin that looks vaguely like a face when the haunt activates.\
  \ You are considered to have a body part from the affected creature for the purpose\
  \ of scrying and similar divination spells. Once per day as a standard action, you\
  \ can remotely cause the spirit to make the affected creature's skin crawl, causing\
  \ the creature to become sickened for 1d4 rounds + 1 round per 2 caster levels you\
  \ have (to a maximum of 5 extra rounds at 10th level) unless it succeeds at a Fortitude\
  \ save. Alternatively, once per day you can remotely use a hex, a mind-affecting\
  \ spell, or a necromancy spell that causes disease or possession on the affected\
  \ creature. Each time you use the remote sickening or spell or hex effect, the spell's\
  \ haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round."
