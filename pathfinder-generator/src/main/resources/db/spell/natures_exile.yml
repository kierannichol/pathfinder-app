description: "This spell curses the creature touched, making it inimical to the natural\
  \ world. All animals have an initial attitude of hostile toward the target. Familiars,\
  \ being magical beasts, are not affected by this spell, but animal companions are.\
  \ If you have an animal companion, it does not become hostile, but as long as you\
  \ remain cursed, your animal companion takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, skill\
  \ checks, and saving throws. The target also takes a –10 penalty on Survival skill\
  \ checks as the weather and environment themselves seem to conspire to cause trouble."
