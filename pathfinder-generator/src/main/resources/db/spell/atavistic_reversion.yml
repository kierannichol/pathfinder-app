    Effect: "The primary caster lights a bonfire surrounded with incense, steps into\
      \ the fire, places the crown upon his brow, and lets forth a primal howl. Ghostly\
      \ images of beasts swirl through the air as the casters join in a spectral hunt.\
      \ As the ritual progresses, all humanoids in the ritual's area of effect, including\
      \ the casters, regress in appearance to resemble their primal animalistic ancestors.\
      \ Initially, these features have no mechanical effects, and they disappear if\
      \ the ritual fails. If the ritual succeeds, the casters and those who succeed\
      \ at a Fortitude save return to normal, while all other humanoids regress further.\
      \ They gain a +4 size bonus to Strength, a +4 natural armor bonus to AC, and\
      \ a bite attack (if they already had one, it counts as if they were one size\
      \ larger). If their Intelligence is greater than 2, it becomes 2, and they can't\
      \ cast spells, use other special abilities that require Intelligence, speak,\
      \ and wield manufactured weapons. The only skill checks they can attempt are\
      \ Acrobatics, Climb, Fly, Perception, Stealth, and Swim. The effects on a creature\
      \ can be removed with break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse,\
      \ or wish. Removing the penalties also removes the benefits."
