description: "This spell renders as many as three undead creatures immobile. A nonintelligent\
  \ undead creature gets no saving throw; an intelligent undead creature does. If\
  \ the spell is successful, it renders the undead creature immobile for the duration\
  \ of the spell (similar to the effect of hold person on a living creature). The\
  \ effect is broken if the halted creatures are attacked or take damage."
