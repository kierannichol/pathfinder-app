    Effect: "The caster reads aloud from her chosen lexicon while standing amid a\
      \ circle of candles, reciting passages that fill her with dedication and conviction.\
      \ Upon the completion of the ritual's casting time, she steps into the target\
      \ haunt's area, causing her to forge a psychic connection with the haunt that\
      \ pulls her mind into a binary mindscape (Occult Adventures 235) of the haunt's\
      \ creation and that is strongly reminiscent of the haunt's anguish and themed\
      \ along the lines of the haunt's destruction method."
