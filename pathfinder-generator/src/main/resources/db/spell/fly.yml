name: "Fly"
description: "The subject can fly at a speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if it wears medium\
  \ or heavy armor, or if it carries a medium or heavy load). It can ascend at half\
  \ speed and descend at double speed, and its maneuverability is good. Using a fly\
  \ spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack\
  \ or cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can charge but not run, and\
  \ it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears.\
  \ The subject gains a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to 1/2 your caster level."
