name: "Absorb Rune I"
description: "This spell allows you to lay your hand upon a magical glyph, symbol,\
  \ or other magical spell effect (referred to in this spell description as a â€œrune\"\
  ) and attempt to absorb the essence of its effect. To absorb a rune, you must be\
  \ aware of the rune's existence (but need not know the details of what it actually\
  \ does) and then succeed at a caster level check (DC = 10 + the caster level of\
  \ the spell affect being absorbed) as you touch the rune in question. If you fail\
  \ this caster level check, the magical rune is not triggered unless you fail the\
  \ roll by 5 or more."
