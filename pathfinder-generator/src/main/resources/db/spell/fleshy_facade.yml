description: "The target's flesh fills out and gains a healthy, natural color. This\
  \ gives the target the appearance of a living creature of the type it was when it\
  \ was still alive (if applicable). Creatures casting spells such as detect undead\
  \ must succeed at a saving throw (with a DC equal to the spell's save DC) to detect\
  \ the target's presence, and if the target is intelligent, it gains a +10 bonus\
  \ on Disguise checks to appear alive or recently deceased. If the undead has any\
  \ features different from those of the type of living creature it most resembles\
  \ (such as a ghoul's elongated teeth and claws), those features shrink and become\
  \ less prominent, and the subject deals damage as though it were one size smaller.\
  \ This spell has no effect on creatures that are skeletal or otherwise lack flesh."
