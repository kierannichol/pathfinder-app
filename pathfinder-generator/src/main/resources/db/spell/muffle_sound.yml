description: "You suppress sounds made by the targets, granting them a +4 bonus on\
  \ Stealth checks. The targets have a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells\
  \ with verbal components or using abilities that have audible components (such as\
  \ some bardic performances). This spell does not hamper the targets' ability to\
  \ hear other sounds and provides no protection against language-dependent or sonic\
  \ spells and effects."
