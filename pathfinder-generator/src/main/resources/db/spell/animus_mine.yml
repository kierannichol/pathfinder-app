name: "Animus Mine"
description: "You implant a mental mine within your psyche that triggers against anyone\
  \ attempting to manipulate your thoughts. Any creature that uses a mind-affecting\
  \ effect against you triggers the mine, causing psychic backlash against the offending\
  \ creature. This backlash deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6)\
  \ and staggers the target for 1d4 rounds. If the target succeeds at a Will saving\
  \ throw, it takes only half damage and negates the staggered effect. The mine does\
  \ not disrupt the mind-affecting effect that triggered the spell. You can use a\
  \ swift action to suppress the trigger of your mine for 1 round to allow someone\
  \ to use a mind-affecting effect on you. You can have only one mental mine active\
  \ at a time."
