description: "If a creature within 100 feet that you can see is speaking a language\
  \ you understand, you can read its lips with perfect accuracy. Reading lips in this\
  \ manner gives the exact wording of conversation and does not assist in deciphering\
  \ any obfuscated ideas such as secret messages or slang. Reading lips requires moderate\
  \ concentration, and you take a â€“4 penalty on other Perception checks while doing\
  \ so."
