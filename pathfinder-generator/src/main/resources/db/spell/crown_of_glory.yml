description: "You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma. All creatures with fewer\
  \ than 8 HD are compelled to stop and pay attention to you. Any such creature that\
  \ wants to take hostile action against you must make a Will save to do so. Any creature\
  \ that fails this saving throw the first time it attempts a hostile action is enthralled\
  \ for the duration of the spell (as the enthrall spell), as long as it is in the\
  \ spell's area. It does not try to leave the area on its own. Creatures with 8 HD\
  \ or more are not affected."
