description: "You can cast this spell only as a response to a confirmed critical hit\
  \ against the target that would deal slashing damage. If the target fails the saving\
  \ throw and has a discernible head, the attack deals an extra 4d6 points of damage\
  \ and the critical multiplier of the critical hit increases by 1. If the critical\
  \ hit then brings the target to 0 hit points or fewer, the target is instantly decapitated\
  \ and dies unless it can survive decapitation. Even on a successful saving throw,\
  \ the critical hit deals an extra 4d6 points of damage."
