description: "Animals cannot sense the warded creatures. Even extraordinary or supernatural\
  \ sensory capabilities, such as blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense,\
  \ cannot detect or locate warded creatures. Animals simply act as though the warded\
  \ creatures are not there. If a warded character touches an animal or attacks any\
  \ creature, even with a spell, the spell ends for all recipients."
