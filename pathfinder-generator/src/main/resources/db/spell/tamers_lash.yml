name: "Tamer's Lash"
description: "A 15-foot-long whip of sonic energy springs from your hand, delivering\
  \ a loud crack when you strike with it. The tamer's lash acts as a whip that deals\
  \ 1d4 points of sonic damage on a hit, but it has no physical substance and you\
  \ cannot use it to perform combat maneuvers, nor can it be sundered or disarmed.\
  \ If you strike an animal with the tamer's lash, the animal must succeed at a Will\
  \ saving throw or be unable to attack you for 1d3 rounds. Furthermore, if the whipped\
  \ animal starts its turn unable to attack you as a result of this spell and it is\
  \ within 30 feet of you, it must spend its first action moving away from you, if\
  \ it is able. Combattrained animals, animal companions, and animals with Hit Dice\
  \ in excess of your caster level + 4 gain a +4 circumstance bonus on their saves\
  \ to avoid being intimidated in this way. This intimidation effect is a mind-affecting\
  \ fear effect."
