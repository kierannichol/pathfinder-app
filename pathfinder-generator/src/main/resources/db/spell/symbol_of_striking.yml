name: "Symbol of Striking"
description: "This spell functions like symbol of death, except that using the material\
  \ component, you scribe a symbol of strikingso it fills a 5-foot square. Once triggered,\
  \ the symbol of strikingglows and lasts for 10 minutes per caster level or until\
  \ it has made a number of attacks of opportunity equal to your level, whichever\
  \ comes first. When triggered, the symbol threatens its area and the area around\
  \ it as if it were a Medium creature wielding a magic version of the weapon you\
  \ used as the material component. Using your caster level + 1 + your Intelligence\
  \ modifier (magus, witch, wizard) or Wisdom modifier (cleric) or Charisma modifier\
  \ (oracle, sorcerer) as its attack bonus, the symbol can make a number of attacks\
  \ of opportunity each round equal to 1 + the same ability score modifier you used\
  \ to determine its attack bonus. It gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to the same\
  \ ability score modifier you used to determine its attack bonus. A shadowy version\
  \ of you wielding the material component appears to make these attacks."
