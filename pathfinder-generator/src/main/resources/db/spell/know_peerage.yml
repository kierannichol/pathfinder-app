name: "Know Peerage"
description: "You impart your knowledge of nobility and peerage to the target, allowing\
  \ her to recognize members of noble households, differentiate one set of heraldry\
  \ from another, and otherwise identify who's who at a royal gala or other noteworthy\
  \ social event. The target is able to identify noble individuals, noble family names,\
  \ and noble crests, signets, heraldry, and other symbols. The target treats her\
  \ number of ranks in Knowledge (nobility) as though it were equal to your number\
  \ of ranks in Knowledge (nobility), to a maximum of 5 ranks and a minimum of 0.\
  \ If the target's number of ranks is greater than yours, she uses her own number\
  \ of ranks instead. In addition, if the target's new total skill bonus on Knowledge\
  \ (nobility) checks is at least +0, she automatically succeeds on all Knowledge\
  \ (nobility) checks with a DC of 10 or lower."
