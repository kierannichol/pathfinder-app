description: "Getawayteleports you and allies you designate at the time of casting\
  \ to a predetermined location. You must initially cast the spell at that location--all\
  \ creatures affected by the spell must be present at that time and within 30 feet\
  \ of you. At any time before the spell's duration expires, you may trigger the spell\
  \ as a swift action. At this time, all affected creatures (or their remains and\
  \ gear) within 30 feet of you are teleported to the location where you first cast\
  \ the spell. Creatures more than 30 feet away from you are left behind. Selected\
  \ creatures within 30 feet of you who do not wish to travel with you at that time\
  \ can simply choose not to go. You can be transported any distance within a plane\
  \ but cannot travel between planes."
