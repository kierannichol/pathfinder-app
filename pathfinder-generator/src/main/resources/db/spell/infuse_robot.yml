name: "Infuse Robot"
description: "If the targeted robot fails its Will saving throw, it transforms into\
  \ a magical construct made of wood, stone, flesh, or bone. The robot's statistics\
  \ and abilities do not change, although it is now a magical construct rather than\
  \ a technological one. It loses the robot subtype, but does not lose its Intelligence\
  \ score (if any). You can issue mental commands to the infused robot as long as\
  \ it stays within range of the spell; issuing commands in this manner is a free\
  \ action for you. When the spell's duration runs out, the robot transforms back\
  \ to normal but is staggered for 1d4 rounds."
