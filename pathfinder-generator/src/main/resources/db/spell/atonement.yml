name: "Atonement"
description: "This spell removes the burden of misdeeds from the subject. The creature\
  \ seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds.\
  \ If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form\
  \ of compulsion, atonement operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the\
  \ case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds, you must intercede with your\
  \ deity (requiring you to expend 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings). Atonement\
  \ may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected."
