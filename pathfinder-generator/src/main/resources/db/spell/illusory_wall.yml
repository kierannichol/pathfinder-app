name: "Illusory Wall"
description: "This spell creates the illusion of a wall, floor, ceiling, or similar\
  \ surface. It appears absolutely real when viewed, but physical objects can pass\
  \ through it without difficulty. When the spell is used to hide pits, traps, or\
  \ normal doors, any detection abilities that do not require sight work normally.\
  \ Touch or a probing search reveals the true nature of the surface, though such\
  \ measures do not cause the illusion to disappear. Although the caster can see through\
  \ his illusory wall, other creatures cannot, even if they succeed at their will\
  \ save (but they do learn that it is not real)."
