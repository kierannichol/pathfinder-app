    Effect: "This ritual works only on inoperative divine altars, rendered powerless\
      \ through damage or other ways, and must be performed on a holy day of the deity\
      \ to which the altar is dedicated. In order to repair a broken altar, the primary\
      \ caster and all secondary casters must be worshipers of that same deity. The\
      \ exact process of revitalizing altars varies by religion, but such rituals\
      \ require a dose of holy or unholy water when dealing with good- or evil-aligned\
      \ deities, as well as a masterfully wrought holy symbol regardless of the deity's\
      \ alignment. By speaking numerous prayers and conducting the required religious\
      \ ceremonies, the primary caster can restore the altar to its previous function,\
      \ effectively restoring its capabilities as a magical item."
