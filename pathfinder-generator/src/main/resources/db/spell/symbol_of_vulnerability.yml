description: "This spell functions as symbol of death, except it saps the defenses\
  \ of all creatures within 60 feet. Affected creatures receive a –4 penalty to spell\
  \ resistance and a –4 penalty on saving throws, and energy resistances and damage\
  \ reduction (if any) are reduced by 10 each (to a minimum of 0). Once triggered,\
  \ the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per level. The effects last as long as\
  \ the creature is within 60 feet of the symbol, and for 1 round per caster level\
  \ afterward."
