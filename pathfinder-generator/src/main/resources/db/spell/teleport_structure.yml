name: "Teleport Structure"
description: "You instantly teleport a building in a settlement you control to another\
  \ lot or series of lots in the same settlement district. The building to be teleported\
  \ must be unoccupied, and the area to which you wish to move the building must be\
  \ cleared and unoccupied during the casting of this spell. A building cannot be\
  \ teleported to an area it would not normally be able to occupy, such as an area\
  \ adjacent to a prohibited building type. If you don't wholly own the structure,\
  \ all of the structure's owners must consent to the structure's teleportation before\
  \ the spell is cast; otherwise, it fails immediately."
