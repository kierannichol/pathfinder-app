description: "When you are under of the effects of your mutagen, you can cast this\
  \ spell to safely pass it to another creature with a touch. You must make a successful\
  \ touch attack against the target. On a hit, the effect of the mutagen passes to\
  \ the target touched, though in a lesser form. The mutagen's effect ends for you,\
  \ and passes on to the creature touched, but the target only gets half of the alchemical\
  \ bonus to the physical ability modifier you chose when took the mutagen, and twice\
  \ the penalty to the corresponding mental ability score. If the target's mental\
  \ ability score drops below 3, the target is also confused for the remaining duration\
  \ of the mutagen. The mutagen continues until the duration has ended. It can be\
  \ ended earlier if the target drinks or is fed the contents of a vial of antitoxin,\
  \ but with only 50% chance of success."
