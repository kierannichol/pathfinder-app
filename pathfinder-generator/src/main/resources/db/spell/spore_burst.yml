description: "You cause a willing plant creature's body to sprout small, puffy mushrooms\
  \ that remain for 1 round per caster level or until the creature uses them. As a\
  \ standard action, the target can cause these mushrooms to burst open, releasing\
  \ a cloud of toxic spores that affect all creatures in a 20-foot-radius spread.\
  \ Those in the area must succeed at Fortitude saves or be sickened for 1d6 rounds\
  \ as they are overcome by sneezing and coughing. The caster is immune to this poison\
  \ effect, as are all creatures of the plant type."
