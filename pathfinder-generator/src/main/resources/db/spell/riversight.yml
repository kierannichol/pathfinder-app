description: "You can view events transpiring along a natural watercourse you touch.\
  \ You can see anything on or within the river as if you were present at that location,\
  \ or you can observe anything happening within 15 feet of the river's banks as if\
  \ peering from the water's surface. Moving your point of view to a different location\
  \ along the river is a standard action, though your perception can follow something\
  \ moving along the river as a free action."
