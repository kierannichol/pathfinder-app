description: "You drain the might of the target and transfer that power to another\
  \ creature. The subject takes a penalty to Strength equal to 1d6 + 1 per 2 caster\
  \ levels (maximum 1d6 + 5). This effect can't cause the subject's Strength score\
  \ to drop below 1. A successful Fortitude save halves this penalty. This penalty\
  \ doesn't stack with itself or the penalty applied from ray of enfeeblement."
