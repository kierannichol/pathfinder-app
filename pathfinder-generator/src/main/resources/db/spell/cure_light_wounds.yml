description: "When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy\
  \ that cures 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Since\
  \ undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead\
  \ of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply spell resistance, and can\
  \ attempt a Will save to take half damage."
