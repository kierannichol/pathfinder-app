name: "Harvest Knowledge"
description: "You touch a creature and temporarily absorb its knowledge for yourself.\
  \ If the target fails its saving throw, you can sort through its lore and memories.\
  \ You can retrieve one answer to a specific question per minute, as through sifting\
  \ through the creature's surface thoughts with detect thoughts. Alternatively, you\
  \ can tap into the target's learned experiences and attempt one Knowledge check\
  \ in a skill in which the target has at least 1 rank, using the target's total skill\
  \ modifier. Each Knowledge check requires 1 minute and allows the target another\
  \ Will save to resist the effect. If the target successfully resists, the spell\
  \ does not end, but you are unable to attempt another Knowledge check for that skill\
  \ using this spell. You can also use this spell against targets trapped in magic\
  \ items or spells that hold their bodies or souls, such as an iron flask or the\
  \ spell trap the soul, by touching the associated receptacle."
