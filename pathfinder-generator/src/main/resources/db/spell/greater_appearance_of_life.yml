name: "Greater Appearance of Life"
description: "This spell functions as appearance of life (Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures\
  \ 108), except that you can disguise a single undead creature regardless of its\
  \ number of Hit Dice, and the illusion also creates relevant smells, sounds, textures,\
  \ and temperatures to match the appearance. If you disguise the target as a living\
  \ version of itself, creatures that interact with the target take a â€“5 penalty on\
  \ their Will saving throws to disbelieve the illusion, though if the target attacks\
  \ a creature, the attacked creature no longer takes this penalty."
