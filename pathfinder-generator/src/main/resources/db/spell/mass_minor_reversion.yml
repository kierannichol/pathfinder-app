description: "You create a replica within the Akashic Record of each target at the\
  \ time the spell is cast. Each targeted creature must currently have at least half\
  \ its hit points. If at any time during the duration of the spell a target is brought\
  \ below half her maximum hit points, that target can end the spell on herself as\
  \ an immediate action to absorb strength from her replica and immediately regain\
  \ a number of hit points equal to 1d8 plus 1 point per caster level (maximum +25)."
