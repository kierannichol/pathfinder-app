description: "This spell makes it difficult for the subject to cast arcane spells,\
  \ use spell-like abilities, and use some abilities granted by arcane spellcasting\
  \ classes. The subject must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 10 + 1/2 its\
  \ caster level) in order to cast an arcane spell, use any spell-like ability (even\
  \ those that come from a divine source), use arcane spell completion or spell trigger\
  \ magic items, or use any of the following class features that come from an arcane\
  \ spellcasting class: arcane school powers, arcanist exploits, bardic performances,\
  \ magus arcana, or witch hexes. Spells, spelllike abilities, or class features that\
  \ take a free, swift, or immediate action aren't affected by this spell, nor are\
  \ mythic spells or mythic powers."
