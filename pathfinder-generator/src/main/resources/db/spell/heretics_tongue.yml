description: "You fill your target's mind with blasphemous knowledge. If the target\
  \ fails its saving throw, it cannot cast spells or use spell-like abilities for\
  \ the duration of the spell. Divine spellcasters whose power derives from the worship\
  \ of a single deity (most clerics, paladins, and warpriests) have the potential\
  \ to suffer worse. When targeting a divine spellcaster, you can designate an alignment.\
  \ If the named alignment coincides with either the spellcaster's alignment or that\
  \ of her deity, the divine spellcaster loses access to all supernatural and spell-like\
  \ class abilities granted by the associated class for the spell's duration--blessings,\
  \ domain powers, channel energy, smite evil, etc."
