description: "A word of arcane-empowered inspiration can snatch victory from seeming\
  \ defeat. Cast this spell when a creature fails an attack roll or skill check. The\
  \ target gains a +1 competence bonus per five caster levels (maximum +3 bonus) on\
  \ the attack roll or skill check retroactively. If the bonus is enough to make the\
  \ failure a success, the roll succeeds."
