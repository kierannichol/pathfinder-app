description: "You imitate the mad cacophony created by the awful beings associated\
  \ with the Outer God, Azathoth. This spell targets only creatures with the ooze\
  \ type, creatures with the amorphous special ability, and non-bipedal creatures\
  \ with a special association with the Outer Gods. This music draws the targets'\
  \ attention to the caster, as per the fascinate bardic performance. It affects mindless\
  \ creatures despite the mindless quality typically granting immunity to mind-affecting\
  \ effects, though it doesn't ignore any other immunity to mind-affecting effects\
  \ the creature might have. The caster doesn't have to maintain the effect each round--the\
  \ music continues for the duration of the spell. Creatures fascinated by mad sultan's\
  \ melody become immune to any other casting of the spell for 24 hours after the\
  \ spell ends, and the spell ends if the fascination breaks on any of its targets\
  \ for any reason (such as an attack)."
