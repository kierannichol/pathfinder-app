    Effect: "A solitary ritual, the rite of fiendish transformation must take place\
      \ in an area bereft of light, save for that of a single candle. The candle is\
      \ centered on a circular sigil crafted out of powdered obsidian and lined with\
      \ unholy water. As the ritual commences, the caster holds aloft the severed\
      \ head of a good outsider, through which a fiendish patron speaks. The circle\
      \ channels the patron into the head without summoning its full presence, and\
      \ the primary caster can choose which evil plane the creature comes from (Abaddon,\
      \ the Abyss, or Hell)."
