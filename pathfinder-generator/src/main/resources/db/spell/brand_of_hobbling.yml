name: "Brand of Hobbling"
description: "This spell etches a symbol of chains, a particular prison, or a lawful\
  \ institution on the target, dealing 1d6 points of damage. The mark can be placed\
  \ on any exposed portion of the creature, typically on the head or forearm. While\
  \ the recipient is branded in this way, all of its movement speeds are reduced by\
  \ half (rounded down to the next 5-foot increment). A brand of hobbling can be hidden\
  \ by clothing or removed by scraping the brand away (the latter deals 1d6 points\
  \ of damage, though the brand returns if that damage is healed), but in either case\
  \ the effects of a brand of hobbling continue to function."
