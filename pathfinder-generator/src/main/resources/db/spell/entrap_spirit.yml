description: "You trap the target in the mirror used as the spell's focus. The target\
  \ cannot be affected by any means while inside the mirror. If the mirror is destroyed,\
  \ any incorporeal creature within is immediately freed and any haunt within returns\
  \ to its original location. Creatures that assumed incorporeal form through a spell\
  \ or other means remain incorporeal while trapped, even if the duration of the effect\
  \ that rendered them incorporeal expires. If your focus mirror belonged to the target,\
  \ the target takes a â€“2 penalty on its saving throw."
