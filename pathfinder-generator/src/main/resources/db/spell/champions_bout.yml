description: "You allow two chosen champions to fight without interference. The two\
  \ creatures must be willing in order for the spell to work. After you cast this\
  \ spell, any creature attempting to aid or hinder either of the two targets in any\
  \ way must succeed at a Will save or lose its action instead (spell resistance applies).\
  \ A creature that fails its Will save against champion's bout cannot attempt to\
  \ interfere again. If a creature successfully interferes with the bout, the spell\
  \ ends immediately."
