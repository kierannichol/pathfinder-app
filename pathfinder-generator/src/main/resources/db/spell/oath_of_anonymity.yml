description: "You swear an oath not to reveal your identity, magically preventing\
  \ anyone from discovering it so long as you avoid revealing your face or other easily\
  \ identifiable features. The spell distorts your voice and subtly alters your body\
  \ language and the appearance of your gear and any animals you use, whether as companions,\
  \ mounts, or otherwise. This spell does not make you appear to be a different creature\
  \ type, nor does it change your apparent height or body type."
