description: "You can attempt to influence unfriendly or hostile creatures, altering\
  \ their attitudes toward you. After casting, make a Diplomacy check against the\
  \ creatures as a free action; you gain a +2 sacred bonus on this check against creatures\
  \ that failed their saves against the spell. Even if you favorably manipulate the\
  \ attitude of the affected targets, they quickly revert to their previous attitude\
  \ if threatened or treated poorly."
