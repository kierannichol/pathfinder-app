name: "Locate Object"
description: "You sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object.\
  \ You can search for general items, in which case you locate the nearest of its\
  \ kind if more than one is within range. Attempting to find a certain item requires\
  \ a specific and accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the\
  \ actual object, the spell fails. You cannot specify a unique item unless you have\
  \ observed that particular item firsthand (not through divination)."
