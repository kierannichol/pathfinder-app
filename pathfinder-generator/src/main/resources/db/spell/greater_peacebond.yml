name: "Greater Peacebond"
description: "If a target weapon is sheathed or slung as the spell is cast, this functions\
  \ as peacebondUC, locking the target's weapon in place on its owner's body or within\
  \ the weapon's sheath or holster. Anyone who then tries to draw the weapon must\
  \ spend a standard action and succeed at a Strength check to do so, provoking attacks\
  \ of opportunity whether the attempt succeeds or fails. The DC for Strength checks\
  \ required by this spell is equal to the spell's save DC."
