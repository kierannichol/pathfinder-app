description: "You can use your psychic power to overwhelm the target's ego, leaving\
  \ the target feeling hopeless and unsure of itself. Choose Intelligence, Wisdom,\
  \ or Charisma. The target takes a â€“2 penalty to that ability score, and is also\
  \ staggered for the first round it's affected. A successful Will save negates the\
  \ staggered effect and reduces the duration of the penalty to 1 round."
