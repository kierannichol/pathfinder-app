description: "Developed due to Arazni's fear that her stolen organs might be used\
  \ to control her, this spell reflects any attempts to steal your free will. Whenever\
  \ you are exposed to a mind-affecting effect or a spell that would otherwise give\
  \ another creature control of your actions (such as control undead), you can dispel\
  \ this effect as an immediate action to redirect the spell to a creature within\
  \ 30 feet. The affected creature must attempt a save against the original DC of\
  \ the triggering effect. On a failure, it is subject to the effects of the triggering\
  \ spell, with the exception that you are treated as the original caster (statistics\
  \ determined by caster level are still calculated according to its original caster).\
  \ The target creature applies any spell resistance or immunities it has normally.\
  \ You can have only one instance of this spell active at a time."
