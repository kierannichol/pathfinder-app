name: "Death Candle"
description: "This spell functions like death knell, except instead of using the slain\
  \ target's life energy to enhance yourself, you use it to summon a Small fire elemental\
  \ resembling a burning, howling version of the slain creature. The elemental acts\
  \ immediately on your turn and otherwise behaves as if you had summoned it with\
  \ summon monster II. The elemental remains for a number of rounds equal to the Hit\
  \ Dice of the slain creature."
