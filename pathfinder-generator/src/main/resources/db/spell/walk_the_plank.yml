description: "This spell functions as per create pitAPG, except as noted here. All\
  \ but the top 10 feet of the hole is filled with saltwater, reducing the fall damage\
  \ for anyone falling into the pit to 1d3 points of nonlethal damage and allowing\
  \ Huge or larger creatures at the water's surface to simply pull themselves out\
  \ of the pit as part of a normal move action, without a Climb check. Additionally,\
  \ the pit contains a single advanced shark (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 294, 247) for\
  \ every 4 caster levels you have (maximum four advanced sharks). If desired, when\
  \ you cast the spell, you can substitute two of the summoned sharks for one great\
  \ white shark (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 241). These sharks immediately attack any\
  \ creature that falls into the pit, even you. If multiple creatures fall in the\
  \ pit, the sharks attack randomly. When the spell ends, creatures inside the hole\
  \ rise up with the bottom of the pit, as normal for create pit, but the conjured\
  \ water and sharks vanish."
