description: "You shroud an area in Urgathoa's unclean influence, rendering those\
  \ who pass through it and fail their Will saving throws more enticing to ravenous\
  \ undead. When an affected creature comes within 60 feet of an undead creature,\
  \ the spell immediately draws the undead creature's attention, granting it a +4\
  \ bonus on Perception checks to notice the affected creature and on saving throws\
  \ to resist spells that hide or disguise the affected creature (such as hide from\
  \ undead). Once the undead creature notices the affected creature, it feels compelled\
  \ to kill and devour the affected creature, and gains a +1 profane bonus on attack\
  \ rolls made against the affected creature and a +1 profane bonus on saving throws\
  \ against the affected creature's spells and special abilities. The undead also\
  \ ignores any concealment less than total concealment that an affected creature\
  \ has. Each time the spell draws an undead creature's attention to an affected creature,\
  \ the spell's haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round."
