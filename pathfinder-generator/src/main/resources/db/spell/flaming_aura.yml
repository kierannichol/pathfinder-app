description: "The spell allows you channel fire into your very being. If you don't\
  \ already have the fire subtype, this spell grants you the fire subtype. If you\
  \ already have the fire subtype, you instead channel the flames from your being\
  \ outward, creating a 10-foot-radius aura of fire centered on you. Creatures who\
  \ enter or end their turns in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw\
  \ or take 1d8 points of fire damage."
