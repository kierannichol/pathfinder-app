description: "You call upon the restless souls of those who died at sea. This spell\
  \ can be cast only on an area of deep water. When a creature enters the area, the\
  \ haunt manifests, automatically grabbing the creature and dragging it under the\
  \ water on initiative count 10. Each round, the haunt deals 1d6 points of nonlethal\
  \ damage as it drags its victim down 10 feet; a successful DC 15 Swim check reduces\
  \ the descent to 5 feet and negates the nonlethal damage. Each round in the haunt's\
  \ clutches reduces the duration the victim can hold her breath by 2 rounds (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Core Rulebook 445). A victim can make a single move or standard action each\
  \ round while in the haunt's grasp if she succeeds at a Will save; on a failed save,\
  \ she can only struggle helplessly against the haunt. A victim cannot use her actions\
  \ to swim toward the surface while the haunt is active. If the haunt reaches the\
  \ bottom of its body of water, it pounds its victim against the bottom, dealing\
  \ 2d6 points of nonlethal damage per round to the victim and reducing the duration\
  \ the victim can hold her breath by an additional round. This continues until either\
  \ the haunt is neutralized (in which case the victim must still swim to the surface)\
  \ or the victim drowns."
