description: "This spell infuses a spark of magical energy into the veins of the target,\
  \ allowing it to feel the presence of magic the way one might feel the thrum of\
  \ vibrations in the air. For the spell's duration, the target gains the benefits\
  \ of the spell detect magic and also gains a +5 enhancement bonus on Spellcraft\
  \ checks to identify the properties and command words of magic items. Further, the\
  \ target can attempt such checks untrained while under the effects of this spell.\
  \ This ability does not allow the target to identify artifacts."
