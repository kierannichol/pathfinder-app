name: "Unwelcome Halo"
description: "This spell causes the target to glow as if surrounded by a halo of light.\
  \ This halo sheds normal light in a 20-foot radius from the creature, and increases\
  \ the light level by one step for an additional 20 feet. This halo makes it impossible\
  \ for the creature to gain concealment in nonmagical darkness, and in dim or darker\
  \ conditions, the creature's glow can be seen even if it is not within direct line\
  \ of sight."
