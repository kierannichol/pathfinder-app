name: "Amnesia"
description: "You cause the target to lose most of its memories; its skills, its past,\
  \ and even its name become mysteries to it. While the target can build new memories,\
  \ it has trouble accessing those gained before falling victim to the spell. The\
  \ target can still speak and read any languages it knows and perform basic tasks,\
  \ but it loses all class abilities, feats, and skill ranks gained before being affected\
  \ by amnesia. It retains its base attack bonus, saving throws bonuses, Combat Maneuver\
  \ Bonus, Combat Maneuver Defense, total experience points, Hit Dice, and hit points.\
  \ If the target gains a character level while suffering from amnesia, it can use\
  \ any abilities gained by that class level normally. If the class level it gained\
  \ was from a class in which it already has levels, it gains the abilities of a 1st-level\
  \ character of that class, even though it is technically of a higher level in that\
  \ class."
