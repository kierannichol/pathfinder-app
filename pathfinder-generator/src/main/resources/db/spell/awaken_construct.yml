name: "Awaken Construct"
description: "You amplify the animating force of a construct to more closely resemble\
  \ a true soul, granting the construct humanlike sentience. To do so, you must succeed\
  \ at a Spellcraft check (DC = 15 + the construct's current Hit Dice). If the construct's\
  \ master (if any) is present, this is an opposed Spellcraft check. You have no special\
  \ empathy or connection with a creature you awaken--it is a free-willed creature.\
  \ Golems previously under another creature's control, either as shield guardians\
  \ or a golem crafter's creations, break all connections with that creature."
