description: "You enchant the target so it is nearly impossible to detect by both\
  \ magical and mundane means, granting it the following benefits. The target gains\
  \ a bonus on Stealth checks equal to half your caster level, and can use Stealth\
  \ to hide from all creatures attempting to perceive it, even when it lacks concealment\
  \ or cover. It can attempt a Stealth check to avoid detection from creatures using\
  \ blindsight, blindsense, or any ability that functions as either (such as lifesense\
  \ or tremorsense). Furthermore, the target leaves no trail and cannot be tracked\
  \ unless it chooses to leave a trail. If a creature attempts to discern the target's\
  \ presence or location using divination magic (including magic items with a divination\
  \ aura such as a crystal ball), that creature must succeed at a caster level check\
  \ with a DC equal to the target's Stealth bonus to discern any information about\
  \ the target, and on a failed check cannot do so for the spell's duration."
