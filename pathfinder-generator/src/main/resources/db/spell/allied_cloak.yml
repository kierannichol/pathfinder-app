description: "You cause a cloak, shawl, poncho, or other outer garment you are wearing\
  \ to animate to aid and defend you. The cloak provides a +2 shield bonus to your\
  \ AC. In addition, once each round during your turn, you can take a free action\
  \ to direct your cloak to use the aid another action to assist your skill check,\
  \ attack roll, or AC. The cloak has an attack bonus or a total skill bonus equal\
  \ to your caster level plus your key spellcasting ability score modifier (Charisma\
  \ for bards, Intelligence for wizards, and so on). If another creature dons the\
  \ cloak during the duration, the cloak provides its protection and aid to the wearer,\
  \ but it still uses the same bonus on the aid another actions as if you were the\
  \ wearer. The cloak cannot take any other type of action."
