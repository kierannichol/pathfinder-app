description: "When you charge, you can make a full attack at the end of that charge,\
  \ but only with claw attacks you have, and you can make only one attack per claw.\
  \ If you have abilities that grant bonuses on damage rolls or that apply other special\
  \ effects to charge attacks, only the first claw attack benefits from these bonuses.\
  \ When you make a claw attack as an attack of opportunity, you can expend one additional\
  \ use of your attacks of opportunity to make an additional claw attack against the\
  \ target that provoked the attack."
