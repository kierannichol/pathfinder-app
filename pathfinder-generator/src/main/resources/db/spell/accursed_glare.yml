name: "Accursed Glare"
description: "You channel a fell curse through your glare. If the target fails its\
  \ saving throw, it begins to obsessively secondguess its actions and attract bad\
  \ luck. Whenever the target attempts an attack roll or saving throw while the curse\
  \ lasts, it must roll twice and take the lower result. While you cast this spell,\
  \ an ally within range of the subject can attempt an Intimidate check as a move\
  \ action (DC = save DC of this spell); on a success, the ally adds its own glare\
  \ to yours, granting you a +2 bonus on your caster level check to overcome spell\
  \ resistance (if any). Multiple allies can attempt Intimidate checks; this bonus\
  \ stacks."
