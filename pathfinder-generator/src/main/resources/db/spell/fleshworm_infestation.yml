name: "Fleshworm Infestation"
description: "With a touch, you cause an infestation of ravenous worms to manifest\
  \ in the target's flesh. The target must make a Fortitude save every round. Failure\
  \ means it takes 1d6 hit points of damage and 2 points of Dexterity damage, and\
  \ is staggered for 1 round. If it makes the save, it takes no hit point or Dexterity\
  \ damage and is only sickened for 1 round rather than staggered. Fleshworm infestationcannot\
  \ be ended early by remove diseaseor heal, as the infestation starts anew if the\
  \ current worms are slain. Protection from evilnegates this spell's effects for\
  \ as long as the two durations overlap.Dispel evilautomatically ends a fleshworm\
  \ infestation."
