    Effect: "The ritual allows the primary caster to tap into the multiversal connection\
      \ shared by all aeons. The primary caster weaves complicated occult patterns\
      \ around herself with the silver wire; if secondary casters are involved in\
      \ the ritual, they stand around the primary caster and the primary caster wraps\
      \ the silver wire around their outstretched limbs to form these patterns. If\
      \ successfully performed, the primary caster can utilize the envisaging ability\
      \ as though she were an aeon to communicate with other creatures, can attempt\
      \ Knowledge checks untrained, and gains an enhancement bonus on Knowledge checks\
      \ equal to half her character level or twice the number of secondary casters,\
      \ whichever is greater. Although the primary caster can communicate with aeons\
      \ themselves across vast gulfs of distance and even planar boundaries, they\
      \ are unlikely to respond except to profess amusement or mild annoyance."
