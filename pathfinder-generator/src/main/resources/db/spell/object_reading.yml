  \ or psychically charged events in the item's history, or the information imprinted\
  \ by the charge object or implant false reading spells. This spell returns the same\
  \ information as the psychometry occult skill unlock (see page 196), but gives 1\
  \ piece of information when cast and requires 1 round of concentration per additional\
  \ piece of information instead of 1 minute. You must still attempt an Appraise check\
  \ to see how much information you gain. You gain a +10 competence bonus on the check."
