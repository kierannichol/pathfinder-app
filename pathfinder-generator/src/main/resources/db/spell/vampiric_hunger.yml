description: "The target of this spell grows the fangs of a vampire, as well as a\
  \ thirst for blood. For the duration of this spell, the target gains the ability\
  \ to drain an opponent's blood during a grapple; if the target establishes or maintains\
  \ a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage. Each round\
  \ it drains blood in this way, the target heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary\
  \ hit points for the duration of the spell (up to a maximum number of temporary\
  \ hit points equal to its full normal hit points). If the target does not drain\
  \ blood in this way while under the effects of this spell, it becomes exhausted\
  \ at the end of the spell's duration."
