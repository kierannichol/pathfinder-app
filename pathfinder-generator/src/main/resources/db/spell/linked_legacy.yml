description: "This spell helps build community and ensure a shared vision for the\
  \ future. When any of the affected creatures succeeds at a Knowledge check to answer\
  \ a question within its field of study or identify a monster and its special powers\
  \ or vulnerabilities, as a free action the affected creature can share any information\
  \ gained automatically with all targets of the spell. If any of the targets move\
  \ out of the spell's range, the spell ceases to function for all of them until they\
  \ are all within close range of you again."
