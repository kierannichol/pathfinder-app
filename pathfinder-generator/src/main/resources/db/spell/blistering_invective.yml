description: "You unleash an insulting tirade so vicious and spiteful that enemies\
  \ who hear it are physically scorched by your fury. When you cast this spell, make\
  \ an Intimidate check to demoralize each enemy within 30 feet of you. Enemies that\
  \ are demoralized this way take 1d10 points of fire damage and must succeed at a\
  \ Reflex save or catch fire. Spell resistance can negate the fire damage caused\
  \ by this spell, but does not protect the creature from the demoralizing effect."
