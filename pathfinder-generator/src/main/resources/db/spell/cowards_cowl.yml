description: "You imbue the target with a compulsion to avoid threats, enhancing its\
  \ defensive instincts. So long as the affected creature does not move closer to\
  \ enemies during its turn, or moves at least 5 feet away from adjacent enemies,\
  \ it gains a +1 morale bonus to its AC, and a +1 morale bonus on saves and on attack\
  \ rolls made as readied actions and attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, if the\
  \ affected creature does not close with its enemies, it can increase the DC of all\
  \ spells it casts as part of a readied action by 1. If the subject of the spell\
  \ willingly moves toward a threatening creature, the spell immediately ends."
