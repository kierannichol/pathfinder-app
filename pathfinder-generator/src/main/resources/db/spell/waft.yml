description: "You make the targets light enough to be carried by wind. Creatures affected\
  \ by this spell suffer cumulative penalties for attacking as if under the effects\
  \ of levitate unless they have a fly speed. Treat each target as two size categories\
  \ lighter for the purposes of being checked or blown away by wind. If a target has\
  \ a fly speed, it can fly overland at the wind's speed in the same direction as\
  \ the wind by succeeding at a DC 20 Fly check. If a creature flying overland this\
  \ way attempts to change direction, it risks being blown away as usual. By linking\
  \ hands or creating a connection with rope, creatures affected by this spell can\
  \ be towed through the air by a flying creature as if each weighed only one-eighth\
  \ its actual weight."
