description: "This spell functions as create lesser demiplane, except the area is\
  \ larger and you can add more features to the plane. You can use this spell to expand\
  \ a demiplane you created with create lesser demiplane (you do not need to create\
  \ an entirely new plane using this spell), in which case it has a duration of 1\
  \ day/level. Alternatively, when cast within your demiplane, you may add (or remove)\
  \ one of the following features to your demiplane with each casting of the spell,\
  \ in which case it has an instantaneous duration."
