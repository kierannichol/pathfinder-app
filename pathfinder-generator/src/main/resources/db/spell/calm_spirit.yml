name: "Calm Spirit"
description: "This spell temporarily calms agitated haunts and incorporeal undead\
  \ such as ghosts. You have no control over the affected creatures, but calm spirit\
  \ postpones hostile action by the affected spirits for the duration of the spell.\
  \ Entities so affected cannot take violent actions or do anything destructive, including\
  \ triggering persistent haunt abilities, though they can defend themselves. Any\
  \ aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed spirit or haunt immediately\
  \ ends the effect."
