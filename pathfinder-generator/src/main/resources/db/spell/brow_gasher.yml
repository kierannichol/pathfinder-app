description: "You imbue a slashing melee weapon with the ability to deal a gruesome\
  \ head wound. When the target weapon hits a living creature, in addition to the\
  \ normal effects of that hit, the wielder can discharge this spell as a free action\
  \ to open a gash on the target's forehead that deals bleed damage equal to half\
  \ your caster level. At the start of each of the target's turns, when it takes bleed\
  \ damage, it also takes a cumulative –1 penalty on all attack rolls. When that penalty\
  \ reaches –3, the target also treats all targets as having concealment (20% miss\
  \ chance). When the penalty reaches –5, the target is blinded. Stopping the bleed\
  \ damage ends the effects this spell imposes on the bleeding creature. A target\
  \ that is immune to bleed damage is also immune to all this spell's effects."
