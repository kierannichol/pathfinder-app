name: "Secret Speech"
description: "This spell grants the target the ability to send secret messages embedded\
  \ within normal speech. This is similar to the secret messages ability of the Bluff\
  \ skill, but no check is needed; the speaker's intended recipient always understands\
  \ the hidden message perfectly, but other listeners cannot perceive the message\
  \ at all. The target can send only one message at a time, though it can send that\
  \ message to multiple listeners. The secret message is considered to be in the same\
  \ language the target is speaking, and intended recipients hear and understand both\
  \ the actual speech and the secret message. The target can make itself understood\
  \ as far as its voice carries."
