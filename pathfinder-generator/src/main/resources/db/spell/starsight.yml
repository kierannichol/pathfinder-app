description: "You can observe the night sky and all of its celestial bodies as if\
  \ it were a clear night, regardless of weather conditions that would otherwise block\
  \ your view. Your vision penetrates any light pollution from nonmagical sources,\
  \ though this spell doesn't function in daylight, indoors, or underground. You see\
  \ through forest canopies and similar natural obstructions, but only for the purpose\
  \ of stargazing. For the spell's duration, you gain a +2 insight bonus on Knowledge\
  \ (geography) checks relating to the stars and planets and Survival checks to avoid\
  \ getting lost."
