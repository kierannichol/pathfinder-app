description: "You view several possible futures at once, allowing you to thread a\
  \ needle around disasters by taking a middle path. For the duration of this spell,\
  \ whenever you roll for an attack, saving throw, or skill check, roll three d20\
  \ and use the middle of the three rolls (or the highest, if more than one die shows\
  \ the same highest value, or the lowest, if more than one die shows the same lowest\
  \ value). If another ability would make you roll an attack roll, saving throw, or\
  \ skill check twice and take the higher result, roll twice and take the lower result,\
  \ or reroll, that ability has no effect and threefold sight ends immediately."
