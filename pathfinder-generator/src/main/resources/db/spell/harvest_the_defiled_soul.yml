    Effect: "Formulated and perfected by the Whispering Way's most twisted minds,\
      \ this ritual allows the caster to perform a number of fell rites that thoroughly\
      \ defile the metaphysical soul of a specific haunt or incorporeal creature,\
      \ causing its essence to coalesce into a refined ectoplasmic material that can\
      \ be used to craft especially powerful magic items and artifacts. Before she\
      \ can begin casting this ritual, the primary caster must draw necromantic sigils\
      \ around the area to be affected and adorn them with candles, a 12-hour process.\
      \ Each secondary caster participating in the ritual reduces this time by 1 hour,\
      \ to a minimum of 1 hour. During the ritual, one specific incorporeal undead\
      \ creature or haunt must be present within the affected area for its entire\
      \ casting time. Upon completing the ritual, the primary caster can harvest material\
      \ components from the specific creature or haunt as if she had the Haunt Scavenger\
      \ feat, though the creature or haunt need not be destroyed or neutralized. If\
      \ she already has this feat, she gains a +20 competence bonus on skill checks\
      \ to harvest material components from the specific creature or haunt and the\
      \ gp value of those components doubles. This process doesn't destroy or neutralize\
      \ the creature or haunt, and can be used on a specific creature or haunt only\
      \ once per month."
