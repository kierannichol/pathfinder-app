description: "This spell tears a rift in reality, creating an extradimensional hole\
  \ with a depth of 60 feet. You must create the rift on a horizontal surface of sufficient\
  \ size. Since the rift extends into the Abyss, it does not displace the original\
  \ underlying material or allow access to areas below the surface--you can create\
  \ the rift on the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of\
  \ a forest. Any Large or smaller creature standing in the area where you conjure\
  \ the rift must succeed at a Reflex save to avoid falling into the hole. If successful,\
  \ the creature picks which side of the rift it remains on once the rift opens. Unattended\
  \ objects and structures that can be fully engulfed by the rift automatically fall\
  \ into it."
