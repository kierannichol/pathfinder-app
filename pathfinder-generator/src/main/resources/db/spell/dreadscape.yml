name: "Dreadscape"
description: "Your targets see their surroundings as a nightmarish reflection of the\
  \ world around them. Buildings and furnishings take on a dirty, ruined appearance.\
  \ Even allies appear foreign and hostile, with friendly speech turning into garbled\
  \ mockery and threats. Each target gains the scared condition and has a hostile\
  \ attitude toward any new creature it encounters (though not toward creatures that\
  \ were already present at the time of the casting). Being hostile doesn't necessarily\
  \ mean the target will attack, and creatures can attempt Diplomacy checks to gain\
  \ a target's trust at the normal DC. If a creature becomes frightened or panicked\
  \ while under the influence of dreadscape, that creature takes 1d6 points of Wisdom\
  \ damage, though only once per casting of dreadscape."
