name: "Mirror Transport"
description: "This spell functions as mirror hideaway, except any creature that enters\
  \ the target mirror can spend a swift action to exit through another mirror within\
  \ 500 feet as if using dimension door; this is a one-way transport. The creature\
  \ can exit through a mirror only if it could fit through an opening the same size\
  \ as the mirror. Each transport through the target mirror reduces the spell's duration\
  \ by 1 hour."
