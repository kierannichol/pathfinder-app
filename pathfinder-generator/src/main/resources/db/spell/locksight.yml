name: "Locksight"
description: "The target can observe for 1 full round a lock that he is aware of (or\
  \ object that includes a lock, such as a chest or door) that is within 60 feet to\
  \ automatically determine whether it is open, closed, or jammed. If the target creature\
  \ is trained in Disable Device, by concentrating on a lock for 3 rounds, he can\
  \ also determine the quality of the lock (simple, average, good, or superior). This\
  \ spell does not enable the target to see hidden locks, such as those on secret\
  \ doors."
