name: "Planar Refuge"
description: "This spell enforces the rules of the Material Plane on other planes\
  \ of existence. Upon casting this spell on another plane, a spherical pocket of\
  \ wilderness terrain forms around the designated point. The affected area defies\
  \ the local climate and planar traits, suppressing any harmful environmental effects\
  \ such as toxicity, extreme temperatures, or lack of air (though this spell doesn't\
  \ affect gravity). The area also becomes lush with edible plants whose appearance,\
  \ taste, and smell bear characteristics distinct to the environment. On a negative-dominant\
  \ planeGMG, for example, the plants grow ghastly white leaves and taste bitter.\
  \ Though planar refuge can be cast on any plane of existence other than the Material\
  \ Plane, it requires a body of solid matter at least as large as its area to function."
