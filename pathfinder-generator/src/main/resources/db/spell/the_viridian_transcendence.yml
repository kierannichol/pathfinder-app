    Effect: "The primary caster draws the symbol of the Peacock Spirit--a peacock\
      \ feather with an open eye in the middle--on the floor as the secondary casters\
      \ stand in a circle around him. The secondary casters join hands around the\
      \ primary caster, who must perform the praises of the Peacock Spirit (traditionally,\
      \ hymns and dances that focus on tripartite union of mind, body, and soul).\
      \ The secondary casters can lend their voices, but they must be in perfect harmony."
