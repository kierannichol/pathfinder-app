description: "You alter the area's terrain and climate to a new terrain and climate\
  \ type appropriate to the planet or plane. For example, you might transform a desert\
  \ to plains. To cast this spell, you must expend 10 uses of mythic power along with\
  \ the material cost. This magically alters the area's climate and normal plants\
  \ to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn't affect creatures or the configuration\
  \ of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into\
  \ shrubs and small trees, but doesn't flatten the hills or change the animals to\
  \ suit the new environment."
