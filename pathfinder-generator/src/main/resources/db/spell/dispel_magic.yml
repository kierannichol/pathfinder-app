name: "Dispel Magic"
description: "You can use dispel magic to end one ongoing spell that has been cast\
  \ on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic\
  \ item, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if\
  \ its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't\
  \ be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like\
  \ effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration\
  \ can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel\
  \ magic can take effect."
