description: "You grow flesh on a decomposed or skeletonized corpse of a Medium or\
  \ smaller creature, providing it with sufficient flesh that it can be animated as\
  \ a zombie rather than a skeleton. The corpse looks as it did when the creature\
  \ died. The new flesh is somewhat rotted and not fit for eating."
