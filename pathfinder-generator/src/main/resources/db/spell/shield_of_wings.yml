description: "You gain five burning wings that grant a fly speed equal to the number\
  \ of wings Ã— 10 (average maneuverability) for an initial fly speed of 50 feet. The\
  \ first time in a round where you would take fire damage, a wing vanishes (reducing\
  \ the fly speed granted) and you gain fire resistance 30 for the remainder of the\
  \ round. When you are down to one wing (and a fly speed of 10 feet), your maneuverability\
  \ drops to poor. When you lose your final wing, you become immune to fire damage\
  \ for 1 additional minute, after which the effects of this spell end."
