description: "You imbue a weapon with a faint silvery glow that dimly illuminates\
  \ a 5-foot square. An affected weapon also easily bypasses the physical defenses\
  \ of undead creatures, ignoring 5 points of an undead creature's damage reduction,\
  \ as long as the damage reduction is not DR/epic. For example, attacks with a weapon\
  \ affected by this spell completely ignore a zombie's DR 5/slashing or reduce a\
  \ lich's damage reduction to DR 10/bludgeoning and magic."
