description: "This spell functions only against a creature with an attitude toward\
  \ you of indifferent or better, and only if the target is not hostile toward you\
  \ or your visible allies. A target touched by you (this touch usually requires a\
  \ successful melee touch attack) must succeed at a Will saving throw or fall asleep\
  \ for 2d6 hours. While asleep, the creature is helpless. For 1 minute after the\
  \ creature is affected, any loud noise or rough contact causes it to awaken immediately.\
  \ Thereafter, slapping or wounding an affected creature awakens it, but normal noise\
  \ does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (this is an application of\
  \ the aid another action)."
