name: "Revealing Light"
description: "The touched object emits a shimmering light (as per light) that causes\
  \ shadows to shift constantly in a 20-foot radius. Creatures lose any racial bonus\
  \ on Stealth checks while in the area, and the light suppresses any bonuses on Stealth\
  \ checks granted by visual camouflage (such as from camouflage nettingUE or the\
  \ camouflage rogue talentAPG). The unpredictable light patterns also interfere with\
  \ spells and effects of the pattern subschool, granting all creatures in the area\
  \ a +2 bonus on saves against such effects."
