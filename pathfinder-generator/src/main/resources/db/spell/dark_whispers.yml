name: "Dark Whispers"
description: "You communicate through the shadows of one or more targets within range.\
  \ The shadows have no physical presence and don't move or animate. Instead, your\
  \ words emerge from the shadow as a clear whisper, absent any accent or other identifying\
  \ features. The targets can make conversation with the shadow, but must speak aloud\
  \ to do so. The targets' voices emerge from your own shadow only when they intend\
  \ to speak to the shadow, but you hear no other sounds from the target's immediate\
  \ area. Their responses also emerge as clear whispers, absent identifying features,\
  \ but you can instinctively identify which target is speaking to you through the\
  \ shadow. Once the spell has been cast, you don't need to have line of effect to\
  \ the targets or their shadows to communicate back and forth."
