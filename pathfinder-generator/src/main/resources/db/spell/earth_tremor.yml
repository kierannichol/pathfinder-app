name: "Earth Tremor"
description: "You strike the ground and unleash a tremor of seismic force, hurling\
  \ up earth, rock, and sand. You choose whether the earth tremor affects a 30-foot\
  \ line, a 20-foot cone-shaped spread, or a 10-foot-radius spread centered on you.\
  \ The space you occupy is not affected by earth tremor. The area you choose becomes\
  \ dense rubble that costs 2 squares of movement to enter. Dense rubble adds 5 to\
  \ the DC of Acrobatics checks and adds 2 to the DC of Stealth checks. Creatures\
  \ on the ground in the area take 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage per caster level\
  \ you have (maximum 10d4) or half damage on a successful save. Medium or smaller\
  \ creatures that fail their saves are knocked prone."
