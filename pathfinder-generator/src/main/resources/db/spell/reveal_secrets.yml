name: "Reveal Secrets"
description: "When you cast this spell, you ask the target whether it has a secret\
  \ about a specific topic that can be described in 10 words or fewer. This can concern\
  \ a person, place, or thing (such as a town's mayor, the ring worn by a traveling\
  \ merchant, or the bridge spanning a nearby river) or an easily distinguished event\
  \ (such as a historic battle or a recent rash of disappearances). If the target\
  \ knows a secret about the topic (information it believes isn't common knowledge\
  \ and which it would not normally tell you), it states it has a secret. The target\
  \ doesn't mention anything about the secret and doesn't remember telling you it\
  \ has a secret. If the target succeeds at its saving throw, it isn't compelled to\
  \ reveal whether it knows a secret and is aware that you asked."
