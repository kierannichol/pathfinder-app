name: "Burning Entanglement"
description: "This spell functions as per entangle, except it sets the foliage on\
  \ fire. A creature that begins its turn entangled by the spell takes 4d6 points\
  \ of fire damage (Reflex half), and a creature that begins its turn in the area\
  \ but is not entangled takes 2d6 points of fire damage (Reflex negates). Smoke rising\
  \ from the vines partially obscures visibility. Creatures can see things in the\
  \ smoke within 5 feet clearly, but attacks against anything farther away in the\
  \ smoke must contend with concealment (20% miss chance). When the spell's duration\
  \ expires, the vines burn away entirely."
