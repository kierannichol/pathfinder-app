description: "This spell transforms your body into living flame. You and your equipment\
  \ are immune to fire damage. In fact, every time you would normally take damage\
  \ from fire, you are instead healed of damage at a rate of 1 point per 3 points\
  \ of damage the fire attack would have normally inflicted. You are immune to blindness,\
  \ critical hits, ability score damage, deafness, disease, drowning, electricity,\
  \ poison, stunning, and all spells that affect your physiology or respiration. You\
  \ take only half damage from acid or electricity. You take 150% as much damage from\
  \ cold than normal."
