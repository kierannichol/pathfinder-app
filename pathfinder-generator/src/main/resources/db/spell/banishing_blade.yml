name: "Banishing Blade"
description: "You imbue a weapon with the power to drive foes back. The first time\
  \ each round the weapon strikes a creature, the weapon attempts a free bull rush\
  \ combat maneuver check against that creature. This does not provoke attacks of\
  \ opportunity. The combat maneuver for the bull rush is equal to 1d20 + your caster\
  \ level. You do not have to move to push creatures more than 5 feet with this bull\
  \ rush. If a creature you strike has spell resistance, you must attempt a caster\
  \ level check to overcome its spell resistance the first time you strike it. If\
  \ you fail, that creature is immune to the effects of this casting of banishing\
  \ blade."
