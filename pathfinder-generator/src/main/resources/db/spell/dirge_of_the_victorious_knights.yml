description: "By performing part of the Chelish opera Victory of the Hellknights,\
  \ you call forth spectral illusions of mounted Hellknights to trample your foes\
  \ under the hooves of their glorious steeds. The shadowy knights appear in an adjacent\
  \ 10-foot square and ride forward in the direction you indicate, dealing 1d6 points\
  \ of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to all creatures in their path. Half\
  \ of this damage is cold damage, while half results directly from arcane power and\
  \ is not subject to cold resistance or immunity. The knights cannot pass through\
  \ force effects or barriers that block incorporeal creatures or undead."
