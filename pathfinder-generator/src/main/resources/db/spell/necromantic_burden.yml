description: "You make an undead creature more difficult for necromancers and clerics\
  \ to control via effects such as Command Undead or control undead. If the target\
  \ fails its Will save, the target's effective number of Hit Dice is doubled for\
  \ the purposes of determining whether it remains under the control of another creature.\
  \ Regardless of the target's actual Hit Dice, its effective HD cannot exceed twice\
  \ your caster level. (For example, a 12th-level cleric could cast this spell to\
  \ cause an undead creature with 15 HD to instead effectively have 24 HD for the\
  \ purpose of controlling it.)"
