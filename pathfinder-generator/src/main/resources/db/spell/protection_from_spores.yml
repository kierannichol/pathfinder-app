name: "Protection from Spores"
description: "With a touch, you bolster a creature's body to protect it from the harmful\
  \ effects of spores and similar afflictions. While under the effect of this spell,\
  \ a creature is immune to the effects of brown mold, green slime, russet mold, yellow\
  \ mold, and any similar hazard, provided the hazard is CR 6 or lower. Similarly,\
  \ the creature is immune to poison, disease, and infestation attacks from all fungal\
  \ creatures of CR 6 or lower, including effects such as basidirond spores, violet\
  \ fungus rot, and the like. The target is immune to fungus-based toxins, such as\
  \ striped toadstool. Against similar hazards or monsters of CR 7 or higher, the\
  \ target gains a bonus on all saving throws against the effect equal to half your\
  \ caster level. Protection from spores offers no protection against fungal infestations\
  \ created by the seeded, by the spell what grows within, or by Xhamen-Dor."
