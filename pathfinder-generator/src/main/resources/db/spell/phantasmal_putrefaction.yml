name: "Phantasmal Putrefaction"
description: "You implant within the minds of your targets the illusion that their\
  \ skin is rotting away, large rents are appearing all over their bodies, and their\
  \ internal organs are spilling out into a putrid halfliquid mass at their feet.\
  \ Those who fail to disbelieve phantasmal putrefaction immediately take 1d4 points\
  \ of Wisdom damage. This damage occurs only once. Each round at the beginning of\
  \ its turn, an affected target receives another Will save to disbelieve the effect,\
  \ and targets that fail must succeed at a Fortitude save or faint, falling asleep\
  \ as per sleep (except that it isn't a magical sleep effect). Waking up doesn't\
  \ end the spell for a target; it must continue to attempt Will saves to disbelieve\
  \ and Fortitude saves to avoid fainting each round until the spell ends or the target\
  \ successfully disbelieves."
