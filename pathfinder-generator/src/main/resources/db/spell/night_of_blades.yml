description: "Useful primarily to those who skulk in the darkness, this spell is a\
  \ temporary trap for the unwary. You create an immobile wall of tiny black blades\
  \ that whirl and tear into creatures like a cyclone. Anyone who enters this space\
  \ takes 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d4), though a successful\
  \ Reflex save halves the damage. The spell cannot be cast so that it appears in\
  \ a space already occupied by Small or larger creatures."
