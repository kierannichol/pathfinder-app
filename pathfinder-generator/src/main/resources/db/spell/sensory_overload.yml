description: "You overload the target creature's senses, making it difficult for the\
  \ target to concentrate. For the duration of the effect, the target must succeed\
  \ at a Will save at the same DC as the original effect to perform any standard or\
  \ full-round action. On a failure, the creature loses the action that triggered\
  \ the saving throw. If successful, the creature is able to take the action, but\
  \ this spell effect is not negated."
