description: "You create floating swords of the type used as the material component\
  \ for this spell (such as a rapier or scimitar) and magically propel them at your\
  \ target. You can create one sword for every 2 caster levels that you possess, up\
  \ to a maximum of five swords at 10th level. You must have line of effect between\
  \ you and the target, and the target must be within the spell's range. You make\
  \ a ranged attack roll for each sword (with no penalties for range increments or\
  \ using melee weapons as ranged weapons); each attack has the same threat range\
  \ and critical modifier and deals the same damage as a standard sword of the type\
  \ expended. Swords created by this spell disappear after striking (or missing) their\
  \ targets."
