description: "You cause the victim's attacks to careen wildly, endangering itself\
  \ and those around it. Your target gains a 25% miss chance on all attack rolls.\
  \ If an attack misses due to this magical effect, the victim instead targets an\
  \ ally, or else itself if there are no allies within range of the original attack.\
  \ Apply the attack roll for the original attack to the new target's Armor Class\
  \ to determine if this attack hits. This is a curse effect."
