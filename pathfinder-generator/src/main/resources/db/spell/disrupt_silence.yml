name: "Disrupt Silence"
description: "You suppress magical sound-dampening effects within the area. Disrupt\
  \ silence temporarily negates magical silence within its area, so that normal sounds\
  \ can be heard within the overlapping areas of effect. Additionally, disrupt silence\
  \ can automatically counter or dispel any magical silence effect of equal or lower\
  \ level cast upon the same target, such as silence. If you cast disrupt silence\
  \ on the target of a higher-level silence effect, it functions as dispel magic instead\
  \ of its normal function."
