    Effect: "The primary caster begins the ritual by placing the focus in a pool of\
      \ water that measures at least 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 50 feet deep.\
      \ After this is done, the secondary casters surround the pool and perform ceremonial\
      \ chants and wild supplications to the Drowned God, while the primary caster\
      \ whispers the horrifying truths of Tychilarius into the target's ear. The unspeakable\
      \ horror and veracity of the whispers create a stronger bond between the target\
      \ and the Drowned God. The ritual casters then place the target inside the pool."
