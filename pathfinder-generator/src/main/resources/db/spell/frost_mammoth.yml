description: "A blast of snow suddenly fills an area with a space of 15 feet, immediately\
  \ taking the shape of a woolly mammoth made of snow with tusks of solid ice. The\
  \ mammoth has statistics identical to those of a mastodon (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary\
  \ 128), except it also has the cold subtype (and thus gains immunity to cold and\
  \ vulnerability to fire). The frost mammoth obeys your telepathic commands. It allows\
  \ you or anyone you designate to ride it, and it is treated as if combat trained.\
  \ At 17th level, a frost mammoth you conjure deals an additional 1d6 points of cold\
  \ damage with each physical attack."
