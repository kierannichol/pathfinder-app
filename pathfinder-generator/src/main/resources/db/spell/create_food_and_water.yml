name: "Create Food and Water"
description: "The food that this spell creates is simple fare of your choice--highly\
  \ nourishing, if rather bland. Food so created decays and becomes inedible after\
  \ 24 hours, although it can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by casting a purify\
  \ food and water spell on it. The water created by this spell is just like clean\
  \ rain water, and it doesn't go bad as the food does."
