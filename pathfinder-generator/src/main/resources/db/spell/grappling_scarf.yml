name: "Grappling Scarf"
description: "A scarf you are wearing frays at the end into hook-like shapes and can\
  \ extend to incredible lengths. Although your scarf retains its weight, its frayed\
  \ ends function as a grappling hook that can be thrown with a range increment of\
  \ 20 feet. Your scarf elongates to 100 feet the first time it is thrown during the\
  \ spell duration. Regardless of its apparent material, the scarf is as strong and\
  \ easy to climb as a knotted silk rope. At the end of the duration, the scarf detaches\
  \ and returns to its former shape, fluttering down from its position if you haven't\
  \ already retrieved it."
