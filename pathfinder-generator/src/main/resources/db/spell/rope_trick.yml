name: "Rope Trick"
description: "When this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long,\
  \ one end of the rope rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular\
  \ to the ground, as if affixed at the upper end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened\
  \ to an extradimensional space that is outside the usual multiverse of extradimensional\
  \ spaces. Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of\
  \ spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes. The space\
  \ holds as many as eight creatures (of any size). The rope cannot be removed or\
  \ hidden. The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds. A weight greater than that can\
  \ pull the rope free."
