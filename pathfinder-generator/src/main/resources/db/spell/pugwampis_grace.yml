name: "Pugwampi's Grace"
description: "Hated by adventurers throughout the Inner Sea region, the gremlins known\
  \ as pugwampis infect those around them with a malignant form of unluck--an effect\
  \ that this spell emulates. If the target fails its Will save, it becomes infused\
  \ with the so-called â€œgrace of the pugwampi.\" A creature affected by this spell\
  \ must roll two d20s whenever a situation calls for a d20 roll (such as an attack\
  \ roll, a skill check, or a saving throw) and must use the lower of the two results\
  \ generated. As with the aura shed by actual pugwampies, this spell has no effect\
  \ on animals, gremlins, or gnolls. The effects of this spell are negated as long\
  \ as a target gains any sort of luck bonus to a d20 roll (such as those granted\
  \ by a luckstoneor divine favor), but the spell's duration is not impacted by these\
  \ effects. If the luck bonus goes away before the pugwampi's graceeffect ends, the\
  \ unluck returns and remains until the spell's normal duration runs out."
