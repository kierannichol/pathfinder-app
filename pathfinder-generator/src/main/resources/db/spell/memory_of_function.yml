name: "Memory of Function"
description: "Even a broken object remembers what it means to be a functioning whole.\
  \ You restore a broken object or damaged construct to a functional state, as if\
  \ it were new and intact. Any pieces missing from the object or construct remain\
  \ missing. Significant missing pieces may prevent proper functioning. If the object\
  \ uses charges, the object becomes fully charged. A timeworn object becomes fully\
  \ charged, but doesn't lose the timeworn condition (this spell is one of the few\
  \ ways a timeworn item can be recharged). For 1 hour after this spell is cast on\
  \ a timeworn object, that object does not suffer any chance of glitching. Other\
  \ consumables such as ammunition are not restored."
