description: "This spell wards the subject and creates a mystic connection between\
  \ you and the subject so that some of its wounds are transferred to you. The subject\
  \ gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on saves. Additionally,\
  \ the subject takes only half damage from all wounds and attacks (including those\
  \ dealt by special abilities) that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not\
  \ taken by the warded creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not involve\
  \ hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level draining, and\
  \ death effects, are not affected. If the subject suffers a reduction of hit points\
  \ from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with you because\
  \ it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer\
  \ divided between the subject and you, but damage already split is not reassigned\
  \ to the subject."
