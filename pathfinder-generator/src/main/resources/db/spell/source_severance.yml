description: "You create an invisible barrier that surrounds you and moves with you,\
  \ inhibiting one category of magic. When you cast this spell, choose either arcane\
  \ or divine magic. This spell functions like antimagic field, but it suppresses\
  \ only spells of the chosen type and supernatural and spell-like class abilities\
  \ from classes that grant spellcasting of the selected type. Magic items, other\
  \ spell-like abilities, and other supernatural abilities are unaffected."
