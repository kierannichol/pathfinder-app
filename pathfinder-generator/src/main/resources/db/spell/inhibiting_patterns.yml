description: "You create one or more vibrant pillars of kaleidoscopic color that rise\
  \ out from the ground. A creature attempting to move through one of the pillars\
  \ must attempt a Will save. Failure means the creature can't move through the pillar\
  \ and can't take any other actions for the duration of its turn that round, but\
  \ it can attempt to pass through the pillar again in subsequent rounds (attempting\
  \ another save against the effect). A creature need only succeed at one saving throw\
  \ to move through all pillars created by this spell."
