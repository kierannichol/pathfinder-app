description: "You wrest the control of a construct from its master. For as long as\
  \ you concentrate, you can control the construct as if you were its master. You\
  \ must make a Spellcraft check each round to maintain control. The DC of the Spellcraft\
  \ check is (10 + the construct's HD). If the construct's creator or master is present\
  \ and trying to control the construct, you both must make opposed Spellcraft checks\
  \ each round to control the construct."
