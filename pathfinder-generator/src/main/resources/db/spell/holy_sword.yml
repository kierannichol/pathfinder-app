name: "Holy Sword"
description: "This spell allows you to channel holy power into your sword, or any\
  \ other melee weapon you choose. The weapon acts as a +5 holy weapon (+5 enhancement\
  \ bonus on attack and damage rolls, extra 2d6 damage against evil opponents). It\
  \ also emits a magic circle against evil effect (as the spell). If the magic circle\
  \ ends, the sword creates a new one on your turn as a free action. The spell is\
  \ automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand. You cannot have\
  \ more than one holy sword at a time."
