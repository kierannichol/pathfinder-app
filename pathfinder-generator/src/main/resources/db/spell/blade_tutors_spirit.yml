description: "You summon an insubstantial spirit of force that resembles a cloudy\
  \ vapor hovering around your fists or any melee weapons you wield. The spirit compensates\
  \ for your defensive or reckless melee attacks, nudging your weapons in the proper\
  \ direction. When you voluntarily use one or more actions or feats that apply penalties\
  \ to attack rolls with your melee weapons (such as a charge, fighting defensively,\
  \ or using the Power Attack feat), the spirit reduces the total penalty on affected\
  \ attacks by 1 (to a minimum penalty of 0). The penalty is reduced by an additional\
  \ 1 for every 5 caster levels you possess (to a minimum penalty of 0). Only penalties\
  \ incurred by voluntary use of feats or maneuvers are reduced by this spell."
