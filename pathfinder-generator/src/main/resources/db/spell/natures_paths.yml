description: "The target instinctively knows the shortest, easiest, and fastest way\
  \ through the wilderness. For the purpose of determining overland speed, the target\
  \ treats any trackless terrain as though there were a trail or road, and any terrain\
  \ with a road or trail as though there were a highway (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook\
  \ 171--172). Up to one creature per caster level traveling with the target can also\
  \ benefit from the effect. The spell functions only outdoors and does not function\
  \ in magically altered terrain."
