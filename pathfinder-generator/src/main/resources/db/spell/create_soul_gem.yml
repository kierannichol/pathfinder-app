name: "Create Soul Gem"
description: "You draw forth the ebbing life force of a dying creature or one that\
  \ has died in the past round, focusing it through a crystal lens focus to transform\
  \ into a soul gem. If the creature is alive and fails its saving throw, it dies\
  \ and you capture its soul in the gem. If the creature is dead, it can still resist\
  \ the spell effect by attempting a Will save as if it were still alive. The value\
  \ of the soul gem created depends on the nature of the creature it is made from\
  \ (see page 191). Soul gems created by this spell crumble to dust once the spell's\
  \ duration expires, releasing the trapped soul to travel on to judgment in the Great\
  \ Beyond."
