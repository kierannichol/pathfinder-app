name: "Umbral Weapon"
description: "A shadowy afterimage trails behind the targeted weapon, potentially\
  \ damaging foes even when the weapon misses. Once per round, when the weapon's wielder\
  \ misses a creature with the target weapon, the wielder can reroll the attack. If\
  \ the reroll hits, the spell hits the targeted creature and deals 1d8 points of\
  \ cold damage, plus 1 additional point per 2 caster levels (maximum +10). If an\
  \ attacked creature has spell resistance, you must attempt a caster level check\
  \ (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spell damages\
  \ the target. If the creature successfully resists umbral weapon, the spell is dispelled.\
  \ If not, the creature takes damage as normal."
