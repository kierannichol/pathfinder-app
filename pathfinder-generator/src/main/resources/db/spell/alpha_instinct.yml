description: "Animals perceive you as a social superior. The starting attitude of\
  \ animals you interact with improves by one step, and you gain a +2 morale bonus\
  \ on Handle Animal checks. Helpful animals provide simple assistance (such as using\
  \ the aid another action on skill checks they understand) as long as the spell lasts,\
  \ but they flee from attacks and do not support you in combat. At one point during\
  \ the spell's duration, you can issue a nonverbal command to helpful animals within\
  \ 60 feet to forage for you; the animal or animals immediately head out into the\
  \ wilderness to do just that. After 1 hour, the animals return to the location where\
  \ you issued the command to make you an offering of edible food sufficient for one\
  \ meal for you and a number of others equal to your caster level."
