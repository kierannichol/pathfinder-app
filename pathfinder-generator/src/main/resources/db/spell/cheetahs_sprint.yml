description: "A wild surge of energy courses through your body and propels you into\
  \ a sprint. If you take a charge or run action before the end of your turn, you\
  \ can move a total distance of up to 10 times your base land speed. This adjustment\
  \ is an enhancement bonus. There is no effect on other modes of movement, such as\
  \ burrow, climb, fly, or swim. As with other effects that increase your speed, this\
  \ spell affects your jumping distance."
