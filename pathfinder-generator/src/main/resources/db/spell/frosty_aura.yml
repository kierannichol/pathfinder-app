description: "The spell allows you to channel cold into your very being. If you don't\
  \ already have the cold subtype, this spell grants you the cold subtype. If you\
  \ already have the cold subtype, you instead channel the frost from your being outward,\
  \ creating a 10-footradius aura of cold centered on you. Creatures who enter or\
  \ end their turns in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or take 1d8\
  \ points of cold damage."
