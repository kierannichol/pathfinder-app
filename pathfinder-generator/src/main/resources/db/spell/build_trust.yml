description: "You get a sense of the best way to interact with the target in order\
  \ to encourage positive regard and fellowship toward you. You gain a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks you attempt when\
  \ interacting with the target. In addition, whenever you fail a Charisma check or\
  \ Charisma-based skill check when interacting with the target, you can reroll the\
  \ check as an immediate action. Attempting this reroll grants the target a new saving\
  \ throw to end the spell. The target doesn't become hostile to you when the spell\
  \ ends, but it does become disillusioned of its new trust in you. Attacking the\
  \ target or taking an obvious hostile action against it automatically ends the spell."
