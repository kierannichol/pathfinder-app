description: "You can attempt to slay any one living creature. When you cast this\
  \ spell, your hand seethes with eerie dark fire. You must succeed on a melee touch\
  \ attack to touch the target. The target takes 12d6 points of damage + 1 point per\
  \ caster level. If the target's Fortitude saving throw succeeds, it instead takes\
  \ 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level. The subject might die from damage\
  \ even if it succeeds on its saving throw."
