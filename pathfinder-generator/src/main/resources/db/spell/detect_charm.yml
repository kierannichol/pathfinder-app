name: "Detect Charm"
description: "This spell functions as per detect magic, except that it detects only\
  \ charm, compulsion, and possession effects. You immediately detect the strength\
  \ and location of each such aura on all creatures in the area. You can attempt to\
  \ identify the properties of each aura (see Spellcraft on page 106 the Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Core Rulebook). In addition to noticing the targets of these effects, you\
  \ can recognize when creatures in the area are using these effects on others by\
  \ attempting a Sense Motive check as a standard action (DC = 20 + caster level).\
  \ If you succeed, you can attempt a Spellcraft check to identify what magic it is\
  \ using (even if the target is not in the area)."
