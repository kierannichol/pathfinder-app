name: "Vine Strike"
description: "Bristles burst from your body, lodging in your opponent and blossoming\
  \ into entangling vines as you pummel your target. While this spell is in effect,\
  \ one of your natural attacks or unarmed strikes deals an additional 1d6 points\
  \ of damage, and each creature hit with that natural weapon or unarmed strike must\
  \ succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled for the duration of the spell; on a successful\
  \ Reflex save, the creature is immune to the entangled effect for 1 round. A creature\
  \ entangled by this spell can spend a standard action to remove the vines, but can\
  \ be entangled again by further unarmed strikes."
