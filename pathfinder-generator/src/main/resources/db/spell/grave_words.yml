description: "With this spell and a touch, you can force a corpse talk to you, but\
  \ you can't ask it specific questions or communicate with it at all. The corpse\
  \ will start babbling for 1 round, spitting out random sentences. There is a 10%\
  \ chance this information is of some use to the caster, but it is difficult to distinguish\
  \ whether the information is useful (the GM makes the percentile roll in secret)."
