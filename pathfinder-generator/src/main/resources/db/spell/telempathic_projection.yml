description: "You alter the target's mood, adjusting its attitude toward you or another\
  \ creature you designate by one step either positively or negatively (see the Diplomacy\
  \ skill on page 94 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). You can instead use this\
  \ spell to assist your own or an ally's Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Perform, or\
  \ Sense Motive check, granting that check a +5 insight bonus against the target\
  \ of your telempathic projection with no save. In this case, the spell's duration\
  \ expires immediately when the skill check is complete."
