description: "By speaking the name â€œXhamen-Dor,\" you infuse yourself with the essence\
  \ of the Inmost Blot and gain a +3 profane bonus on Will saving throws for the spell's\
  \ duration. When you prepare what grows within for the first time, or the first\
  \ time you use it via a spell-completion or spell-trigger item, you can thereafter\
  \ be targeted by Xhamen-Dor's infected dreams ability (see page 86). As long as\
  \ you are under the effects of what grows within, your mind-affecting spells carry\
  \ this supernatural taint within them and can infect those who succumb to those\
  \ effects. Whenever you successfully affect a creature with one of your mind-affecting\
  \ spells (this requires the target to fail its saving throw against the spell if\
  \ the spell allows a save, but automatically affects a target if the spell does\
  \ not allow a saving throw), that target must also succeed at a Fortitude saving\
  \ throw against what grows within or it immediately becomes afflicted by a lesser\
  \ version of Xhamen-Dor's seeded infestation. This infestation does not expose the\
  \ victim to Xhamen-Dor's infectious dreams, but it can ultimately result in that\
  \ creature's transformation into one of the seeded. Each time you affect a creature\
  \ with what grows within in this manner, the remaining duration of what grows within\
  \ is reduced by 1 round. If you affect multiple creatures in a round, you choose\
  \ the order in which they must save against the effects of what grows within, and\
  \ reduce the spell's remaining duration by 1 round each time one of them is affected\
  \ by the infestation."
