description: "This spell makes a single bag, chest, sack, or other container look\
  \ and feel empty. The container must be no larger than 1 cubic foot per caster level\
  \ or the spell fails. Anyone peering into or reaching into the container must succeed\
  \ at a Will save or perceive the container as being completely empty. All items\
  \ within the container when the spell was cast are still present, but they can't\
  \ be noticed unless removed from the bag--such as by someone who can perceive them,\
  \ or who upends the container."
