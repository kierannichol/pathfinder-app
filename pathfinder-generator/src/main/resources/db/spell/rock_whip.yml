name: "Rock Whip"
description: "A 15-foot-long lash of crumbling crystal and earth emerges from the\
  \ palm of your hand. This weapon is treated as a nonmagical whip that deals 1d8\
  \ points of bludgeoning damage. You can wield this weapon as a whip as if you were\
  \ proficient with it, and it isn't subject to the disarm or sunder combat maneuver.\
  \ The whip passes through natural unworked stone effortlessly, allowing you to ignore\
  \ cover between you and your target from such sources. Armor and natural armor have\
  \ no effect on the damage dealt by a rock whip (unlike a normal whip), but the whip\
  \ deals no damage to outsiders with the earth subtype. Attacks with a rock whip\
  \ strike with resounding force; you can make a free bull rush combat maneuver against\
  \ any creature you strike with a rock whip, using your caster level in place of\
  \ your base attack bonus and your primary casting ability score modifier (Charisma\
  \ for sorcerers, Intelligence for wizards, and so on) in place of your Strength\
  \ modifier."
