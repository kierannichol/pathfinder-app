description: "When you cast this spell, a spectral force binds a broken weapon together,\
  \ relieving the broken condition for a short time. While under the effects of this\
  \ spell, an item with the broken condition suffers no adverse effects from that\
  \ condition, and is treated as if it is not broken. The object regains no hit points,\
  \ and damage can still destroy the object."
