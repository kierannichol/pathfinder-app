name: "Groundswell"
description: "This spell allows the target to cause the ground to rise up beneath\
  \ him. As a swift action, the target can cause the ground to rise 5 feet, while\
  \ all adjacent squares are treated as steep slopes. The groundswellprecludes flanking\
  \ from creatures standing at lower elevations than the target. If the target moves\
  \ after creating a groundswell, the ground returns to its normal elevation at the\
  \ end of his turn; otherwise, it remains in place until the target moves or uses\
  \ a swift action to return the ground to normal. A groundswellcannot increase elevation\
  \ of the ground beyond 5 feet."
