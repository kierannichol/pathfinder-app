name: "Unwilling Shield"
description: "Like shield other, unwilling shieldcreates a mystic connection between\
  \ you and the target, but unlike shield other, the target shares the wounds that\
  \ you receive. In addition, the link draws upon the target's life force to supplement\
  \ your own defenses. You gain a +1 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. You take\
  \ only half damage from all wounds and attacks (including those dealt by special\
  \ abilities) that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by you is\
  \ taken by the target. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm\
  \ effects, ability damage, level draining, and death effects are not affected. If\
  \ you take a reduction in hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction\
  \ is not split with the target because it is not hit point damage. When the spell\
  \ ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between you and the subject, but\
  \ damage already split is not assigned to you."
