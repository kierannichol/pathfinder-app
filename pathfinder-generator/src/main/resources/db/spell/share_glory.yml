description: "You imbue the targets with a fraction of your mythic nature. They count\
  \ as mythic creatures for the purpose of path abilities, spells, and other effects\
  \ that function differently for mythic creatures. This doesn't grant the targets\
  \ mythic tiers or any uses of mythic power; it merely gives them a greater advantage\
  \ when others use abilities that work differently for mythic creatures. You must\
  \ be at least a 1st-tier mythic character to cast this spell."
