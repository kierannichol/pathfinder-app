description: "This spell transforms water into an alcoholic beverage, typically ale,\
  \ beer, mead, or wine. The alcohol is of middling quality but perfectly drinkable.\
  \ The spell also serves to remove poisons, diseases, minerals, and other toxins\
  \ from the water as it transforms. The more contaminants that exist in the water,\
  \ the darker the ale or the more full-bodied the wine becomes. The beverage's alcohol\
  \ content is not affected by the presence or absence of contaminants."
