description: "You encase the willing subject in a jeweled shell that has the same\
  \ hardness and hit points as 5 inches of iron (hardness 10, hp 150). For 7 days,\
  \ the subject enters a state of suspended animation (as per temporal stasis), during\
  \ which it heals from even the most grievous wounds. Each day, the subject regains\
  \ 5 hit points per Hit Die it has as well as recovering from 2 points of ability\
  \ damage or ability drain from any ability score of its choice. After 7 days, the\
  \ shell crumbles away and the subject emerges, its body's severed limbs, broken\
  \ bones, and ruined organs regrown (as per regenerate)."
