description: "This spell creates a semi-visible psychic manifestation that allows\
  \ a creature to replace a missing body part or parts. This could be as simple as\
  \ a missing finger or toe or as complex as one or more limbs or even a set of wings.\
  \ The creature can use these ghostly appendages exactly as if they were the creature's\
  \ own limbs, including any natural attacks or other special abilities. This includes\
  \ any extraordinary abilities granted by the appendages, but not supernatural ones."
