description: "This variant of planar binding is specifically used to call one of the\
  \ most knowledgeable types of outsiders: the immortal and prophetic caulborn (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Bestiary 3 48). This spell calls a single caulborn into a specially prepared\
  \ trap. The caster of this spell can compel a bound caulborn only to provide information\
  \ (using its Knowledge skills or detect thoughts); attempts to compel the caulborn\
  \ to fight, guard a location, or perform some other task automatically fail."
