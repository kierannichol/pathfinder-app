description: "You cause a sound heard in the target area up to 1 round ago and lasting\
  \ up to 1 round in duration to repeat at a regular interval. The original sound\
  \ need not have come from the area, but it echoes from the target area at its original\
  \ full volume. Any special effects of the sound are not duplicated by this spell.\
  \ If the area is naturally prone to echoes, such as a space surrounded on at least\
  \ two sides by cliffs or high river banks, the spell's range is long. Otherwise,\
  \ the spell's range is close."
