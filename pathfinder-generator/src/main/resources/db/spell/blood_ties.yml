description: "One of the targets of this spell must be a hostage--a bound, pinned,\
  \ or helpless creature within your reach (though the spell doesn't end if the hostage\
  \ later moves beyond your reach). The second target must be a member of the first\
  \ target's family. If neither creature successfully saves against the spell, the\
  \ second target also takes any damage conferred to the hostage, provided both are\
  \ still alive, to a maximum of 10 points of damage per caster level per day (damage\
  \ beyond that necessary to kill the first target does not transfer). This transferred\
  \ damage is typeless and ignores the second creature's damage reduction and resistances.\
  \ If either target succeeds at the saving throw, you can never attempt to exploit\
  \ the connection between these particular two creatures again. The connection between\
  \ your targets weakens when the two are less familiar with one another. Each target\
  \ gains a +2 bonus on its save if the two are distant relations or related by marriage.\
  \ Each target takes a â€“2 penalty on its save if the two targets are parent and child\
  \ or siblings."
