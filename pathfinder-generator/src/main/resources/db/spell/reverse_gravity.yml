name: "Reverse Gravity"
description: "This spell reverses gravity in an area, causing unattached objects and\
  \ creatures in the area to fall upward and reach the top of the area in 1 round.\
  \ If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects\
  \ and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would during a normal downward\
  \ fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything,\
  \ it remains there, oscillating slightly, until the spell ends. At the end of the\
  \ spell duration, affected objects and creatures fall downward."
