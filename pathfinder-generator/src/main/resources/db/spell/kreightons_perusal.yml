description: "You gain a brief but incomplete understanding of one book's contents,\
  \ equivalent to having skimmed its pages for 1 hour. This insight is not sufficient\
  \ to translate unknown languages, decipher codes, or memorize text, but it does\
  \ allow the caster to learn what topics the book discusses-- invaluable to a Pathfinder\
  \ who must make a snap decision when performing research or deciding whether or\
  \ not to abscond with a volume. In addition, you instantly benefit from any bonuses\
  \ or effects the book would normally grant to anyone who reads it for 1 hour (such\
  \ as the bonuses gained from reading volumes of the Pathfinder Chronicles; see pages\
  \ 26â€“27)."
