description: "You transform one or more improvised weapons into equivalent simple\
  \ or martial weapons. The bearer of such a weapon can wield it with proficiency\
  \ (no penalty for using an improvised weapon or not having the required proficiency).\
  \ This does not alter the weapon's shape or appearance in any way. For example,\
  \ if cast on a chair leg, butter knife, and pitchfork, the weapons function as a\
  \ club, dagger, and trident, respectively, and anyone who wields them does so without\
  \ a nonproficiency penalty, but the weapons look no different than they were before\
  \ the spell."
