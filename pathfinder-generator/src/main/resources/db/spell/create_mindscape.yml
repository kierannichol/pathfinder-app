name: "Create Mindscape"
description: "You create an immersive mindscape (see page 235) that the minds of both\
  \ you and another creature enter together. You choose whether the mindscape is overt\
  \ or veiled, and whether it's harmless or harmful. You can choose any shape and\
  \ size trait, as well as any gravity trait (though you can't make it so the gravity\
  \ is so strong it harms creatures within). The mindscape has normal time, no alignment\
  \ traits, and normal magic."
