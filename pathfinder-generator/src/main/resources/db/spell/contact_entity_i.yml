description: "You send out a magical message to any eldritch entities of a particular\
  \ kind within a 100-mile radius, which can be delivered to up to 20 such creatures,\
  \ starting with the nearest creatures until the limit has been met. This spell can't\
  \ contact creatures with more than 6 Hit Dice. You can't send a specific message,\
  \ but this spell (and all similar contact entity spells) can be characterized as\
  \ an open invitation to make contact and establish communication. If there is an\
  \ appropriate entity within range, the spell succeeds automatically. You don't know\
  \ whether the message was received, nor any specific details about what creatures\
  \ received it or how many. Creatures that receive the message know the location\
  \ and distance from where the spell was cast. Because this spell doesn't call or\
  \ summon the target, the target must have its own way to reach the place where the\
  \ spell was cast."
