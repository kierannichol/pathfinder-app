description: "You invest a target with cursed elemental energy, causing nearby bodies\
  \ of water to roil when the target draw nears and tendrils of water to drag it deeper\
  \ under the waves. The target takes a â€“10 penalty on Swim checks and automatically\
  \ sinks 15 feet per round when in any body of liquid. The creature does not sink\
  \ if standing upon a solid surface capable of supporting its weight, even if it\
  \ is submerged."
