description: "You subtly alter both the target's aura and subtle cues in its body\
  \ language, tone of voice, and word choice, which makes everything that the target\
  \ says seem to be a lie. Every statement that the target makes appears to be a lie\
  \ under both magical scrutiny (such as discern lies) and mundane scrutiny (such\
  \ as using the Sense Motive skill). Someone who closely scrutinizes the target can\
  \ determine when it is actually telling the truth with a successful Sense Motive\
  \ check (DC = 15 + your caster level)."
