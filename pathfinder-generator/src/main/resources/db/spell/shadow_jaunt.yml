description: "You instantly travel between shadows to a point within range, though\
  \ line of sight is not necessary. You leave a shadowy image of yourself in your\
  \ former location and are wrapped in shadow at your destination; you can attempt\
  \ a Stealth check as a free action to hide in your new location. Creatures that\
  \ fail opposed Perception checks typically aren't aware that you are no longer at\
  \ your former location unless they are familiar with this spell and identify the\
  \ effects. Any attack on your former location causes the shadows to disperse, allowing\
  \ any creature that can see your former location to immediately notice your disappearance.\
  \ In addition, for 1 round, the envelope of shadow around you grants you concealment\
  \ (20% miss chance). This spell doesn't function if there are no shadows within\
  \ 5 feet of your starting location, and you can't travel through your own shadow.\
  \ If you choose a destination that has no shadows, you appear from the shadow closest\
  \ to your destination that's within the spell's range (this could be your starting\
  \ location if there are no other shadows within the spell's range)."
