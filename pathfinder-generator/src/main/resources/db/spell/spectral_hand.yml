name: "Spectral Hand"
description: "A ghostly hand shaped from your life force materializes and moves as\
  \ you desire, allowing you to deliver low-level, touch range spells at a distance.\
  \ On casting the spell, you lose 1d4 hit points that return when the spell ends\
  \ (even if it is dispelled), but not if the hand is destroyed. (The hit points can\
  \ be healed as normal.) For as long as the spell lasts, any touch range spell of\
  \ 4th level or lower that you cast can be delivered by the spectral hand. The spell\
  \ gives you a +2 bonus on your melee touch attack roll, and attacking with the hand\
  \ counts normally as an attack. The hand always strikes from your direction. The\
  \ hand cannot flank targets like a creature can. After it delivers a spell, or if\
  \ it goes beyond the spell range or goes out of your sight, the hand returns to\
  \ you and hovers."
