description: "All creatures within the area gain the effects of a protection from\
  \ evil spell, and evil summoned creatures cannot enter the area either. Creatures\
  \ in the area, or who later enter the area, receive only one attempt to suppress\
  \ effects that are controlling them. If successful, such effects are suppressed\
  \ as long as they remain in the area. Creatures that leave the area and come back\
  \ are not protected. You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to\
  \ keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil), but the deflection\
  \ and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless\
  \ of enemies' spell resistance."
