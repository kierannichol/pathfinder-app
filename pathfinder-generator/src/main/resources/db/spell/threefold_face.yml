name: "Threefold Face"
description: "You grow two additional faces set equidistantly around your head, each\
  \ embodying a different aspect of your personality that you choose (such as kindliness,\
  \ joy, or wrath). You gain all-around vision and can't be flanked. Effects that\
  \ would blind you, deafen you, block your mouth, or otherwise affect your face,\
  \ including beneficial effects that grant you exceptional vision, only affect a\
  \ single face (for example, it would take three castings of blindness/ deafness\
  \ to blind you). You lose all-around vision if even a single face becomes blind.\
  \ This spell doesn't grant you additional magic item slots or additional heads.\
  \ When threefold face ends, you gain all the conditions from all three faces, for\
  \ good or ill."
