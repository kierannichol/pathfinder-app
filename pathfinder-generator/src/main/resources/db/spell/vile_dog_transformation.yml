name: "Vile Dog Transformation"
description: "You transform one or more dogs into evil, monstrous creatures. Each\
  \ dog can attempt a Will save to negate the transformation, but if the dog trusts\
  \ you (it has been trained by you for a purpose, or has been in your care for at\
  \ least 30 days and generally treated well), it takes a â€“4 penalty on this saving\
  \ throw. Each transformed dog has the same stats as a hell hound (Bestiary 173)\
  \ except that it doesn't have fire immunity and cold vulnerability and instead has\
  \ acid, cold, and fire resistance 5. Additionally, each transformed dog deals an\
  \ extra 1d6 points of acid damage with its bite attack (instead of fire damage),\
  \ and its breath weapon is replaced with a vaporous cloud that spreads out in front\
  \ of the creature in a 10-foot cone, dealing 2d4 points of acid damage. The creature\
  \ can't understand Infernal but understands any languages you know. The dog is normally\
  \ neutral evil, but is chaotic evil if you are chaotic or lawful evil if you are\
  \ lawful."
