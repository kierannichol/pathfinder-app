name: "Awaken the Devoured"
description: "This spell is often used by conjurers as a method to torment daemons\
  \ and force compliance, for it awakens the broken, anguished memories of the countless\
  \ souls that the target daemons have consumed. All daemons targeted by awaken the\
  \ devoured must be within 30 feet of each other. The fragmented memories haunt and\
  \ afflict the daemons, dealing 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d8)\
  \ and making the daemons confused for 1 round per level. A daemon that succeeds\
  \ at a Will save halves the damage and negates the confusion effect."
