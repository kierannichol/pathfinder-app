description: "You create a mental block in the target's mind, impeding the flow of\
  \ his mental spellcasting process and forcing him to incorporate a thought component\
  \ into any spell or spell-like ability he uses. This is in addition to any other\
  \ components the spell already requires, and doesn't replace the verbal component.\
  \ Spell-like abilities require this thought component, even though they normally\
  \ don't need spell components."
