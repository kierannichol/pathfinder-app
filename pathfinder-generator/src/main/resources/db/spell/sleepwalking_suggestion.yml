name: "Sleepwalking Suggestion"
description: "You compel the target creature to rise from its sleep as if sleepwalking\
  \ and perform a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The spell takes\
  \ effect immediately if the target is already asleep, or as soon as the target falls\
  \ asleep if it is conscious. You can specify that the creature should wait before\
  \ taking action when you give your instructions if you so choose. A sleeping creature\
  \ doesn't get a save against this spell. The suggested activity must not cause the\
  \ target to directly harm itself or others, but it doesn't need to be reasonable.\
  \ For example, you could instruct the target to unlock doors and windows or poison\
  \ its ally's rations, but not jump off a roof or perform a coup de grace action\
  \ against a sleeping ally. Instructions that cause direct harm prompt the target\
  \ to awaken just prior to performing the action and the target experiences a vague\
  \ memory of what it was supposed to do."
