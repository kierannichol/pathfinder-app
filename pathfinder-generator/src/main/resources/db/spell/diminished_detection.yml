name: "Diminished Detection"
description: "You can avoid being detected when you are on the edges of some divination\
  \ spells' ranges. Whenever you would normally be within the area of effect of a\
  \ detection spell (such as detect magic, detect evil, or detect undead), the area\
  \ of effect is reduced by half for the purposes of the spell's caster detecting\
  \ you or your possessions. The caster of the detect spell is unaware of this reduction\
  \ in her spell's range; she simply does not detect you."
