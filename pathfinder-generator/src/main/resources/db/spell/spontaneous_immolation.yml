description: "You point your finger at a creature, causing it to spontaneously burst\
  \ into flame. The target takes 3d6 points of fire damage and catches on fire. A\
  \ successful Fortitude save reduces this damage by half and prevents the target\
  \ from catching on fire. Each round on your turn, a burning target can attempt a\
  \ new save to extinguish the flames (DC equal to the DC of the spell); otherwise\
  \ it takes another 1d6 fire damage."
