  \ or drinking from the River Styx and a +4 profane bonus on saves against effects\
  \ that alter or suppress memory (such as modify memory or mindwipe). This does not\
  \ grant the target the ability to breathe water, nor does it grant any protection\
  \ against creatures or mundane hazards such as rapids. The spell has no power to\
  \ restore memory to a creature already suffering from an existing fugue or amnesia\
  \ state."
