description: "Upon casting this spell, you permanently rearrange and resize the rooms\
  \ in a building you constructed as a downtime activity (see page 84 of Ultimate\
  \ Campaign). You may reorganize and remap the building however you please, as if\
  \ each room had just been constructed and is being positioned for the first time.\
  \ You cannot make any changes to a building that changes how much a room would cost\
  \ to create or that alters the benefits a room provides. The structure also must\
  \ remain in the same general position within the district. If you don't wholly own\
  \ the structure, all of the structure's owners must consent to the changes being\
  \ made before the spell is cast; otherwise, it fails immediately."
