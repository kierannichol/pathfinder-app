description: "Your spell slowly begins to eat away at the defenses of your target.\
  \ If the target fails its saving throw, it loses 1 point from any damage reduction\
  \ and natural armor bonus it may have. If the initial save was not successful, the\
  \ target may attempt a new saving throw each round for the duration of the spell\
  \ or continue to suffer cumulative losses. If the first save fails but a subsequent\
  \ save succeeds, the eroding effects stop at that point, though any of the penalties\
  \ already accrued remain until the spell expires. At the end of the spell's duration,\
  \ the target's damage reduction and natural armor bonus immediately return to normal."
