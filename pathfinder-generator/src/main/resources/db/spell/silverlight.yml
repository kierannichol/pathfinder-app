name: "Silverlight"
description: "As daylight, except the object touched sheds bright silvery light in\
  \ a 20-foot radius. In addition to providing illumination, the area of bright light\
  \ is painful to creatures that are susceptible to alchemical silver. A creature\
  \ with DR/silver that begins its turn within the light of this spell is automatically\
  \ dazzled and becomes sickened unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save. These effects\
  \ disappear 1 round after the target leaves the silverlight. A creature that leaves\
  \ the area and then returns must make a new saving throw. This spell provides dim\
  \ light up to 40 feet away, but only creatures within 20 feet are subject to the\
  \ above e!ects."
