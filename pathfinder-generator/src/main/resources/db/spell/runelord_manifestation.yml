    Effect: "The ritual allows the primary caster to observe an area at any distance,\
      \ as per scrying, except that the sensor created for this scrying effect is\
      \ an enormous visible image of the primary caster in the air above the area\
      \ (even if the area viewed is indoors or underground) that cannot be dispelled.\
      \ This image can take any form that the primary caster desires, such as an exact\
      \ replica or a shape formed from shadows or clouds, but the image is always\
      \ recognizable as the primary caster. The primary caster can speak to any creatures\
      \ in the area with a loud voice that emanates from the image. The following\
      \ spells function reliably through the sensor: detect chaos, detect evil, detect\
      \ good, detect law, detect magic, detect thoughts, message, read magic, tongues,\
      \ and true seeing. Any other spell requires a successful concentration check\
      \ to function through the image (DC = 20 + double the level of the spell); on\
      \ a failure, the spell is lost."
