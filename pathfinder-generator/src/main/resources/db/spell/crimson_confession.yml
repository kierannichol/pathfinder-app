description: "You ward an object or an area with your personal rune or mark. You can\
  \ choose for the writing to be visible or invisible, and it doesn't harm the material\
  \ upon which it is placed. A detect magic spell causes an invisible mark to glow\
  \ and be visible. If any creature other than you touches the warded object or area\
  \ and fails a Fortitude save, its skin turns bright red for 1 hour per level. This\
  \ coloring cannot be washed away, but it can be dispelled."
