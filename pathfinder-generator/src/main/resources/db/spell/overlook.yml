name: "Overlook"
description: "You enhance your natural ability to seem small and unimportant, causing\
  \ those around you to overlook you. You gain a +20 bonus on Stealth checks, which\
  \ doesn't stack with bonuses from effects that actually make you sneakier, such\
  \ as invisibility or respectful quiet (see below); you do not need cover or concealment\
  \ to hide; and you can hide while you are being observed. If a creature fails to\
  \ notice you because of this spell, that creature can still remember seeing a halfling\
  \ pass by, but attach no importance to the memory. You do not gain these benefits\
  \ against creatures that are immune to compulsions or mind-affecting effects, and\
  \ spell resistance applies. If you take an actively aggressive or extremely conspicuous\
  \ action, creatures automatically notice you, and you gain no further benefits against\
  \ those creatures for the remainder of the spell's duration."
