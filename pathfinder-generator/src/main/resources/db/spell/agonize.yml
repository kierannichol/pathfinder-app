description: "You afflict a creature you have conjured via planar ally(or a similar\
  \ spell) with bolts of vicious energy. These foul energies inflict terrible pain\
  \ upon the conjured creature, torturing it to make it more pliant to your will.\
  \ The targeted creature must make a Fortitude save or take a –1 penalty for every\
  \ 2 levels you possess (maximum –10) on all saves and checks made against you for\
  \ the next hour. In addition, creatures that demand payment for their services reduce\
  \ the payment by 20% for every 4 levels you possess (maximum 60% reduction). However,\
  \ beings tortured by this spell quickly come to resent you, making them more likely\
  \ to try to pervert your orders to malicious ends or try to seek retribution after\
  \ their release. This spell has no effect on creatures that are immune to nonlethal\
  \ damage."
