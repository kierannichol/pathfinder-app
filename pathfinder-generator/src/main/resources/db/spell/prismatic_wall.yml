name: "Prismatic Wall"
description: "Prismatic wall creates a vertical, opaque wall--a shimmering, multicolored\
  \ plane of light that protects you from all forms of attack. The wall flashes with\
  \ seven colors, each of which has a distinct power and purpose. The wall is immobile,\
  \ and you can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. Any other creature\
  \ with less than 8 HD that is within 20 feet of the wall is blinded by the colors\
  \ for 2d4 rounds if it looks at the wall."
