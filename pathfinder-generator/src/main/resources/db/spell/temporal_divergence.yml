name: "Temporal Divergence"
description: "This spell allows you to witness two divergent decisions and choose\
  \ which to pursue. Upon completing this spell, you must immediately choose two other\
  \ different spells that you could cast at that moment and that each have a casting\
  \ time of 1 standard action; these spells take effect simultaneously, and you must\
  \ track all resulting effects, areas of effect, saving throws, and other outcomes\
  \ separately as if each had been cast normally and the other spell had never happened.\
  \ Once you've seen how each spell resolves, you must choose which version of reality\
  \ occurred, expending the standard action, prepared spell, and material components\
  \ as necessary. The other spell's results are ignored and do not require an action\
  \ or expend the prepared spell, spell slot, or material components. If the targets\
  \ of the spell you did not choose expended any resources or effects to resist your\
  \ spell, those resources or effects are also not expended. If you cast this spell\
  \ and do not or cannot immediately follow the instructions described above, this\
  \ spell has no effect."
