description: "You create a phantom instrument, a glowing construct of magic in the\
  \ form of a portable musical instrument of your choice. The instrument floats beside\
  \ you, moving as you move (even if you teleport). It cannot be damaged, but can\
  \ be dispelled. The instrument plays as you direct, and as long as it plays, you\
  \ do not have to expend rounds of bardic performance from your daily allotment to\
  \ maintain an effect. Activating a bardic performance or switching to a new effect\
  \ still costs a round of your overall bardic performances per day."
