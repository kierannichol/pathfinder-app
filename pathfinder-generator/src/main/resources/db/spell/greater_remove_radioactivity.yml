name: "Greater Remove Radioactivity"
description: "This spell functions like remove radioactivity, save that it cures all\
  \ ability damage and drain due to radioactivity that the target has taken. In addition,\
  \ you can deplete a radioactive object as well, although because you must touch\
  \ the object to affect it, you expose yourself to at least 1 round of contact with\
  \ the object's radiation. You must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 5 + the\
  \ Fortitude DC associated with the radiation effect) in order to deplete the object.\
  \ If you are successful, the object no longer emits radiation. In the case of a\
  \ nuclear reactor or atomic warhead, this permanently renders the reactor or warhead\
  \ inert and harmless."
