description: "You cause the target to sound as if it is elsewhere within range, including\
  \ its movements, speech, and all other sounds. As long as you concentrate, you can\
  \ cause the sound's apparent location to change as you see fit within range from\
  \ your current location. Once you cease concentrating, the sound moves so that it\
  \ remains the same relative distance and direction from the target. This spell can\
  \ fool any sound-based blindsense or blindsight (including echolocation), but it\
  \ can't fool other forms of detection such as other forms of blindsense or blindsight,\
  \ lifesense, normal vision, and tremorsense. The target receives a saving throw\
  \ against the effect if it doesn't wish for you to shift its sound, and any creature\
  \ that interacts with the illusion receives a Will save to disbelieve the glamer."
