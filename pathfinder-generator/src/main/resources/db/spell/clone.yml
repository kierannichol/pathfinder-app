description: "This spell makes an inert duplicate of a creature. If the original individual\
  \ has been slain, its soul immediately transfers to the clone, creating a replacement\
  \ (provided that the soul is free and willing to return). The original's physical\
  \ remains, should they still exist, become inert and cannot thereafter be restored\
  \ to life. If the original creature has reached the end of its natural life span\
  \ (that is, it has died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails."
