    Effect: "This powerful ritual attempts to shunt the target's soul to a plane determined\
      \ during the preparation for the ritual. A key component of the ritual is a\
      \ forked rod, just like that used for a plane shift spell. Any other device\
      \ suitable for use as a focus component for plane shift is also suitable for\
      \ use with this ritual. The casters form a circle around the target, each touching\
      \ the shoulder of the caster to his left to form a ring representing the multiverse\
      \ as a whole. The primary caster stands inside this ring with the target, holding\
      \ the diamond in one hand and the forked rod in the other. As the casters chant,\
      \ the primary caster walks around the target in a circle. At the conclusion\
      \ of the ritual, the primary caster touches the forked rod to the black diamond,\
      \ which shatters. If the ritual is performed successfully, the target's soul\
      \ is immediately sent to the designated plane and manifests there as a petitioner\
      \ or another appropriate outsider, just as if the designated plane were the\
      \ soul's appropriate reward and regardless of the soul's actual alignment or\
      \ outlook. If the target is a helpless creature, it is slain by this effect\
      \ (no save). If the target is a soul trapped inside an object, the object is\
      \ emptied when the soul departs to its designated destination."
