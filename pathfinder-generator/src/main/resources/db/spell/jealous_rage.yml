name: "Jealous Rage"
description: "You fill the target with a sense of entitled self-importance, making\
  \ the subject unable to bear the indignity of another creature getting something\
  \ that it doesn't have. Whenever an ally of the target receives a harmless spell\
  \ or spell-like ability, beneficial supernatural effect, or assisting action (including\
  \ the aid another action, first aid using the Heal skill, etc.) that doesn't also\
  \ include the target, the target is driven into a murderous rage against either\
  \ the producer of that effect or the nearest creature that benefited from that effect,\
  \ whichever is closer. The target must attack that creature on its next turn. Any\
  \ ability that deals lethal damage is considered an attack for this purpose. Once\
  \ the target deals lethal damage to the object of his jealous rage, the compulsion\
  \ to attack that creature ends."
