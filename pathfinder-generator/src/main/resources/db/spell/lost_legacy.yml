description: "You inflict a powerful curse on a touched creature that causes others\
  \ to quickly forget positive aspects of their interactions with the target. The\
  \ target cannot attempt a Diplomacy (or wild empathy or similar ability) check to\
  \ improve the attitude of other creatures. Any creature that normally has an attitude\
  \ of friendly or helpful toward the target must succeed at a Will save at the spell's\
  \ normal saving throw DC each time it interacts with the target, or its attitude\
  \ becomes indifferent. Once this curse is removed, creatures coming back into contact\
  \ with the target regain their pleasant memories of it. If their attitudes toward\
  \ the target have not been reduced from indifferent, their original attitudes are\
  \ restored."
