description: "By rearranging the threads of fate, you disrupt fortunate outcomes for\
  \ other creatures. A creature affected by this spell is unable to benefit from effects\
  \ that grant the ability to roll multiple times and take the higher result (like\
  \ the swashbuckler's charmed life ability) or to choose the die result in lieu of\
  \ rolling (like the wizard's prescience school power or the cyclops's flash of insight\
  \ ability). This doesn't affect abilities that force a creature to take the lower\
  \ of two rolls, such as ill omen or a pugwampi's unluck aura (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary\
  \ 2 144). A cyclops can't use its flash of insight ability to save against this\
  \ spell."
