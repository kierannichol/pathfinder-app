description: "You create a magical emanation that interferes with all figments and\
  \ glamers within it, giving creatures a +4 bonus on saving throws to recognize them\
  \ as illusions. The emanation negates concealment less than total concealment within\
  \ the area. Perception checks to notice creatures or objects within the area gain\
  \ a bonus equal to half your caster level (maximum +10). The spell is stationary\
  \ if cast on a point in space. It is mobile if centered on a creature or object,\
  \ though creatures or attended objects can negate the spell with a saving throw\
  \ or spell resistance."
