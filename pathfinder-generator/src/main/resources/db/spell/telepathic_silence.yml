description: "Creatures within the area cannot send or receive telepathic messages,\
  \ and anyone in the area casting a spell with a thought component must succeed at\
  \ a concentration check (DC = 20 + twice the spell's level; this includes the increased\
  \ concentration DC for casting spells with a thought component) or lose the spell.\
  \ Furthermore, the thoughts of creatures within the area cannot be detected, located,\
  \ or read with thoughtsense, detect thoughts, or similar effects. Telepathic silence\
  \ does not hinder spells that target a creature's mind or that do not rely on communication,\
  \ such as mind thrustOA."
