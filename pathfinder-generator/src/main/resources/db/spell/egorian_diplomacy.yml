name: "Egorian Diplomacy"
description: "As part of casting this spell, you can attempt a single Intimidate skill\
  \ check to make a target act friendly toward you. If you succeed, the target assists\
  \ you normally, but Egorian diplomacy clouds the memory of any threats or pressure\
  \ you applied. The target remembers assisting you, but can't remember why, and its\
  \ attitude toward you doesn't worsen as a result of being intimidated."
