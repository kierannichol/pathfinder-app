description: "You ward all creatures and objects in the area from ranged weapons.\
  \ The spell's area of effect is often a sphere, although you can shape it to be\
  \ smaller than the maximum area or to exclude certain adjacent areas or objects\
  \ (for example, if you are warding a specific structure, or if you are roughly warding\
  \ the front lines of a battlefield). This spell's area is also up to 40 feet in\
  \ height, so flying creatures benefit as long as they are in this area of effect."
