description: "While under the effect of this spell, you're immune to any damaging\
  \ area spells you cast. You can dismiss this spell as an immediate action when you\
  \ are caught within the area of someone else's damaging area spell; if you do, you're\
  \ immune to that particular casting of that spell as well. If you have the blood\
  \ casting class feature, you can cast this spell as a swift action instead of a\
  \ standard action while you're in a bloodrage."
