description: "You animate one of the target's fetid organs so that it leads you to\
  \ the undead creature's most recent controller or the cause of the creature's undeath.\
  \ The organ (typically the heart, the brain, or an eyeball) floats in front of you\
  \ at chest level and slowly leads you to the undead creature's most recent controller\
  \ at a rate of 30 feet per round, always staying within your range of vision. If\
  \ the creature from which the organ originated had no controller, but rather was\
  \ created deliberately by another creature, the organ instead leads you to that\
  \ creator. If the undead was animated by an effect or event at a particular location,\
  \ the organ leads you to that location. If the creature was animated by none of\
  \ the methods above, if it was selfcreated, or if the creature's most recent controller\
  \ no longer exists, the spell fails. Once the organ is within 10 feet of its intended\
  \ destination, the spell ends, and the organ falls to the ground."
