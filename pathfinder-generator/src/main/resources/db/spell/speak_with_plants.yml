name: "Speak with Plants"
description: "You can communicate with normal plants and plant creatures, and can\
  \ ask questions of and receive answers from them. A normal plant's sense of its\
  \ surroundings is limited, so it won't be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions\
  \ of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity.\
  \ The spell doesn't make plant creatures any more friendly or cooperative than normal.\
  \ Furthermore, wary and cunning plant creatures are likely to be terse and evasive,\
  \ while the more stupid ones may make inane comments. If a plant creature is friendly,\
  \ it may do some favor or service for you."
