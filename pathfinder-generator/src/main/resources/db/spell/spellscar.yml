description: "This potent spell invokes the same sort of magical devastation that\
  \ created the Mana Wastes so long ago-- albeit on a much more localized (and thankfully\
  \ temporary) scale. Within the area you choose to affect with spellscar, the terrain\
  \ takes on a strange pale hue, as if colors were muted. Periodically, ripples of\
  \ vibrant color wriggle through the terrain. Within this area, any spell, spell-like\
  \ ability, or magic item activation automatically triggers a primal magic event--a\
  \ spellcaster can avoid triggering such an event by making a concentration check\
  \ (DC 15 + twice the spell's level), but non-spellcasters who activate magic items\
  \ have no such option."
