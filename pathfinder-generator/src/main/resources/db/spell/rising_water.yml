description: "You conjure a cylinder of calm water on an area of solid ground or on\
  \ top of a body of water. The water forms quickly but displaces only air; it doesn't\
  \ push away objects or creatures, though anything in the area when the spell is\
  \ cast is submerged. Unconscious air-breathing creatures caught in the area immediately\
  \ begin to drown, but other air-breathing creatures can hold their breath while\
  \ in the cylinder. Movement through the cylinder at normal speed requires a successful\
  \ DC 10 Swim check (otherwise, creatures move at one-quarter speed). If conjured\
  \ in an area with insufficient room for the entire cylinder, the cylinder attains\
  \ its maximum possible size. It retains its shape in defiance of gravity for the\
  \ spell's duration, and any creature can enter or exit the cylinder's sides as easily\
  \ as stepping into or out of a pool of ordinary water. The water disappears at the\
  \ end of the spell's duration, so creatures swimming in the water immediately fall\
  \ to the ground."
