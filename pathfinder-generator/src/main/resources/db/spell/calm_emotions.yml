name: "Calm Emotions"
description: "This spell calms agitated creatures. You have no control over the affected\
  \ creatures, but calm emotions can stop raging creatures from fighting or joyous\
  \ ones from reveling. Creatures so affected cannot take violent actions (although\
  \ they can defend themselves) or do anything destructive. Any aggressive action\
  \ against or damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all\
  \ calmed creatures."
