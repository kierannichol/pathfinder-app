name: "Abjuring Step"
description: "This spell creates a subtle and complicated force effect that is most\
  \ effective when used by a still or slow-moving spellcaster or formula user. While\
  \ you are subject to this spell, you can take two 5-foot steps each round and still\
  \ cast spells and use spell-like abilities without provoke attacks of opportunity.\
  \ This spell automatically discharges as soon as you make an attack, cast a harmful\
  \ spell against another creature, or move more than 5 feet with a single move action.\
  \ If the action that discharges the spell also provokes attacks of opportunity,\
  \ that action still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal."
