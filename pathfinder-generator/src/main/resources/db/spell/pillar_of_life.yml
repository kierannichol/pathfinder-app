description: "You conjure a pillar of positive energy in a single 5-foot square within\
  \ range that radiates light as if it were a sunrod. Living creatures adjacent to\
  \ the pillar can spend a standard action to touch the pillar and heal 2d8 points\
  \ of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). Creatures can move into the\
  \ square containing the pillar, but if an undead creature moves into the pillar\
  \ it takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). Undead creatures\
  \ vulnerable to bright light take 1d8 points if damage per caster level (maximum\
  \ 10d8). A creature cannot benefit or suffer more than once from a single casting\
  \ of this spell."
