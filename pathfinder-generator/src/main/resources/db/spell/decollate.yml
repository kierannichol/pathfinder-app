description: "A thin red line circles the target's neck. The target's head becomes\
  \ detachable so long as she removes it willingly. While the target's head is detached,\
  \ she gains DR 2/-- and immunity to decapitation effects and other effects that\
  \ require their target to have a head or a particular facial feature. The target\
  \ is blind so long as she has no head, but she gains blindsense to a distance of\
  \ 15 feet. The target hears normally even without its head."
