name: "Peerless Integrity"
description: "Peerless integrity conceals the alignment of creatures from divination\
  \ magic. All creatures within the spell's area, including you, appear to have lawful\
  \ good auras for the purposes of divination spells and effects that reveal alignments\
  \ (such as detect law and see alignmentUC), instead of their actual alignments.\
  \ If the caster of such divination magic succeeds at a Will save, the caster recognizes\
  \ whether the readings are true or false. Any creature under the effects of this\
  \ spell gains a +2 circumstance modifier on Bluff and Diplomacy checks."
