name: "Shield Of Shards"
description: "This defensive spell must be cast on a shield you are currently wielding,\
  \ and fractures the shield into two shards, plus one additional shard per 2 caster\
  \ levels (to a maximum of 12 shards at 20th level). While shield of shards is active,\
  \ you lose your shield's bonus to AC as its broken pieces orbit you. On your turn,\
  \ you can direct the shards to attack an adjacent opponent as a move action. The\
  \ shards' attack bonus is equal to your caster level + the modifier for the ability\
  \ score that determines your spell save DCs. The shards deal an amount of slashing\
  \ and piercing damage equal to 1d4 points + 1 point per shard beyond the first,\
  \ and have a threat range of 19â€“20. They are considered magic weapons for the purpose\
  \ of bypassing damage reduction. Additionally, if your shield is made from a special\
  \ material (such as adamantine), the shards penetrate damage reduction and hardness\
  \ as if they were weapons made from the same material."
