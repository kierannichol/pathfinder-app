description: "This spell functions like arcane eye, except as noted above. Upon casting\
  \ this spell, you fall asleep for its duration, creating an invisible magic sensor\
  \ (called a dreamscryer) that is the exact size and shape of your body, is recognizable\
  \ as you, and cannot pass through spaces that your body cannot enter. Unlike the\
  \ invisible sensor created by arcane eye, children of any race (no older than the\
  \ human equivalent of 10) and animals can see your dreamscryer. Sleeping creatures\
  \ can sense its presence and might incorporate your image into their dreams. Force\
  \ effects and abjuration spells that ward out creatures (such as magic circle against\
  \ evil) are effective barriers against a dreamscryer (regardless of your creature\
  \ type, alignment, or other specifics). If you dismiss the spell or the dreamscryer\
  \ is dispelled or destroyed, you awaken."
