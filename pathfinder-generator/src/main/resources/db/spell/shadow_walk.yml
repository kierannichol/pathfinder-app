name: "Shadow Walk"
description: "To use the shadow walk spell, you must be in an area of dim light. You\
  \ and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff\
  \ to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect\
  \ is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature\
  \ along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other."
