name: "Flame Strike"
description: "A flame strike evokes a vertical column of divine fire. The spell deals\
  \ 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Half the damage is fire\
  \ damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore\
  \ not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks."
