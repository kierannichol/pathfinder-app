name: "Speak with Plane"
description: "You tap into the awareness and consciousness of a plane with a sentient\
  \ structure (Planar Adventures 60), allowing it to answer questions. A tangible\
  \ manifestation of the plane (such as the ground) must be within the spell's range\
  \ upon casting. You can ask the sentient plane one question per 2 caster levels.\
  \ If the plane's alignment is at least one step away from yours, the plane can attempt\
  \ a Will save to resist the spell. A plane typically has a +20 bonus on Will saves,\
  \ and a demiplane typically has a +15 bonus on Will saves. A plane's traits can\
  \ further affect these bonuses: a mildly aligned plane receives a +2 bonus, and\
  \ a strongly aligned plane or a plane with the wild magic trait receives a +4 bonus\
  \ on its save."
