name: "Greater Neutralize Poison"
description: "This spell functions as neutralize poison, except as noted here. You\
  \ automatically succeed at all caster level checks to neutralize any poisons affecting\
  \ the target creature. The spell also reverses all instantaneous or permanent effects\
  \ caused by poisons, such as temporary ability damage or permanent ability drain\
  \ (it does not heal ability drain caused by anything other than poison, however).\
  \ If you use the spell to neutralize the poison in a poisonous creature or object,\
  \ the duration is 1 hour per level rather than 10 minutes per level. If the spell\
  \ is cast on a creature, the creature can negate the effect by succeeding at a Will\
  \ saving throw."
