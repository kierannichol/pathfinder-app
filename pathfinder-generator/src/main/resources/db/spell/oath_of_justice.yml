name: "Oath of Justice"
description: "This spell seals a solemn vow between two creatures. When this spell\
  \ is cast, the targets must clasp hands and swear their oath in Kols's name. The\
  \ spell functions like mark of justice, except as noted above and rather than being\
  \ cursed, the oath-breaker gains a mark on the face indicating to all dwarves who\
  \ see it that the target has broken a sacred oath, which gives the oath-breaker\
  \ a â€“4 penalty to influence dwarves. The mark can be removed as described in the\
  \ mark of justice spell, or the other target can forgive the oathbreaker, which\
  \ causes the mark to vanish."
