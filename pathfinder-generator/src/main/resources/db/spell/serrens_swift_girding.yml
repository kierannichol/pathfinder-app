description: "With a sweep of your hand, you select a number of targets and the same\
  \ number of suits of armor. The targets of this spell are immediately clad in the\
  \ armor that you choose. The subjects of the spell must be capable of wearing the\
  \ chosen armor, cannot be wearing other armor, and must be able to properly fit\
  \ into the chosen armor. The chosen armor must be empty and cannot be currently\
  \ worn by another creature (thus you cannot move armor from one wearer to another\
  \ with this spell). Creatures armored with this spell are considered to have donned\
  \ the armor properly."
