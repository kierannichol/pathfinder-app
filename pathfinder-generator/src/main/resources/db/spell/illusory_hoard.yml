name: "Illusory Hoard"
description: "The spell forces the target to believe that nothing in its hoard is\
  \ missing or has been disturbed. This spell fools all the senses, convincing the\
  \ target that its hoard feels and behaves as it should. Only if the target tries\
  \ to use an item from this illusory hoard for some other purpose does it receive\
  \ another saving throw to disbelieve the effects of the spell (a wizard trying to\
  \ use an illusory wand or a dragon trying to unlock a door with an illusory key).\
  \ For the purposes of this spell, a hoard is any amount of treasure that is too\
  \ big to be carried by the treasure's owner without magical tools such as bags of\
  \ holding or portable holes, such as a dragon's hoard, a king's treasury, a merchant's\
  \ strongbox, or a thief's hidden cache."
