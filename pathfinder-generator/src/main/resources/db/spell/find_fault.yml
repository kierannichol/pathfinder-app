description: "You instantly learn many of the target's weaknesses, as if you had made\
  \ an appropriate Knowledge skill check with a result equal to 20 + your caster level.\
  \ Additionally, your first melee or ranged attack roll against the creature before\
  \ the end of your next turn gains a +5 insight bonus. If the creature is polymorphed,\
  \ disguised, or hidden by an illusion and you are not aware of it's true form, this\
  \ spell fails as if the target has spell resistance you failed to penetrate (the\
  \ GM may have you attempt a caster level check to conceal the true reason for the\
  \ spell's failure)."
