description: "You use material from the Shadow Plane to cast a quasi-real, illusory\
  \ version of a psychic, sorcerer, or wizard enchantment spell of 2nd level or lower.\
  \ Spells that deal damage or have other effects work as normal unless the affected\
  \ creature succeeds at a Will save. If the disbelieved enchantment spell has a damaging\
  \ effect, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely\
  \ to occur. If recognized as a shadow enchantment, a damaging spell deals only one-fifth\
  \ (20%) the normal amount of damage."
