description: "This spell works like animate dead except you set a specific condition\
  \ for when the animation occurs and you do not immediately have control of the creatures.\
  \ The condition can be simple, such as being touched, a certain word spoken, or\
  \ on hearing a specific sound. You can also set a condition based on time, but it\
  \ must occur within a number of days equal to your caster level. At any time, you\
  \ can cause the animation to occur as a standard action."
