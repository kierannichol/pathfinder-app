    Effect: "Through a process of reaching mutual understanding and agreeing on a\
      \ shared goal, the casters of this ritual are joined in the pursuit of knowledge.\
      \ Each secondary caster holds on to a section of long copper wire, while the\
      \ primary caster questions them. Only when assured of the purity of joint purpose\
      \ among all casters does the primary caster permit the other casters to let\
      \ go of the wire, successfully completing the ritual. Failure by the primary\
      \ caster to conduct this purpose-driven interrogation, or by the secondary casters\
      \ to withstand it, can lead to severe mental trauma for all involved."
