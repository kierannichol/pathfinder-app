description: "You convert a thin layer of the ground to molten glass that cools quickly.\
  \ Creatures in the area take 1d6 points of fire damage per two caster levels (maximum\
  \ of 10d6) and become entangled. Any creature within the area that makes a successful\
  \ Reflex save takes half damage and is not entangled. An entangled creature can\
  \ attempt to free itself by spending a move action to attempt a Strength check or\
  \ Escape Artist check (the DC equals the spell's saving throw DC)."
