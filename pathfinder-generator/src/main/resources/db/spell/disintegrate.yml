description: "A thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger. You must make a\
  \ successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature struck by the ray takes 2d6\
  \ points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). Any creature reduced\
  \ to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind\
  \ only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected."
