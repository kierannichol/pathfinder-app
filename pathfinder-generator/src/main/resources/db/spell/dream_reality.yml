description: "You cause the target to perceive the world as if in a dream. When the\
  \ spell ends, the target forgets all identifying details of events that transpired\
  \ while the spell lasted. The memories were not taken from it; rather, its mind\
  \ never recorded the memories as real in the first place. If modify memory is cast\
  \ upon it before the spell ends, the target remembers these events. A target under\
  \ the effect of lullaby before this spell is cast applies its penalty to the saving\
  \ throw against this spell."
