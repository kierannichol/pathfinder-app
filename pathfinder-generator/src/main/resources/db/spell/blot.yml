description: "This spell reduces all types of writing and other recognizable symbols\
  \ found on any sort of surface within range into illegible smears. It affects books,\
  \ carvings on stone, or even tattoos with equal ease. It does not affect writing\
  \ that is not actually on a surface, such as an illusion, projection, reflection,\
  \ or anything similar. Spellbooks and magical items that contain writing (such as\
  \ scrolls) gain a saving throw to resist the effects of this spell. Against magical\
  \ writing created by spell effects (such as glyphs of wardingor symbols), blot instead\
  \ functions as a dispel magicspell capable of targeting all such spell effects in\
  \ the area. This spell has no effect on writing found on artifacts or similarly\
  \ unique surfaces."
