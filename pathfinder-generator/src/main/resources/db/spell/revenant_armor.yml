name: "Revenant Armor"
description: "This spell endows a suit of armor with a singular purpose realized only\
  \ after its wearer goes unconscious or is killed; whenever the wearer of a suit\
  \ of armor warded by revenant armor is brought below 0 hit points or otherwise rendered\
  \ unconscious (but not paralyzed or held) in combat, the armor is immediately brought\
  \ to life as a Medium animated object. This animated suit of armor still contains\
  \ the unconscious (or dead) body of its former wearer and moves with a shambling\
  \ gait at a speed of 20 feet. This animated object has average hit points and, if\
  \ the armor is made from metal, it has the metal animated object extraordinary ability\
  \ (plus additional abilities based on the type of metal, as indicated on page 14\
  \ of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). Once animated, the revenant armor remains standing\
  \ (and stands if knocked prone, doing so without provoking attacks of opportunity),\
  \ and prevents the wearer of the armor from being considered helpless. If an ally\
  \ of the wearer is within range of the armor, she can direct it to move, though\
  \ it refuses to go anywhere that requires a skill check. If grappled or otherwise\
  \ restrained, it can attempt to break free with a Strength score equal to your caster\
  \ level and a CMB equal to 1 + your caster level + the armor's Strength modifier.\
  \ If the armor's wearer is reduced to dust, made conscious, or removed from the\
  \ armor, the spell ends."
