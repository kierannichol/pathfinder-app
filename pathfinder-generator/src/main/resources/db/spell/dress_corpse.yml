description: "You cause the flesh and bones of a corpse to shift themselves to suit\
  \ a narrative of your choosing. This spell can hide or create telltale wounds, bruising,\
  \ and other subtle clues as to the nature of the target's death, and the final hours\
  \ leading up to it, allowing you to make the corpse appear to have died in just\
  \ about any way. You could, for example, make stab wounds close up as though they\
  \ were never there, rearrange bruises on the neck, evaporate traces of poison within\
  \ the body into nothingness, make burn marks grow to cover the corpse's skin, or\
  \ shrivel the target's body as though the creature had starved. This spell can't\
  \ hide extreme alterations to the body (such as the loss of a limb), nor can it\
  \ restore flesh to a skeletal corpse or strip a corpse down to skeletal form. It\
  \ is also unable to change the apparent identity of the corpse."
