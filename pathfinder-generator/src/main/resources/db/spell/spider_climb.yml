name: "Spider Climb"
description: "The subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even traverse\
  \ ceilings as well as a spider does. The affected creature must have its hands free\
  \ to climb in this manner. The subject gains a climb speed of 20 feet and a +8 racial\
  \ bonus on Climb skill checks; furthermore, it need not make Climb checks to traverse\
  \ a vertical or horizontal surface (even upside down). A spider climbing creature\
  \ retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents\
  \ get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the\
  \ run action while climbing."
