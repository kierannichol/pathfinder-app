description: "This spell functions like sending, except the subject also receives\
  \ knowledge of a command word that, when spoken, summons you to the open space nearest\
  \ to the subject. The subject must speak the command word within 1 round of knowing\
  \ it to summon you, although the subject isn't obligated to speak it. You can be\
  \ transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes. You\
  \ can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load.\
  \ You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying\
  \ gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels.\
  \ A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four\
  \ Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact\
  \ with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with\
  \ you."
