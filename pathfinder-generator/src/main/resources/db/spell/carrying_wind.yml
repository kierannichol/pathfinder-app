description: "When you cast this spell, a wind spirit envelopes you and carries you\
  \ with it at your direction. You gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to your base\
  \ speed and fly speed while this spell is in effect. If you don't have a fly speed,\
  \ you instead gain a fly speed of 10 feet with poor maneuverability. If your caster\
  \ level is 10thâ€“14th, the enhancement bonus to these speeds is +20 feet (if applicable,\
  \ your temporary fly speed is 20 feet with average maneuverability). If your caster\
  \ level is 15th or higher, the enhancement bonus to these speeds is +30 feet (if\
  \ applicable, your temporary fly speed is 30 feet with average maneuverability)."
