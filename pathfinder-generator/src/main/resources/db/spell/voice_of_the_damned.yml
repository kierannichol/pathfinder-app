    Effect: "The caster rouses the lingering consciousness of a neutralized haunt.\
      \ Upon the ritual's completion, a spirit resembling the entity that empowered\
      \ the haunt manifests before the caster and scrawls a message of 25 words or\
      \ less onto the provided parchment, using the caster's blood. This message provides\
      \ a cryptic clue regarding how to permanently destroy the haunt, acting much\
      \ like the information granted by a divination spell, except that there is no\
      \ chance that the information will be incorrect because the haunt hopes to end\
      \ its suffering."
