    Effect: "This ritual conjures forth a restless spirit or otherworldly entity to\
      \ harass and sabotage a target of the caster's choice. The ritual must take\
      \ place in an environment pleasing to the nemesis creature (an allip must be\
      \ called in an asylum, a gremlin must be called in a clocktower or site of misfortune,\
      \ etc.). The caster supplicates before a representation-- usually a statue or\
      \ tapestry--of the nemesis creature, reciting a long litany of the target's\
      \ real or imagined sins and how deeply the target deserves to suffer."
prerequisites: ""
