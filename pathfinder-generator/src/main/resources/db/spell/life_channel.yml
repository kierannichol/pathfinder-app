description: "When cast on a creature with negative energy affinity, the target is\
  \ able to convert channeled positive energy into temporary hit points. When subject\
  \ to an effect that heals hit points only to living creatures (such as cure light\
  \ woundsor channel positive energy), the target gains a number of temporary hit\
  \ points equal to half the number of hit points that the positive energy would normally\
  \ heal. These temporary hit points go away at the end of this spell's duration."
