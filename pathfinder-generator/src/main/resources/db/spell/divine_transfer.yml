  \ can transfer up to a number of hit points equal to your Constitution score to\
  \ the target. These hit points heal the subject, but cannot raise the subject's\
  \ hit points higher than its normal hit point total. In addition, the subject gains\
  \ DR/evil equal to your Charisma bonus (if any) for the duration of the spell."
