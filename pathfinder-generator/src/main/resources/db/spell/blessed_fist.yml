description: "The target is considered to be armed even when unarmed, so it doesn't\
  \ provoke attacks of opportunity when it attacks foes with unarmed strikes. Its\
  \ unarmed strikes can deal lethal or nonlethal damage (target's choice). If the\
  \ target already has this ability (such as from the monk unarmed strike ability\
  \ or the Improved Unarmed Strike feat), its unarmed strikes gain a +1 enhancement\
  \ bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, and they count as good-aligned weapons\
  \ for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction."
