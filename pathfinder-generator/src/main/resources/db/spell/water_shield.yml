description: "This spell surrounds you in a spout of clear acid that aids in deflecting\
  \ attacks and damages creatures that attack you in melee. The constantly upward-rushing\
  \ waters grant you a measure of protecting, shielding you so you only take half\
  \ damage from acid and fire-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save\
  \ for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save."
