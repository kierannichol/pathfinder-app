description: "This spell gives you the power to turn one melee weapon in your hand\
  \ into a two-dimensional object with length and height but no width. A sword becomes\
  \ a flat image of a sword, a mace is reduced to a flat outline, and so on. The magic\
  \ of the spell allows the weapon to be wielded by you normally, creating just enough\
  \ depth to grasp it."
