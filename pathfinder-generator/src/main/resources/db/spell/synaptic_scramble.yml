name: "Synaptic Scramble"
description: "You scramble the synaptic connections of your target, causing it to\
  \ lose the ability to coherently communicate and to take unintended actions when\
  \ it meant to perform others. The target cannot effectively communicate while under\
  \ the spell's influence, and thus cannot engage in acts like speaking, attempting\
  \ Bluff checks to pass secret messages, writing, or using telepathy, although the\
  \ spell doesn't prevent verbalizations made for purposes other than communication,\
  \ such as command words or the verbal component of spellcasting."
