description: "You channel residual feelings of terror into the minds of creatures\
  \ within the area, causing those fears to manifest when confronted with a specific\
  \ object. All creatures in the area must succeed at a Will save or acquire a phobia\
  \ (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 250) for the spell's duration. You choose one\
  \ kind of creature, object, or image within the area of the spell when it is cast\
  \ that triggers the phobia. The kind of creature, object, or image that triggers\
  \ the phobia must be named specifically. A creature type or subtype is not specific\
  \ enough. The phobia can be cured using traditional methods of treating insanity,\
  \ and spells or effects that prevent possession or mind control suppress the phobia\
  \ for their duration. Each time the phobia is triggered in an affected creature,\
  \ the spell's haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round."
