name: "Conditional Curse"
description: "This spell functions as bestow curse, except that you must state a condition\
  \ under which the curse is broken, ending its effect. An intelligent target, even\
  \ one of animal intelligence, innately understands this condition even if it doesn't\
  \ understand your language. The condition must be possible for the target to bring\
  \ about within a year and a day without ensuring its own death and stated in 25\
  \ or fewer words. The curse is more difficult to remove via magic. The DC to remove\
  \ conditional curse with break enchantment or remove curse increases by 5."
