description: "By holding aloft a holy symbol and calling your deity's name, you take\
  \ on an aspect of that divinity. When you cast this spell, choose a domain offered\
  \ by your deity. You gain that domain's benefits from the list below, along with\
  \ the listed physical changes; abilities that allow a saving throw use this spell's\
  \ DC. At any point during the duration of this spell, you can change which domain\
  \ benefit you gain by concentrating for 1 round--this provokes attacks of opportunity\
  \ and reduces the remaining duration of the spell by 10 minutes. If you have less\
  \ than 10 minutes of the spell's duration remaining, you cannot change the selected\
  \ domain in this way. If you change your domain, all ongoing effects from your previously\
  \ chosen domain end."
