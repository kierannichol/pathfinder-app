description: "This spell helps creatures accustomed to the concrete reality of the\
  \ Material Plane to navigate within the confusing realities of other planes. When\
  \ cast, it functions as know direction, save that instead of revealing true north,\
  \ it reveals the direction of the palace or demesnes most associated with that plane\
  \ or demiplane's ruling god or demigod, as well as a brief and generic vision of\
  \ that entity's appearance or holy symbol. The spell functions only within whatever\
  \ plane or demiplane you are located in at the time; for instance, if cast within\
  \ a specific demon lord's Abyssal realm or on a given layer of Hell, it would point\
  \ to the seat of power for that demon lord or archdevil, not Lamashtu or Asmodeus.\
  \ If a plane or demiplane has multiple gods or rulers, such as the Eldest of the\
  \ First World or Heaven's various Empyreal Lords and deities, it reveals the directions\
  \ of the closest three, allowing for triangulation."
