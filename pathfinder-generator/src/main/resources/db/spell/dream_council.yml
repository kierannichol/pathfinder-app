description: "This spell functions as dream, but you and the target of your dream\
  \ can converse in a limited fashion as long as the recipient is also asleep. You\
  \ can send or receive a number of dream messages equal to your caster level. Each\
  \ message can be up to 25 words long or a single vague image that can't convey fine\
  \ details such as words. You can send and receive these dream messages with a single\
  \ target or multiple targets, but each message you send or receive counts against\
  \ the total number of messages allowed. Sending a message takes 1 round. The spell\
  \ ends and you wake up when you run out of messages."
