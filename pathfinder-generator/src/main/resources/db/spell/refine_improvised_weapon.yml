name: "Refine Improvised Weapon"
description: "You transform an improvised weapon into an equivalent simple or martial\
  \ weapon of masterwork quality. This effect does not alter the weapon's shape or\
  \ appearance in any way. For example, if this spell is cast on a chair leg, a butter\
  \ knife, or a pitchfork, the items function as a masterwork club, a masterwork dagger,\
  \ or a masterwork trident, respectively, but the items look no different than they\
  \ did before the spell was cast."
