description: "By freeing your spirit from your physical body, this spell allows you\
  \ to project an astral body onto another plane altogether. You can bring the astral\
  \ forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked\
  \ in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent\
  \ upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during\
  \ the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them."
