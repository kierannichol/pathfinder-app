name: "Enemy's Heart"
description: "You cut out an enemy's heart and consume it, absorbing that enemy's\
  \ power as your own. As part of casting this spell, you perform a coup de grace\
  \ with a slashing weapon on a helpless, living adjacent target. If the target dies,\
  \ you eat its heart to gain the spell's benefits. If the target survives, the spell\
  \ is not wasted and you can try again as long as you continue concentrating on the\
  \ spell. When you consume the heart, you gain the benefits of a death knell spell,\
  \ except you gain 1d8 temporary hit points +1 per Hit Die of the target, and the\
  \ bonus to Strength is a profane bonus."
