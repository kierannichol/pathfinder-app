name: "Bloodsworn Retribution"
description: "When you cast this spell, you cut yourself and swear an oath of retribution\
  \ on your own blood. You decide how much damage you want to take from this attack,\
  \ up to 25 points. This damage cannot be healed for as long as the spell is in effect.\
  \ Anytime you perform an attack, save, or check that is directly related to the\
  \ oath and brings you closer to the fulfillment of that oath, you gain a morale\
  \ bonus to that roll equal to the number of hit points of damage you took from the\
  \ oath divided by 5. The GM is the final arbiter over whether or not an action qualifies\
  \ for this bonus. When you fulfill the oath (or choose to forsake it), the spell\
  \ ends, and the lost hit points can be healed as normal."
