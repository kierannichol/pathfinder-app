description: "This spell functions like the spell glyph version of glyph of warding,\
  \ except you can store a hex you know (but not a major hex or a grand hex) instead\
  \ of a spell. If the hex has a target, it targets the intruder. If the hex has an\
  \ area or an amorphous effect, the area or effect is centered on the intruder. The\
  \ triggered hex uses this spell's caster level and DC."
