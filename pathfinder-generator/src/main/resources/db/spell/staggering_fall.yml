name: "Staggering Fall"
description: "This spell must be cast on a creature as it falls, either from a height\
  \ or after being knocked prone or tripped. The magic of this spell causes the creature\
  \ to hit the ground particularly hard, knocking the wind from it. The creature takes\
  \ an additional 1d6 points of damage from the fall. In addition, the creature becomes\
  \ staggered for the duration of the spell unless it makes a Will save. Each round\
  \ the spell's effects persist, the creature may attempt a new Will save as a free\
  \ action to end the staggered effect early. A creature under the effects of this\
  \ spell must take a standard action to stand up."
