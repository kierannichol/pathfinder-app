name: "Magnetic Field"
description: "You create a spherical magnetic field that surrounds you to a range\
  \ of 30 feet and follows you for the duration of the spell. Unattended metal objects\
  \ in range--including weapons, armor, and anything made primarily out of metal--are\
  \ pulled violently toward you, stopping just short of your space and falling harmlessly\
  \ to the ground. Objects secured to a nonmetallic fixture remain where they are\
  \ unless a forceful tug would be enough to detach them. Loose objects weighing more\
  \ than 500 pounds are not affected. If the magnetic field would cause a dangerous\
  \ metal object such as a sword or anvil to intersect a square occupied by a creature,\
  \ that creature must succeed at a Reflex save or take damage as if from an improvised\
  \ weapon of the object's size (or smaller or larger, at the GM's discretion)."
