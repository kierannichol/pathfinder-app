name: "Demon Dream"
description: "When the target of demon dream is a worshiper of a demon lord or Lamashtu,\
  \ the caster has the option of making the spell function instead as a dream spell.\
  \ Otherwise, this spell functions like nightmare (see Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook\
  \ 316), save that the subject matter of the dream always involves demons. Upon waking\
  \ from a demon dream, the victim must make a saving throw against the spell to resist\
  \ taking 1d6 points of Wisdom drain from the unsettling, madness- inducing dream--this\
  \ is in addition to the damage and fatigue normally caused by the nightmare."
