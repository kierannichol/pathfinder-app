description: "You identify the stage of a given soul's judgment, or determine its\
  \ fate post-judgment. You must either unambiguously identify the soul you seek or\
  \ use the skull of the body the soul vacated as a focus. If the subject does not\
  \ share your alignment, the soul can attempt a Will save to resist this spell's\
  \ effects as if it were still alive. If the subject is still alive or its soul has\
  \ been destroyed, this spell fails without providing any information."
