description: "After casting this spell, the next creature you attack using your smite\
  \ evil class ability is engulfed in flames of positive energy. At the start of its\
  \ turn, the target takes 1d6 points of damage, and takes an additional 1d6 points\
  \ of damage each time it attacks a creature other than you. If the creature is an\
  \ outsider with the evil subtype, an evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature\
  \ this damage increases to 1d10. With a successful saving throw, a creature is affected\
  \ by this spell for only 1 round. This damage is divine in nature and bypasses any\
  \ DR the creature possesses."
