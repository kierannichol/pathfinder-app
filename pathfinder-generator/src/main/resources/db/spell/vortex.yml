description: "You create a powerful and immobile whirlpool in any body of liquid large\
  \ enough to contain the spell's effect. Any Large or smaller creature that comes\
  \ in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points\
  \ of bludgeoning damage. A Medium or smaller creature that fails its first save\
  \ must succeed on a second one or be pulled into the whirlpool and held suspended\
  \ in its powerful currents, taking 1d8 points of damage each round on your turn\
  \ with no save allowed. You may direct the whirlpool to eject any carried creatures\
  \ whenever you wish. A boat that is equal in length or shorter than the vortex's\
  \ width that passes through a vortex takes 6d6 points of damage and is caught up\
  \ by the current. If the boat's captain makes a DC 25 Profession (sailor) check\
  \ (or if the boat is longer than the vortex's width), the boat takes only half damage\
  \ and is not caught up by the vortex."
