      \ among the holy symbol foci, the primary caster shakes the unseen spiritual\
      \ pillars of the mortal world. This ritual has no visible effect to mortal eyes,\
      \ but it creates a powerful rending cut in the world of spirits. By successfully\

      \ a kami from its ward, or untethering a bound companion."
