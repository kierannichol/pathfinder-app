description: "You place a protective ward over your spirit that ensnares creatures\
  \ attempting to possess you. Should a creature attempt to possess you (such as via\
  \ magic jaror a similar effect) while you are under the effects of possession trap,\
  \ that creature must first succeed at a Will save or its possession attempt is ruined\
  \ and its spirit is shunted into this spell's focus gem. The trapped creature is\
  \ contained within the focus gem for 1 round per caster level, acting as though\
  \ it were trapped in a magic jarfor the duration of this effect. This effect fails\
  \ if you are not carrying the focus gem during the time of the possession attempt."
