name: "Sturdy Tree Fort"
description: "You cause a large tree to grow in the 5-foot square you touch. The tree\
  \ has 1 foot of thickness for every 4 caster levels you have, and it can grow to\
  \ any height you designate, up to 5 feet high per caster level you have. If there\
  \ is a ceiling or other barrier overhead, the maximum height of the tree cannot\
  \ exceed the space available. At any point along the tree's height, you can create\
  \ a sturdy wooden building that fills one 10-foot cube for every 4 caster levels\
  \ you have. All portions of the structure must be adjacent to the trunk of the tree\
  \ (or can have the tree trunk extend up through their spaces), but otherwise these\
  \ cubes need not be contiguous. If you place the cubes so that they are contiguous,\
  \ the buildings merge together, complete with ladders connecting different vertical\
  \ levels. The fort is magically supported, but if the tree it is attached to is\
  \ destroyed, the structure is destroyed as well (the tree has hardness 5 and 20\
  \ hp per caster level you have)."
