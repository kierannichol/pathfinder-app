description: "You surround yourself in a whirling barrier of force that sends any\
  \ attack that misses you hurling back toward its source. This applies to any melee\
  \ or ranged attack directed against you so long as it uses an attack roll to determine\
  \ whether or not it strikes you. If an attack misses you, the attacker must make\
  \ a second attack roll against its own Armor Class, using all of the applicable\
  \ modifiers of the original attack and if it hits, the attacker takes the attack's\
  \ damage and suffers all the other consequences of getting struck with that attack.\
  \ You cannot deflect attacks that miss you for any reason besides a failed attack\
  \ roll (such as concealment). Similarly, you cannot deflect attacks that actually\
  \ do strike you but simply fail to do any harm."
