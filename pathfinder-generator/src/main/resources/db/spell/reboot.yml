description: "Whispering in the dense, information-rich machine language of the First\
  \ Ones, you bring a destroyed construct back to operational status for a short time,\
  \ restoring it to 1 hit point. The construct can be further healed with spells like\
  \ make whole, but it returns to its destroyed state as soon as this spell's duration\
  \ expires or it is brought to 0 hit points, whichever comes first. As long as the\
  \ construct is active, it obeys your commands to the best of its ability, fighting\
  \ on your behalf and carrying out tasks that it is capable of performing."
