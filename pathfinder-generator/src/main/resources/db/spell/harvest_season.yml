description: "You cause an explosive burst of growth in a single plant, causing it\
  \ to grow through a cycle of flower, fruit, or grain production as appropriate.\
  \ If the plant is not one that normally produces food fit for humanoid consumption,\
  \ it produces edible flowers under the effect of this spell. The plant produces\
  \ enough food to nourish one Medium creature per caster level. Food harvested through\
  \ this spell rots if not eaten within 24 hours. This spell nourishes, fertilizes,\
  \ and pollinates the plant, and doesn't harm the plant in any way. This spell has\
  \ no effect on plant creatures."
