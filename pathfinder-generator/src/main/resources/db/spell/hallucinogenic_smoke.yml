description: "Dark gray smoke seeps from your eyes, ears, and mouth for the spell's\
  \ duration, though the smoke doesn't significantly hamper your vision. Upon casting\
  \ the spell, you may immediately exhale the smoke in a 30-foot cone or do so in\
  \ a later round as a standard action, ending the spell. Each living creature caught\
  \ within the cone must succeed at a Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round per\
  \ caster level as it is wracked with waves of nausea and disorienting visions. If\
  \ it succeeds at its Fortitude save, the creature is instead sickened for 1d4 rounds."
