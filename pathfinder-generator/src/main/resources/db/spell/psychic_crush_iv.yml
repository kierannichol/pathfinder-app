description: "This functions as psychic crush I, but the target takes 9d6 points of\
  \ damage + 1 point of damage per caster level on a successful Fortitude or Will\
  \ save. The target does not receive any saving throw bonus because of its hit points.\
  \ If it is at fewer than half its total hit points, it doesn't gain a Fortitude\
  \ save to resist this spell but instead proceeds as if it had automatically failed\
  \ its Fortitude save. This spell can be undercast."
