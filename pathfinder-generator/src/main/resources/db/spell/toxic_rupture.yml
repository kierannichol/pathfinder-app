description: "With a squeezing hand gesture, you cause internal bleeding in the target\
  \ creature's venom glands or similar organs. The target must attempt a saving throw\
  \ against its own poison using the DC for this spell. If it fails, the creature\
  \ is poisoned and suffers the full effect of its poison. Any subsequent saving throws\
  \ that the target must attempt against the poison use the normal DC for the poison\
  \ rather than this spell's DC."
