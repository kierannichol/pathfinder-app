description: "You imbue the target with an exaggerated sense of its own mortality\
  \ and a drive for self-preservation. The target is shaken, and the first time each\
  \ round the target takes damage (including the first round of the spell's duration),\
  \ it must succeed at another Will save or its fear level increases by one step (from\
  \ shaken to frightened, and from frightened to panicked). If the target fails a\
  \ saving throw against this effect while panicked, it is transfixed in terror and\
  \ is helpless for the remainder of the spell's duration. If the target succeeds\
  \ at the initial Will save, it is shaken for 1 round but its fear level cannot be\
  \ further increased by this spell's effects during that round."
