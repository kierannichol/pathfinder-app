name: "Form of the Exotic Dragon III"
description: "This spell functions as per form of the exotic dragon II except that\
  \ it also allows you to take the form of a Huge imperial or primal dragon. Druids\
  \ can choose from the primal dragon (brine, cloud, crystal, magma, or umbral) forms\
  \ only. You gain the following abilities: a +10 size bonus to your Strength, a +8\
  \ size bonus to your Constitution, a +8 natural armor bonus, a fly speed of 120\
  \ feet (poor), blindsense with a range of 60 feet, darkvision with a range of 120\
  \ feet, a breath weapon, damage reduction 10/ magic, frightful presence (DC = DC\
  \ for this spell), and immunity to one form of energy (of the same type form of\
  \ the exotic dragon I grants a resistance to, if any). You gain one bite attack\
  \ (2d8), two claw attacks (2d6), a one tail slap attack (2d6), and either a gore\
  \ attack (2d8) if you assume the form of an imperial dragon or two wing attacks\
  \ (1d8) if you assume the form of a primal dragon. You can use the breath weapon\
  \ as often as you like, but must wait 1d4 rounds between uses. All breath weapons\
  \ deal 12d8 points of damage unless noted otherwise and allow a Reflex save to halve\
  \ the normal damage. Line breath weapons increase to 100-foot lines and cones increase\
  \ to 50-foot cones."
