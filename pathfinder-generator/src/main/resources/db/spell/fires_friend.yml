description: "You cloak yourself in flames that do not harm you or your carried equipment\
  \ but damage other creatures and objects. The flames cast light as a torch. Any\
  \ creature that attacks you with a non-reach melee weapon or that begins its turn\
  \ engaged in a grapple with you takes 1d6 points of fire damage and must succeed\
  \ at a Reflex save or catch fire. The creature can negate the damage (and avoid\
  \ catching fire) with spell resistance. Any time you end your movement in the same\
  \ square as a flammable object or creature, that creature or object must succeed\
  \ at a Reflex save or catch fire."
