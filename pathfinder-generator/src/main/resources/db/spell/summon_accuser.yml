name: "Summon Accuser"
description: "This spell summons a single accuser devil from Hell to do the spellcaster's\
  \ bidding, similar to how summon monster spells function. Accuser devils, known\
  \ to diabolists as zebubs, are hideous flying creatures with the torso of a plump\
  \ human infant and the body and wings of an enormous fly. They make excellent spies,\
  \ for they have the ability to grant visions of what they have witnessed to others--the\
  \ Queen's Hands sometimes use summoned zebubs to observe suspects from afar. Accuser\
  \ devils are detailed on page 84 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2."
