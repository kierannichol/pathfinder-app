name: "Alluring Light"
description: "You glow with a soft radiance that calls out to all who see it. Each\
  \ enemy that fails its save is drawn to you and must use its move action to approach\
  \ you at the beginning of each of its turns for 1 round per caster level. An affected\
  \ target must move toward you in the most direct path it can, though it can step\
  \ around obstacles or other creatures. This spell can't force a creature to walk\
  \ into an area that might obviously harm or kill it (such as into a pit, over a\
  \ patch of floor studded with caltrops, or through a wall of fire). An affected\
  \ creature that loses sight of you is not compelled to move toward you, although\
  \ if it later regains vision of you while still affected by this spell, it must\
  \ again move toward you. Any hostile action against an affected creature (such an\
  \ attack of opportunity due to its movement) cancels the spell's effect against\
  \ that creature. Your initial flash of light also increases the light level within\
  \ the spell's area by one step, up to normal light (darkness becomes dim light,\
  \ and dim light becomes normal light) for 1 round per caster level."
