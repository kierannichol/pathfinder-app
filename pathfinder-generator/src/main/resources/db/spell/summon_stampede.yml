  \ stampedes in the direction you indicate. The herd takes up a 20-foot-radius space\
  \ and moves at a rate of 120 feet per round in a straight line. Any creatures caught\
  \ in the herd's path take 4d6+9 points of damage that round as they are trampled\
  \ beneath dozens of animals' hooves. A successful Reflex save halves this damage."
