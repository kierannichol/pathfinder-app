name: "Ectoplasmic Hand"
description: "You draw forth a ghostly, animated hand through the ectoplasmic veil\
  \ to manipulate objects, attack creatures, and deliver touch spells at a distance.\
  \ The hand remains tethered to you by tendrils of ectoplasm. The ectoplasmic hand\
  \ and its tether have hardness 10 and hit points equal to 10 + your caster level.\
  \ The tether can be damaged or sundered anywhere along its length, ending the spell.\
  \ The ectoplasmic hand has improved evasion, uses your save bonuses, and has an\
  \ AC of 24 (+6 natural armor, +8 size). The ectoplasmic hand moves up to 30 feet\
  \ per round, and on each of your turns you can spend a move action to move it an\
  \ additional 30 feet. If you spend a swift action, the ectoplasmic hand can make\
  \ an attack using your base attack bonus, modifying its attack rolls and damage\
  \ rolls with your spellcasting ability score (the ability score that determines\
  \ your spell save DCs). It deals 1d6 points of damage with a slam attack, and it\
  \ can wield any light or one-handed weapon. The ectoplasmic hand threatens and can\
  \ flank targets."
