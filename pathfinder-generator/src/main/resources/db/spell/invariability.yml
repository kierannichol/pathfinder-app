    Effect: "The caster carefully places the four cogs around the target and traces\
      \ chalk lines connecting them. As the chalk lines must be as close to perfectly\
      \ square as possible, the caster typically uses a guide or straight edge to\
      \ draw the lines, although these components aren't strictly necessary if the\
      \ caster can draw the lines freehand with exceptional precision. As the caster\
      \ recites certain mathematical formulae, the cogs slide slowly along the chalk\
      \ lines and closer to the target, redrawing the chalk lines across the floor\
      \ as they move. As the cogs approach the target, the target's skin and clothing\
      \ become more metallic-looking, and the target's gaps and joints appear to contain\
      \ rapidly whirring clockwork mechanisms, as though the target were a quasi-mechanical\
      \ creature like an inevitable. If the ritual is successful, the target is infused\
      \ with the essence of Axis and can act only with rigid precision. The first\
      \ ability check, attack roll, caster level check, saving throw, or skill check\
      \ the target makes each round throughout the ritual's duration is automatically\
      \ treated as though the natural d20 roll resulted in an 11. When the duration\
      \ ends, the target's appearance returns to normal."
