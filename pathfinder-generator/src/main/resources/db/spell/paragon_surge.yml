name: "Paragon Surge"
description: "You surge with ancestral power, temporarily embodying all the strengths\
  \ of both elvenkind and humankind simultaneously, and transforming into a paragon\
  \ of both races, something greater than elf or human alone. Unlike with most polymorph\
  \ effects, your basic form does not change, so you keep all extraordinary and supernatural\
  \ abilities of your half-elven form as well as all of your gear."
