description: "You channel your magical power to fuel the target's spellcasting. The\
  \ next spell the target casts of 3rd level or lower does not expend a spell slot;\
  \ in effect, you are using your spell slot to power the target's spell. The target\
  \ must start casting this spell before your next turn, and the spell cannot have\
  \ a casting time longer than 1 full round. Your alignment, prohibited wizard school,\
  \ and other restrictions on your own spellcasting do not affect the target, nor\
  \ do you suffer any backlash from the target's choice of spell."
