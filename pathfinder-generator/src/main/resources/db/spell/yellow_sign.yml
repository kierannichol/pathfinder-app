name: "Yellow Sign"
description: "This spell functions as per symbol of death, save that creatures that\
  \ succumb to this spell become dominated (as per dominate monster) by Hastur. This\
  \ causes such creatures to seek to aid any obvious minions or worshipers of Hastur\
  \ in sight, and any true worshiper of Hastur can command the affected creatures\
  \ as if that worshiper had been the one to dominate them. In the case of conflicting\
  \ commands issued from different true worshipers of Hastur, the commanders must\
  \ attempt opposed Charisma checks, with the winner being able to command the targets\
  \ for that round. If no worshipers or agents of Hastur are in sight, an affected\
  \ creature can act normally. When affected by this spell's Yellow Sign in this way,\
  \ the effects last for 1 round per level. Once triggered, the Yellow Sign remains\
  \ active for 10 minutes per caster level."
