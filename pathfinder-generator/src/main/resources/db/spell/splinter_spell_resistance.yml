description: "You create an aura around the target weapon that weakens a foe's magical\
  \ defenses. The first time each round the weapon damages a creature with spell resistance,\
  \ that creature's spell resistance is reduced by 5 for 1 round. This reduction is\
  \ not cumulative for multiple attacks within the same round, even if the target\
  \ is struck by different weapons, each affected by a different casting of splinter\
  \ spell resistance. However, the same creature's spell resistance can be reduced\
  \ on multiple rounds by subsequent hits."
