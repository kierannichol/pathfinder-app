    Effect: "The caster must gather her intended victims in a circle with a radius\
      \ no larger than 10 feet around her and restrain them for the duration of the\
      \ ritual; while they don't participate in the ritual other than as sacrifices,\
      \ these victims count as secondary casters for the purpose of determining the\
      \ caster's skill bonuses. At the ritual's start, the caster stands at the center\
      \ of the circle of victims and chants while holding the onyx aloft. The evil\
      \ energy emanating from the caster slowly siphons the victims' blood through\
      \ their facial orifices; that blood travels in a liquid line from the victims\
      \ to the primary caster's onyx. From there, the blood washes over the primary\
      \ caster. By the end of the ritual, the primary caster's entire body is bathed\
      \ in an occluding egg of thick, dripping blood."
