name: "Blessing of the Watch"
description: "This spell functions like bless, except as noted. It works only in the\
  \ caster's home city, and in areas under the jurisdiction of the city watch. For\
  \ example, if the watch patrols a shantytown outside the city walls but not the\
  \ ruined subterranean tunnels that lie beneath the city, the spell works in the\
  \ former area but not the latter."
