    Effect: "This ritual inflicts a terrible curse upon an entire family line. The\
      \ casters use a sample of the victim's hair or blood to infuse a ruby with dark\
      \ magic and a shred of their target's soul. If successful, the ritual functions\
      \ as bestow curse, affecting the primary target, as well as the primary target's\
      \ siblings, children, grandchildren, parents, and grandparents, no matter their\
      \ location. Each target can resist the curse with a successful Will saving throw;\
      \ success means the negative effects of the curse do not affect that individual,\
      \ though they may still pass the curse on to their descendants. Children born\
      \ into the curse manifest its effects and attempt their saving throws upon reaching\
      \ maturity."
