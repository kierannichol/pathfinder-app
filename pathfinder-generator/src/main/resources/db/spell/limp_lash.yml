description: "You create a dark whip-shaped field of energy that wraps around an enemy's\
  \ neck, leaving everything except his head paralyzed until you let go of the whip\
  \ or it is destroyed. You must make a ranged touch attack with this spell. If you\
  \ strike your target, he takes a 1d6 penalty to his Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution\
  \ each round. This penalty cannot reduce any attribute to less than 1, and once\
  \ any of these attributes reaches 1 the target collapses and his body, except his\
  \ head, becomes paralyzed. While paralyzed in this way, the target retains full\
  \ use of his senses, including the ability to feel pain, and can speak (including\
  \ casting spells with only verbal components). The whip has a maximum length of\
  \ 20 feet, 15 hit points, and a hardness of 5. The spell ends immediately if you\
  \ let go of the whip or it is destroyed. When the spell ends, all penalties the\
  \ target took from this spell also end."
