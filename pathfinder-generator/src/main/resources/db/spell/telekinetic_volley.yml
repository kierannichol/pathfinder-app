description: "The touched items levitate in your space. When you cast the spell and\
  \ once per round thereafter, you can launch one item at a target of your choice\
  \ as a standard action. The ranged attack is made as if you had thrown the item\
  \ unless it's ammunition for a weapon, in which case the attack is made as if fired\
  \ from a heavy crossbow (if a bolt), a halfling sling staff (if a sling bullet),\
  \ a blowgun (if a blowgun dart), a composite longbow with a +2 Strength rating (if\
  \ an arrow), an atlatlUE (if an atlatl dart), or a pistolUE (if a firearm bulletUE).\
  \ A firearm pelletUE launched by the spell functions as a shuriken."
