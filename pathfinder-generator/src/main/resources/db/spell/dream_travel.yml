name: "Dream Travel"
description: "You and the other targets of the spell are physically drawn from the\
  \ Material Plane into the Dimension of Dreams on a voyage into the dreams of a creature\
  \ you designate. In the Dimension of Dreams, you move through a swirling sea of\
  \ thoughts, desires, and emotions created by the minds of dreamers everywhere to\
  \ reach your destination dreamscape. Reaching the destination dreamscape takes 1\
  \ hour. At any point before the spell's duration ends, you can dismiss the spell\
  \ to return to where you started on the Material Plane. The connection between dreams\
  \ and reality is inherently tenuous, and your ability to arrive precisely where\
  \ you mean to is dependent on your familiarity with the dreamer you're trying to\
  \ find. To determine how accurate your arrival is at the end of your dream travel,\
  \ roll d% on the following table."
