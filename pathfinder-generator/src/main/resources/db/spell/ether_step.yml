description: "You step into the Ethereal Plane long enough to dodge a blow or confound\
  \ a spell; you must cast ether step after you are targeted by an attack or effect\
  \ but before you learn the results of the attack or effect. This spell functions\
  \ as ethereal jaunt, except that you become ethereal until the beginning of your\
  \ next turn. On the turn after you cast this spell and return to your starting point,\
  \ you can take only move actions or free actions."
