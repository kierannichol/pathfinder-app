description: "You temporarily graft a dismembered body part onto yourself. You must\
  \ have the body part in your possession or the spell has no effect. The graft must\
  \ come from a creature the same size category as you. You can have only one graft\
  \ active at a time. Grafting on a new body part immediately ends the effects of\
  \ the older casting and causes that body part to fall off. The effect of the graft\
  \ depends on the type of body part you choose to graft to yourself, as follows."
