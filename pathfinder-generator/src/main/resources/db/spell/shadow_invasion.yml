name: "Shadow Invasion"
description: "Using a slashing motion with the spell's focus as part of the casting\
  \ of shadow invasion, you cut open a rift to the Plane of Shadow that fills a 30-foot\
  \ area with shadowy energies. This area is stationary and becomes dark and gloomy,\
  \ reducing the light level by one step (as darkness). Certain spells are enhanced\
  \ within the area; spells of the shadow subschool that have reduced effects when\
  \ disbelieved (such as shadow evocation) have their reduced effects increased by\
  \ 20% (to a maximum of 90%) when determining their effects on targets within the\
  \ area of shadow invasion."
