description: "You imbue a projectile, such as an arrow or shuriken, with holy energy\
  \ so that it deals extra damage to undead equal to that dealt by your lay on hands\
  \ feature. This extra damage is not multiplied on a critical hit. Although this\
  \ spell does not expend a daily use of your lay on hands class feature, you must\
  \ have at least one daily use available to cast this spell. If the projectile hits\
  \ a target or is destroyed before the duration ends, the spell is discharged."
