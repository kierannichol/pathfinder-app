name: "Cape of Wasps"
description: "You summon a wasp swarm, which fills your space (up to 5 feet by 5 feet)\
  \ but does not attack you. The dense cloud of vermin gives you partial concealment\
  \ against ranged attacks. Any creature that makes a successful melee attack against\
  \ you takes 2d6 points of swarm damage and poison from the wasp swarm, but is not\
  \ affected by the swarm's distraction ability. As a free action on your turn, you\
  \ may have the swarm cling to you tightly, giving you a fly speed of 20 feet (poor\
  \ maneuverability); when using the swarm to fly, it does not provide concealment\
  \ or harm creatures that strike you. You can return the swarm to its protective\
  \ shape as a free action on your turn."
