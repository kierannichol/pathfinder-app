description: "By shouting a forceful litany of strictures, you make a chaotic creature\
  \ more susceptible to the attacks of lawful creatures. If the target is chaotic,\
  \ it takes double the normal damage from attacks made by creatures that have a lawful\
  \ aura from a class feature or by creatures that have the lawful subtype. If the\
  \ target also has the chaotic subtype, when it is hit with attacks made by creatures\
  \ with a lawful aura, it is also sickened for 1 round. If this spell targets a nonchaotic\
  \ creature (or one that lacks the chaotic subtype), it has no effect and the spell\
  \ is wasted. While subject to this spell, the target cannot be the target of another\
  \ spell that has the word â€œlitany\" in the title."
