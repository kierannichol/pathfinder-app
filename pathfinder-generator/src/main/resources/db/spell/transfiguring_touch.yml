name: "Transfiguring Touch"
description: "You create an alchemical residue on your hands that gradually converts\
  \ a touched, unattended, nonmagical object into iron, paper, or wood (your choice).\
  \ The spell converts at most 1 cubic foot of material per caster level you have;\
  \ if the object is larger than the maximum volume, the transfiguration stops once\
  \ that amount of matter has been converted. If your caster level is at least 14th,\
  \ you can opt to create lead. If your caster level is at least 19th, you can opt\
  \ to create precious metals. If you create a precious metal, you must use an equivalent\
  \ value of alchemical reagents as a material component (5 sp per pound of copper,\
  \ 5 gp per pound of silver, 50 gp per pound of gold, 500 gp per pound of platinum)."
