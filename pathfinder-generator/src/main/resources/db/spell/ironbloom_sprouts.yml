description: "This spell functions like goodberry, except as noted above and that\
  \ it transforms 2d4 mushrooms into magical ironbloom mushrooms rather than transforming\
  \ common berries into magical berries. Alternatively, you may create twice as many\
  \ mushrooms, but each only has the nourishment ability of a goodberryand not the\
  \ healing properties."
