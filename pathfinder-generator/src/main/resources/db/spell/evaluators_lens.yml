name: "Evaluator's Lens"
description: "You summon an insubstantial lens of force 4 inches in diameter that\
  \ hovers in front of your face. When you attempt a saving throw against a spell\
  \ with the figment or pattern descriptor, you can roll twice and take the higher\
  \ result. You gain a +10 enhancement bonus on Appraise checks to appraise the worth\
  \ of an item viewed through the lens, and you never judge an item's value wildly\
  \ inaccurately. If you successfully identify that the item has magical properties,\
  \ you can immediately attempt a Spellcraft check to determine the item's properties,\
  \ as if you had cast detect magic on the item and examined it for 3 rounds. This\
  \ spell cannot determine the properties of artifacts."
