name: "Sebaceous Twin"
description: "By touching a living target, you cause a half-formed, parasitic clone\
  \ of the target to burst from its midsection. The twin dangles from the target's\
  \ body, making it difficult for the target to move easily and imparting a â€“2 penalty\
  \ on Acrobatics and Climb checks. In addition, for the spell's duration, the target\
  \ must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw at the start of its turn each round,\
  \ or else it takes 1 point of Constitution damage and is sickened for that round\
  \ as the twin siphons off its blood. Each time the target receives any healing (magical\
  \ or otherwise), the duration of this spell is extended by 1 round. Each attack\
  \ that deals damage to the target reduces the duration of this spell by 1 round.\
  \ If the duration reaches 0 rounds in this manner, the twin is violently excised\
  \ from the body, and the target takes 1d6 points of bleed damage (which can be healed\
  \ as normal)."
