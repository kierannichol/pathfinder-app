name: "Sympathetic Wounds"
description: "This spell functions like shield other, except some of your wounds transfer\
  \ to the targeted creature rather than some of their wounds transferring to you.\
  \ For example, you could link yourself to a nearby chained slave so that when you\
  \ are wounded, some of the damage is transferred to the slave. You must have at\
  \ least as many hit dice as the target, otherwise the spell fails. A creature can\
  \ only be under the effects of one instance of this spell at a time."
