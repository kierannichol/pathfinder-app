description: "Your gestures and droning incantation fascinate nearby creatures, causing\
  \ them to stop and stare blankly at you. In addition, you can use their rapt attention\
  \ to make your suggestions and requests seem more plausible. Roll 2d4 to see how\
  \ many total HD of creatures you affect. Creatures with fewer HD are affected before\
  \ creatures with more HD. Only creatures that can see or hear you are affected,\
  \ but they do not need to understand you to be fascinated."
