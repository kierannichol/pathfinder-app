description: "You show one creature the effect of its life so far and what it might\
  \ expect when it passes under Pharasma's impartial gaze at the end of its life.\
  \ Depending on the creature's alignment and its adherence to its ethos, you can\
  \ provide it a brief glimpse of the reward or punishment that waits for it when\
  \ it dies by showing it a mental image of its destined plane in the Great Beyond.\
  \ If the target is good-aligned, it is fascinated for 1d4 rounds on a failed save.\
  \ If the target is neutral-aligned, it is confused for 1d4 rounds on a failed save.\
  \ If the target is evil-aligned, it is shaken for 1d4 rounds on a failed save."
