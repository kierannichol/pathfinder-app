description: "You bring into being a localized region of increased gravity that crushes\
  \ a creature to the ground. Affected targets weigh twice as much as normal, can\
  \ move only at half speed, jump only half as far as normal, and can lift and carry\
  \ only half as much as normal. Any flying target has its maneuverability worsened\
  \ by two steps (from good to poor, for example; minimum clumsy) and plummets to\
  \ the ground unless it succeeds at a DC 25 Fly check to remain in the air."
