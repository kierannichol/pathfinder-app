  \ age category. The target immediately takes the age penalties to Strength, Dexterity,\
  \ and Constitution for its new age category, but does not gain the bonuses for that\
  \ category. A creature whose age is unknown is treated as if the spell advances\
  \ it to middle age. Ageless or immortal creatures are immune to this spell."
