description: "This spell causes the target to act as though it's wandering through\
  \ a maze. While under the effects of the spell, the target can't make attacks or\
  \ cast spells and must take at least one move action each round to walk in a random\
  \ direction determined using the guidelines for missed splash weapons (Core Rulebook\
  \ 202). The target must move at its maximum speed during this required movement,\
  \ though additional move actions after the first can cover shorter distances. If\
  \ this movement takes the target into a dangerous area, such as through a threatened\
  \ square or off a ledge, the target receives a second saving throw to end the effect\
  \ before moving into peril. Walking into a harmless obstacle, such as a wall, ends\
  \ the target's movement."
