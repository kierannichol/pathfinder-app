description: "This spell functions identically to the spell zone of truth, except\
  \ as noted above. The target momentarily takes on the semblance of a being of perfect\
  \ order, like an archon or inevitable, so that all who can see the target know it\
  \ is affected by the spell. This divine guise flickers over the target for only\
  \ an instant and does not allow it to pass as a member of a different race."
