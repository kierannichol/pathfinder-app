name: "Clear Grove"
description: "Trees, shrubs, and other thick vegetation move out of the spell's area.\
  \ The affected area is cleared of all vegetation thick enough to provide cover or\
  \ concealment. This also creates a hole in any tree canopy, allowing sunlight to\
  \ pass through. Affected trees and undergrowth form a 5-foot-wide ring along the\
  \ edge of the clearing, which may provide cover or concealment based on the thickness\
  \ of the vegetation (at the GM's discretion)."
