description: "You swallow a dose of poison with no effect and regurgitate a dose of\
  \ a different poison (your choice) into the old container (or another you have on\
  \ hand). Attempt a Craft (alchemy) check against the new poison's DC. If you succeed,\
  \ you create a dose of your chosen poison. If you fail, the poison you regurgitate\
  \ is inert. If you roll a natural 1, you expose yourself to the original poison\
  \ (although you remain immune to that poison if you have venom immunity or a similar\
  \ class feature or ability). The new poison's price must be the same as or less\
  \ than the original poison's price."
