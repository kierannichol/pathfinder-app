    Effect: "The ritual teleports a specific natural resource from the ritual's area\
      \ and transports it adjacent to the primary caster. The natural resource is\
      \ the same as the material component used in the ritual (for example, using\
      \ 500 gp of gold as a material component causes the ritual to teleport all gold\
      \ in the area). The area must be one the primary caster is familiar with and\
      \ can clearly visualize, although he need not have line of sight or line of\
      \ effect to the area at the time the ritual is performed. The sudden removal\
      \ of these resources can cause the ground in the selected area to shift or collapse."
