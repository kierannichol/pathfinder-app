name: "Devil Snare"
description: "Your touch creates an invisible circle on a flat surface. Any outsider\
  \ passing through this circle must succeed at a Will save or be caught within. Once\
  \ trapped, a creature must succeed at a Will save as a standard action to physically\
  \ exit the confines of the circle, teleport, or use any form of extradimensional\
  \ travel (as per dimensional anchor). Contained outsiders can still attack adjacent\
  \ creatures outside of the circle, or target others with ranged attacks, spells,\
  \ and spell-like abilities. Despite the spell's name, devil snare captures outsiders\
  \ of any type, not only devils."
