name: "Liquefy"
description: "The object you target becomes a liquid version of itself and drips or\
  \ runs like a thin oil until it pools on any flat surface. If the item has magical\
  \ or alchemical properties, they become inert for the duration of the spell. If\
  \ you are holding the item when you cast this spell, you can drain it into the bottle\
  \ used as focus for the spell. Items with hit point damage or the broken condition\
  \ regain 5 hit points/caster level if drained into a bottle in this way. The duration\
  \ of temporary effects (such as applied poison or greater magic weapon) passes normally\
  \ and may expire while the object is in liquid form. The liquid is clearly unsafe\
  \ to drink, but if, for some reason, a creature does drink the liquid and the spell\
  \ ends, the creature takes 3d6 points of damage, and brings up the solid version\
  \ of the item as a standard action in a coughing fit."
