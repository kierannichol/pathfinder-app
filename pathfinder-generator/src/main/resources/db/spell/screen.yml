description: "This spell creates a powerful protection from scrying and observation.\
  \ When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not be observed in the\
  \ spell's area. The illusion created must be stated in general terms. Once the conditions\
  \ are set, they cannot be changed. Attempts to scry the area automatically detect\
  \ the image stated by you with no save allowed. Sight and sound are appropriate\
  \ to the illusion created. Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal\
  \ illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Even entering the area\
  \ does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden\
  \ beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion."
