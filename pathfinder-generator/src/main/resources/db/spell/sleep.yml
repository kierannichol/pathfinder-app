description: "A sleep spell causes a magical slumber to come upon 4 HD of creatures.\
  \ Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD,\
  \ those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. HD that\
  \ are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Sleeping creatures are helpless.\
  \ Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not.\
  \ Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action).\
  \ Sleep does not target unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures."
