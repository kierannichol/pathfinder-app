name: "Lash of the Astradaemon"
description: "You draw on the essence of astradaemons to cause one of your hands to\
  \ elongate and sprout fearsome translucent claws that radiate a cold phosphorescence.\
  \ You gain one claw attack, which is a primary natural attack that deals 1d6 points\
  \ of slashing damage on a hit (1d4 for a Small spellcaster) and forces the creature\
  \ struck to succeed at a Fortitude save against the spell (spell resistance applies)\
  \ to resist gaining 1 negative level. Each time you inflict a negative level with\
  \ this spell, you gain 5 temporary hit points that persist for 1 hour. A creature\
  \ that succeeds at the saving throw against your claw's negative level is immune\
  \ to further negative levels inflicted from this casting of lash of the astradaemon\
  \ but not to the claw's damage. The claw does not interfere with your ability to\
  \ cast spells or perform other actions that require hands. You can use your claw\
  \ attack up to 1 time per 2 caster levels. Your claw reverts to a normal hand once\
  \ you've delivered all of your potential attacks or after 24 hours (whichever comes\
  \ first)."
