description: "You cause a straitjacket to spring into existence to restrain the target\
  \ creature. You attempt a combat maneuver against the target's CMD. Your CMB for\
  \ this check is equal to your caster level + 5 due to the straightjacket's Strength.\
  \ This combat maneuver doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity, and if it succeeds,\
  \ the target is restrained. This is similar to the grappled condition, except the\
  \ target is able to move at its normal speed, the restraint doesn't cause the target\
  \ to require concentration checks to use abilities that require concentration, and\
  \ the target can't take actions that require one or more hands or arms to perform\
  \ (including casting spells that require a somatic or material component)."
