description: "You instill a target with the fear that the nearest other intelligent\
  \ creature knows her darkest secret. If she is in the midst of another situation\
  \ as vital as protecting her darkest secret, such as combat, this doesn't cause\
  \ her to cease participating, but otherwise, she becomes compelled to use her abilities\
  \ and skills to determine exactly how much the other individual knows. Even if she\
  \ isn't around other creatures or otherwise avoids confronting her paranoia for\
  \ a time, the nagging fear causes the target to become shaken for the duration of\
  \ the spell (though this doesn't stack with other fear effects to make the target\
  \ frightened or panicked)."
