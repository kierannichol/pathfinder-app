description: "You create a comforting phantasm, which leeches onto the psyche of a\
  \ nearby target. The creature can attempt a Will saving throw to prevent the phantasm\
  \ from entering its psyche, but otherwise it takes up permanent residence in the\
  \ creature's mind. The phantasm fills its target's dreams with happy visions, comforting\
  \ manifestations of loved ones, and incredible vistas, feeding the target a perfect\
  \ fantasy life it never wishes to leave. After the target's next night's sleep,\
  \ the target must succeed at a Will saving throw to wake up; otherwise, it remains\
  \ asleep for the rest of the day and following night. Each night it must succeed\
  \ at a new saving throw or remain asleep for days or weeks on end as it slowly starves\
  \ to death (presuming it normally needs to eat to survive). Loud noises, jostling,\
  \ and even pain won't rouse the slumbering target. Dealing 1 point of damage per\
  \ the target's Hit Die awakens the target, but it awakens fatigued and takes a â€“\
  2 penalty on all saving throws against spells and effects that may put it back to\
  \ sleep until the phantasm has been banished."
