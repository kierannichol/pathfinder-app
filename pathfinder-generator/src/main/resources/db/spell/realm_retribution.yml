description: "All attacks made by the target match your alignment, counting as either\
  \ chaotic, evil, good, or lawful as appropriate. If your alignment includes multiple\
  \ alignment components, such as lawful good, you select one alignment component\
  \ to impart to the target. Whenever the target confirms a critical hit against or\
  \ takes damage from a creature, that creature must attempt a Will save. On a failed\
  \ save, the creature is sent to the Outer Plane matching your alignment, as per\
  \ plane shift, and the spell ends. A warpriest treats this spell as a 6th-level\
  \ cleric spell for the purposes of preparing the spell, determining DCs, and so\
  \ forth."
