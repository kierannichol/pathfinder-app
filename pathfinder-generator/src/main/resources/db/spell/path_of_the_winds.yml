name: "Path of the Winds"
description: "With a sweeping gesture, you call forth mighty winds to clear a path\
  \ ahead of you. The winds are the equivalent of a windstorm. During the first round\
  \ of the spell, the winds sweep the designated area clear of anything of Small or\
  \ smaller size, blowing it outward to the sides of the spell's effect (50% chance\
  \ of landing on either side). You may move within the effect without penalty, though\
  \ all other creatures are subject to the wind's effects. On the second and all later\
  \ rounds of the spell, the edges of the effect are treated as a wind wall. If the\
  \ effect includes a body of water or other liquid, the winds create a channel up\
  \ to 40 feet deep into the surface of the liquid. On your turn as a move action,\
  \ you can move the effect of this spell, either rotating it at one of its ends up\
  \ to 45 degrees, or moving it up to 50 feet in line with its current orientation\
  \ (toward you or away from you)."
