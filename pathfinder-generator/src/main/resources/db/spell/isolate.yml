description: "You cause the target to become invisible and silent, but only to his\
  \ allies. Any creature with an attitude of indifferent or worse toward the target,\
  \ and any creature that wishes the target harm, can see the target normally. The\
  \ target can see and hear himself, can cast spells with verbal components, and can\
  \ use command words normally, but any effect that requires allies to see or hear\
  \ the target does not function. An ally that can see invisible creatures can both\
  \ see and hear the target of isolate."
