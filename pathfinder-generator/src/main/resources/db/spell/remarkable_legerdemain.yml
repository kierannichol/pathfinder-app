description: "While this spell is in effect, your body and clothing flutter and distort\
  \ subtly, allowing you to conceal items with uncanny skill. You treat any object\
  \ you can hold in one hand as a coin-sized object for the purposes of Sleight of\
  \ Hand checks to palm the object or make it disappear; however, you can hide only\
  \ one such item per caster level on your person at one time. This effect does not\
  \ change the actual sizes of the objects."
