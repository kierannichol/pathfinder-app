description: "You overlay a realistic illusion of a terrifying hellscape upon an area.\
  \ Structures, equipment, and creatures within the area are not hidden, though environmental\
  \ features take on an infernal appearance. While you are prepared for these images\
  \ and are not affected by them, any other creature within the area must make a Will\
  \ save or become shaken and also take a â€“2 penalty on saves versus fear effects;\
  \ the fear and penalty persists as long as the creature remains in the area. Devils\
  \ and any lawful evil creatures suffer no negative effects from this spell."
