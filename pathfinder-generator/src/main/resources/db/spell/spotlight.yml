description: "You create a mobile area of bright light centered on one target while\
  \ simultaneously suppressing other light sources surrounding it. The light level\
  \ in the target's space increases to bright light, causing the target to take any\
  \ penalties that it would normally take in bright light. In addition, all mundane\
  \ light sources (and magic light sources of 3rd spell level or lower) within 20\
  \ feet of the target's space are suppressed, shedding no light as long as they remain\
  \ within this spell's affected area and reverting the area normally affected by\
  \ those light sources to their unmodified illumination levels."
