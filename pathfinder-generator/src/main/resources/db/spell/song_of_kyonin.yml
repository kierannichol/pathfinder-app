description: "Certain elven bards of Kyonin are known for the restorative power of\
  \ their performances--mostly as a result of this spell. You must have a bardic performance\
  \ in effect to cast this spell (although this spell is called song of Kyonin, the\
  \ bardic performance need not be singing). As long as that performance continues,\
  \ up to 3 creatures affected by the performance gain fast healing 2. When this bardic\
  \ performance ends or you change to a different bardic performance, the fast healing\
  \ granted by this spell ends as well, but all creatures affected by this spell heal\
  \ 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15) and are cured of\
  \ any of the following conditions: exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, paralyzed, sickened,\
  \ or stunned."
