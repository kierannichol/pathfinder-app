description: "You convert a non-masterwork item into its masterwork equivalent. A\
  \ normal sword becomes a masterwork sword, a suit of leather armor becomes a masterwork\
  \ suit of leather armor, a set of thieves' tools becomes masterwork thieves' tools,\
  \ and so on. If the target object has no masterwork equivalent, the spell has no\
  \ effect. You can affect 50 pieces of ammunition as if they were one weapon. You\
  \ decide if the object's appearance changes to reflect this improved quality."
