name: "Deflect Blame"
description: "You can cast this spell immediately after attacking a creature, causing\
  \ that creature to believe that a different creature that threatens it was responsible\
  \ for the attack rather than you. You can instead cast this spell immediately after\
  \ a failed Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check, causing the target of that check\
  \ to believe that a different creature you designate within spell range was responsible\
  \ for the content of that failed check. Using the spell in these ways doesn't compel\
  \ the target to undertake a specific action in response to its belief of where the\
  \ blame lies."
