name: "Brand of Conformity"
description: "This spell etches the symbol of a nation, organization, or order on\
  \ the target, dealing 1 point of damage. The mark can be placed on any exposed portion\
  \ of the creature, typically the head or forearm. While branded in this way, the\
  \ recipient loses the ability to speak or understand its racial language and the\
  \ language of its homeland or primary culture (if these are different). For example,\
  \ an elf raised among the Shoanti would lose Elven and Shoanti (if she knew both\
  \ those languages), while a halfling raised among dwarves would lose both Halfling\
  \ and Dwarven (if she knew both those languages). A gnome raised among gnomes would\
  \ lose Gnome, but no other language. This spell never suppresses Common or Undercommon,\
  \ nor does it prevent spellcasting, though it may prevent a target from speaking\
  \ intelligibly if it suppresses all of the target's languages. A brand of conformity\
  \ can be hidden beneath clothing or removed by scraping it away (the latter deals\
  \ 1d6 points of damage, though the brand returns if that damage is healed). In any\
  \ event, the language-suppression element of a brand of conformity continues to\
  \ function even when hidden or scraped away."
