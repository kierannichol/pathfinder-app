description: "Hermea's benevolent Council of Enlightenment uses this spell to humanely\
  \ preserve their society's greatest minds from the ravages of time, though it has\
  \ seen far more sinister employment when put to use by other organizations that\
  \ have since discovered its utility. This spell binds a single creature into a prepared\
  \ book, sustaining it in suspended animation and filling the book with its experience\
  \ and knowledge. The tome weighs 10 pounds and has one page for every day of the\
  \ subject's life. The cover and binding transform to reflect the subject's appearance,\
  \ interests, and tastes. Every thought and memory--including those the target may\
  \ have forgotten long ago--are perfectly transcribed within the enchanted pages,\
  \ penned in excruciating detail in the language that the creature was thinking or\
  \ speaking in when the event occurred. If a memory includes dialogue in a language\
  \ the subject didn't understand, that dialogue is reproduced phonetically, and must\
  \ be translated by a reader who knows that language. Any alterations to a subject's\
  \ memories--such as by a modify memory spell--appear in a subtly different script;\
  \ a successful DC 35 Linguistics check is needed to identify this."
