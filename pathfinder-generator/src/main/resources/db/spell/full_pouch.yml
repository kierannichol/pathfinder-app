description: "You cast this spell as you draw out a consumable alchemical item to\
  \ use. The object must be an alchemical item, but not a dose of disease, a poison,\
  \ a magic potion, or another type of consumable item. The item divides itself into\
  \ two nearly identical copies and the newly separated one is delivered into your\
  \ hand. The new item functions as the original in all ways except the copied item\
  \ suffers a slight reduction in quality. Saves against the new alchemical item's\
  \ affects use the original item's save DC or the save DC of this spell, whichever\
  \ is higher."
