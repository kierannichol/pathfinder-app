description: "You create a link to a target and can direct pain and damage through\
  \ this link. You take only half damage from effects and attacks that deal hit point\
  \ damage. The target of this spell takes the remainder of the damage. Forms of harm\
  \ that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage,\
  \ level drain, and death effects cannot be shared through this link. If you suffer\
  \ a reduction in hit points because of a lowered Constitution score, the reduction\
  \ is not split with the target of this spell because it is not hit point damage.\
  \ When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject\
  \ and you, but damage already split is not reassigned back to you."
