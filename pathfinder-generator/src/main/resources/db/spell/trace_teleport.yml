name: "Trace Teleport"
description: "You immediately become aware of any teleportation effects that begin\
  \ or end within the spell's area. The spell's area radiates from you and moves as\
  \ you move. You know the exact origin point of any teleportation effect that originates\
  \ within the spell's area, and the exact end point of any teleportation effect that\
  \ terminates within the spell's area. Further, you can detect the lingering traces\
  \ of any teleportation effect that occurred up to 1 hour previously, in the same\
  \ fashion. You intuitively know, to the nearest minute, when the teleportation effect\
  \ occurred."
