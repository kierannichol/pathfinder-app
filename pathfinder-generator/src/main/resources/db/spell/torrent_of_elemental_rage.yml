description: "A shimmering torrent of raw elemental power springs into existence,\
  \ originating from your outstretched palms. The blast resembles a horizontal whirlwind\
  \ of howling winds, searing flame, and tumbling shrapnel of ice and metal. Any creature\
  \ in the area of effect must make a Reflex save or take 8d6 points of damage from\
  \ a variety of effects--2d6 points of fire damage, 2d6 points of cold damage, 2d6\
  \ points of sonic damage, and 2d6 points of slashing damage that overcomes adamantine\
  \ damage reduction."
