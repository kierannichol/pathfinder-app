description: "The target becomes temporarily immune to disease. Any disease to which\
  \ it is exposed during the spell's duration does not affect the target until the\
  \ spell's duration has expired. If the target is currently infected with a disease,\
  \ you must make a caster level check against the disease's DC to suspend it for\
  \ the duration of the spell; otherwise, that disease affects the target normally.\
  \ Delay disease does not cure any damage a disease may have already done."
