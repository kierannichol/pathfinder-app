description: "If a creature successfully takes the item targeted by this spell while\
  \ you are holding, wearing, or wielding it, the creature must attempt a Will save.\
  \ If the creature fails its save, it becomes fatigued, and it must attempt a new\
  \ saving throw at the end of its turn every round it does not return the item to\
  \ you. Failing a second saving throw causes the target to become exhausted. As long\
  \ as the victim of the curse is actively working to return the object, its exhaustion\
  \ is reduced to fatigue. The fatigue and exhaustion cannot be removed by effects\
  \ that normally remove them, though immunity to fatigue and exhaustion protect against\
  \ the conditions as normal."
