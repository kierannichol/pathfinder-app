name: "Assume Appearance"
description: "This spell functions similarly to alter self, except for the following\
  \ differences. You assume the exact form of a deceased Small or Medium creature\
  \ of the humanoid type. Your voice changes to match that of the form you assume.\
  \ The creature whose form you assume must be dead and you must have access to its\
  \ fresh corpse (either dead less than 24 hours, or preserved via gentle repose or\
  \ similar effect). Any attempt to copy the form of a living creature causes the\
  \ spell to fail. You do not have access to the assumed form's abilities, memories,\
  \ mannerisms, or speech patterns. The spell grants a +10 bonus on Disguise checks\
  \ to appear as the imitated creature."
