description: "If the target takes hit point damage while within range of this spell,\
  \ it immediately teleports to your space (or adjacent to your space) after the damage\
  \ is applied. If the target is killed, its corpse teleports instead. Optionally,\
  \ you can specify a number of points of damage for your familiar to take before\
  \ the spell takes effect, but you must do so when the spell is cast. Once the familiar\
  \ has teleported back to you, the spell ends."
