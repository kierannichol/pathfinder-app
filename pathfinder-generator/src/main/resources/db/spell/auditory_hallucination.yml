name: "Auditory Hallucination"
description: "You cause the targets to believe they hear any sound you imagine. The\
  \ sound can include intelligible speech. Instead of precisely imagining a sound,\
  \ you can identify a sound the subjects know and they imagine it doing what you\
  \ describe as you cast the spell. For example, you could cast this spell on orc\
  \ warriors and have them imagine the sound of their chieftain calling for help,\
  \ even if you've never heard their chieftain and even if the chieftain speaks in\
  \ a language you don't understand. All targets hear the same hallucination. You\
  \ can change the sound as part of concentrating on the spell."
