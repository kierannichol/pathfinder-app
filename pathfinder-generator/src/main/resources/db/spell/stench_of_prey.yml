description: "The target exudes a strong odor that most predators recognize as the\
  \ scent of helpless prey. The closest 1d4+1 predatory creatures within 30 feet must\
  \ succeed at a Will save or start attacking the target (animals with the scent ability\
  \ are affected if within 60 feet). If the predator is an animal, it can be called\
  \ away from the target by a handler using the â€œdown\" trick (Core Rulebook 97) or\
  \ any effect that suspends or dispels emotion or rage effects."
