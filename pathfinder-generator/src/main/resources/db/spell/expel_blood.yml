name: "Expel Blood"
description: "You animate a portion of the target's blood, causing it to force itself\
  \ out of the victim's body and form a corrupted water elemental. The target takes\
  \ 2d4 points of Constitution damage unless it succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw.\
  \ Additionally, if the target fails the saving throw, blood (or an analogous internal\
  \ fluid, such as ichor) pours from the target's body and pools in an empty adjacent\
  \ square of your choice. The fluids immediately form into a fiendish water elemental\
  \ (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 294, 126) of the same size as the target (but not larger\
  \ than a Large fiendish water elemental). This fiendish water elemental does not\
  \ have the vortex ability, but it has the blood drain special attack (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Bestiary 2 294), which deals 1d3 points of Constitution damage at the end\
  \ of the water elemental's turn if it grapples a foe. The elemental gains Improved\
  \ Grapple as a bonus feat. You have no control over the fiendish water elemental\
  \ once it is summoned, though the water elemental does not attack you under any\
  \ circumstances."
