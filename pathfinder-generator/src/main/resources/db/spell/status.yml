description: "When you need to keep track of comrades who may get separated, status\
  \ allows you to mentally monitor their relative positions and general condition.\
  \ You are aware of direction and distance to the creatures and any conditions affecting\
  \ them: unharmed, wounded, disabled, staggered, unconscious, dying, nauseated, panicked,\
  \ stunned, poisoned, diseased, confused, or the like. Once the spell has been cast\
  \ upon the subjects, the distance between them and the caster does not affect the\
  \ spell as long as they are on the same plane of existence. If a subject leaves\
  \ the plane, or if it dies, the spell ceases to function for it."
