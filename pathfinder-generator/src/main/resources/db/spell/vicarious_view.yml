description: "You plant a scrying sensor on a touched creature, object, or point in\
  \ space, allowing you to see and hear the creature, object, or point and its surroundings\
  \ (approximately 10 feet in all directions). If the creature or object on moves,\
  \ the sensor moves with it. Unlike other scrying spells, vicarious view doesn't\
  \ allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it."
