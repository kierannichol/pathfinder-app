description: "Targets in the area must succeed at a Will save or become deathly afraid\
  \ of drowning. If the target is swimming or otherwise submerged in water, it must\
  \ spend all of its efforts attempting to escape from the water. As long as an affected\
  \ target remains in water, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage each round as\
  \ it thrashes about and swallows water. Even out of water, targets cannot imbibe\
  \ potions or willingly interact with any fluids for the duration of this spell."
