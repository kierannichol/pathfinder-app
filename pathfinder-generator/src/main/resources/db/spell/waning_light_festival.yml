    Effect: "At the completion of the festival, the primary and secondary casters\
      \ are charged with magical energy. For the next 2 hours, any creature they touch\
      \ gains a resistance bonus on their next 5 saving throws equal to 1 for every\
      \ 5 Hit Dice the primary caster possesses. It's considered auspicious if it\
      \ rains during the festival, even more so if thunder and lightning crack through\
      \ the sky. If the ritual is performed in these conditions, the benefit is doubled,\
      \ instead granting the bonus on saving throws for the next 10 saves."
