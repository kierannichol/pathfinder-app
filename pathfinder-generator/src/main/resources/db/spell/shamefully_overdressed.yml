name: "Shamefully Overdressed"
description: "The target sees its own attire as hopelessly out of fashion, ostentatious,\
  \ and embarrassing, and is filled with a compulsion to strip off all clothing. Each\
  \ round, the target must spend a move action to remove a worn item that can be removed\
  \ with a move action, dropping the item once it is removed. The target doesn't distinguish\
  \ between magical and nonmagical items when removing them. Each round it removes\
  \ an item as determined randomly from the following slots: belt, body, chest, eyes,\
  \ feet, hands, head, headband, shoulders, or wrists. When determining randomly,\
  \ don't include any slots if the character has no item of that sort, and don't include\
  \ items that take more than one move action to remove. Though creatures can't have\
  \ more than one magic item in any of those slots, they can have multiple mundane\
  \ items that fit each slot, in which case randomly decide which one they remove.\
  \ If a target is wearing clothing that doesn't fit in any of those slots, such as\
  \ breeches or a quiver, add it to the list of possibilities at the GM's discretion."
