description: "You turn a number of normal-sized centipedes, scorpions, or spiders\
  \ into their giant counterparts. Only one type of vermin can be transmuted (so a\
  \ single casting cannot affect both a centipede and a spider). The number of vermin\
  \ which can be affected by this spell depends on your caster level, as noted on\
  \ the table below."
