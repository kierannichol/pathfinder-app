description: "You harness the Irriseni people's palpable fear of their frozen environment\
  \ and cruel Jadwiga overlords into a haunt that withers defenses against the cold.\
  \ Any creature that enters the affected area must succeed at a Will save or gain\
  \ spell resistance equal to 11 + your caster level against any abjuration effect\
  \ that provides resistance to or protection against cold damage or cold climates.\
  \ This spell resistance cannot be voluntarily lowered. Once every 30 minutes as\
  \ an immediate action, the haunt attempts a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level)\
  \ against an active abjuration effect currently protecting a creature in the affected\
  \ area against cold, even if it was active before the creature was haunted or it\
  \ successfully bypassed the spell resistance imposed by the haunt. Against creatures\
  \ with multiple layers of protection, these dispel checks start with the highest-level\
  \ abjuration effects and work their way down the list. Each time the haunt attempts\
  \ a dispel check, the spell's haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round."
