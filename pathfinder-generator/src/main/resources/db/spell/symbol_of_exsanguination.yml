  \ within the radius of symbol of exsanguination begins to bleed uncontrollably and\
  \ violently from their eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, as well as any existing open\
  \ wounds. Creatures that failed their saving throws immediately take 1d6 points\
  \ of bleed damage and are sickened as long as they continue to take bleed damage\
  \ from the symbol."
