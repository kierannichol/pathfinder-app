description: "You create a magical barrier that protects a target's vital areas. When\
  \ the target is struck by a critical hit or a sneak attack, there is a 25% chance\
  \ that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled\
  \ normally. This benefit does not stack with other effects that can turn critical\
  \ hits or sneak attacks into normal attacks, such as the fortification armor special\
  \ ability."
