description: "You wrack the target's body and mind with the anguish and suffering\
  \ of every bitter failure it will ever experience, rendering it permanently shaken\
  \ and sickened. A successful Will save reduces the duration to 1 round per level.\
  \ If the target is a spellcaster, failing this saving throw means it also gains\
  \ a random minor spellblight (see Ultimate Magic)."
