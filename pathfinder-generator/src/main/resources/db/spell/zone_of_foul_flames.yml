description: "The twisted druids of the Uskwood forsook fire in ages past for the\
  \ glory of Zon-Kuthon. Despite this aversion, these servants of Nidal know well\
  \ the sting of flame, and have learned to turn it back on those that wield it. This\
  \ spell creates a zone where magical fire effects twist and lash out against those\
  \ who create the effects. A zone of foul flameslooks unremarkable to the casual\
  \ observer, but a Perception check (DC = 20 + the caster's level) reveals a faint\
  \ rippling effect in the area, as if of heat distortions in the air."
