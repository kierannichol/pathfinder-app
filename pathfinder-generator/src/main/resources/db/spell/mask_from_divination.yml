description: "As part of the action used to cast this spell, you place the mask used\
  \ as the focus component on the target's face, after which it adheres tightly to\
  \ the target for the spell's duration and cannot be removed by physical force. Despite\
  \ lacking eyes, this mask does not impair its wearer's vision in any way. While\
  \ in effect, this spell functions like nondetection, except it also foils divination\
  \ spells that attempt to gather information about the creature, even if they don't\
  \ target it specifically. In the case of divination spells that would normally reveal\
  \ the wearer's presence, such as see invisibility, the spell works, but the wearer\
  \ is detected only if the caster succeeds at a caster level check. Likewise, scrying\
  \ attempts that specifically target the wearer do not work at all unless the caster\
  \ succeeds at a caster level check. In addition, the DCs of skill checks to learn\
  \ about the wearer or identify the wearer and its strengths and weaknesses-- including\
  \ Diplomacy checks to gather information, Perception checks opposed by the target's\
  \ Disguise checks, and Knowledge checks--increase by 4."
