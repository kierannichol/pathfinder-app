name: "Pyrotechnic Eruption"
description: "The caster causes jets of flame to erupt from the ground and surround\
  \ the target. The target takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6)\
  \ unless it succeeds at a Reflex save for half damage. The blaze surrounds the target\
  \ for the duration of the spell, forcing the creature to attempt a new save each\
  \ round. Each round, the damage dealt is reduced to half as many d6; the spell expires\
  \ when it would deal no damage. If the target moves, the pyrotechnic eruption follows,\
  \ even if the target teleports."
