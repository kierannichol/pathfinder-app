name: "Seek Thoughts"
description: "Similar to detect thoughts, seek thoughtsallows you to sift through\
  \ the surface thoughts of those around you. You may scan for either the answer to\
  \ a simple question (such as â€œWhere is the hidden lair of the wererats?\") or for\
  \ information on a general topic (such as the beliefs of an evil cult). You detect\
  \ the number of creatures who are thinking about this question or topic within range,\
  \ as well as their location if they are visible to you. Seek thoughtsdoes not let\
  \ you read actual surface thoughts, only if a given creature is thinking about the\
  \ topic you are concentrating on. A successful Will save prevents you from sensing\
  \ a creature's thoughts for the duration of the spell."
