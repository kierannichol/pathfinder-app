description: "You strip all creatures within the emanation of any gifts associated\
  \ with corruptions (see page 14). Abilities associated with corruptions cease to\
  \ function, as if they were magically dispelled. The corruption stains still fully\
  \ affect creatures. A creature that enters the emanation and fails its saving throw\
  \ loses its gifts until the spell's duration ends, even if it leaves the emanation,\
  \ but a successful saving throw renders a creature immune to the spell, even if\
  \ it enters and exits the emanation several times."
