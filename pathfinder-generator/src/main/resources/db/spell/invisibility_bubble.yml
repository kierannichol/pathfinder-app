name: "Invisibility Bubble"
description: "A glamered bubble surrounds the target's space, rendering her completely\
  \ invisible underwater by hiding both the target and any water she displaces. Because\
  \ of the bubble's size limit, this spell works only on Medium or smaller targets.\
  \ Other objects and creatures within the bubble's space are also invisible while\
  \ they stay in the space, which could reveal the spell's existence to a canny observer\
  \ who notices fish disappearing into the bubble and reappearing on the other side.\
  \ Creatures inside the bubble can see each other, which allows foes who can pinpoint\
  \ the bubble's location (such as dragons) to stick their heads into the bubble in\
  \ order to see the target. Any creature on the inside of the bubble that takes any\
  \ action that would break invisibility pops the bubble and ends the spell early.\
  \ On land, the bubble is clearly visible, acting much as invisibility does in the\
  \ water. Unlike with invisibility, the inside of the bubble blocks light from escaping\
  \ the bubble, meaning that light sources inside the bubble don't illuminate past\
  \ its edges, but also don't reveal a telltale glow."
