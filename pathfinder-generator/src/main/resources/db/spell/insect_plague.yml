description: "You summon a number of swarms of wasps (one per three levels, to a maximum\
  \ of six swarms at 18th level). The swarms must be summoned so that each one is\
  \ adjacent to at least one other swarm (that is, the swarms must fill one contiguous\
  \ area). You may summon the wasp swarms so that they share the area of other creatures.\
  \ Each swarm attacks any creatures occupying its area. The swarms are stationary\
  \ after being summoned, and won't pursue creatures that flee."
