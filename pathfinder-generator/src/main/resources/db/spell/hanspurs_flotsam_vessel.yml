name: "Hanspur's Flotsam Vessel"
description: "This spell assembles a sturdy raft and oars from driftwood, reeds, and\
  \ other river detritus. The smallest raft created by the spell is roughly 5 feet\
  \ square, increasing by an additional 5 feet square for every 2 caster levels you\
  \ possess. Each 5-foot section of the raft can carry two Medium passengers or 300\
  \ pounds of cargo. The vessel functions as a normal raft, except it is not slowed\
  \ or damaged by nonmagical river hazards such as rapids or shallows, and it is always\
  \ considered to be traveling downstream for the purpose of calculating travel speed,\
  \ regardless of its actual direction."
