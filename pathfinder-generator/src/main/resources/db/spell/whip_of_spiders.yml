name: "Whip of Spiders"
description: "You summon hundreds of Diminutive spiders, which cling together in the\
  \ form of a whip made for a creature of your size. You can wield this object as\
  \ if it were an actual whip, except you make a melee touch attack with it instead\
  \ of a regular attack. Any creature you strike with the whip takes swarm damage\
  \ as if it were attacked by a spider swarm (1d6 points of damage plus poison and\
  \ distraction, Bestiary 258). The swarm whip is able to damage creatures with armor\
  \ or natural armor, even if a normal whip could not. It cannot be used to make bull\
  \ rush, grapple, or trip attacks, and (unlike a swarm) is subject to a miss chance\
  \ for concealment and cover."
