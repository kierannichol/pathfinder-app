description: "You create a blast of intense cold, coating all solid surfaces in the\
  \ area with a thin coating of ice. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast\
  \ takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +10) and falls\
  \ prone; creatures that succeed at a Reflex save take half damage and don't fall\
  \ prone. Spell resistance applies to this initial effect."
