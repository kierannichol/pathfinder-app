    Effect: "The rituals of lost Sarkoris summoned and put to use many of their myriad\
      \ â€œgods,\" including conjuring powerful spirits into a clan's soldiers to invest\
      \ them with bravery and divine grace in an upcoming battle. In this ritual,\
      \ after an hour of chanting, calling down a spirit, and begging and forcing\
      \ its service, the primary caster moves among those to be invested with the\
      \ spirit's power, anointing the participants' foreheads with blood. The ritual\
      \ infuses each anointed warrior with inhuman passion and courage, granting a\
      \ +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, as well\
      \ as a +4 morale bonus on saves against fear effects, but also renders them\
      \ vulnerable to spells that forbid outsiders or deal additional damage against\
      \ creatures of the outsider type (such as magic circle against chaos and chaos\
      \ hammer). A target of this spell does not become an outsider; it simply gains\
      \ a temporary vulnerability to these effects."
