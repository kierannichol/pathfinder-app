description: "This spell breaks the life link between you and your eidolon. This spell\
  \ allows your eidolon to venture more than 100 feet away from you without penalty.\
  \ It can travel any distance while this spell is in effect without penalty, but\
  \ if the spell expires while the eidolon is farther than 100 feet away, it immediately\
  \ loses hit points as normal for distance and is possibly sent back to its home\
  \ plane. While this spell is in effect, you cannot sacrifice hit points to prevent\
  \ damage to your eidolon. Damage that would be transferred due to the life bond\
  \ ability is not transferred. If you attempt to use the transposition ability while\
  \ this spell is in effect, you must roll on the teleportmishap table, using the\
  \ â€œstudied carefully\" row."
