name: "Probe History"
description: "You gain a glimpse of a potential reality similar to this one but that\
  \ never was. If the target fails her Will save, you can ask about one topic and\
  \ attempt the appropriate Knowledge check with a +5 competence bonus; track Knowledge\
  \ checks attempted with this spell separately for the purpose of disallowing retries\
  \ on Knowledge checks. You learn information on that topic from a reality in which\
  \ you were an acquaintance of the target, although the differences in that reality\
  \ might cause the answer to be subtly different than in your own. Once you have\
  \ probed a target's history, successfully or not, you cannot target the same creature's\
  \ history or search for the same information in another creature's history."
