name: "Plane Shift"
description: "You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence\
  \ or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as\
  \ many as eight can be affected by the plane shift at the same time. Precise accuracy\
  \ as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible.\
  \ From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to\
  \ 500 miles (5d%) from your intended destination. Plane shift transports creatures\
  \ instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they\
  \ are to travel back (including casting plane shift again)."
