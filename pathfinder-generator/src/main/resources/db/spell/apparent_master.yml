description: "This charm makes a construct regard you as its master. The spell only\
  \ affects mindless constructs that are attuned to the commands of a master, such\
  \ as animated objects, golems, retrievers, and shield guardians. All constructs\
  \ with Intelligence scores, even those that explicitly follow the commands of their\
  \ creator, such as an homunculus, are unaffected. If the construct is currently\
  \ being threatened or attacked by you or your allies it receives a +5 bonus on its\
  \ saving throw."
