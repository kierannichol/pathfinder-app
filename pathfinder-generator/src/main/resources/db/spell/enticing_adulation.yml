name: "Enticing Adulation"
description: "A targeted creature that fails its saving throw is filled with a deep\
  \ desire to protect and care for you, fawning over your needs and ensuring your\
  \ comfort. If another creature harms you, the target is immediately overcome with\
  \ rage and is compelled to attack the aggressor, gaining a +2 morale bonus to Strength\
  \ and Constitution, a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, and a â€“2 penalty to its Armor\
  \ Class. These bonuses last until the instigating creature is defeated or retreats,\
  \ or the target of the spell is killed or rendered unconscious. If other creatures\
  \ have harmed you while the target is under this effect, the target continues to\
  \ rage until all threats against you are defeated or driven off, after which the\
  \ target creature is fatigued for as many rounds as it raged. Your target continues\
  \ to fly into defensive rages each time a creature harms you so long as the spell's\
  \ duration lasts, but cannot rage while fatigued."
