    Effect: "The caster lights the rare incense and then scribes a complex conjuring\
      \ diagram on the floor using glowing inks, then must focus on the runes to look\
      \ through reality into the Abyss while reciting the methods by which a retriever\
      \ can be shaped into being from raw Abyssal quintessence. If the ritual is successful,\
      \ a retriever is conjured at the caster's location. The retriever is loyal to\
      \ the caster but will perform only one service before it vanishes back to the\
      \ Abyss. If the service takes longer to perform than a number of years equal\
      \ to the primary caster's level, the retriever vanishes at the end of this duration,\
      \ even if its service is not yet complete."
