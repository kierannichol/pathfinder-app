name: "Touch of Slime"
description: "You create a coating of slime on your hand. When you make a successful\
  \ melee touch attack with the slime, it pulls free of you and sticks to the target,\
  \ at which point it acts like green slime, dealing 1d3 points of Constitution damage\
  \ per round. Anything that destroys green slime (scraping, freezing, burning, cutting,\
  \ sunlight, or remove disease) destroys this slime. If the slime kills a creature,\
  \ it consumes the body and then dies. It cannot transfer to a creature other than\
  \ the original target, and dies if separated from the original target."
