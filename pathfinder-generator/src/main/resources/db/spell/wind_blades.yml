description: "You harden the air around the target into jagged invisible blades that\
  \ deal damage based on how fast the target moves. On its turn, the target takes\
  \ 1d6 points of slashing damage if it moves at least 5 feet, plus 1d6 points of\
  \ slashing damage for each additional 10 feet of movement. Movement that doesn't\
  \ pass through air (such as burrowing, swimming, or teleportation) doesn't cause\
  \ this damage."
