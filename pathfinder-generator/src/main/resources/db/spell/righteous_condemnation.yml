description: "Any creature of chaotic, neutral, or evil alignment who targets you\
  \ with a spell must succeed at a Will save or take a –4 penalty on Intelligence-,\
  \ Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks for the spell's duration. Creatures with only\
  \ neutral alignment components receive a +4 bonus on their Will saves against this\
  \ spell. The penalties for alignment components stack (therefore, a chaotic evil\
  \ spellcaster would take a –8 penalty)."
