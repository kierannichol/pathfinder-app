name: "Searching Shadows"
description: "Strands of shadow probe an area, searching for a creature or object\
  \ you specify by shape, size, or texture. Each round, the shadows attempt a Perception\
  \ check on the squares they touch with a total bonus equal to your caster level\
  \ + your Charisma or Intelligence modifier, whichever is higher. You can move the\
  \ shadows up to 30 feet or change the search criteria as part of concentrating on\
  \ the spell. Whenever the shadows come into contact with a creature with spell resistance,\
  \ you must attempt a caster level check to overcome its spell resistance. If you\
  \ fail, the spell ends."
