description: "You cause the target to transform into a plant over time. You must succeed\
  \ at a melee touch attack to infect the target. If the target succeeds at its Fortitude\
  \ saving throw, it takes 1d4 points of ability damage to each physical ability score\
  \ (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution) and the spell ends. If the target fails\
  \ its saving throw, it takes 1d4 points of ability damage to each physical ability\
  \ score immediately and continues to take 1d4 points of ability damage to each of\
  \ its physical ability scores every day, until the spell expires. It can't recover\
  \ this ability damage as long as the spell lasts, even with magic. While the spell\
  \ continues, the target takes on physical plant characteristics as appropriate to\
  \ the environment. It begins to diminish in height and its skin turns plantlike.\
  \ For example, the target's skin might turn green and its hair is slowly replaced\
  \ with grass or leaves or the target's skin might become smooth, pale, and flabby\
  \ as the creature transforms into a large mushroom in an underground environment."
