name: "Dust Form"
description: "Upon casting this spell, you keep your relative form, but you and your\
  \ equipment become composed entirely of dust. While in this dust form, you take\
  \ no penalties for squeezing, and can move through spaces as if you were a creature\
  \ three size categories smaller without penalty. You are also considered incorporeal,\
  \ though any nonmagical attack you make deals half damage (50%). Magic attacks are\
  \ unaffected, and you can still use your magic items and other equipment as normal."
