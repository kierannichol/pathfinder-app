description: "This spell functions like invisibility, except that the effect moves\
  \ with the group and is broken when anyone in the group attacks. Individuals in\
  \ the group cannot see each other. The spell is broken for any individual who moves\
  \ more than 180 feet from the nearest member of the group. If only two individuals\
  \ are affected, the one moving away from the other one loses its invisibility. If\
  \ both are moving away from each other, they both become visible when the distance\
  \ between them exceeds 180 feet."
