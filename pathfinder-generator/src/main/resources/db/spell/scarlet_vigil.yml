    Effect: "This ritual requires the intact corpse of a target slain by the primary\
      \ caster, who must possess at least 5 levels in the Red Mantis assassin prestige\
      \ class. Each of the secondary casters must possess exactly 1 level in the Red\
      \ Mantis assassin prestige class. During the ritual, the primary caster reveals\
      \ meticulous details about the victim's demise to the secondary casters, describing\
      \ in anatomical detail the damage done to the individual and pointing out visual\
      \ cues on the corpse, all while connecting the methods of execution to the teachings\
      \ of the mantis god Achaekek, patron of the assassin order. During the ritual,\
      \ the secondary casters must use a giant mantis claw to draw blood from themselves\
      \ in a place where the corpse was damaged; in the case of poisons and similar\
      \ effects, the location can be symbolic. If the corpse took damage in many different\
      \ locations, the secondary casters must draw blood from themselves in the place\
      \ where the victim sustained the most damage."
