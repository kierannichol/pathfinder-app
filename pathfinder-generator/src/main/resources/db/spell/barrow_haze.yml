description: "Barrow haze creates a bank of fog similar to that created by fog cloud,\
  \ except that the vapors are black and they have a necromantic link to you. The\
  \ vapors do not interfere with your vision. Because of your link to the haze, if\
  \ any part of it is within 30 feet of you, any creatures within the haze count as\
  \ in range for the purpose of using any of your hexes that have a maximum range\
  \ of 30 feet."
