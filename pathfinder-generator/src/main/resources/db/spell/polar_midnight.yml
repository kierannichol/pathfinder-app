description: "You plunge an area into the brutal chill of the arctic night. Illumination\
  \ conditions are dropped by two steps (though only to darkness, not supernatural\
  \ darkness), and all creatures in the area take 5d6 points of cold damage and 1d6\
  \ points of Dexterity damage per round. A successful Fortitude save each round negates\
  \ the Dexterity damage but not the cold damage. Any creature that doesn't move on\
  \ its turn becomes encased in a sheath of ice equivalent to wall of ice, is helpless,\
  \ and cannot breathe. Corpses in the area for longer than 1 round are transmuted\
  \ into solid ice; reviving the icy corpse requires true resurrection, miracle, or\
  \ wish. As a move action, you may move the area of effect up to 10 feet in any direction."
