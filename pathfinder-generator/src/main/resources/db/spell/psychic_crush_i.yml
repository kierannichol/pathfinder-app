description: "Using your psychic power, you invade the mind of the target and tear\
  \ it asunder, causing massive internal damage to both its mind and body. If the\
  \ target succeeds at the initial Will save, it is sickened for 1 round. If the target\
  \ fails its Will save, it must attempt a Fortitude save (with a +4 circumstance\
  \ bonus on this save if it has more than half its total hit points remaining). If\
  \ it also fails the Fortitude save, the target is reduced to –1 hit points and is\
  \ dying. If the target succeeds at its Fortitude save, it instead takes 3d6 points\
  \ of damage + 1 point of damage per caster level, which cannot reduce the target\
  \ below –1 hit point, and the target is sickened for 1 round. This attack has no\
  \ effect on creatures without an Intelligence score."
