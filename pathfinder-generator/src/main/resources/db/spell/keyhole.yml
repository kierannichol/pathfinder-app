name: "Keyhole"
description: "By touching a single door, gate, or other portal, you create a keyhole\
  \ where none existed before or double the size of an existing keyhole. A conjured\
  \ keyhole allows you to peer through the door, though the limited perspective imposes\
  \ a â€“10 penalty on Perception checks to spot anything beyond. It also allows a sealed\
  \ door to be locked or picked if it could not be before. Locking or unlocking such\
  \ a door requires a successful Disable Device check with a DC equal to the barrier's\
  \ break DC + 10. Enlarging an existing keyhole allows viewers to peer through to\
  \ whatever lies beyond, even if the preexisting keyhole did not allow it, and it\
  \ reduces the Disable Device DC to open or lock the door by 5."
