    Effect: "Designed to create a Jistkan construct that is considered in many ways\
      \ a precursor to early golems, this ritual uses hours of laborious calculations,\
      \ recitation, and focus to bind an elemental outsider (a creature with the elemental\
      \ subtype or a genie) into an inscribed bronze seal, harnessing the outsider's\
      \ vibrant life force to animate an object. The seal must already be affixed\
      \ to the object to be animated (usually a mannequin or statue), and the outsider\
      \ must be available within the ritual area and contained (via binding, a magic\
      \ circle, or similar magic). Upon successful completion of the ritual, the outsider\
      \ is bound to loyal service within the seal for a year and a day, losing access\
      \ to most of its powers and memories and treating the object to which the seal\
      \ is affixed as its new body. Such animated servitors were most often used as\
      \ guardians or bodyguards, but also sometimes served as assassins."
