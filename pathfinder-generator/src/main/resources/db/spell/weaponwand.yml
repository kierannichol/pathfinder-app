name: "Weaponwand"
description: "When you cast this spell on a weapon, you cause a portion of the weapon\
  \ to open like the skin of a partially peeled apple, revealing a space large enough\
  \ to insert a single wand within. As part of the spell's casting, you can insert\
  \ a single wand into the weapon, at which point the weapon returns to its original\
  \ form with the wand held inside of it without negatively impacting the weapon's\
  \ integrity. For the spell's duration, a character who wields the transmuted weapon\
  \ is also considered to be wielding the wand as well. You can attack normally with\
  \ the weapon or use the weapon as if it were the encased wand. If the effect created\
  \ by the wand requires an attack roll to successfully strike a foe, you may make\
  \ the attack roll as if you were making an attack with the weapon at its highest\
  \ bonus (including any bonuses the weapon would normally receive) rather than just\
  \ a normal attack with the wand--doing so does not allow you to add the weapon's\
  \ damage to the wand's attack roll, but instead allows you to use your skill with\
  \ the weapon to boost your chance of hitting with the spell."
