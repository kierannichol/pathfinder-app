description: "This spell functions similarly to modify memory, except you can modify\
  \ the target's memory only in a specific way. In response to a triggering condition\
  \ you determine, up to the last 5 minutes of the target's memory are eliminated\
  \ and replaced with a memory of your choosing (or no memory at all). For example,\
  \ you could cast this on an assassin, set it to trigger when he completes his kill,\
  \ and replace his memory of the murder with the memory of him discovering the body\
  \ and picking up the murder weapon. You can cast this spell multiple times on the\
  \ same target, even with the same trigger, affecting different memories. A single\
  \ casting of false alibi affects a creature only until the specified condition has\
  \ been triggered; once a condition has been triggered and the target's memory altered,\
  \ that condition no longer triggers this spell unless the victim is subject to another\
  \ casting of false alibithat specifies the same trigger."
