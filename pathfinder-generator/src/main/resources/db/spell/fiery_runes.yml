description: "You charge a weapon with a magic rune of fire. When the wielder of the\
  \ weapon successfully strikes a foe in melee with the weapon, the wielder can discharge\
  \ the rune as a swift action to deal 1d4+1 points of fire damage to the target.\
  \ This damage isn't multiplied on a critical hit. If the target has spell resistance,\
  \ you attempt a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance\
  \ when the rune is discharged. If the rune is successfully resisted, the spell is\
  \ dispelled; otherwise, the rune deals damage normally."
