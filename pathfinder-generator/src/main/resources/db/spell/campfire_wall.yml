description: "You can create a barrier around a fire of at least campfire size that\
  \ shelters everyone inside so long as the fire continues to burn. The barrier appears\
  \ as a crackling sphere of light and fire that is clearly visible, providing as\
  \ much illumination as a torch. The barrier bocks line of sight, granting creatures\
  \ on either side of the barrier total concealment from creatures on the other side.\
  \ Any object or creature passing through the barrier from outside takes 1d6 points\
  \ of fire damage and is also outlined with light equivalent to that of a torch,\
  \ for 1d6 minutes. Creatures outlined in this way are plainly visible regardless\
  \ of the light conditions and do not benefit from any sort of concealment, magical\
  \ or otherwise. The light is not bright enough to have any special effect on undead\
  \ or creatures vulnerable to light. Creatures inside the barrier can leave without\
  \ penalty, but if they try to return they suffer the same consequences as anyone\
  \ else. If the fire source at the barrier's center is extinguished or moved, the\
  \ spell ends."
