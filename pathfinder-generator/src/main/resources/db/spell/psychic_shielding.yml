    Effect: "The caster must begin this incantation at dusk or dawn, in a windowless\
      \ room with the intended target (if it is not the caster), surrounded by mithral\
      \ mirrors pointed inward. As the ritual concludes, the caster blows out a lantern\
      \ using the diamond dust, leaving her and the target in the darkened room. While\
      \ in the darkness, the caster must touch the ritual's target before exiting\
      \ the room. Then, for a number of days equal to the caster's character level,\
      \ the target gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against psychic spells and abilities,\
      \ but can't use any psychic magic abilities, can't cast psychic spells or use\
      \ psychic magic, and can't be engaged or engage in a psychic duel."
