name: "Damnation of Memory"
description: "You name one creature and excise all memory of that creature's involvement\
  \ in events the targets remember. The targets either forget who exactly performed\
  \ the named creature's deeds or assume some other individual performed them. Alternatively,\
  \ you can name either one event lasting no more than 10 minutes per caster level\
  \ or a single topic (defined at the GM's discretion) such as a shameful secret of\
  \ the king that was recently revealed or a small revolt that was quelled messily,\
  \ and erase all recollection of that subject from the minds of all creatures within\
  \ the area. Memory of facts and topics that are common knowledge (information with\
  \ a Knowledge check DC of 10 or less) cannot be stolen via this spell."
