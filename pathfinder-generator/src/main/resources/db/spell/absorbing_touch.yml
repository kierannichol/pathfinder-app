description: "You absorb the next object your hand touches into your body. If you\
  \ are already holding an object, you can attempt to absorb it; otherwise, you may\
  \ touch an object as a standard action separate from casting the spell. You can\
  \ absorb any nonmagical, nonliving object weighing no more than 1 pound per caster\
  \ level. A container and its contents count as a single object. Objects in the possession\
  \ of another creature receive a Fortitude saving throw to prevent absorption. You\
  \ may continue to attempt to absorb objects until one is absorbed."
