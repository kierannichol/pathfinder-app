name: "Maw of Chaos"
description: "This spell creates a rip in reality that plunges into the interspatial\
  \ vortices that constantly churn with the raw destructive chaos of the Abyss. Each\
  \ round at the beginning of your turn, the maw of chaos attempts a drag combat maneuver\
  \ check against every creature within 40 feet, using your caster level plus your\
  \ primary spellcasting ability modifier in place of a CMB. If a creature is dragged\
  \ into a maw of chaos, the area erupts in a surge of chaotic energy and the creature\
  \ takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level. Only one such eruption can occur\
  \ per round."
