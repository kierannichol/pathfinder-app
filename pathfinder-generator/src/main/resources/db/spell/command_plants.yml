name: "Command Plants"
description: "This spell allows you some degree of control over one or more plant\
  \ creatures. Affected plant creatures can understand you, and they perceive your\
  \ words and actions in the most favorable way (treat their attitude as friendly).\
  \ They will not attack you while the spell lasts. You can try to give a subject\
  \ orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything\
  \ it wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) A commanded plant never\
  \ obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something\
  \ very dangerous is worth doing."
