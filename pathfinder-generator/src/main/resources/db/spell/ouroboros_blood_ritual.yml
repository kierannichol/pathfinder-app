    Effect: "The caster uses the ouroboros blood to paint complex mathematical equations\
      \ on the ground surrounding a dead body (or if lacking a body, in the area where\
      \ the body was slain). Upon the ritual's completion, the dead body is restored\
      \ to life, as per true resurrection. Unlike that spell's limitation, there is\
      \ no limit as to how long the body has been dead before it can be restored to\
      \ life in this manner, but bodies whose souls have been judged and sent on to\
      \ the afterlife (GM's discretion) cannot be restored to life via this ritual.\
      \ A creature can be restored to life via an ouroboros blood ritual only once\
      \ through all time."
