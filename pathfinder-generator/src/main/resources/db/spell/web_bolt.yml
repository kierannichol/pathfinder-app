description: "You launch a ball of webbing at a target, which must make a save or\
  \ be affected as if by a webspell occupying only the creature's space. If the creature\
  \ saves or breaks free of the webbing, the remaining webs dissolve and the square\
  \ is not considered difficult terrain. The spell has no effect if the target is\
  \ not on or adjacent to a solid surface that can support the webbing."
