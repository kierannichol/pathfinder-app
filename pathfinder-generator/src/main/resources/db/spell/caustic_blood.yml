name: "Caustic Blood"
description: "You imbue your blood with corrosive acid. Any time you take piercing\
  \ or slashing damage, a spray of acidic blood spurts from your body in the direction\
  \ of the opponent who inflicted the wound, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage per\
  \ caster level (maximum 15d6, Reflex half). This spurt travels in a 10-foot line,\
  \ damaging the first creature or object it touches, with no splash damage. After\
  \ it contacts a creature or object, your acidic blood continues to burn that creature\
  \ for 1 round, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 7d6).\
  \ A second successful Reflex save negates this additional damage."
