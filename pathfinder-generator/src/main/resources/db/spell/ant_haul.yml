description: "The target's carrying capacity triples. This does not affect the creature's\
  \ actual Strength in any way, merely the amount of material it can carry while benefiting\
  \ from this spell. It also has no effect on encumbrance due to armor. If the creature\
  \ wears armor it still takes the normal penalties for doing so regardless of how\
  \ much weight the spell allows it to carry."
