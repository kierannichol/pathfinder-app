name: "Burning Sands"
description: "You cause sheets of hot sand to spread over the ground in the area of\
  \ effect. This layer of sand is 1 foot deep and constantly shifts and churns, transforming\
  \ the ground in the area into difficult terrain. The sand itself burns, and periodic\
  \ flames rise from the grit. While these flames cannot ignite objects, they deal\
  \ 1d4 points of fire damage to any creature that ends its turn in contact with the\
  \ ground within the area of effect. At the end of the duration, the sand vanishes,\
  \ leaving no aftereffects (other than damage dealt)."
