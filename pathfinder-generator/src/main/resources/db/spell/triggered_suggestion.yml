name: "Triggered Suggestion"
description: "This spell functions as suggestion, except you can use it only to specify\
  \ a condition that triggers a special activity, and the subject does not remember\
  \ that you made the suggestion. For example, you could use triggered suggestion\
  \ on a palace guard to make him attack the king the next time he and the king are\
  \ alone, and the guard would not remember the suggestion to do so until the trigger\
  \ occurred."
