name: "Stolen Light"
description: "Kreighton Shaine researched this spell from the fragmentary notes of\
  \ a Vudrani ascetic recorded in a strange tome, and rumors credit him with no fewer\
  \ than a dozen permanent stolen lightgems hidden in compartments and drawers in\
  \ his study. Stolen lightstores images within a gem. To store an image, as part\
  \ of casting you must touch a gem worth not less than 500 gp. You trap within the\
  \ gem an image of everything visible within a 30-foot cone measured from the gem,\
  \ in a direction of your choice. Alternatively, you can capture a less detailed\
  \ image of a single object within sight. Once the casting is complete, the gem turns\
  \ opaque, and the image inside cannot be seen. The stolen image remains within the\
  \ gem until released or dispelled."
