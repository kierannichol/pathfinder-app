description: "You create a small weightless sphere of pure negative energy. As a move\
  \ action, you can move it up to 30 feet per round in any direction. If it enters\
  \ a space with a living creature, it stops moving for the round and that creature\
  \ gains one negative level (Fortitude negates). Any creature passing through or\
  \ ending its turn in the space occupied by the sphere gains one negative level (Fortitude\
  \ negates). Twenty-four hours after gaining a negative level from the sphere, the\
  \ subject must make a Fortitude saving throw (the DC of this save is equal to the\
  \ DC of this spell) for each negative level. If the save succeeds, that negative\
  \ level is removed. If it fails, that negative level becomes permanent."
