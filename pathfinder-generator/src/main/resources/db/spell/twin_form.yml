description: "This extract splits a perfect double of yourself from your body, dressed\
  \ and equipped exactly as you are. You are able to shift your consciousness from\
  \ one body to the other once each round as a free action. This shift takes place\
  \ either immediately before your turn or immediately after it, but not during the\
  \ round. You may act normally in the body you inhabit. Your other self is treated\
  \ as though dazed, except it may take a single move action each round during your\
  \ turn. Your twin cannot speak while you are in your other body, and cannot flank,\
  \ make attacks of opportunity, or otherwise threaten enemies."
