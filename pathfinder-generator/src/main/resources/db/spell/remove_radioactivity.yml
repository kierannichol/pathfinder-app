name: "Remove Radioactivity"
description: "You remove all ongoing radiation effects, both primary and secondary,\
  \ on a single target if you succeed at a caster level check (DC = the Fortitude\
  \ DC associated with the radiation effect). In addition, you immediately restore\
  \ 1d4 points of Constitution drain and 1d4 points of Strength drain caused by radiation--this\
  \ spell cannot restore ability damage or drain caused by other sources. When cast\
  \ on an area, a single casting of remove radioactivity removes radiation from a\
  \ 20-foot-radius area around the point you touch. This spell has no power to negate\
  \ naturally radioactive materials, and as long as such materials remain in an area,\
  \ the radiation that was removed may return."
