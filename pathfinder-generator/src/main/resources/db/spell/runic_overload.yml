description: "This spell charges magical runes to an explosive degree. If cast on\
  \ a creature with magical runes on its body, such as a rune giant or a runescarred\
  \ creature (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lost Cities of Golarion 60), it deals 1d6\
  \ points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to the target and stuns\
  \ the target for 1 round. When the spell is cast in this way, it must overcome the\
  \ target's spell resistance. A successful Will save halves the damage and negates\
  \ the stun effect."
