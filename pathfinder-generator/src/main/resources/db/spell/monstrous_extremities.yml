name: "Monstrous Extremities"
description: "You change one of the extremities of the creature touched--arms or legs\
  \ only--into another shape of approximately the same size and mass. You can choose\
  \ a tentacle, a hoof, or a wing. The subject must take approximately 10 minutes\
  \ to familiarize itself with the function and movement of the new extremity to use\
  \ it properly. These new forms do not allow the subject to fly, run faster, or swim\
  \ better; however, they do act as natural weapons of the appropriate type, and the\
  \ subject can use them to make secondary attacks while making attacks with weapons\
  \ as a full-attack action. The secondary attacks are made using the creature's base\
  \ attack bonus â€“5 and adding only 1/2 the creature's Strength bonus on damage rolls.\
  \ The subject cannot hold a weapon or use any item that would ordinarily fit into\
  \ the slot of the changed extremity. The subject can receive the benefits of this\
  \ spell multiple times."
