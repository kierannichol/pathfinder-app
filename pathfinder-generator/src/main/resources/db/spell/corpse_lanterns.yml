name: "Corpse Lanterns"
description: "This spell functions as dancing lights, except it summons up to four\
  \ spheres of light, each of which glows a sickly pale green. These corpse lanternsshed\
  \ dim light in a 20-foot radius, and do not increase the light level in areas of\
  \ normal light or bright light. In dim or normal light, the radiance of corpse lanternsprovides\
  \ a strange contrast, giving all creatures in the area a â€“5 penalty on Stealth checks.\
  \ In addition, the hue interferes with illusion (pattern) spells, giving all creatures\
  \ in the illuminated area a +2 bonus on any saving throws against such spells. Unlike\
  \ dancing lights, you may have more than one corpse lanternsspell active at a time,\
  \ but you may only move one set in any given round. Moving the corpse lanternsdoes\
  \ not require concentration. Corpse lanterns can be made permanent on an area with\
  \ a permanencyspell by a caster of at least 11th level for the cost of 7,500 gp."
