description: "You ignore the physical detriments of being middle-aged. This spell\
  \ does not cause you to look younger, nor does it prevent you from dying of old\
  \ age, but as long as the spell is in effect, you ignore the â€“1 penalties to Strength,\
  \ Dexterity, and Constitution that accrue once you become middle-aged. You retain\
  \ the age-related bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma while under the\
  \ effects of this spell. Additional penalties that you accrue upon becoming old\
  \ or venerable apply in full."
