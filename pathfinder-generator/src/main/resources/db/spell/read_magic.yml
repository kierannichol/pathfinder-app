description: "You can decipher magical inscriptions on objects--books, scrolls, weapons,\
  \ and the like--that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not\
  \ normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the\
  \ case of a cursed or trapped scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you\
  \ have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular\
  \ writing without recourse to the use of read magic. You can read at the rate of\
  \ one page (250 words) per minute. The spell allows you to identify a glyph of warding\
  \ with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a greater glyph of warding with a DC 16 Spellcraft\
  \ check, or any symbol spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + spell level)."
