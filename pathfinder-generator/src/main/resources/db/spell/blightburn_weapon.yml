name: "Blightburn Weapon"
description: "You transform the target weapon into pure blightburn. The weapon functions\
  \ as normal, but any creature that touches it, or that it strikes, takes 2d6 points\
  \ of fire damage each round it remains in contact. In addition, the weapon emanates\
  \ an aura of radiation that causes blightburn sickness. This is as the disease (see\
  \ page 29), but with a 10-foot radius and a save DC equal to this spell's save DC."
