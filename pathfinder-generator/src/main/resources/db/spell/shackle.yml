description: "You summon a set of Small or Medium masterwork restraints into being.\
  \ When you cast this spell, you can choose whether the restraints are manacles or\
  \ fetters (manacles specifically designed to fit around the ankles). You also summon\
  \ the restraints' key to your person; the Disable Device DC to open the locked restraints\
  \ is equal to 15 + your caster level + the modifier of your primary casting ability\
  \ score. Typically, the restraints appear in your hands. However, as part of the\
  \ spell's casting, you can make a melee touch attack against a creature; if you\
  \ succeed and the creature then fails a Reflex saving throw against the spell's\
  \ DC, the locked fetters appear clasped on the creature or locked manacles clasp\
  \ you and the creature together. You can instead have manacles restrain the target's\
  \ limbs in front of or behind it. If you cast the spell as a full-round action,\
  \ you can make melee touch attacks against two creatures you can reach. If you succeed\
  \ at both attacks and both creatures fail their Reflex saving throws, you can cause\
  \ the set of manacles to bind the targets together."
