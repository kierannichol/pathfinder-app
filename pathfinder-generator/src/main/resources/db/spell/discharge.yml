description: "Discharge dissipates the charges from one technical object, temporarily\
  \ depowers one electrically powered technological object that does not use charges,\
  \ or severely hinders a creature with the robot subtype. If the spell targets an\
  \ object with charges, the object loses all of its remaining charges. If the object\
  \ is powered by electrical means other than charges, its functions are suppressed\
  \ for 1d4 rounds. If the spell targets a creature not of the robot subtype, it affects\
  \ a random charged or electrically powered item in that creature's possession. If\
  \ the target is a robot, the robot is staggered and cannot use any energy-based\
  \ attacks for 1d4 rounds. A robot that's affected by this spell receives a new saving\
  \ throw at the end of each round to shrug off the effect."
