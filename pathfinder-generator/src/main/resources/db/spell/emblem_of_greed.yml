description: "You transform one melee weapon into a burning glaive similar to the\
  \ ones wielded by the runelords of old. The target of your spell must be a masterwork\
  \ or magical melee weapon appropriate to your size. The weapon becomes a glaive\
  \ appropriate to your size and has a +1 enhancement bonus and the flaming weapon\
  \ special ability. When wielding the glaive, you are considered proficient with\
  \ it and use your caster level as your base attack bonus (which may give you multiple\
  \ attacks). When you reach caster level 14th, the glaive gains the spell-storing\
  \ weapon special ability. When you reach caster level 17th, it loses the flaming\
  \ weapon special ability, and gains the flaming burst weapon special ability. The\
  \ glaive's enhancement bonus increases to +2 at caster level 15th, and +3 at caster\
  \ level 19th."
