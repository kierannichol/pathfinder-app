name: "Floating Disk"
description: "You create a slightly concave, circular plane of force that follows\
  \ you about and carries loads for you. The disk is 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch\
  \ deep at its center. It can hold 100 pounds of weight per caster level. If used\
  \ to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons. The disk floats approximately\
  \ 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It floats along horizontally\
  \ within spell range and will accompany you at a rate of no more than your normal\
  \ speed each round. If not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant interval\
  \ of 5 feet between itself and you. The disk winks out of existence when the spell\
  \ duration expires. The disk also winks out if you move beyond its range or try\
  \ to take the disk more than 3 feet away from the surface beneath it. When the disk\
  \ winks out, whatever it was supporting falls to the surface beneath it."
