description: "Driving sleet blocks all sight (even darkvision) within it and causes\
  \ the ground in the area to be icy. A creature can walk within or through the area\
  \ of sleet at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it\
  \ can't move in that round, while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics\
  \ skill for details)."
