  \ and onto an ally within range; the target must be the same size and general shape\
  \ as you. This armor appears on the target's body fully formed and properly donned,\
  \ granting the creature the immediate benefit of its protection. If the target of\
  \ guardian armor was already wearing armor, the armor wearing it is removed from\
  \ the target's body and falls undamaged into an adjacent square."
