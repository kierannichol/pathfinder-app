name: "Lock Gaze"
description: "You compel the target to look at you and only you for the spell's duration\
  \ or until the spell is discharged. While staring at you, the target is considered\
  \ to be averting its eyes from every creature but you, granting creatures other\
  \ than you concealment against the target's attacks. If the target willingly leaves\
  \ your line of sight, it is blinded for 1 round and the spell ends. If you willingly\
  \ leave the target's line of sight or become unconscious or dead, the spell creature\
  \ suffers no ill effects. Blind creatures and creatures immune to gaze attacks are\
  \ immune to this spell."
