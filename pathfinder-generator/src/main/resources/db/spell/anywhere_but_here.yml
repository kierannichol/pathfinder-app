description: "This spell functions similarly to plane shift, but instead of transporting\
  \ the targets to a destination near an intended location on a specific plane, anywhere\
  \ but here transports affected creatures to a random plane. A creature can be affected\
  \ by anywhere but here only if it is currently not on its home plane (although targets\
  \ can, by chance, end up traveling to their home plane as a result of this spell).\
  \ Subjects always appear in a location that is not inherently harmful, but the exact\
  \ destination is otherwise random. The specific plane is determined by the table\
  \ below; the location on the destination plane where the transported creatures arrive\
  \ is completely subject to the GM's whim. d% Planar Destination 1-7 Abyss 8-14 Abaddon\
  \ 15-20 Hell 21-24 Shadow Plane 25-28 First World 29-35 Maelstrom 36-42 Boneyard\
  \ 43-49 Axis 50-56 Ethereal Plane 57-63 Elysium 64-70 Nirvana 71-77 Heaven 78-84\
  \ Astral Plane 85-90 Random demiplane 91-95 Material Plane (random world) 96-100\
  \ GM's choice A creature that is transported by anywhere but here cannot be affected\
  \ by a subsequent casting of anywhere but here for 24 hours afterward (but can be\
  \ affected normally by other forms of planar travel)."
