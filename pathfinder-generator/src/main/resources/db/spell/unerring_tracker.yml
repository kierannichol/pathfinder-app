description: "During this spell's duration, you can touch the sign of a creature's\
  \ passage that you have identified using the Survival skill to make the other steps\
  \ in the creature's path perfectly clear to you, no matter how minute. This trail\
  \ can't be more than 24 hours old. You can follow the trail at any speed, provided\
  \ you have line of sight to the trail. You can distinguish the trail of the particular\
  \ creature followed even if it joins and splits with other trails. Once you have\
  \ selected a trail to follow using this spell, it can't be changed."
