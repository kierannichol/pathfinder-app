description: "You set up a magical connection between two doors (or other physical\
  \ portals, such as windows) that both must be within range, line of sight, and line\
  \ of effect. During the spell's duration, you can move through one of the two portals.\
  \ When you do, you teleport to the other portal, emerging in either direction. Both\
  \ portals must be open and unobstructed when you cast the spell and enter the first\
  \ portal, and they both must be large enough for you to fit through, otherwise the\
  \ spell ends and the teleportation fails. You can bring along objects as long as\
  \ their combined weight doesn't exceed your maximum load."
