name: "Healing Leak"
description: "Whenever the target is affected by a spell or effect that heals hit\
  \ point damage through the use of positive or negative energy, it regains only half\
  \ the number of hit points it normally would recover. If the target employs a spell\
  \ or effect that heals itself or other creatures through the use of positive or\
  \ negative energy, the target must succeed at a concentration check (DC = this spell's\
  \ save DC) or the effect restores only half of the normal number of hit points.\
  \ Other forms of healing (such as from the Heal skill) are not affected by this\
  \ spell."
