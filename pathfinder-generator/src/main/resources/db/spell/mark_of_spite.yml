  \ the mark remains, you may injure yourself as a standard action, dealing a number\
  \ of points of damage equal to 1d8 plus your Strength modifier. The recipient of\
  \ the mark automatically takes twice the amount of damage that you deal to yourself,\
  \ bypassing any damage reduction, immunities, or resistances."
