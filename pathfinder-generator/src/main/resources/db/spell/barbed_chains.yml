name: "Barbed Chains"
description: "You summon a chain from another realm, causing it to burst out from\
  \ the ground and strike a target within the spell's range. You can have the chain\
  \ either make a melee attack (dealing 1d6 points of slashing damage) or attempt\
  \ a trip combat maneuver against the target. The chain uses your base attack bonus\
  \ plus your key spellcasting ability score modifier as its attack bonus and combat\
  \ maneuver bonus. On a successful hit or combat maneuver check, the target must\
  \ attempt a Will save. If it fails its save, the creature is shaken for 1d4 rounds.\
  \ You summon one additional chain every 3 levels after 1st, for a total of two chains\
  \ at 4th level, three at 7th level, and a maximum of four at 10th level. Multiple\
  \ chains can attack the same target but the shaken effect doesn't stack."
