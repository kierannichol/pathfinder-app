name: "Ice Armor"
description: "You create a suit of armor made of ice. While cold to the touch, it\
  \ does not harm the wearer, especially if worn over normal clothing (though it can\
  \ hasten the effects of exposure in cold environments). It offers the same protection\
  \ as a breastplate, except it has hardness 0 and 30 hit points. If the intended\
  \ wearer is immersed in water when you cast this spell, you may form the armor around\
  \ the wearer (who may be you); otherwise the wearer must don the armor normally.\
  \ Attacks against the wearer that create heat or fire degrade the armor, reducing\
  \ its armor bonus by 1 for every 5 points of fire damage the wearer takes; when\
  \ the armor's bonus to AC reaches 0, the armor is destroyed and the spell ends.\
  \ Because the ice is slightly buoyant, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus\
  \ on Swim checks, except when swimming downward. Druids can wear ice armor without\
  \ penalty."
