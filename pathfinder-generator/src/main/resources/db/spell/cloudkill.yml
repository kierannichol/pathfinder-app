description: "This spell generates a bank of fog, similar to a fog cloud, except that\
  \ its vapors are yellowish green and poisonous. These vapors automatically kill\
  \ any living creature with 3 or fewer HD (no save). A living creature with 4 to\
  \ 6 HD is slain unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save (in which case it takes 1d4\
  \ points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud)."
