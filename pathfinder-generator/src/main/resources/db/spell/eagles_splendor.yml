description: "The transmuted creature becomes more poised, articulate, and personally\
  \ forceful. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma, adding the usual\
  \ benefits to Charisma-based skill checks and other uses of the Charisma modifier.\
  \ Bards, paladins, and sorcerers (and other spellcasters who rely on Charisma) affected\
  \ by this spell do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Charisma,\
  \ but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this spell's effect do increase."
