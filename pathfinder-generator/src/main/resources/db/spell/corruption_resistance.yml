  \ that inflict damage based on the target creature's alignment, such as holy smite,\
  \ order's wrath, a paladin's smite evil attack, or an unholyweapon. Choose one alignment\
  \ type: chaos, evil, good, or law. The subject takes 5 less points of damage from\

  \ increases to 10 points at 7th level and 15 points at 11th level. The spell protects\
