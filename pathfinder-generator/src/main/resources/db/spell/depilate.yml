description: "This simple jinx causes a target's hair or fur to fall out in patchy\
  \ clumps, leaving the creature disheveled and less commanding. A jinxed creature\
  \ takes a â€“2 penalty on all Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Perform checks until the\
  \ hair begins to regrow 1 week later, or until the damage can be concealed with\
  \ a successful Disguise or Heal check (the DC is equal to the original save DC of\
  \ the spell). A successful break enchantment, remove curse, or similar effect instantly\
  \ regrows the target's hair or fur and removes the spell's effects."
