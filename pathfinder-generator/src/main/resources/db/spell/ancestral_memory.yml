description: "When you cast this spell, you open your mind to the vast experiences\
  \ of your ancestors in the hope of learning something pertinent about your current\
  \ situation. The chance of successfully finding an ancestral memory that is pertinent\
  \ is equal to 70% + your caster level. Failure indicates you merely gain a +5 insight\
  \ bonus on all Intelligence-based skill checks for the duration of the spell."
