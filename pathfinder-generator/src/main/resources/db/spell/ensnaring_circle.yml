    Effect: "This ritual requires the casters to create a large magic circle outlined\
      \ with the silver powder and shaped with the focus stylus. The circle must be\
      \ painstakingly molded to attune it to the alignment targeted (chaos, evil,\
      \ good, or law), which is chosen during the time of creation. The ritual gains\
      \ the descriptor of the alignment selected. Once the circle is complete, it\
      \ becomes invisible to all but the casters of the ritual or to creatures with\
      \ see invisibility, true seeing, or some other method of seeing invisible objects."
