description: "A blast of hellfire blazes from your hands. You can fire one ray, plus\
  \ one additional ray for every 4 caster levels beyond 11th (to a maximum of three\
  \ rays at 19th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals\
  \ 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Half the damage is fire\
  \ damage, but the other half results directly from unholy power and is therefore\
  \ not subject to being reduced by fire resistance. The rays can be fired at the\
  \ same target or at different targets, but all rays must be fired simultaneously\
  \ and aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other."
