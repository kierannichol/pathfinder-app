description: "You cause the targets to forget all but the most general information\
  \ about you. If they saw you or interacted with you, they still remember your presence\
  \ and your general shape (such as humanoid), as well as the gist of your interactions\
  \ with them (such as â€œShe was asking about the queen\"), but they don't remember\
  \ specifically what you said, details of your appearance, or any identifying information\
  \ about you. This spell targets any memories of you in the minute preceding its\
  \ casting, but is otherwise permanent."
