description: "As wall of force, except you create a hemispherical dome of force with\
  \ hardness 20 and a number of hit points equal to 10 per caster level. The bottom\
  \ edge of the dome forms a relatively watertight space if you are standing on a\
  \ reasonably flat surface. The dome shape means that falling debris (such as rocks\
  \ from a collapsing ceiling) tend to tumble to the side and pile up around the base\
  \ of the dome. If you make a DC 20 Craft (stonemasonry), Knowledge (engineering),\
  \ or Profession (architect or engineer) check, the debris is stable enough that\
  \ it retains its dome-like configuration when the spell ends, otherwise it collapses.\
  \ Normally this spell is used to buy time for dealing with avalanches, floods, and\
  \ rockslides, though it is also handy in dealing with ambushes."
