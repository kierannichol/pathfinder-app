description: "With a dark incantation and a gesture of your hand over your eyes, you\
  \ cause a shroud of darkness to descend upon the targets of this spell. The subjects\
  \ treat the light level as two steps lower than normal for the duration of this\
  \ spell. Bright light becomes dim light, normal light becomes darkness, and areas\
  \ of dim light and darkness become supernaturally dark (as darkness, but even creatures\
  \ with darkvision cannot see)."
