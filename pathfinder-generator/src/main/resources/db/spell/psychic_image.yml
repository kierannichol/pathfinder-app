name: "Psychic Image"
description: "You envelop your consciousness in a quasi-real image of yourself. Your\
  \ psychic image looks, sounds, and smells like you, but is intangible. While your\
  \ mind occupies the image, you control it as though it were your own body, but you\
  \ cannot directly affect physical objects. Your image moves with a fly speed of\
  \ 60 feet and perfect maneuverability. Your senses perceive only what the image\
  \ can see and hear while occupying it, and your own body is considered blind, deaf,\
  \ and helpless. You can switch between the image and your body as a swift action.\
  \ While your mind is in your body, the image is similarly helpless."
