description: "This spell functions as per claim identity, except it transforms its\
  \ target into a helpless, inanimate porcelain mask for the spell's duration. The\
  \ target remains aware of everything it can see or hear while transformed. The target\
  \ can't speak or move, but can still take purely mental actions (such as casting\
  \ certain spells) or be targeted by spells that affect its mind."
