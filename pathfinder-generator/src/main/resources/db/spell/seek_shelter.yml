description: "You send an empathic urge to seek safety both as fast as possible and\
  \ in an orderly fashion, and to remain in such secure locations for the duration\
  \ of the spell. Targets with 5 or more Hit Dice are unaffected. When you cast the\
  \ spell, you can designate a fortified location--either general (such as “indoors\"\
  ) or specific (such as “the local garrison\")--for the targets to attempt to reach.\
  \ If you do not specify a location for the targets to retreat to, they attempt to\
  \ find safety to the best of their ability. Affected creatures defend themselves\
  \ normally but attack only if provoked."
