description: "As long as the target is at least one size category smaller than you\
  \ are, it can merge harmlessly into your body while under the effect of this spell.\
  \ For the duration of this spell, you and the target can separate or merge at will\
  \ as a move action. While merged, your familiar or spirit animal can't be targeted\
  \ or affected by most attacks and effects, though it still suffers from ongoing\
  \ effects and their durations continue. It can be the recipient of effects that\
  \ originate from you."
