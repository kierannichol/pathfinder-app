description: "The scholars of the Magaambya claim that Old-Mage Jatembe developed\
  \ this spell to help eradicate the lost city of Ird, although such claims have never\
  \ been confirmed. This spell causes tall grass, weeds, and other plants to swell\
  \ into Gargantuan vines and tendrils that erupt from the ground, reaching for any\
  \ structure or any creature of evil alignment, functioning like black tentacles\
  \ except as noted. When you are determining the tendrils' CMB, the tendrils use\
  \ your caster level as their base attack bonus and have a +13 bonus due to their\
  \ Strength. Any tendril that succeeds in grappling a foe deals 4d6+13 points of\
  \ damage to the grappled creature. Additionally, the tendrils created by this spell\
  \ can detect evil auras, as if they had spent 3 rounds observing all creatures and\
  \ objects within the spell's area using detect evil, and attack and impede the movement\
  \ of only evil creatures, though they also attack any structures in their area.\
  \ Each structure suffers a single attack each round; your caster level acts as the\
  \ base attack bonus for these attacks, and the tendrils deal 4d6+13 points of damage\
  \ on each successful attack. Creatures that lack evil auras are not attacked or\
  \ impeded by this spell."
