description: "This spell creates an unearthly and infectious song that seductively\
  \ summons all who hear it. Nixie's lureaffects a maximum of 24 Hit Dice of creatures.\
  \ Creatures in the area who fail their saves are lured by the song and move toward\
  \ you using the most direct means available. If the path leads them into a dangerous\
  \ area such as through fire or off a cliff, the creatures each receive a second\
  \ saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Creatures lured by the\
  \ spell's song can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within\
  \ 5 feet of you simply stands still and for the duration of the spell remains fascinated."
