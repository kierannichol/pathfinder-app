    Effect: "This ritual must be performed in a place that holds a significance related\
      \ to weapons, such as an armory, an old battlefield, or a warrior's crypt. The\
      \ primary caster begins this ritual by mixing her blood with the diamond dust,\
      \ smearing each weapon with the mixture, and placing the weapons in a circle\
      \ around herself. The primary caster then holds each weapon and demonstrates\
      \ the weapon in a combat performance. After the primary caster finishes her\
      \ performance with a weapon, she places the weapon into the air in front of\
      \ her, now held in midair by her force of ego."
