description: "You determine whether a creature, object, or area has been poisoned\
  \ or is poisonous. You can determine the exact type of poison with a DC 20 Wisdom\
  \ check. A character with the Craft (alchemy) skill may try a DC 20 Craft (alchemy)\
  \ check if the Wisdom check fails, or may try the Craft (alchemy) check prior to\
  \ the Wisdom check. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch\
  \ of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it."
