description: "You call the spirits of two ancestors to manifest in the mortal world\
  \ and attack your enemies. Each appears as a transparent image of a powerful, wise\
  \ dwarf armed with a traditional dwarven weapon of your choice. These spirits move\
  \ and attack at your direction, each having the abilities of a spiritual weapon,\
  \ except they can attack different targets and deal physical damage (bludgeoning,\
  \ piercing, or slashing, according to the weapon the spirit wields) instead of force\
  \ damage. Like creatures conjured with a summon monster spell, your ancestors are\
  \ not harmed if these manifestations are destroyed."
