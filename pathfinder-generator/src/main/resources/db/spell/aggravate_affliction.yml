name: "Aggravate Affliction"
description: "All recurring afflictions (those with a frequency,including curses,\
  \ diseases, and poison) possessed by the targeted creature immediately trigger,\
  \ requiring an immediate saving throw (as described in the affliction) to avoid\
  \ suffering their effects. A successful saving throw does not count toward ending\
  \ the affliction, and this extra save does not change the timing of the next save\
  \ against the affliction. Afflictions without a frequency are unaffected by this\
  \ spell."
