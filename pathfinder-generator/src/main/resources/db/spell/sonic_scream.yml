description: "Up to three times during this spell's duration, you can emit a cone\
  \ of powerful sound as a standard action. The first cone deals 4d4 points of sonic\
  \ damage to every creature in the area. The second deals 2d4 points of sonic damage\
  \ to every creature in the area. The third deals 1d4 points of sonic damage to every\
  \ creature in the area. A successful Reflex save against a cone halves that cone's\
  \ damage. After the third cone of sound, the spell ends. Until you use all three\
  \ cones, you cannot use your voice for any magic-related purpose (bardic performance,\
  \ verbal spellcasting, and so on), and cannot speak at any volume lower than a shout."
