description: "Those in this spell's area who fail their Will saving throws harbor\
  \ a faint sense of paranoia and evoke the same feeling in others for the duration\
  \ of the spell. Domesticated animals (not including familiars and animal companions)\
  \ don't willingly approach affected creatures unless the animal's master succeeds\
  \ at a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. Affected creatures take\
  \ a â€“4 penalty on Handle Animal, Ride, and wild empathy checks against familiars,\
  \ animal companions, animal cohorts, and other permanent companions provided by\
  \ class abilities for the spell's duration. Anyone an affected creature interacts\
  \ with must succeed at a Will save or have its initial attitude automatically worsened\
  \ by one step for the spell's duration. Every time an affected creature attempts\
  \ a Sense Motive check to get a hunch or detect a Bluff from another creature (or\
  \ vice versa), it must succeed at a Will save or automatically assume the other\
  \ party is lying or otherwise harbors ill will against it. Each time this spell\
  \ causes an affected creature (or someone interacting with the affected creature)\
  \ to attempt a Will saving throw, the spell's hauntlike manifestation occurs."
