description: "This functions as per animus mine, except the triggering creature is\
  \ stunned for 1d4 rounds instead of staggered. If the target succeeds at a Will\
  \ saving throw, it takes only half damage and negates the stunned effect. If the\
  \ target fails this Will saving throw, you automatically succeed at any saving throw\
  \ against the mind-affecting effect that triggered the mine."
