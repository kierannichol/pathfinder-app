description: "When under the effects of this spell, your face and body appear subtly\
  \ wrong, though you are still recognizable as yourself. You gain a +4 circumstance\
  \ bonus on Intimidate checks but take a â€“4 penalty on Diplomacy checks. As long\
  \ as this spell's effects persist, you can reveal the face under your face as a\
  \ standard action, assaulting the senses of a single living creature within 30 feet\
  \ that can see you. A targeted creature must succeed at a Will save against the\
  \ DC of this spell or be subject to one of the following effects (your choice).\
  \ Every time you use this ability, you reduce the remaining duration of this spell\
  \ by 10 minutes. The affected creature takes 1 point of Wisdom damage. The affected\
  \ creature is paralyzed with revulsion for 1 round. The affected creature is sickened\
  \ with disgust for 1d6 rounds. The affected creature takes 1d6 points of nonlethal\
  \ damage as its senses are overwhelmed."
