name: "Wind Wall"
description: "An invisible vertical curtain of wind appears. It is 2 feet thick and\
  \ of considerable strength. It is a roaring blast sufficient to blow away any bird\
  \ smaller than an eagle, or tear papers and similar materials from unsuspecting\
  \ hands. (A Reflex save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object.) Tiny\
  \ and Small flying creatures cannot pass through the barrier. Loose materials and\
  \ cloth garments fly upward when caught in a wind wall. Arrows and bolts are deflected\
  \ upward and miss, while any other normal ranged weapon passing through the wall\
  \ has a 30% miss chance. (A giant-thrown boulder, a siege engine projectile, and\
  \ other massive ranged weapons are not affected.) Gases, most gaseous breath weapons,\
  \ and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through the wall (although it is no\
  \ barrier to incorporeal creatures)."
