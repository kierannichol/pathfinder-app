name: "Trap the Soul"
description: "Trap the soul forces a creature's life force (and its material body)\
  \ into a gem. The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem is\
  \ broken and the life force is released, which allows the material body to reform.\
  \ If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane, it can be required\
  \ to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can\
  \ go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken."
