description: "You trap the target in an object decorated with the holy symbols of\
  \ your god or faith. While trapped in the object, the creature can't take any actions\
  \ and is immune to spells and spell-like abilities. The creature remains permanently\
  \ trapped in the object as long the object remains in your possession. Only a freedom,\
  \ miracle, or wish spell can dispel the enchantment, though destroying the object\
  \ frees the creature."
