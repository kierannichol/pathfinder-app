description: "This spell was first created as a minor parlor trick, but adventuring\
  \ Caydenites have repurposed and improved on it for use on their travels. For the\
  \ duration of the spell, as a standard action you can touch a willing target to\
  \ deliver 1 dose of a potable liquid (including alcoholic drinks and potions and\
  \ elixirs, but not poisons or other liquids that are primarily harmful when drunk)\
  \ in your possession (though not necessarily held in hand) into her."
