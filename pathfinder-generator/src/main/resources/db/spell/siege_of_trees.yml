name: "Siege of Trees"
description: "You imbue inanimate plants with limited mobility and a semblance of\
  \ life. Each plant targeted acts as a light catapult until the end of the spell's\
  \ duration, though you must spend a standard action to aim each of these tree catapults\
  \ before the first time they fire, and anytime thereafter when you want the trees\
  \ to fire at a new target. The catapult uses your caster level as its targeting\
  \ bonus. With a free action, you can command one or all of the trees under your\
  \ command to stop firing. You do not need to supply ammunition to these tree catapults;\
  \ they will automatically load themselves with rocks and boulders in the area, digging\
  \ them deep from the ground if need be. You can supply the trees ammunition if you\
  \ desire. The tree will not load flaming ammunition, and these catapult trees cannot\
  \ be affected by energy siege shotif the energy selected is fire."
