name: "Song of Discord"
description: "This spell causes those within the area to turn on each other rather\
  \ than attack their foes. Each affected creature has a 50% chance to attack the\
  \ nearest target each round. (Roll to determine each creature's behavior every round\
  \ at the beginning of its turn.) A creature that does not attack its nearest neighbor\
  \ is free to act normally for that round. Creatures forced by a song of discord\
  \ to attack their fellows employ all methods at their disposal, choosing their deadliest\
  \ spells and most advantageous combat tactics. They do not, however, harm targets\
  \ that have fallen unconscious."
