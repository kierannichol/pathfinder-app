description: "You plunge the targets' minds into a veiled immersive mindscape (see\
  \ page 235) of your own design. You can affect any number of creatures whose combined\
  \ total Hit Dice do not exceed 30. A creature of 10 HD or fewer gets no saving throw,\
  \ one of 11â€“15 HD escapes after 10 minutes per level you possess on a successful\
  \ save, and a creature of 16 HD or more negates the effect on a successful save.\
  \ Given time, the bodies of creatures whose minds are trapped in a microcosm can\
  \ die of starvation and thirst without care. Creatures can neither escape from nor\
  \ enter a microcosm, even via a mindscape door. Microcosm can be ended only by miracle\
  \ or wish."
