description: "When you cast this spell on a weapon, you cause an extradimensional\
  \ space to open within the weapon. As part of the casting, you can insert a single\
  \ magic rod or magic staff into the weapon's extradimensional space, after which\
  \ the space closes. For the spell's duration, a character wielding the transmuted\
  \ weapon is also considered to be wielding the rod or staff as well. If the rod\
  \ or staff can be used to make attacks, you can attack normally with the weapon\
  \ or use the weapon as if it were the merged rod or staff. If the effect created\
  \ by the rod or staff requires an attack roll to successfully strike a foe, you\
  \ can make the attack roll as if you were making an attack with the weapon at its\
  \ highest bonus (including any bonuses the weapon would normally receive) rather\
  \ than just a normal attack with the rod or staff--doing so does not allow you to\
  \ add the weapon's damage to the attack, but instead allows you to use your skill\
  \ with the weapon to boost your chance of hitting with the rod or staff's attack,\
  \ spell, or effect."
