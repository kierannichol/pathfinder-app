description: "All targets are rendered silent, as per silence. The silence affects\
  \ the entirety of each creature but does not extend beyond. However, the silence\
  \ is one-way--sounds from outside the creatures' spaces can still enter. Quieted\
  \ creatures gain a +10 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks."
