description: "A sense of euphoria suffuses the target, amplifying all sensations,\
  \ good or bad. The target creature gains a +2 competence bonus on Diplomacy, Handle\
  \ Animal, Perform, and Sense Motive checks. In addition, the DC for any spells or\
  \ effects with the emotion or pain descriptors cast or caused by the target increases\
  \ by 1 while the target is under the effects of the spell. However, increased sensitivity\
  \ causes the target to take a â€“2 penalty on saving throws against spells and effects\
  \ with the emotion or pain descriptor."
