name: "Creeping Ice"
description: "This spell covers the floor, the ground, or some other calm horizontal\
  \ surface (such as a placid lake or a gentle river) with a sheet of slowly growing\
  \ ice. The initial sheet of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects\
  \ or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. The ice is\
  \ hard, strong, and opaque, and is 1 inch thick per caster level. The ice is strong\
  \ enough to support the weight of a typical horse, making it possible for creatures\
  \ to cross a body of water."
