name: "Awaken"
description: "You awaken a tree or animal to human-like sentience. To succeed, you\
  \ must make a Will save (DC 10 + the animal's current HD, or the HD the tree will\
  \ have once awakened). The awakened animal or tree is friendly toward you. You have\
  \ no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken, although it serves\
  \ you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it. If you\
  \ cast awaken again, any previously awakened creatures remain friendly to you, but\
  \ they no longer undertake tasks for you unless it is in their best interests."
