description: "You cast this spell on one or more gold pieces, which make those who\
  \ have them more vulnerable to your magics. A creature with one or more of these\
  \ gold pieces in its possession must attempt a Will save (at this spell's save DC)\
  \ the first time the creature is forced to attempt a saving throw against a spell,\
  \ spell-like ability, or supernatural ability you create. If the creature fails,\
  \ it takes a â€“2 penalty on all saving throws against your magic effects as long\
  \ as the gold piece is in its possession. Additionally, if it fails a saving throw\
  \ against a magic ability of yours that is not harmless and has a duration, the\
  \ duration is doubled for that creature."
