name: "Thorn Javelin"
description: "A wooden thorn the size of a javelin (appropriate for your size) appears\
  \ in your open hand. You can wield this thorn as a javelin, and you are proficient\
  \ in its use. Any creature struck by the javelin must succeed at a Fortitude save\
  \ or be sickened for 1 round. If you throw the javelin, another one appears in your\
  \ hand. Any javelin that leaves your grasp disappears at the end of your turn. Each\
  \ javelin attack you make reduces the spell's remaining duration by 1 minute. If\
  \ an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends\
  \ after that attack resolves."
