description: "This spell functions like shadow conjuration, except that it duplicates\
  \ any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or conjuration (creation) spell\
  \ of 6th level or lower. The illusory conjurations created deal three-fifths (60%)\
  \ damage to nonbelievers, and nondamaging effects are 60% likely to work against\
  \ nonbelievers."
