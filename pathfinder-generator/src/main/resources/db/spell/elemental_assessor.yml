description: "Azata champions developed this spell to deal with fiends with unknown\
  \ resistances. A ray of spiraling colors springs from your hand and streaks to its\
  \ target. You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit your target with\
  \ the ray, which deals 2d6 points of acid damage, 2d6 points of cold damage, 2d6\
  \ points of electricity damage, and 2d6 points of fire damage. The type of energy\
  \ that does the most points of damage to the target then persists, dealing another\
  \ 4d6 points of that type of damage per round for 1d4 rounds."
