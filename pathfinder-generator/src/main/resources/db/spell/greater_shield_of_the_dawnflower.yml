name: "Greater Shield of the Dawnflower"
description: "You create a disk of sunlight on one arm. Any creature that strikes\
  \ you with a melee attack deals normal damage, but also takes 1d6 points of damage\
  \ + 1 point per caster level. Half of this damage is fire damage and half is holy\
  \ damage (as the spell flame strike). An undead creature or a creature particularly\
  \ vulnerable to light that hits you instead takes 2d6 points of damage +1 point\
  \ per caster level. Creatures with reach weapons are not subject to this damage\
  \ if they attack you. The shield provides illumination equivalent to a daylightspell.\
  \ You can have only one instance of this spell in effect at a time. It does not\
  \ stack with similar damaging aura spells such as fire shield or shield of the Dawnflower(The\
  \ Inner Sea World Guide296)."
