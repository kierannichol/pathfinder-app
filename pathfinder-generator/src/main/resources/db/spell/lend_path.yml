description: "You temporarily transfer one of your mythic path abilities to another\
  \ creature, which can use it as if it were part of the creature's own path. If the\
  \ target is unable to expend mythic power, it can't activate any part of the ability\
  \ that requires expending uses of mythic power, but the ability otherwise functions\
  \ as if the creature were 1st tier."
