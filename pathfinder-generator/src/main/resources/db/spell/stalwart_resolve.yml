name: "Stalwart Resolve"
description: "Stalwart resolve was originally created to temporarily aid those suffering\
  \ from certain afflictions. The recipient of stalwart resolve ignores the effects\
  \ of ability damage and penalties to a single ability score of your choice, except\
  \ that damage equal to or greater than the ability score still causes unconsciousness\
  \ or death. This applies whether or not the ability damage or penalty happened before\
  \ or during the spell's duration, and whether or not multiple sources are involved.\
  \ This spell has no effect on ability drain."
