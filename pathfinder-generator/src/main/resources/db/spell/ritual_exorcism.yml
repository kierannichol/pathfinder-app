    Effect: "You force the life force of a possessing creature to leave its host.\
      \ Upon the completion of this ritual, the possessing creature attempts a Will\
      \ saving throw. If it fails the save, the possessor is expelled, as if the duration\
      \ of the spell or effect it used to possess the target had expired. If the possessing\
      \ creature succeeds at the save, it continues to stay within the host creature\
      \ or object, though the ritual can be attempted anew as long as the possessed\
      \ creature is helpless or the object restrained."
