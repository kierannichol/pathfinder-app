name: "Painful Revelation"
description: "You augment an ongoing illusion effect to strike out painfully at creatures\
  \ that see through it. When a creature successfully disbelieves an illusion that\
  \ is the target of painful revelation, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage for\
  \ every 2 caster levels you have (maximum 10d6) and is staggered for 1d4 rounds.\
  \ A successful Will save reduces the nonlethal damage by half and negates the staggered\
  \ effect. Once painful revelation has been triggered, the spell ends."
