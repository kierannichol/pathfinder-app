description: "You draw motes of essence from material native to a plane that has elemental\
  \ or energy essence traits (Pathfinder RPG Planar Adventures 60), weaving the essence\
  \ together into a shield of force. Choose an essence trait from the list below;\
  \ the material component for this spell must come from a plane that has the essence\
  \ trait you chose. Each essence trait has an associated damage type (see the table\
  \ below). Any creature that hits you with a non-reach melee weapon, natural weapon,\
  \ or unarmed attack takes 3d6 points of damage plus 1 point per caster level you\
  \ have (maximum +20) of a type corresponding to the essence trait you chose. In\
  \ addition, you take only half damage from attacks or effects of the associated\
  \ damage type, and if such an attack or effect allows a saving throw for half damage,\
  \ you take no damage on a successful saving throw."
