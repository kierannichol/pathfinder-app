name: "Violent Accident"
description: "You curse the target to suffer a violent accident within the next 24\
  \ hours. You have no control over the form the accident takes or when it strikes.\
  \ The target can avoid being cursed with spell resistance when you cast the spell,\
  \ but otherwise receives no saving throw. Regardless of the accident's nature, it\
  \ is magically empowered to deal an amount of damage equal to 1d8 Ã— your caster\
  \ level (maximum 5d8 points of damage), and the damage is of a type appropriate\
  \ to the source of damage (such as fire for an explosion or bludgeoning for a falling\
  \ object). When the accident occurs, the target can attempt a Reflex saving throw\
  \ to reduce the damage by half. Although others might be surprised or inconvenienced\
  \ by the accident, it damages only the target."
