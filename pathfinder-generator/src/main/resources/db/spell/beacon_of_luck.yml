description: "You send out a burst of luck with a 30-foot radius centered around you.\
  \ While the beacon of luck is in effect, you gain a +2 sacred bonus on all saving\
  \ throws. As an immediate action before a saving throw is made, allies within the\
  \ area can choose to benefit from this luck, rolling twice for a saving throw and\
  \ taking the better result. Once a creature benefits from the beacon of luck in\
  \ this way, it cannot gain the benefit of this spell for 24 hours."
