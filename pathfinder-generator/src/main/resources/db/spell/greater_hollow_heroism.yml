description: "This spell functions as greater heroism, except that you can reverse\
  \ the spell by issuing a special command as a standard action if you are within\
  \ medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) of the target. The target loses\
  \ the bonuses and instead takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and\
  \ skill checks until the spell's duration ends (no save), increasing to a –8 penalty\
  \ against fear effects. Additionally, she takes damage equal to your caster level\
  \ when you reverse the spell."
