description: "You cause the target's mind to unleash a vast overflowing torrent of\
  \ information throughout the target's body, causing the target's synapses to violently\
  \ trigger. The target takes 1d6 points of electrical damage per caster level (maximum\
  \ 15d6) and is staggered for 1 minute. A successful Fortitude saving throw doesn't\
  \ reduce the damage, but it negates the staggered effect."
