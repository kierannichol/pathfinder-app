description: "All creatures within the area gain the effects of a protection from\
  \ technology spell. Creatures in the area, or that later enter the area, receive\
  \ only one attempt to suppress technological effects that are controlling them.\
  \ If a creature succeed at this save, such effects are suppressed as long as the\
  \ creature remains in the area. Creatures that leave the area and then return are\
  \ not protected. Robots receive a saving throw and spell resistance to avoid being\
  \ kept at bay, but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from\
  \ mental control apply to non-technological creatures in the area even if a robot\
  \ succeeds at its saving throw and is thus able to enter the area."
