name: "Preserve"
description: "You imbue one or more objects with magic that dramatically slows down\
  \ natural processes that lead to decay and spoilage. For the duration of the spell,\
  \ food, water, plants, and other perishable objects affected by the spell remain\
  \ as fresh as they were when the spell was cast. The spell also protects these objects\
  \ against spells of the same level or lower that cause spoilage, such as putrefy\
  \ food and drinkAPG. When the duration of preserve expires, the objects resume aging\
  \ at their normal rate. The spell also works on severed body parts and the bodies\
  \ of small creatures as per gentle repose, provided that the weight of the creature\
  \ or part does not exceed the spell's limit."
