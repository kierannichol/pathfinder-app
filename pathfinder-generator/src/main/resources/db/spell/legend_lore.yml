description: "Legend lore brings to your mind legends about an important person, place,\
  \ or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question,\
  \ the casting time is only 1d4 Ã— 10 minutes. If you have only detailed information\
  \ on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting\
  \ lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information\
  \ to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better legend lore\
  \ result next time). If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and\
  \ the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more\
  \ detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time)."
