name: "Peace Bond"
description: "This spell creates one glowing rune of peace, plus one per 2 caster\
  \ levels above 1st (to a maximum of five runes at 9th level). An identical symbol\
  \ appears on your forehead for the duration of the spell and cannot be disguised\
  \ (though it is visible only if you are visible). Each rune illuminates a 5-foot\
  \ cube, preventing any spell you cast of up to 3rd level and that has a defined\
  \ area (as opposed to targets or an effect) from entering or affecting the 5-foot\
  \ cube. For example, creatures and items within any square affected by peace bond\
  \ take no damage from a fireball you cast. However, if you cast stinking cloud,\
  \ the noxious vapors are an effect and enter such cubes normally. This spell does\
  \ not break line of effect within any other spells you cast; it simply negates all\
  \ effects of your 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-level area spells within the peace bond's area.\
  \ Peace bond offers no protection against your spell-like abilities or supernatural\
  \ area effects."
