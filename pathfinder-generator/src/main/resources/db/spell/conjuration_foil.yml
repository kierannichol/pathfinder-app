description: "All creatures in the area gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against teleportation\
  \ effects. If any creature would enter or depart the area via a summoning or teleportation\
  \ effect, that creature takes 1d6 points of damage per spell level of the triggering\
  \ effect (or half the HD of the originating creature if the effect has no spell\
  \ level) and arrives in a random similar location within the triggering effect's\
  \ range, rather than the intended destination."
