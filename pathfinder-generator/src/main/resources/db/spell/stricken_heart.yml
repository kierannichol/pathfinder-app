description: "This spell covers your hand with a writhing black aura. As part of casting\
  \ the spell, you can make a melee touch attack that deals 2d6 points of negative\
  \ energy damage and causes the target to be staggered for 1 round. If the attack\
  \ is a critical hit, the target is staggered for 1 minute instead. Creatures immune\
  \ to precision damage are immune to the staggered effect."
