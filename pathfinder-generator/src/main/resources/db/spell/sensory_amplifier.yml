  \ Perception checks. Sighted creatures gain low-light vision, and creatures with\
  \ a sense of smell gain scent. In addition, the first time each round that a creature\
  \ in the area takes damage, it takes an additional 2d6 points of damage of the same\
  \ type. Despite being within the area, the caster does not take this extra damage."
