description: "You increase the natural heat within your body, transferring it to your\
  \ weapons and armor. As a swift action, you may grant one of your natural or manufactured\
  \ weapons the flaming special ability for 1 round. If you have the fire subtype,\
  \ your weapon instead gains the flaming burst special ability. If the weapon leaves\
  \ your hand for any reason, it loses the flaming (or flaming burst) special ability\
  \ until you spend a swift action to activate it again. You can only have stoke the\
  \ inner fire active on one weapon at a time, and spending a swift action to imbue\
  \ a second weapon with the spell's power immediately ends its effect on the first\
  \ weapon."
