    Effect: "As the primary caster traces warped runes in the air, this ritual twists\
      \ and reshapes the target giant with arcane energies and etches runes into the\
      \ giant's flesh. This agonizing process deals the giant 1d6 points of damage\
      \ per character level of the primary caster. Upon completion of the ritual,\
      \ the giant must succeed at Fortitude save or be transformed into an inverted\
      \ giant. If the giant succeeds at the save, it takes a cumulative â€“2 penalty\
      \ on its Fortitude saves against this ritual for the next week."
