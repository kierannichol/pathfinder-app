name: "Contest of Skill"
description: "The randomness of critical hits has long vexed certain duelists in the\
  \ Aldori school who consider luck to be an unwelcome addition to duels, which they\
  \ view as contests of skill rather than chance. The creature targeted by this spell\
  \ is infused with magical power, altering the odds of combat to weaken lucky strikes.\
  \ Critical threats made by the affected creature automatically fail to confirm.\
  \ Critical threats that automatically confirm due to class features or feats, such\
  \ as the fighter's weapon mastery, are unaffected by this spell."
