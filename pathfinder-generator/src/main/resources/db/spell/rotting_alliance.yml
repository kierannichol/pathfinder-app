description: "You curse two or more creatures to sicken and waste away while in each\
  \ others' company. Each target that fails a Fortitude save becomes cursed with a\
  \ wasting sickness. The disease has no onset period, and those who contracted it\
  \ must attempt a second Fortitude save immediately. A target that fails this second\
  \ saving throw takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage and 1d6 points of Charisma\
  \ damage. Every day thereafter, each target that was within 100 feet of another\
  \ target during the previous 24 hours takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage and\
  \ 1d6 points of Charisma damage (reroll to determine the specific amount of damage\
  \ each day). A successful Fortitude save negates the damage for that day only."
