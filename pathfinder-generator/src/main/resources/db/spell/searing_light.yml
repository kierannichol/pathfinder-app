description: "Focusing divine power like a ray of the sun, you project a blast of\
  \ light from your open palm. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike\
  \ your target. A creature struck by this ray of light takes 1d8 points of damage\
  \ per two caster levels (maximum 5d8). An undead creature takes 1d6 points of damage\
  \ per caster level (maximum 10d6), and an undead creature particularly vulnerable\
  \ to bright light takes 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8). A\
  \ construct or inanimate object takes only 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels\
  \ (maximum 5d6)."
