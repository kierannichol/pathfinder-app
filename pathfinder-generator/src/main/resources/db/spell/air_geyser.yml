description: "You create a powerful blast of air capable of flinging an opponent upward.\
  \ If the target fails its Reflex save, the force of the air deals 2d6 points of\
  \ bludgeoning damage and hurls the target upward a number of feet equal to 5 Ã— your\
  \ caster level. If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered, the target\
  \ strikes the object in the same manner as it would during a normal fall. After\
  \ this blast of air ceases, the target falls down (unless it was flying), taking\
  \ falling damage as normal. A successful save means the target takes half damage\
  \ from the air blast but is not moved by it."
