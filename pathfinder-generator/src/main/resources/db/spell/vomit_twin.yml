name: "Vomit Twin"
description: "Upon casting this spell, you vomit forth a disgusting ooze copy of yourself\
  \ into a single adjacent square. As long as the twin exists, whenever you take a\
  \ move action to move, the twin can move as well, although it does not need to follow\
  \ you and cannot take any other actions. On subsequent rounds, at the start of your\
  \ turn, you can instantaneously exchange places with your twin, as if using teleport.\
  \ This is not an action and does not provoke an attack of opportunity."
