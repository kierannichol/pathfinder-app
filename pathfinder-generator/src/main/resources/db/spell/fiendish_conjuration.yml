    Effect: "The first 20 minutes of the ritual of fiendish conjuration involve preparing\
      \ the conjuration circle and inscribing the appropriate names around the circle.\
      \ This step involves attempting both Linguistics checks; if the conjuration\
      \ circle is permanently inscribed and has been successfully used for this ritual\
      \ at any point in the past, these Linguistics checks are attempted with a +5\
      \ bonus. The next 30 minutes of the ritual invokes the fiend, involving the\
      \ Knowledge and Spellcraft checks; if the fiend's true name is used, these checks\
      \ are attempted with a +5 bonus. At the start of the final 40 minutes, the smoky,\
      \ indistinct shape of the fiend manifests within the circle, at which point\
      \ the caster must attempt the final four Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks.\
      \ Once this stage is reached, the fiend manifests in the flesh at the end of\
      \ the ritual regardless of the ritual's success or failure, but only if the\
      \ ritual is successful is the fiend trapped within the conjuration circle and\
      \ unable to visit harm upon the caster."
