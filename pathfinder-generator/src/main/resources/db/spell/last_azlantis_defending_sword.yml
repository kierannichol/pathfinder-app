name: "Last Azlanti's Defending Sword"
description: "You create a sword of force that functions as mage's sword except as\
  \ described here. The sword does not receive the additional +3 enhancement bonus\
  \ a mage's sword receives, and deals 3d6 points of force damage. You cannot command\
  \ the sword. Until the sword is triggered, it hovers in your space without interfering\
  \ with your actions. While hovering in this way, the sword attempts to defend you\
  \ from incoming attacks, granting you a +4 shield bonus to your AC. The first time\
  \ a foe within close range damages you or forces you to attempt a saving throw that\
  \ you fail, the sword is triggered and begins attacking that target as described\
  \ in mage's sword for the duration of the spell. This ends the shield bonus. You\
  \ cannot direct the sword to defend against a new target once it has begun to attack.\
  \ If its target moves beyond the sword's range, the sword returns to you and hovers\
  \ until the target is again within range. The sword's return does not restore the\
  \ spell's shield bonus to AC."
