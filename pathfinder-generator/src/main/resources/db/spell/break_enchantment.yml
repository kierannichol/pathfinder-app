description: "This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and curses.\
  \ Break enchantment can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect,\
  \ you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC\
  \ of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of\
  \ the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is equal to the DC\
  \ of the curse."
