    Effect: "As the ritual begins, the secondary casters each hold one end of their\
      \ golden threads while the other is tied to the doll. The secondary casters\
      \ stretch both arms out toward each other and rhythmically chant their common\
      \ values (this often involves cult or guild members repeating membership vows).\
      \ The primary caster ties the doll to her wrist with her golden thread. She\
      \ then approaches each of the secondary casters in turn and touches them on\
      \ the forehead with the focus doll. Unlike with normal occult rituals, adding\
      \ more than four secondary casters does not increase the bonus those casters\
      \ provide to the ritual's required skill checks."
