  \ wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or object.\

  \ if a section is destroyed, the remaining lava in the wall immediately fills in\
  \ any such hole created, reducing the wall's overall size by one 5-foot square but\
  \ remaining a contiguous barrier. Each time a weapon strikes a wall of lava, it\
  \ takes 2d6 points of fire damage (or the creature who strikes the wall takes 2d6\
  \ fire damage if the attack was via an unarmed strike or natural attack)."
