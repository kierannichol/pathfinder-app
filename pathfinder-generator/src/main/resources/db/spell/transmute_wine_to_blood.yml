name: "Transmute Wine to Blood"
description: "You transform one bottle of fine wine into 1 pint of animal blood, sufficient\
  \ for a creature with the blood drain ability to feed upon as if it came from a\
  \ Medium animal with 1 Hit Die. If you are using the optional hunger rules (see\
  \ page 22), this blood satiates an undead creature's hunger, negating any withdrawal\
  \ effects, but does not grant the creature a feeding bonus. The blood coagulates\
  \ and spoils at the normal rate."
