name: "Neutral Buoyancy"
description: "The target's buoyancy becomes and stays neutral, regardless of how dense\
  \ the target and its gear are. Among other effects, the target neither sinks nor\
  \ rises when it doesn't attempt a Swim check, making it easier to stay put while\
  \ performing demanding actions or when helpless or disabled, and the target can\
  \ swim up and down with equal ease."
