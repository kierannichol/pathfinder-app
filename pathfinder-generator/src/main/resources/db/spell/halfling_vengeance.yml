description: "You grant the touched target the ability to ascertain the weaknesses\
  \ of foes. The target deals an additional 1d6 points of precision damage on successful\
  \ attacks with daggers or slings against foes within 30 feet, as long as the attacked\
  \ foe is denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class or is flanked by the target.\
  \ This additional damage increases by 1d6 for every 4 caster levels you have beyond\
  \ 3rd, to a maximum of 5d6 at 19th level. This bonus damage is precision damage\
  \ and stacks with other sources of precision damage, such as sneak attack. This\
  \ bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit."
