name: "Gentle Repose"
description: "You preserve the remains of a dead creature so that they do not decay.\
  \ Doing so effectively extends the time limit on raising that creature from the\
  \ dead (see raise dead). Days spent under the influence of this spell don't count\
  \ against the time limit. Additionally, this spell makes transporting a slain (and\
  \ thus decaying) comrade less unpleasant."
