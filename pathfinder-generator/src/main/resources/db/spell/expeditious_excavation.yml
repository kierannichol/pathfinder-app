name: "Expeditious Excavation"
description: "You can excavate and move earth, dust, and sand up to the size of a\
  \ 5-foot cube. If you are buried, you may open a 5-foot cube around yourself, but\
  \ the spell cannot be used for tunneling. Besides its mundane applications, you\
  \ can open a 5-foot-deep pit at a creature's feet. A Medium or smaller creature\
  \ falls prone in the pit unless it succeeds on a Reflex save. With a successful\
  \ save, it can choose to land harmlessly on its feet in the pit or hop to an adjacent\
  \ square; this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A creature can\
  \ escape a 5-foot-deep pit with a DC 5 Climb check. Larger creatures may ignore\
  \ pits smaller than their size."
