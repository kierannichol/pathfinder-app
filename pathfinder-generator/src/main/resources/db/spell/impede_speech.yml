name: "Impede Speech"
description: "This minor curse interferes with the target's ability to speak. On a\
  \ failed save, the target has difficulty stringing words together. Only with great\
  \ concentration can he communicate intelligibly. Speaking in combat becomes a move-equivalent\
  \ action rather than a free action. If the target attempts to cast a spell with\
  \ a verbal component, he has a 50% chance of making an error and losing the spell.\
  \ Even if he can successfully cast a spell, doing so takes 1 round if the spell's\
  \ normal casting time is less than 1 round. If the spell's casting time is usually\
  \ 1 round or longer, its casting time doubles (up until the end of impede speech).\
  \ Impede speech cannot be dispelled, but break enchantment, limited wish, miracle,\
  \ remove curse, or wish can end it prematurely."
