name: "Replay Tracks"
description: "This spell allows you to reconstruct past events that occurred in your\
  \ current location based on the tracks and other signs left behind. Replay tracks\
  \ reveals events that occurred while the tracks that serve as the focus for the\
  \ spell were being left, revealing events in the order they happened in real time\
  \ or in reverse, depending on whether you are following the tracks forward or backward,\
  \ although the image isn't clear enough to make out details (such as a creature's\
  \ exact identity). You can attempt Survival checks to follow tracks as part of concentrating\
  \ on the spell, but only events connected to the tracks used as the focus of the\
  \ spell are revealed by the spell. Elements that left no trace detectable by you,\
  \ such as creatures benefitting from pass without trace, are absent from the events\
  \ you visualize."
