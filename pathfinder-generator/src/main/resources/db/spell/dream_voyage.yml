name: "Dream Voyage"
description: "This spell functions as dream travel, but you and your companions travel\
  \ through the Dimension of Dreams in a fantastical vehicle of your own devising\
  \ that halves the travel time. Only you can pilot the vessel, and you can do so\
  \ even if you aren't inside it. Your psychic vehicle buffers minds from the intense\
  \ emotional tides of the Dimension of Dreams, rendering everyone inside immune to\
  \ harmful emotion and fear effects. Unlike with dream travel, there is no chance\
  \ the vessel arrives off target. In addition, you need not have met the target creature,\
  \ but in that case you must have at least a reliable description of it. However,\
  \ if you attempt to travel there with insufficient or incorrect information, you\
  \ do need to roll, using the false identity entry from dream travel."
