name: "Death Clutch"
description: "Chanting an unholy litany, you reach out with a grasping motion toward\
  \ your target and cause its heart to leap out of its chest and into your hand. A\
  \ target with 200 or fewer hit points remaining that fails its saving throw is instantly\
  \ reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to your caster level or its Constitution\
  \ score â€“ 1, whichever is less negative. The creature is staggered until the beginning\
  \ of your next turn, at which point it dies. If the affected creature receives a\
  \ regenerate spell before the beginning of your next turn, the creature gains the\
  \ normal benefits of that spell and, thanks to its heart's regeneration, it doesn't\
  \ immediately die when your next turn begins. If a creature that dies from death\
  \ clutch is brought back from the dead by a breath of life or raise dead spell,\
  \ it must also be targeted with regenerate on the following round to restore its\
  \ missing heart or be unable to return to life."
