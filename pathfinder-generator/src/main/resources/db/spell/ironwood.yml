name: "Ironwood"
description: "Ironwood is a magical substance created by druids from normal wood.\
  \ While remaining natural wood in almost every way, ironwood is as strong, heavy,\
  \ and resistant to fire as steel. Spells that affect metal or iron do not function\
  \ on ironwood. Spells that affect wood do affect ironwood, although ironwood does\
  \ not burn. Using this spell with wood shape or a wood-related Craft check, you\
  \ can fashion wooden items that function as steel items. Thus, wooden plate armor\
  \ and wooden swords can be created that are as durable as their normal steel counterparts.\
  \ These items are freely usable by druids."
