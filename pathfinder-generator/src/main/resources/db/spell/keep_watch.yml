description: "This spell enables the subjects to stand watch or keep vigil throughout\
  \ the night without any ill effects. The subjects suffer no fatigue and gain all\
  \ the usual benefits of a full night's rest. The subjects gain hit points as though\
  \ from resting, wizards may prepare their spells as though they had slept for 8\
  \ hours, and so on. Effects that rely on actual sleep or dreaming are ineffective,\
  \ though the subjects are still susceptible to effects that would put them to sleep,\
  \ such as sleepor deep slumber. Any vigorous activity, including fighting, immediately\
  \ ends the effect, and the affected creatures must either have the spell cast on\
  \ them again or sleep for the remaining hours to avoid fatigue and gain the benefits\
  \ of a full night's rest."
