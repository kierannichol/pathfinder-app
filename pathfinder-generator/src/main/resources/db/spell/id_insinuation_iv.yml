description: "This functions as id insinuation I, except as noted above. In addition,\
  \ on the first round of the effect, you can select the result of each creature's\
  \ confused condition without having to roll, but this doesn't allow you to make\
  \ any decisions about how that result is applied. On the following rounds of the\
  \ effect, the targets of this spell must roll twice to determine their confused\
  \ effect. You select which roll is used. This spell can be undercast."
