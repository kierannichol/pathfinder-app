description: "You create a darkly sinister floating knife that attacks the same creature\
  \ as you each round. If you choose not to attack a creature, or you make an attack\
  \ that affects multiple opponents, the knife makes no attack during that round.\
  \ The knife uses your base attack bonus modified by either your Intelligence or\
  \ Charisma bonus (whichever is higher) when making this attack. Unless you specifically\
  \ will it to do otherwise, or it proves impossible to do so, the knife always maneuvers\
  \ itself so that it can flank your opponent before making the attack. The knife\
  \ deals 1d4 points of force damage on a successful hit and has the same threat range\
  \ and critical multipliers as a normal dagger. In addition, if the target is denied\
  \ a Dexterity bonus to AC or the knife flanks the target, the knife can make sneak\
  \ attacks as a rogue, inflicting an extra 1d6 points of force damage per four caster\
  \ levels on a successful attack."
