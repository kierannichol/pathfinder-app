name: "Semblance of Flesh"
description: "You make the target construct appear to be a living creature of flesh\
  \ and bone, regardless of its actual materials. You can make it seem 1 foot shorter\
  \ or taller, and appear thin, fat, or anywhere in between. Its bodily configuration\
  \ does not change; for example, a centaur-like construct looks like a centaur rather\
  \ than a human. The extent of the apparent change (such as flesh color, hair color,\
  \ apparent age, and so on) is up to you."
