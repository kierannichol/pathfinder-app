name: "Particulate Form"
description: "The targets' physical forms undergo a bizarre transformation. They look\
  \ and function normally, but are composed of countless particles that separate and\
  \ reconnect to remain whole. Each target gains fast healing 1 and is immune to bleed\
  \ damage, critical hits, sneak attacks, and other forms of precision damage. The\
  \ value of this fast healing increases by 1 at caster levels 10th, 15th, and 20th.\
  \ Any target can end the spell effect on itself as a swift action; the target then\
  \ regains 5d6 hit points and can attempt an additional saving throw against any\
  \ one disease or poison affecting it (at the original save DC), ending that disease\
  \ or poison with a successful saving throw."
