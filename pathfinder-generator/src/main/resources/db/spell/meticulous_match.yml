description: "You compare two similar items and know if they are identical to one\
  \ another or not. The spell can indicate an identical match, a categorical match,\
  \ or no match. For instance, blood samples are identical if they are from the same\
  \ creature. They are categorical if they are from the same species. There is no\
  \ match if they are from different species, or if one sample is merely stage blood."
