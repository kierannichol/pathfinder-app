name: "Advanced Scurvy"
description: "The subject contracts an advanced form of scurvy. He becomes constantly\
  \ fatigued, suffers from bone pain (–1 penalty on Strengthand Dexterity-based checks),\
  \ wounds easily (add +1 point of damage to any bleed effects affecting the target),\
  \ experiences loose teeth, and is slow to heal (natural healing occurs at half the\
  \ normal rate). Scurvy can be treated magically or can be overcome with proper nutrition;\
  \ eating the right foods ends the fatigue and bone pain within 1–2 days and provides\
  \ a full cure 2d6 days after that."
