name: "Anchored Step"
description: "Powerful tendrils grow out of the bottom of your feet or footwear, partially\
  \ anchoring you to the ground and making it more difficult for others to move you\
  \ against your will. These tendrils dig into any surface, but leave no trace of\
  \ your passing. You gain a +10 bonus to your CMD against bull rush, overrun, pull,\
  \ push, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers, as well as any other effect that\
  \ would move you from your current position (such as being swallowed whole) or knock\
  \ you prone. The tendrils slow your movement, however; your speed is reduced by\
  \ 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet). This spell has no effect if you are moving without\
  \ touching the ground (climbing, flying, swimming, and so on)."
