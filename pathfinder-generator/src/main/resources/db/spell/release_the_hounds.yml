description: "This spell summons a pack of canines that respond to the spellcaster's\
  \ commands and act in perfect unison, causing them to function like a swarm. The\
  \ pack uses the statistics for a winter wolf (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 280), except\
  \ it loses its breath weapon, the cold subtype, and its cold special attack and\
  \ gains the swarm subtype, a swarm attack that deals 3d6 points of damage, and the\
  \ distraction special attack (DC 17). Whenever the pack damages an opponent with\
  \ its swarm attack, it can immediately attempt a trip combat maneuver check against\
  \ that creature with its trip special attack. The pack does not gain any damage\
  \ reduction or immunity to damage and can be attacked by effects that target a specific\
  \ number of creatures, though such attacks deal 1/4 the normal amount of damage\
  \ (25%) and effects that don't deal hit point damage are only 25% likely to work."
