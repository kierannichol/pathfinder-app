description: "Casting goodberry makes 2d4 freshly picked berries magical. You (as\
  \ well as any other druid of 3rd or higher level) can immediately discern which\
  \ berries are affected. Each transmuted berry provides nourishment as if it were\
  \ a normal meal for a Medium creature. The berry also cures 1 point of damage when\
  \ eaten, subject to a maximum of 8 points of such curing in any 24-hour period."
