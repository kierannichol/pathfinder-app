description: "The target creature is covered in burning acid that deals 1d6 points\
  \ of acid damage and 1d6 points of fire damage each round. The subject can attempt\
  \ a Fortitude saving throw each round to reduce the damage by half. Dousing the\
  \ target in water ends the effect (both the acid and the fire), but rolling on the\
  \ ground does not extinguish the fire or affect the acid."
