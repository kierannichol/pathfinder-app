name: "Parasitic Soul"
description: "This spell functions like magic jar except as noted above, and instead\
  \ of your own soul, you can transfer a trapped soul (such as one trapped in a soul\
  \ gem or trapped with soul bind or trap the soul) from the receptacle into an unwilling\
  \ target's body. If the target creature fails its saving throw, it dies and the\
  \ trapped soul in the receptacle permanently inhabits the body as if using magic\
  \ jar. The trapped soul does not get a saving throw to resist this transfer. To\
  \ dismiss the spell, you must be within range of the possessed body."
