description: "This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself\
  \ or another. Once foresight is cast, you receive instantaneous warnings of impending\
  \ danger or harm to the subject of the spell. You are never surprised or flat-footed.\
  \ In addition, the spell gives you a general idea of what action you might take\
  \ to best protect yourself and gives you a +2 insight bonus to AC and on Reflex\
  \ saves. This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a Dexterity bonus to\
  \ AC."
