name: "Threefold Form"
description: "You pull forth idealized versions of yourself at various ages from your\
  \ mind, splitting into three copies of yourself. Threefold form functions as bilocation\
  \ (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 158), except there are three of you instead\
  \ of two, and each of the three bodies is under the effect of threefold aspectAPG\
  \ with a different idealized age. Other than the differences from threefold aspect,\
  \ each body shares all other effects with you, as normal for bilocation."
