description: "Upon pointing at an armored foe, you cause all of the joints of the\
  \ target's armor to stiffen as otherworldly chains wrap around the target. On a\
  \ failed Reflex save, a target in heavy metal armor becomes staggered. A target\
  \ in light or medium metal armor instead becomes entangled. Targets wearing no armor\
  \ or nonmetallic armor are unaffected. If the target is wearing heavy metal armor\
  \ and succeeds at its Reflex save, it becomes entangled instead of staggered; a\
  \ target in light or medium metal armor that succeeds at its saving throw is unaffected\
  \ by the spell."
