name: "Undeath Ward"
description: "You create a pale silver barrier that repels undead. Mindless undead\
  \ and intelligent undead with fewer Hit Dice than your caster level cannot enter\
  \ the area or penetrate the barrier. Undead of Hit Dice equal to or greater than\
  \ your caster level can pass through this barrier by making a successful Will save\
  \ against the spell, but as they do so, they take 3d6 points of damage. Once an\
  \ undead creature makes its save against this spell and takes this damage, it can\
  \ come and go without further penalty. This spell may only be used defensively,\
  \ not aggressively. Forcing an undeath ward against creatures that the spell keeps\
  \ at bay collapses the barrier."
