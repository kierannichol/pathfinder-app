description: "This transmutation makes a weapon strike true against evil foes. The\
  \ weapon is treated as having a +1 enhancement bonus for the purpose of bypassing\
  \ the DR of evil creatures or striking evil incorporeal creatures (though the spell\
  \ doesn't grant an actual enhancement bonus). The weapon also becomes good-aligned,\
  \ which means it can bypass the DR of certain creatures. (This effect overrides\
  \ and suppresses any other alignment the weapon might have.) Individual arrows or\
  \ bolts can be transmuted, but affected projectile weapons (such as bows) don't\
  \ confer the benefit to the projectiles they shoot."
