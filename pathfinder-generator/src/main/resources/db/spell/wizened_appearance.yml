description: "You polymorph your target to look like an older version of itself. You\
  \ select how much older (for example, “10 years older\" or “as an adult\"). You\
  \ can't otherwise change the target's appearance other than those details directly\
  \ associated with aging (for example, a target's hair might turn gray or the target\
  \ might develop liver spots). This spell allows children of creatures that are Medium\
  \ or smaller when fully grown to grow one size category to the normal, adult size\
  \ of that type of creature, but otherwise the selected age increase doesn't alter\
  \ the creature's size. A change in size doesn't alter the target's ability scores.\
  \ This spell doesn't affect or cause any age-based modifications to ability scores\
  \ or other age-related effects like dragon age categories or natural metamorphoses."
