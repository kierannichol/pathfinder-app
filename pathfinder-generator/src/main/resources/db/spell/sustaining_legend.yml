description: "The rulers of Azlant are thought to have used this spell to amplify\
  \ the mythic power of themselves and their most gifted lieutenants. You amplify\
  \ the mythic power of the target creatures, bolstering them with healing energy\
  \ each time they draw upon their mythic abilities. When a creature affected by this\
  \ spell expends uses of mythic power for any ability, it immediately heals 2d8 points\
  \ of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25). In addition, the creature\
  \ benefits from one of the following additional effects. Remove any one of the following\
  \ conditions: dazzled, fatigued, shaken, sickened, or staggered. Reduce the dazed\
  \ or stunned condition to staggered. Reduce the exhausted condition to fatigued.\
  \ Reduce the frightened condition to shaken, or the panicked condition to frightened.\
  \ Reduce the nauseated condition to sickened. A target can benefit from the effects\
  \ of sustaining legend only once per round, even if the target expends multiple\
  \ uses of mythic power during that time."
