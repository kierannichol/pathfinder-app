name: "Vision of Lamashtu"
description: "This spell functions exactly as the spell nightmare. In addition to\
  \ the effects of that spell, you can cause a second spell to be delivered when the\
  \ target wakes at the nightmare's conclusion. You must have this second spell prepared,\
  \ and it must be cast immediately after vision of Lamashtu (effectively adding the\
  \ two spells' casting times). This second spell â€œrides along\" with the nightmare,\
  \ affecting the target as soon as it wakes from its fitful sleep. Any spell can\
  \ be sent along with the nightmare, so long as it is of 6th level or lower, affects\
  \ one target (which is always the nightmare's recipient), and does not deal hit\
  \ point damage. The second spell's range is irrelevant for the purposes of vision\
  \ of Lamashtu, and even touch attacks can be delivered in this manner (you must\
  \ still make a successful touch attack in order to affect the target, though, with\
  \ the act of touching occurring within the context of the victim's nightmare). The\
  \ target is allowed to save against the second spell if a save is allowed. For example,\
  \ a cleric of Lamashtu could send bestow curse along as part of a vision of Lamashtu,\
  \ but not blade barrier (affects an area), destruction (too high level), or inflict\
  \ moderate wounds (deals hit point damage)."
