  \ Creatures that end their turn adjacent to the target must succeed at a Fortitude\
  \ save or be affected as if by the spell contagion. The target itself does not become\
  \ diseased, and suffers no ill effects from this spell. Once plague bearerends,\
  \ the target is no longer contagious, though any creature it infected remains diseased."
