name: "Apathy"
description: "You cause a creature to temporarily lose interest in a passion or pursuit,\
  \ taking the heat off your trail to facilitate a getaway, the finalization of a\
  \ scheme, or the elimination of incriminating evidence. When casting the spell,\
  \ you designate a subject or activity about which the target becomes indifferent.\
  \ While under the effects of apathy, the target takes a â€“5 penalty on all skill\
  \ checks and ability checks to investigate, pursue, or otherwise advance its goals\
  \ in relation to the designated subject. In most cases, however, the target does\
  \ not attempt such checks if they can be avoided, as it simply has no interest in\
  \ putting effort into the endeavor."
