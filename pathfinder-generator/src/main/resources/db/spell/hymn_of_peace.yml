description: "Each time a subject of this spell attempts to attack another creature\
  \ or object, or otherwise perform an aggressive or damaging action toward a creature\
  \ or object, it must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the subject can\
  \ attack normally. If the save fails, the subject cannot follow through with the\
  \ attack and loses that part of its action. Creatures not taking violent actions\
  \ are unaffected by this spell."
