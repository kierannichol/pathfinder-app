description: "A favorite in the creaking courts of Ustalav,insect scouts summons one\
  \ or more vermin to investigate a single location or building you can see. Your\
  \ scouts must spend 1d6 hours investigating the target location, but need no oversight.\
  \ When done, they return unerringly to you with their findings, traveling up to\
  \ 1 mile per caster level you have to rejoin their master. Each insect's size is\
  \ Fine. Each insect has 1 hit point, AC 20 (+2 Dexterity, +8 size), a movement speed\
  \ of 5 feet, a climb speed of 5 feet, and a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability).\
  \ The insects use your saving throw bonuses, have a total Perception skill bonus\
  \ equal to 5 + 1/2 your caster level, and can't attack. Because of their incredibly\
  \ small size and magical nature, they can attempt Stealth checks to avoid being\
  \ noticed even if they lack a source of cover or concealment, and they have a total\
  \ Stealth skill bonus equal to 18 + 1/2 your caster level."
