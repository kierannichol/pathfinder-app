name: "Mark of Buoyancy"
description: "You cause the touched object to become lighter than air, such that it\
  \ floats if not weighted down. The object is effectively weightless and, if left\
  \ unattended, will rise to a number of feet off the ground equal to twice your caster\
  \ level, and then remain floating at that height. The object can be pushed, dragged,\
  \ carried, or otherwise moved normally, and it can be carried by the wind if not\
  \ held or secured. The object is buoyant enough that it can carry an additional\
  \ weight of up to 10 pounds per caster level with it, potentially allowing it to\
  \ be used to carry small objects or creatures."
