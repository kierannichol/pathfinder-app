name: "Zone of Silence"
description: "By casting zone of silence, you manipulate sound waves in your immediate\
  \ vicinity so that you and those within the spell's area can converse normally,\
  \ yet no one outside can hear your voices or any other noises from within, including\
  \ language-dependent or sonic spell effects. This effect is centered on you and\
  \ moves with you. Anyone who enters the zone immediately becomes subject to its\
  \ effects, but those who leave are no longer affected. Note, however, that a successful\
  \ DC 20 Linguistics check to read lips can still reveal what's said inside a zone\
  \ of silence."
