description: "The target's shadow becomes a flexible tether to its current square.\
  \ The creature can move up to 5 feet from that square without penalty. Moving farther\
  \ than 5 feet from the tether point requires the target to make a bull rush combat\
  \ maneuver check against a CMB of 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Intelligence\
  \ modifier (if a witch or wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a bard or sorcerer).\
  \ The target takes a â€“1 penalty for every 5 feet of distance between it and its\
  \ tethered square. Failing this check means the target's move is wasted and it cannot\
  \ move farther away. If it fails this check by 10 or more, it is pulled 5 feet toward\
  \ the tether square and is knocked prone. If it beats the check by 10 or more, the\
  \ spell ends. This spell does not work on creatures that do not cast shadows or\
  \ reflections. If the target uses a teleportation effect or leaves the current plane,\
  \ the spell ends."
