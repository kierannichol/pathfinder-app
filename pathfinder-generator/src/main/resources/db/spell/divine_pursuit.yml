description: "Select one creature within 60 feet that you have damaged. If that creature\
  \ has a burrow, climb, fly, or swim speed, you gain that form of movement for the\
  \ duration of the spell at the same speed and maneuverability as the selected creature.\
  \ If this gives you the burrow or swim speed, you can breathe while burrowing or\
  \ swimming. If the creature moves 1,000 feet or more from you, the spell ends. If\
  \ the creature has more than one of these types of movement, you select one from\
  \ the types available to the creature."
