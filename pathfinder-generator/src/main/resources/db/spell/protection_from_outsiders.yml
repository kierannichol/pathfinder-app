name: "Protection from Outsiders"
description: "This spell wards a creature from attacks by outsiders with a specific\
  \ racial subtype, from mental control exerted by creatures of the chosen subtype,\
  \ and from summoned creatures of that subtype. Only the subtypes of specific outsider\
  \ races--angel, azata, demon, oni, psychopomp, protean, and so on--can be chosen\
  \ as the subtype this spell protects against. Alignment subtypes or other general\
  \ subtypes (like elemental, extraplanar, or native) cannot be selected. Outsiders\
  \ without an outsider racial subtype (like genies, night hags, yeth hounds, or xills)\
  \ are not affected by this spell."
