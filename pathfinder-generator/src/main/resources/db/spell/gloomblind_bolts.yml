name: "Gloomblind Bolts"
description: "You create one or more bolts of negative energy infused with shadow\
  \ pulled from the Shadow Plane. You can fire one bolt, plus one for every four levels\
  \ beyond 5th (to a maximum of three bolts at 13th level) at the same or different\
  \ targets, but all bolts must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and\
  \ require a ranged touch attack to hit. Each bolt deals 4d6 points of damage to\
  \ a living creature or heals 4d6 points of damage to an undead creature. Furthermore,\
  \ the bolt's energy spreads over the skin of creature, possibly blinding it for\
  \ a short time. Any creature struck by a bolt must succeed at a Reflex saving throw\
  \ or become blinded for 1 round."
