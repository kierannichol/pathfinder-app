name: "Lesser Entice Fey"
description: "This spell functions as lesser planar ally, except that you entice a\
  \ fey of 6 HD or fewer to lend you its aid with an offering of music or something\
  \ else it finds appealing. Like lesser planar ally, this spell is unpredictable,\
  \ and the fey who answers the calling is up to the whims of nature and the fey,\
  \ not your own choice. You must succeed at a Knowledge (nature) check or Perform\
  \ check (DC = 20 + target's HD) in addition to the spell's material component to\
  \ entice the fey into appearing, after which you can negotiate for the service and\
  \ your payment. The maximum HD of fey that you can call with that casting is equal\
  \ to the result of your check â€“ 20. For example, if your check result is a 24, the\
  \ maximum HD for the called fey is 4. A high result doesn't allow you to break the\
  \ HD maximum for the spell, and a result of 20 or less means you can't call a fey\
  \ at all. If the fey doesn't like the sound of your offer, it can simply choose\
  \ to refuse, in which case you don't expend any of the material components for the\
  \ spell, either the offerings or the payment."
