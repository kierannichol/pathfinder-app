name: "Unadulterated Loathing"
description: "You fill the target with a terrible loathing aimed at a specific creature.\
  \ At the time of the casting, you designate a single creature as the object of the\
  \ target's revulsion. Thereafter, the target does all it can to remain at least\
  \ 60 feet away from the object of its loathing. As soon as the target moves within\
  \ this range, it becomes nauseated until it can again get away from the object of\
  \ its revulsion. If traveling beyond 60 feet of the object of its loathing would\
  \ place the target in obvious physical danger, the target can attempt a second save\
  \ to break the spell's effect."
