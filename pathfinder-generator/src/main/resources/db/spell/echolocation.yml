description: "You can perceive the world by creating high-pitched noises and listening\
  \ to their echoes. This gives you blindsight to a range of 40 feet. The echo-producing\
  \ noises are too high-pitched to be heard by most creatures, and can only be detected\
  \ by dragons, other creatures with this ability (such as bats), and creatures with\
  \ hearing-based blindsense or blindsight. You cannot use this ability if you are\
  \ deaf, and cannot detect anything in an area of silence."
