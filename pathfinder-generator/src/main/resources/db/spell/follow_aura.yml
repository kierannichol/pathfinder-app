description: "Choose one alignment type: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. You gain\
  \ the ability to follow the trail of a strong or overwhelming aura of that alignment\
  \ (see detect evil, Core Rulebook266). This is treated as tracking using the scent\
  \ special quality, except you are following the traces of their aura upon the ground\
  \ rather than their scent, and you receive no bonus on Perception checks. At 10th\
  \ level, you can track the trail of creatures with a moderate alignment aura as\
  \ well."
