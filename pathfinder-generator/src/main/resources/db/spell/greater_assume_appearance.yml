name: "Greater Assume Appearance"
description: "This spell functions similar to assume appearance, except that you can\
  \ imitate a creature even if you have only a likeness (such as a sketch or painting)\
  \ that is fairly accurate. If there is an age difference between the likeness and\
  \ the actual creature, you take on the appearance of the creature near the end of\
  \ its life. If you have heard the creature whose form you plan to assume speak aloud,\
  \ you can also copy its voice as vocal alteration (speak with dead can also be used\
  \ to fulfill this requirement). The spell doesn't grant insight into the dead creature's\
  \ mannerisms"
