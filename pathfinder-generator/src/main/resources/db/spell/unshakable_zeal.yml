name: "Unshakable Zeal"
description: "You fill the target with boundless enthusiasm and faith in its ultimate\
  \ triumph. Whenever the target fails an attack roll, a save, a skill check, a concentration\
  \ check, or an ability check, the target receives a +4 morale bonus on its next\
  \ attempt at the failed check within 1 round (this includes attack rolls against\
  \ the same foe, saving throws against the same ability from the same foe, and so\
  \ on). In addition, when the target would be affected by a fear or emotion effect,\
  \ it can instead dismiss unshakable zeal without spending an action to negate the\
  \ effect on itself."
