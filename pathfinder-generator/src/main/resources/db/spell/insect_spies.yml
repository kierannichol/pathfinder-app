name: "Insect Spies"
description: "You summon one or more glossy black beetles, which have a measure of\
  \ intelligence and make for excellent spies. When they are in your presence, the\
  \ insects obey your mental commands, and you can issue orders to any number of them\
  \ as a single standard action, provided that you issue the same orders to each one.\
  \ In order to issue different orders to different insects, you must spend a separate\
  \ standard action for each set of orders. An insect in physical contact with you\
  \ can answer simple questions about what it has observed, at a rate of one question\
  \ per round. It can relate only what it perceived with its senses, and can't repeat\
  \ speech. It has difficulty making subjective judgments, and questions that demand\
  \ such reasoning are unlikely to yield a clear answer. For example, an insect is\
  \ unable to relay someone's emotional state or determine who among several people\
  \ it saw might be in charge."
