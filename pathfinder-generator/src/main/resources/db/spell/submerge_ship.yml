name: "Submerge Ship"
description: "When this spell is cast upon a vessel, the ship is surrounded by a protective\
  \ bubble of constantly replenishing, breathable air and sinks beneath the waves.\
  \ For the duration of the spell, the ship can travel beneath the water as easily\
  \ as it did above. While under the effects of this spell, the ship has magical propulsion\
  \ that gives it a maximum speed of 120 feet and an acceleration of 30 feet (see\
  \ the Skull & Shackles Player's Guidefor details). The ship's pilot uses the normal\
  \ sailing skill to control the ship while under this spell's effects, and can command\
  \ it to dive and ascend as part of the vessel's normal movement. Despite the magical\
  \ propulsion, the ship still requires its crew to perform its normal functions."
