description: "The target creature's innate goodness infuses its body with holy energy.\
  \ While this energy does not directly empower the target, it can harm embodiments\
  \ of evil. Any creature that damages the target with a slashing or piercing melee\
  \ weapon is sprayed by the target's holy blood. If the attacker is a creature with\
  \ the evil subtype, it takes 1d6 points of damage from divine power each time it\
  \ successfully hits the target. If the target has the good subtype or an ability\
  \ that grants it an aura of good (like paladins or some clerics), its blood instead\
  \ deals 2d6 points of damage. Creatures that don't have the evil subtype or that\
  \ are using reach weapons are not subject to this damage."
