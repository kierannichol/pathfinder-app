name: "Spectral Scout"
description: "You summon a spectral creature in the shape of the Tiny or smaller animal\
  \ of your choice, which always appears in your square. The creature emits a faint\
  \ glow of a color you choose at the time of the spell's casting, providing the illumination\
  \ of a candle. It has the same statistics as the creature after which it is modeled\
  \ (including ability scores, Armor Class, feats, senses, skills, and speed), but\
  \ is incorporeal and has only 1 hit point. A spectral scout cannot attack, but can\
  \ otherwise follow any basic instructions that could be given to a pet or animal\
  \ companion of similar intelligence but without the need to make Handle Animal skill\
  \ checks."
