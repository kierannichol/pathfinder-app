name: "Tail Strike"
description: "You grow a draconic tail (clothing and armor adjust as necessary), or\
  \ if you already have a tail, it takes on a draconic appearance. If you have a draconic\
  \ bloodline, the tail matches the appearance of that dragon type; otherwise, it\
  \ matches the appearance of a dragon type whose alignment matches your own. You\
  \ gain a tail slam attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if Small, 1d8 if\
  \ Large) + your Strength modifier. If you already have a tail attack, you instead\
  \ extend the reach of your tail attack by 5 feet. If you have a tail sweep attack,\
  \ this spell increases its radius by 10 feet."
