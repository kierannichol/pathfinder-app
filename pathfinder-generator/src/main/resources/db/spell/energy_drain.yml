  \ gains 2d4 temporary negative levels. Twenty-four hours after gaining them, the\
  \ subject must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC = energy drain spell's save DC)\
  \ for each negative level. If the save succeeds, that negative level is removed.\
  \ If it fails, that negative level becomes permanent."
