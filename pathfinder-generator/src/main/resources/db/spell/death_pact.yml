description: "You take control of a creature's mind and implant deadly subconscious\
  \ commands. This spell functions as dominate person, allowing you to control your\
  \ subject and see through her senses, but also implants a powerful burst of psychic\
  \ energy in the subject's mind. At any point during the spell's duration, you can\
  \ trigger this burst as an immediate action, dealing 1d8 points of damage per caster\
  \ level (Fortitude half) to the subject. If this damage is enough to reduce to target\
  \ to 0 or fewer hit points, the target dies instantly."
