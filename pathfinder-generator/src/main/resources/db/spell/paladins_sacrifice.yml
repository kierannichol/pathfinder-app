description: "You open up a brief but powerful divine conduit between you and another\
  \ creature, taking on the damage and any other effects that creature suffers. When\
  \ a creature in range is hit by an attack or fails a saving throw, you can cast\
  \ this spell and the wounds and/or effects are magically transmitted to you instead\
  \ of the target. You are affected as if you were hit by the attack or failed the\
  \ saving throw, taking all the damage and suffering all of the adverse effects.\
  \ Any resistances or immunities you have are applied normally, but you cannot otherwise\
  \ reduce or negate the damage or effects in any way."
