name: "Aura of Distraction"
description: "You emit an aura of subsonic noise and mental imagery that makes concentrating\
  \ difficult. Any creature within the aura that fails its save takes a â€“5 penalty\
  \ on concentration checks. A creature must attempt the Will save upon entering the\
  \ area of the aura, and the penalty ends as soon as the creature leaves the aura.\
  \ A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to the effects of the aura for\
  \ this casting of the spell, even if it leaves and reenters the aura, but must attempt\
  \ another Will save each additional time this spell is cast. You are immune to your\
  \ own aura of distraction."
