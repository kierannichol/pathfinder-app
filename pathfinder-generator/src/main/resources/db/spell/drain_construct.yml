description: "You weaken a target construct, temporarily sapping its animating force\
  \ and limiting its normal functionality. If the construct fails its saving throw,\
  \ for the duration of this spell, it loses any damage reduction and fast healing\
  \ it had and its base speed is reduced by half. Additionally, the construct takes\
  \ a –4 penalty to Strength while this spell is in effect. This penalty increases\
  \ by 2 for every 3 caster levels beyond 3rd (maximum –14). If the construct is normally\
  \ immune to magic, this spell's sapping effect is less penetrating and the construct\
  \ receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw."
