description: "You touch an unattended, nonmagical object to create a touchstone for\
  \ humans defending the area. Such human defenders are protected by a shimmering\
  \ aura as long as they are in the area. The spell grants each subject damage reduction\
  \ 2/magic. Humans who leave the area and reenter regain the damage reduction. The\
  \ spell is suppressed if the object is moved from its place, but resumes if the\
  \ object is put back. Its duration continues to elapse while it is suppressed this\
  \ way."
