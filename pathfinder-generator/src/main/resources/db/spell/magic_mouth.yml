description: "This spell imbues the chosen object or creature with an enchanted mouth\
  \ that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs.\
  \ The message, which must be 25 or fewer words long, can be in any language known\
  \ by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter\
  \ verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however,\
  \ move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the\
  \ mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Magic mouth can also be placed\
  \ upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature."
