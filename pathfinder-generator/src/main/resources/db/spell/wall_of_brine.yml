name: "Wall of Brine"
description: "You conjure a 5-foot-thick wall of seawater with a powerful current\
  \ flowing toward one side of the wall, selected by you; a creature attempting to\
  \ swim against this current must spend 4 squares of movement to enter a square of\
  \ the wall. A creature that begins its turn in the wall is ejected in the direction\
  \ of the current just before it acts. The wall provides cover against attacks from\
  \ out of the water, as usual for a body of water. The water and the currents deflect\
  \ physical ranged attacks into or through the wall, unless a weapon used is exceptionally\
  \ massive (such as a siege engine). A creature submerged in the wall takes the usual\
  \ penalties for underwater combat. The wall blocks gases and liquids and prevents\
  \ water from mixing at its edges."
