description: "You mark one creature with a glowing sigil. The target's alignment must\
  \ be opposite yours on at least one alignment axis--if you are neutral with no other\
  \ alignment components, the target must have an alignment with no neutral component.\
  \ Any creature that sees the target can attempt a DC 15 Knowledge (religion) check\
  \ to discern the target's alignment, even if the mark is covered. You are aware\
  \ of the direction and distance to the target as long as it remains within 100 miles\
  \ of you and on the same plane."
