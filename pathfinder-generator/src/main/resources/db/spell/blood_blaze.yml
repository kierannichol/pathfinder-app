description: "The target gains a 5-foot-radius aura that causes the blood of creatures\
  \ in that area to ignite upon contact with air. Any creature (including the spell's\
  \ target) within the aura that takes at least 5 points of piercing, slashing, or\
  \ bleed damage from a single attack automatically creates a spray of burning blood.\
  \ The spray strikes a creature in a randomly determined square adjacent to the injured\
  \ creature. The spray deals 1d6 points of fire damage to any creature in that square,\
  \ and 1 point of splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the spray's target,\
  \ including the target of this spell. A creature can only create one spray of burning\
  \ blood per round. Creatures that do not have blood (including oozes and most constructs\
  \ and undead) do not create blood sprays when attacked."
