description: "This spell disrupts the method a target uses for movement. Creatures\
  \ under the effects of this spell move at half their base speed (rounded down to\
  \ the nearest 5-foot increment) but can still take 5-foot steps as normal. Incorporeal\
  \ creatures and creatures flying with perfect maneuverability are immune to the\
  \ effects of this spell. Each round, a target receives another save to end the effect."
