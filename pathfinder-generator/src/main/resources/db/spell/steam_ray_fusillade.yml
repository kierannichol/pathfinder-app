name: "Steam Ray Fusillade"
description: "For the duration of the spell, you can fire three rays of steam once\
  \ per round as a standard action (and you also fire three such rays as part of casting\
  \ the spell). These rays function similarly to the rays from scorching ray (you\
  \ can fire them at close range, they're ranged touch attacks, they deal 4d6 points\
  \ of fire damage each, and spell resistance negates them) except that they work\
  \ both underwater and above water without a caster level check for being a fire\
  \ spell."
