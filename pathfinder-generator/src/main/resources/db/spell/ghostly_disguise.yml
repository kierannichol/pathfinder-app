name: "Ghostly Disguise"
description: "You make yourself--including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment--appear\
  \ translucent like a ghost. Any mundane or magical disguise on you is affected by\
  \ this illusion as well; for example, if you are disguised as the king or a sahuagin,\
  \ you look like a ghostly version of the king or a sahuagin. Your ghostly form may\
  \ have a pale green, blue, or violet coloration, or a muted version of your normal\
  \ appearance."
