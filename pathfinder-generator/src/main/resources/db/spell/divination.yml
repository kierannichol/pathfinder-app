description: "Similar to augury but more powerful, a divination spell can provide\
  \ you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific\
  \ goal, event, or activity that is to occur within 1 week. The advice granted by\
  \ the spell can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic\
  \ rhyme or omen. If your party doesn't act on the information, the conditions may\
  \ change so that the information is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct\
  \ divination is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%. If the die roll\
  \ fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information\
  \ is at work."
