description: "You concentrate feelings of competitiveness, envy, and ill will into\
  \ a poltergeist-like haunt that wreaks havoc on its victim's long-term endeavors.\
  \ Every time a creature in the affected area attempts a Craft or Profession check\
  \ to generate income, create an item, or earn capital (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign\
  \ 85), any skill check required for crafting or repairing a magic item, or any skill\
  \ check required for an occult ritual (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 208), the\
  \ haunt imposes a â€“5 penalty on the check. If the creature fails its check by 5\
  \ or more, the haunt's mischief deals 1d6 points of damage to the creature in addition\
  \ to any other negative effects from such a failure. If the creature attempts to\
  \ cast a spell with a casting time of 1 minute or longer, the haunt becomes similarly\
  \ disruptive, requiring the caster to succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15\
  \ + spell level) or lose the spell and take 1d6 points of damage from the mischief.\
  \ Each time the haunt is disruptive, the spell's haunt-like manifestation occurs\
  \ during that round."
