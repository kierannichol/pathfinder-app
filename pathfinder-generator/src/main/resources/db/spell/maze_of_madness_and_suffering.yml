description: "This spell works like maze, except the DC of the Intelligence check\
  \ to escape is 22 and each round a creature remains in the maze a different effect\
  \ occurs depending on which section of the maze it is in. Roll on the following\
  \ table each time the creature attempts an Intelligence check to escape the maze\
  \ to see which part of the maze it wanders through; if a creature doesn't attempt\
  \ an Intelligence check, it stays in the same section and suffers that section's\
  \ effects. Any conditions or damage taken persist for the listed duration even if\
  \ the creature exits the maze before then, but conditions don't stack with themselves.\
