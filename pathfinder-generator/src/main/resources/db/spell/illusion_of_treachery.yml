name: "Illusion of Treachery"
description: "You create an illusion that takes the same space as a foe and mimics\
  \ its movements perfectly. Whenever you cast a spell or throw a weapon, the illusion\
  \ ceases mimicking the target's actions just long enough to make it look like the\
  \ target cast the spell or threw the weapon simultaneously with you, such that witnesses\
  \ who can see both you and the target can't tell with certainty who truly cast the\
  \ spell or threw the weapon. Witnesses who can see only the target see it as the\
  \ only apparent source. The subject of this spell doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity\
  \ from these illusory actions. Each target of the attack or spell counts as interacting\
  \ with the illusion and thus receives a save to disbelieve."
