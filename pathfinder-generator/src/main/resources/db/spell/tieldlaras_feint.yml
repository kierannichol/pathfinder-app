  \ lustful thoughts of you, distracting your target and rendering that creature vulnerable\
  \ to your attacks. An affected creature takes a penalty equal to half your caster\
  \ level on concentration checks and to its CMD against dirty trickAPG, grapple,\
  \ and stealAPG combat maneuvers you perform. The creature is also denied its Dexterity\
  \ bonus to AC for the first melee attack you make against it each round."
