name: "False Resurrection"
description: "This spell functions as resurrection except that instead of recalling\
  \ the dead soul to life, the spell calls a shadow demon with the advanced simple\
  \ template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 67, 294) to possess the body. If you fail to\
  \ overcome the subject's spell resistance, the subject's soul can negate the calling\
  \ and gain the option to return to life (as resurrection) in the restored body.\
  \ The possession otherwise functions (as possessionOA) except that the subject's\
  \ soul is not present to resist. When false resurrection ends or the demon is removed\
  \ from the subject, the demon returns to the Abyss, leaving the body alive but soulless\
  \ (like that created by clone). If the soul hasn't been returned to life already,\
  \ it has the option to return in the now-empty body if it still lives (as resurrection).\
  \ If the body was killed, the demon is sent back to the Abyss but the subject remains\
  \ dead."
