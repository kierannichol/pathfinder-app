description: "The Lantern Bearers must often make difficult decisions during their\
  \ missions, such as determining what to do with captured enemies--should they be\
  \ executed, imprisoned, set free, or given a chance to mend their ways? With this\
  \ spell, you grant a creature the ability to foresee moral consequences, as if the\
  \ creature were wearing a phylactery of faithfulness. The spell's guidance focuses\
  \ on the protection of beauty and encourages peaceful resolution and mercy."
