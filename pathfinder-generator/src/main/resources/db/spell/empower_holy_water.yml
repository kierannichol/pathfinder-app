  \ creatures. You can empower one vial of holy water at 4th level, two at 8th level,\
  \ and three at 12th level. When thrown at an undead creature, the affected vial\
  \ of holy water deals an amount of bonus damage equal to your caster level (maximum\
  \ +10) on a direct hit, and half that amount of bonus damage (maximum +5) to creatures\
  \ caught in the splash area. This additional damage is positive energy damage, and\
  \ has no effect on living creatures."
