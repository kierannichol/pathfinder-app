name: "Waters of Lamashtu"
description: "This spell generates what appears to be clear, pure water, but it is\
  \ in fact a foul secretion known as the waters of Lamashtu. The liquid functions\
  \ in all the same ways as unholy water (see curse water). In addition, any creature\
  \ that is anointed with or drinks this fluid must attempt a Fortitude save (drinking\
  \ the waters of Lamashtu is particularly effective--a creature that drinks the liquid\
  \ takes a â€“4 penalty on its save to resist its effects). Success causes the creature\
  \ to become violently ill, vomit up the fluid, and become sickened for 1d4 rounds.\
  \ Failure indicates the water takes root and wreaks havoc on the victim's mind (dealing\
  \ 1d6 points of Intelligence damage) and twists and deforms its body (dealing 1d6\
  \ points of Dexterity damage). The subject's Dexterity and Intelligence cannot drop\
  \ below 1 as a result of this effect. Casting this spell creates approximately 2\
  \ ounces of the waters of Lamashtu--enough for one dose or, if bottled, one use\
  \ as a thrown weapon."
