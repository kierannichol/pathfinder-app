  \ duration of the spell, the following effects apply within the affected area. Nonmagical\
  \ fires are automatically extinguished, and all creatures and objects in the area\
  \ gain fire resistance 5. The conjured water is conductive, and whenever a doused\
  \ creature takes electricity damage, it takes 1 additional point of electricity\
  \ damage. At 6th, 12th, and 18th levels, the fire resistance increases by 5 and\
  \ the additional electricity damage increases by 1 point."
