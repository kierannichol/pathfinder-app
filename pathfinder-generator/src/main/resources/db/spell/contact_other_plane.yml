description: "You send your mind to another plane of existence (an Elemental Plane\
  \ or some plane farther removed) in order to receive advice and information from\
  \ powers there. See the accompanying table for possible consequences and results\
  \ of the attempt. The powers reply in a language you understand, but they resent\
  \ such contact and give only brief answers to your questions. All questions are\
  \ answered with “yes,\" “no,\" “maybe,\" “never,\" “irrelevant,\" or some other\
  \ one-word answer."
