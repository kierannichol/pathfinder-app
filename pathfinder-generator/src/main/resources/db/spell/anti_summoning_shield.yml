description: "Within the area of effect, this spell impedes the use of spells of the\
  \ summoning subschool and other effects that summon creatures. Any such spells,\
  \ spell-like abilities, or similar summoning effects used within the area have a\
  \ percent chance of failure equals 5% Ã— your caster level, to a maximum 75% chance\
  \ of failure. If the summoning effect already has a percent chance of failure (as\
  \ is often the case with the summon spell-like ability of outsiders), these percentages\
  \ stack. This spell does not affect summoners attempting to summon their eidolon,\
  \ but it does affect summoners casting other summoning spells."
