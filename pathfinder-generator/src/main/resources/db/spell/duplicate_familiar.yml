description: "You create a duplicate of a familiar. The familiar's master can use\
  \ the duplicate as if it were his familiar in all respects, though he doesn't gain\
  \ the bonus special ability from more than one familiar at a time. When the spell's\
  \ duration expires, the familiar duplicate shrivels into nothing, even if petrified\
  \ or otherwise transformed."
