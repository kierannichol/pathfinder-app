name: "Wandering Trail"
description: "You cause the trail left by the targets within range to automatically\
  \ reroute, potentially taking any course within the area. Your modification of the\
  \ trail within the spell's area can result in a trail at least half the original\
  \ length or up to twice the original length. If the trail continues beyond the spell's\
  \ range, you must leave it connecting at that point on the edge of the spell's range.\
  \ If a tracking creature exceeds the DC of the skill check to follow the trail by\
  \ an amount equal to your caster level, the tracker recognizes that the trail has\
  \ been manipulated by this spell, although it cannot see the trail's true nature\
  \ unless it uses magical means, such as true seeing."
