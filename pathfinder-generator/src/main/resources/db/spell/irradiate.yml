description: "The spell's area of effect floods with dangerous radiation. The strength\
  \ of the radiation you create depends on your caster level, as detailed below. The\
  \ central irradiated area is always a 10-foot-radius spread that expands normally\
  \ per the rules for radiation areas of effect (see page 55). Creatures within the\
  \ area are exposed to the radiation only once; the radiation does not linger in\
  \ the area. The save to resist the radiation effects is set by the spell, not the\
  \ standard save DC for radiation."
