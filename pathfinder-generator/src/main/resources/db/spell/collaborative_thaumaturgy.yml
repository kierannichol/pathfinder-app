description: "You tap into the magical resonance between you and your allies to enhance\
  \ one another's magic. Cast this spell when an ally casts a spell at least 1 level\
  \ lower than the highest-level spell she can cast. The ally casts her spell as if\
  \ one of the following metamagic feats were applied to it without increasing the\
  \ spell level or casting time: Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Silent Spell, or Still\
  \ Spell. If the ally is the target of two collaborative thaumaturgy spells when\
  \ casting a spell, the ally can instead apply the Empower Spell metamagic feat to\
  \ a spell at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level spell she can cast. Finally,\
  \ if the ally is the target of three collaborative thaumaturgy spells when casting\
  \ a spell, she can instead apply the Maximize Spell or Widen Spell metamagic feat\
  \ to a spell at least 3 levels lower than the highest-level spell she can cast.\
  \ You can't target yourself with collaborative thaumaturgy."
