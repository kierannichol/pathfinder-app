name: "Wave Form"
description: "You transform into a wave of frothing water up to 15 feet wide and 15\
  \ feet tall, as space permits, and then surge forth in a straight line in the direction\
  \ of your choice, moving up to twice your base movement speed before immediately\
  \ returning to your normal form. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\
  \ While in wave form, you are immune to weapon attacks and attacks that target a\
  \ specific number of creatures (since the spell is instantaneous, this is mainly\
  \ relevant for readied actions and the like). All creatures and unattended objects\
  \ in your path take 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. A successful\
  \ Reflex save prevents a creature from being knocked prone."
