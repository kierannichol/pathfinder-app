description: "A coruscating ray springs from your hand. You must succeed on a ranged\
  \ touch attack to strike a target. The subject takes a penalty to Strength equal\
  \ to 1d6+1 per two caster levels (maximum 1d6+5). The subject's Strength score cannot\
  \ drop below 1. A successful Fortitude save reduces this penalty by half. This penalty\
  \ does not stack with itself. Apply the highest penalty instead."
