description: "A cone of tiny, sparkling slivers as hard and sharp as filed diamonds\
  \ springs from your outstretched fingers at tremendous speed. Any creature in the\
  \ area of the torrent takes 1d6 points of slashing damage per caster level (maximum\
  \ 10d6). These magical slivers are treated as adamantine and cold iron for the purpose\
  \ of overcoming damage reduction. In addition, this spell bypasses up to 1 point\
  \ of an object's hardness per 2 caster levels (maximum 10)."
