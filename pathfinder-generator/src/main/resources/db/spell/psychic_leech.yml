description: "The target experiences feelings of ennui and lethargy, becoming fatigued\
  \ for the spell's duration. While the target is fatigued and is within the spell's\
  \ range, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity. On a successful\
  \ save, the target is fatigued for only 1d4 rounds and you receive no bonus. This\
  \ spell has no effect if it targets a creature that is already fatigued."
