description: "You invoke the mystical power of the moon to drive the target into a\
  \ mad, bestial frenzy. If the target fails its save, it is dazed for 1 round, dropping\
  \ held items as its nails and teeth elongate and sharpen. The target gains a bite\
  \ attack and two claw attacks that deal damage appropriate for the creature's size,\
  \ and for the remainder of the spell's duration the target behaves as if under simultaneous\
  \ rageand confusionspells, attacking with its natural weapons in preference to other\
  \ actions. During the final round of the spell's duration, the target is again dazed\
  \ as it returns to its normal state."
