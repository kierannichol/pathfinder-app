name: "Overland Flight"
description: "This spell functions like a fly spell, except you can fly at a speed\
  \ of 40 feet (30 feet if wearing medium or heavy armor, or if carrying a medium\
  \ or heavy load) with a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to half your caster level.\
  \ When using this spell for long-distance movement, you can hustle without taking\
  \ nonlethal damage (a forced march still requires Constitution checks). This means\
  \ you can cover 64 miles in an 8-hour period of flight (or 48 miles at a speed of\
  \ 30 feet)."
