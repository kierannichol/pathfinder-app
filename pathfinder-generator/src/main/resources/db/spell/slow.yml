description: "An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate.\
  \ Creatures affected by this spell are staggered and can take only a single move\
  \ action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round\
  \ actions). Additionally, it takes a â€“1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex\
  \ saves. A slowed creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next\
  \ 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for\
  \ decreased speed."
