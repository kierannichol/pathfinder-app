  \ opponents. Each time an undead creature damages you with a melee attack, that\
  \ creature takes an amount of positive energy damage equal to half the damage it\
  \ dealt to you. This damage is calculated after applying your damage reduction,\
  \ resistances, and other defenses. Once this spell has dealt 5 points of damage\
  \ per caster level (maximum 50), it is discharged."
