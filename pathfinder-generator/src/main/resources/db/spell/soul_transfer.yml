name: "Soul Transfer"
description: "This spell functions like the spell completion option of trap the soul,\
  \ except it works only on bodiless souls (such as incorporeal undead or a soul trapped\
  \ in a gem) and creatures whose substance is a physical incarnation of a soul (such\
  \ as a petitioner). It does not work on creatures formed from souls or planar material\
  \ (such as most outsiders). Soul transfer is mainly used to transfer souls from\
  \ one receptacle to another, but it can also be used to capture vulnerable souls\
  \ that aren't bound to mortal flesh (such as incorporeal creatures and petitioners).\
  \ When used to capture a petitioner, the petitioner's physical body vanishes, reappearing\
  \ only when its soul is released from the receptacle."
