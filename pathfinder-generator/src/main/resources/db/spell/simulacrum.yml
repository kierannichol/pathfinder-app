name: "Simulacrum"
description: "Simulacrum creates an illusory duplicate of any creature. The duplicate\
  \ creature is partially real and formed from ice or snow. It appears to be the same\
  \ as the original, but it has only half of the real creature's levels or HD (and\
  \ the appropriate hit points, feats, skill ranks, and special abilities for a creature\
  \ of that level or HD). You can't create a simulacrum of a creature whose HD or\
  \ levels exceed twice your caster level. You must make a Disguise check when you\
  \ cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is. A creature familiar with\
  \ the original might detect the ruse with a successful Perception check (opposed\
  \ by the caster's Disguise check) or a DC 20 Sense Motive check."
