description: "You create a fist-sized rock that flies toward one enemy. Make an unarmed\
  \ strike attack roll against the target as if it were in your threatened area. If\
  \ the attack is successful, the rock deals bludgeoning damage to the target as if\
  \ you had hit the target with your unarmed strike. If you have a ki pool, as long\
  \ as you have at least 1 point in your ki pool, the rock counts as a ki strike."
