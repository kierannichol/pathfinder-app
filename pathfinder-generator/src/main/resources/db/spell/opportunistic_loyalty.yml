name: "Opportunistic Loyalty"
description: "Cast this spell when a creature within range casts a spell that provides\
  \ an effect for its allies (such as bless or prayer). You are considered an ally\
  \ of the caster for the purposes of that spell. Although you are momentarily considered\
  \ an ally, the caster need not target you if the spell requires that the caster\
  \ select one or more allies to be affected by the spell (as does haste). This spell\
  \ does not allow a target spell to affect more creatures than described in its target\
  \ entry. If this spell would raise the total number of affected targets above that\
  \ allowed by the target spell, opportunistic loyalty has no effect."
