description: "Upon drinking an extract created with this formula, you make a significant\
  \ change to your magical reserve that modifies the nature of all bombs you create\
  \ and throw during this extract's duration. This effect on your magical reserve\
  \ has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify your bombs, but you can\
  \ only have one admixture effect (formula with the word â€œbomb admixture\" in its\
  \ title) active at a time. If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the\
  \ former bomb admixture end and the new one becomes active."
