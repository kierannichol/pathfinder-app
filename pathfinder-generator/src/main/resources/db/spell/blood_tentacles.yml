name: "Blood Tentacles"
description: "You smear a handful of your own blood across your chest, causing one\
  \ writhing tentacle per caster level to burst forth. You can direct these tentacles\
  \ to attack a single creature within 15 feet as a standard action, or one creature\
  \ per 5 caster levels as a full-round action. Each tentacle has an attack bonus\
  \ equal to your base attack bonus plus either your Constitution or Charisma bonus\
  \ (whichever is higher). Each tentacle deals 2d6 points of damage, and a tentacle\
  \ collapses into dried blood on a successful hit, granting you a number of temporary\
  \ hit points equal to the damage dealt. You can't gain more temporary hit points\
  \ than your maximum number of hit points. These temporary hit points disappear after\
  \ 1 hour."
