description: "You conjure a quasi-real heavy chariot with four horselike creatures\
  \ in a team to pull it. (The exact description can be customized as you wish.) The\
  \ chariot has all the normal qualities of a heavy chariot. You or a person you designate\
  \ while casting the spell must drive the chariot, which can carry up to six passengers\
  \ (including the driver). The team and chariot make no sound and the team does not\
  \ fight, although the driver can use the chariot like any normal chariot."
