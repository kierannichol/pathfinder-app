description: "You inflict a curse similar to the spell burn spellblight (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Ultimate Magic 97) on a creature. Each time a spellcaster who is afflicted\
  \ with this curse casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, her skin seems to\
  \ burn as though she were on fire. With a successful concentration check (DC = 15\
  \ + double the spell level of the spell cast or spell-like ability used), the spellcaster\
  \ can ignore the pain of the effect, but if she fails, she loses the spell or spell\
  \ slot and is staggered for a round."
