description: "You grant the target the ability to pick up on the subtle scents and\
  \ disturbances to the natural order that are specific to the living dead, granting\
  \ the target the ability to sense the presence of undead creatures. The target is\
  \ constantly aware of whether there are any undead auras within 60 feet of her in\
  \ any direction. If at least one undead aura is present, the target can concentrate\
  \ on the spell's effects in order to gain more information on the auras present.\
  \ This functions similarly to detect undead, except the number of rounds of concentration\
  \ needed to learn about the undead auras is reduced by 1 (1 round to learn the number\
  \ of auras, and 2 rounds to learn the strength and location of each aura)."
