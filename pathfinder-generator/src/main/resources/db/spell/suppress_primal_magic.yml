description: "Nexian wizards first created this spell while researching the nature\
  \ of the Mana Wastes, hoping to create small zones within the magic-starved region\
  \ where their own spells could still function reliably. The best the Nexians could\
  \ manage was this spell--a method to temporarily stabilize magic so that spellcasting\
  \ within a small area can be accomplished without fear of triggering primal magic\
  \ events. In the area of effect of this spell, primal magic events cannot be triggered.\
  \ The emanation grants a +4 circumstance bonus on all saving throws against effects\
  \ generated by primal magic outside of the spell's effect that expand into the area."
