description: "You accept otherworldly energies into your body and transform. Your\
  \ size increases by one category, your height doubles, and your weight increases\
  \ by a factor of eight. Your features shift into those of a cold and alien being\
  \ of logic, a creature of primal chaos, an angelic presence, or a fiendish monster,\
  \ as chosen by you. You gain a +6 size bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +3\
  \ natural armor bonus, darkvision 60 ft., and SR of 12 + your caster level. These\
  \ modifiers replace the normal modifiers for increasing your size. The size modifier\
  \ for AC, attacks, CMB, and CMD changes as appropriate for your new size category.\
  \ This spell doesn't change your base speed. Determine space and reach as appropriate\
  \ for your new size."
