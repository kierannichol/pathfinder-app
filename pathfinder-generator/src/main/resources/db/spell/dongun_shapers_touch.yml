description: "You create an alchemical residue on your hands that allows you to reshape\
  \ any nonmagical, unattended object with hardness 19 or less as though it were clay.\
  \ Objects with hardness 9 or less are like soft clay, allowing you to reshape up\
  \ to 1 cubic foot per round of effort. Objects with hardness 10 or higher are harder\
  \ to mold, allowing you to reshape up to 1/4 cubic foot per round. The object retains\
  \ its new shape for 24 hours before returning to its original shape. This spell\
  \ does not allow you to reshape a portion of a large object, such as a wall; you\
  \ must be able to reshape the entire target within the spell's duration or the spell\
  \ fizzles and has no effect."
