  \ are dying or are killed before 1 hour per level has passed. If you're brought\
  \ below 0 hit points or killed (including by effects that kill without dealing damage,\
  \ such as phantasmal killerand power word kill), the eruption of healing energy\
  \ acts as mass cure light woundson allies (other than you). Allies with the fewest\
  \ Hit Dice are affected first. Among allies with equal HD, those closest to you\
  \ are affected first. If the duration ends, the stored healing energy dissipates\
  \ with no effect."
