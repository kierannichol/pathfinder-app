description: "All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell,\
  \ except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like\
  \ effects are unraveled and destroyed completely (ending the effect as a dispel\
  \ magic spell does), and each permanent magic item must make a successful Will save\
  \ or be turned into a normal item for the duration of this spell. An item in a creature's\
  \ possession uses its own Will save bonus or its possessor's Will save bonus, whichever\
  \ is higher. If an item's saving throw results in a natural 1 on the die, the item\
  \ is destroyed instead of being suppressed."
