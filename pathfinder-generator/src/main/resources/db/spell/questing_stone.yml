description: "This spell functions like arcane eye, except that it uses an ioun stone\
  \ as a visible scrying sensor. The ioun stone moves at the same rate as an arcane\
  \ eye, and may pass through holes or spaces as small as 2 inches in diameter. It\
  \ can enter another plane of existence using a gate or similar portal, but the caster\
  \ loses contact with the sensor should this occur. The enhanced ioun stone has AC\
  \ 24, 10 hp, hardness 5, fly speed 30 (perfect), and a +16 Stealth bonus. The stone\
  \ does not provide you with its normal benefits while you are using it as a scrying\
  \ sensor."
