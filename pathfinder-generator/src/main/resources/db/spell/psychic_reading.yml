name: "Psychic Reading"
description: "You are able to read a person's surface thoughts and take cues from\
  \ the person's appearance, body language, and manner of speech to infer a great\
  \ deal of information about the person, even if that person is in disguise (including\
  \ polymorph effects). When casting the spell, attempt a DC 20 Sense Motive check\
  \ with a bonus equal to your caster level. A successful skill check reveals to you\
  \ one of the following pieces of information of your choice, plus one additional\
  \ piece of information for every 5 points by which your check result exceeds 20:\
  \ age, alignment, class†, feats†, gender, native language, place of origin, race\
  \ or ethnicity, racial traits†, religion, sexual orientation, or training in a Craft,\
  \ Perform, or Profession skill. For items marked with a cross (†), if the target\
  \ has more than one of these features, each one you discover counts as a piece of\
  \ information."
