description: "The targeted suit of armor or shield sprouts thousands of tiny iron\
  \ spikes like porcupine quills. These do not harm the armor's wearer (though donning\
  \ or removing armor under the effects of this spell takes twice as long), but they\
  \ act as armor spikes or shield spikes (as appropriate). Any creature attacking\
  \ the wearer with natural weapons takes 1 point of piercing damage for each attack\
  \ that hits. At 5th level, the spikes gain a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and\
  \ damage rolls; this bonus increases to +2 at 10th level. At 15th level, the spikes\
  \ also gain the anarchic weapon quality."
