description: "This spell generates an illusory silt cloud that drifts around you and\
  \ moves with you. The cloud provides total concealment to creatures within it (including\
  \ you) when the spell is cast. Creatures moving into the cloud after the spell is\
  \ cast gain concealment (but not total concealment) due to the illusion. Any creatures\
  \ within the cloud can see each other normally and can see out from within the cloud\
  \ as though it were transparent. If a creature other than you that has total concealment\
  \ due to the cloud makes an attack against any foe, it loses total concealment and\
  \ gains concealment instead. If you make an attack against any creature, the spell\
  \ ends."
