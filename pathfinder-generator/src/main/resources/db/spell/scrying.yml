description: "You can observe a creature at any distance. If the subject succeeds\
  \ on a Will save, the spell fails. The difficulty of the save depends on how well\
  \ your knowledge of the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you\
  \ have to that creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, it gets\
  \ a +5 bonus on its Will save."
