name: "Petulengro's Validation"
description: "After a particularly harrowing brush with death at the hands of doppelgangers,\
  \ Venture-Captain Eliza Petulengro devised a means of being sure her companions\
  \ were actually who they appeared to be. To cast this spell, you must have a bit\
  \ of hair, a fingernail clipping, or some other portion of a creature. The sample\
  \ must be no more than 1 week old per caster level. As part of casting, you touch\
  \ the target creature, and instantly know whether the target is the same creature\
  \ the sample is from. Note that if you wish to be discrete, you can cast the spell\
  \ away from the target and hold the charge before touching the creature, so that\
  \ the casting is not noticed. You can also use this spell to divine whether a dead\
  \ body, or even partial remains from a body, belonged to the same person whose fingernail\
  \ clipping or bit of hair you used when casting the spell."
