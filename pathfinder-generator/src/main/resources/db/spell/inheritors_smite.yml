description: "You channel the power of righteousness into your weapon arm, allowing\
  \ you to strike with great force. Your next melee attack (if made before the end\
  \ of your next turn) gains a +5 sacred bonus on the attack roll. If the attack hits,\
  \ you may immediately attempt a bull rush combat maneuver (with a +5 sacred bonus\
  \ on your combat maneuver check) against the target without provoking an attack\
  \ of opportunity; if your combat maneuver check exceeds the defender's CMD by more\
  \ than 5, you do not need to move with the target to push it back more than 5 feet."
