description: "This spell creates a chaotic charge within the black powder loaded in\
  \ a target firearm. The next time the target weapon fires during this spell's duration,\
  \ it automatically misfires. If this misfire causes the firearm to explode, the\
  \ radius of the explosion is doubled and it deals maximum damage to all creatures\
  \ in the radius. The firearm's wielder also takes 1d6 additional points of fire\
  \ damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 10d6) you have."
