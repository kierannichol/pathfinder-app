name: "Deivon's Parry"
description: "Originally designed by an Aldori magus who had long admired swashbucklers\
  \ for their ability to deflect blows, Deivon's parry has swiftly gained popularity\
  \ among bards and magi alike. Your reflexes snap into action, allowing you to deflect\
  \ a blow. This spell can be cast only when an opponent makes a melee attack against\
  \ you, and only before the attack roll has been made. Make a parry attempt with\
  \ a light or one-handed weapon you're wielding, as if using the swashbuckler's opportune\
  \ parry and riposte deed (except that this does not require panache). You cannot\
  \ riposte as part of this spell's effect."
