name: "Ice Crystal Teleport"
description: "This spell functions as teleport, except you use it to teleport yourself\
  \ or one other creature to a safe location you specify (the target can bring along\
  \ objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed the target's heavy load). You can\
  \ only send the target to a location with which you are very familiar. The target\
  \ is first trapped in ice (hardness 0, 3 hit points per inch of thickness, 1 inch\
  \ thick per caster level) for 1d4 rounds, during which time it is paralyzed, aware\
  \ but unable to take any physical actions, and begins to fade away as the teleportation\
  \ aspect takes effect. At the end of the 1d4 rounds, the target teleports to the\
  \ specified location, and the ice's hit points drop to 0 and it quickly melts away.\
  \ If the ice is destroyed before the target teleports, the spell ends and the teleport\
  \ doesn't occur."
