description: "A creature that fails its save uses an immediate action to hand you\
  \ whatever object it's currently wielding or holding. If the target doesn't have\
  \ an immediate action available, it uses a move action at the beginning of its next\
  \ turn to hand you the object. If it's currently holding or wielding more than one\
  \ item, determine randomly which item it gives you. If you're no longer adjacent\
  \ to the creature when it has to give you the item, the spell ends with no effect.\
  \ A creature that isn't holding an item when you cast this spell is unaffected."
