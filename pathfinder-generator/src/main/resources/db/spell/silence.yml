name: "Silence"
description: "Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected\
  \ area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells with verbal components\
  \ cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through\
  \ the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary\
  \ unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the\
  \ effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature\
  \ can attempt a Will save to negate the spell and can use spell resistance, if any.\
  \ Items in a creature's possession or magic items that emit sound receive the benefits\
  \ of saves and spell resistance, but unattended objects and points in space do not.\
  \ Creatures in an area of a silence spell are immune to sonic or language-based\
  \ attacks, spells, and effects."
