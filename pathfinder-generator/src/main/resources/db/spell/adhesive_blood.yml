name: "Adhesive Blood"
description: "Your blood thickens to becomes a glue-like substance upon contact with\
  \ air. A piercing or slashing weapon that deals hit point damage to you is stuck\
  \ fast unless the wielder succeeds at a Reflex save. A creature can pry off a stuck\
  \ weapon on its turn as a standard action with a successful Strength check against\
  \ the spell's DC. Strong alcohol or universal solvent dissolves the adhesive. The\
  \ glue breaks down 5 rounds after you die, or when the duration ends. This glue\
  \ has no effect while underwater or in environments that lack air."
