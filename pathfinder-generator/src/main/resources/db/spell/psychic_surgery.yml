description: "Psychic surgery cures the target of all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma\
  \ damage and restores all points permanently drained from the target's Intelligence,\
  \ Wisdom, and Charisma scores. It also eliminates all ongoing insanity, confusion,\
  \ and fear effects. Psychic surgery can also remove other mental afflictions, including\
  \ enchantment spells and abilities, and even instantaneous effects, but in this\
  \ case, if dispel magic couldn't remove the effect, psychic surgery works only if\
  \ the spell level or equivalent spell level of the effect was 6th level or lower.\
  \ Psychic surgery removes all effects magically altering the target's memory, even\
  \ instantaneous effects, and it can restore a memory to perfect clarity like the\
  \ second use of modify memory."
