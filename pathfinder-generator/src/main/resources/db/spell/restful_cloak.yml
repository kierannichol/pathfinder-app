name: "Restful Cloak"
description: "A cloak you are wearing transforms into a canvas tent large enough to\
  \ hold four Medium creatures, firmly pitched in a flat area adjacent to you (if\
  \ there is no such area, this spell simply fails). A creature regains 1 hit point\
  \ for each hour it rests in the tent, in addition to any other benefits of resting.\
  \ Additionally, a fatigued creature resting within the tent for 1 hour loses the\
  \ fatigued condition, but a creature cannot recover from being fatigued more than\
  \ once per casting of restful tent. At the end of the spell's duration, the tent\
  \ transforms back into a cloak. If the tent is moved prior to the expiration of\
  \ the spell's duration, the spell immediately ends."
