description: "You place your spirit in a receptive state so when you confirm a critical\
  \ hit against a living enemy or reduce a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points,\
  \ you can steal some of that creature's ki. This replenishes 1 point of ki as long\
  \ as you have at least 1 ki point in your ki pool. This does not allow you to exceed\
  \ your ki pool's maximum. This ability does not stack with similar abilities (such\
  \ as the steal ki ability of the hungry ghost monk)."
