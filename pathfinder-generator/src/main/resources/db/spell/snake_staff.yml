description: "With a long hissing whisper, you transform ordinary pieces of wood into\
  \ various sorts of snakes that immediately attack your foes. As long as the snakes\
  \ remain within sight, you can direct their actions telepathically as a free action.\
  \ You can only apply this spell to wooden objects not in a creature's possession\
  \ or not part of a larger structure or plant. Each time you cast this spell you\
  \ can create a number of snakes equal to your caster level. More powerful snakes\
  \ take up more than one of your available total, as noted below. See Snake statistics\
  \ and advanced and giant simple templates."
