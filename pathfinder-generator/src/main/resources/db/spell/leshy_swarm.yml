  \ simpleminded. The swarm uses the statistics for a rat swarm, except it does not\
  \ carry a disease or have scent. The leshy swarm has darkvision with a range of\
  \ 60 feet and is immune to electricity, mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poison,\
  \ polymorph, sleep effects, sonic, and stunning."
