description: "This spell creates a spectral saluqi, an undead canine resembling an\
  \ oversized hound with black fur, a gray ruff and tail, and milky gray eyes. The\
  \ hound shares your alignment and can converse with you telepathically. It can see\
  \ and attack ethereal creatures, and otherwise has the same statistics as a yeth\
  \ hound (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 286). It usually leaves no tracks because it prefers\
  \ to fly an inch above the ground. You are immune to the hound's bay ability. The\
  \ hound's bite is considered aligned to any single alignment you possess for the\
  \ purposes of overcoming damage reduction."
