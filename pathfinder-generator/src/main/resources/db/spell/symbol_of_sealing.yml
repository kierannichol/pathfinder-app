name: "Symbol of Sealing"
description: "This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon or above\
  \ a door or other opening measuring no more than 20 square feet/level in size. When\
  \ the casting is completed, the symbol immediately triggers, glowing visibly and\
  \ sealing the door or opening with an invisible barrier of force equivalent to a\
  \ wall of force. Destroying the symbol ends the effect, though destroying it once\
  \ the symbol has been activated requires destroying the wall of forcefirst. Once\
  \ triggered, the wall remains for 10 minutes per caster level."
