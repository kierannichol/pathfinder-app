name: "Passwall"
description: "You create a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not\
  \ through metal or other harder materials. The passage is 10 feet deep plus an additional\
  \ 5 feet deep per three caster levels above 9th (15 feet at 12th, 20 feet at 15th,\
  \ and a maximum of 25 feet deep at 18th level). If the wall's thickness is more\
  \ than the depth of the passage created, then a single passwall simply makes a niche\
  \ or short tunnel. Several passwall spells can then form a continuing passage to\
  \ breach very thick walls. When passwall ends, creatures within the passage are\
  \ ejected out the nearest exit. If someone dispels the passwall or you dismiss it,\
  \ creatures in the passage are ejected out the far exit, if there is one, or out\
  \ the sole exit if there is only one."
