description: "You animate the target's shadow with semi-living energies drawn from\
  \ the Shadow Plane, instilling a maddening hunger for its owner's life energy within\
  \ it. If the target fails its Will save, it takes 1d4 points of Strength damage\
  \ as a quasi-real shadow manifests in its space and attacks it. This shadow remains\
  \ attached to the target and moves wherever the target moves."
