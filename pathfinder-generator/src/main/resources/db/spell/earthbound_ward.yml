    Effect: "The primary caster marks an enclosed space upon the ground with a material\
      \ that is anathema to a specific type of creature that the caster wishes to\
      \ keep at bay; typically, this ritual is used against specific outsider subtypes\
      \ and undead creatures. Typical materials (and a list of creatures affected\
      \ by those materials) include cold iron powder (daemons, demons, and fey), mithral\
      \ or silver powder (devils and lycanthropes), oil mixed with sulfur (agathions,\
      \ angels, archons, and azatas), and salt (undead and outsiders with the incorporeal\
      \ subtype). At the GM's decision, additional materials may be available for\
      \ use against other creatures. The area to be affected must be enclosed, with\
      \ no gaps in the material's outline."
