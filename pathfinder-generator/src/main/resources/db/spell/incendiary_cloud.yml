description: "An incendiary cloud spell creates a cloud of roiling smoke shot through\
  \ with white-hot embers. The smoke obscures all sight as a fog cloud does. In addition,\
  \ the white-hot embers within the cloud deal 6d6 points of fire damage to everything\
  \ within the cloud on your turn each round. All targets can make Reflex saves each\
  \ round to take half damage."
