name: "Adroit Retrieval"
description: "You instill the target with the ability to withdraw small items from\
  \ her pockets or packs with supernatural swiftness. When the target retrieves an\
  \ item stored on itself, it can retrieve the item either as a move action without\
  \ provoking attacks of opportunity, or as a swift action that provokes attacks of\
  \ opportunity. This effect functions only when the target attempts to retrieve a\
  \ stored item that weighs less than 1 pound per caster level (maximum 15 pounds)."
