description: "Upon completing this spell, roll a single d20 and record the result.\
  \ At any point during the duration of this spell, you may use that roll for a single\
  \ ability check, attack roll, initiative check, saving throw, or skill check, using\
  \ the recorded result in place of a roll. This spell cannot be used to replace a\
  \ roll that has already been made; the recorded result must be used instead of a\
  \ roll. Once you have used this recorded result or the duration of the spell ends,\
  \ the spell's effect ends. You can't have more than one instance of embrace destiny\
  \ active on you at the same time."
