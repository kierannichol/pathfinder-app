  \ that you can wield or give to another creature like any other longsword. At 8th\
  \ level, the sword functions as a +2 longsword. At 13th level, it functions as a\
  \ +3 longsword. A force sword cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks,\
  \ but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation\
  \ affects it."
