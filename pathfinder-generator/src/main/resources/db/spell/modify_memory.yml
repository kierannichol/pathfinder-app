description: "You reach into the subject's mind and modify as many as 5 minutes of\
  \ its memories in one of the following ways. Eliminate all memory of an event the\
  \ subject actually experienced. This spell cannot negate charm, geas/quest, suggestion,\
  \ or similar spells. Allow the subject to recall with perfect clarity an event it\
  \ actually experienced. Change the details of an event the subject actually experienced.\
  \ Implant a memory of an event the subject never experienced.Casting the spell takes\
  \ 1 round. If the subject fails to save, you proceed with the spell by spending\
  \ as much as 5 minutes (a period of time equal to the amount of memory you want\
  \ to modify) visualizing the memory you wish to modify in the subject. If your concentration\
  \ is disturbed before the visualization is complete, or if the subject is ever beyond\
  \ the spell's range during this time, the spell is lost."
