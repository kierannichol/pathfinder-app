description: "You cut yourself with the dagger, dealing yourself 1d6 points of bleed\
  \ damage. So long as you keep taking this bleed damage, your targets each bleed\
  \ for 1d6 points of damage at the beginning of their turns. The bleed damage on\
  \ any target ends if that target receives magical healing, or if your bleed damage\
  \ ends for any reason. This spell has no effect if you're immune to bleed damage\
  \ or can otherwise reduce or ignore the bleed damage to yourself."
