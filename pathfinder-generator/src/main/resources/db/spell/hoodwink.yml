name: "Hoodwink"
description: "You befuddle the targets' senses, preventing the targets from clearly\
  \ perceiving their surroundings. Instead, hoodwinked creatures see only the roughest\
  \ shapes and details and hear only muffled noises. However, targets can clearly\
  \ hear verbal communication from the spell's caster. This spell does not impart\
  \ understanding of the caster's language if the creature can't already understand\
  \ it. Other than to hear the caster speak, targets automatically fail Perception\
  \ checks with DCs greater than 5, and they are too disoriented by the spell to accurately\
  \ remember the path they took while under its effects."
