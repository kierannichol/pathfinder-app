description: "Your wrathful words cause physical harm to your enemies. Your enemies\
  \ take 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) and are staggered\
  \ for 1 round. Half of this damage is sonic damage, but the other half results directly\
  \ from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance\
  \ to sonic-based attacks. Rebukeis especially devastating to foes who worship your\
  \ god, inflicting 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) and stunning\
  \ them for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates\
  \ the staggering or stunning effect."
