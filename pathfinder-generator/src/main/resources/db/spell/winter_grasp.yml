description: "Ice encrusts the ground, radiating supernatural cold and making it hard\
  \ for creatures to maintain their balance. This icy ground is treated as normal\
  \ ice, forcing creatures to spend 2 squares of movement to enter an icy square and\
  \ increasing the DC of Acrobatics checks in the area by 5. A creature that begins\
  \ its turn in the affected area takes 1d6 points of cold damage and takes a â€“2 penalty\
  \ on saving throws against spells with the cold descriptor for 1 round."
