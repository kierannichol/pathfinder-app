description: "You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horselike creature (the exact coloration\
  \ can be customized as you wish). It can be ridden only by you or by the one person\
  \ for whom you specifically created the mount. A phantom steed has a black head\
  \ and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make\
  \ no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight,\
  \ but animals shun it and refuse to attack it."
