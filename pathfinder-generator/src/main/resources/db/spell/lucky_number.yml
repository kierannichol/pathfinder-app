name: "Lucky Number"
description: "You are able to tweak tiny variables affecting a creature's immediate\
  \ future in order to grant the target a bit of luck at the right time. Roll a d20;\
  \ once during the duration of lucky number, when the target creature rolls that\
  \ result (regardless of what type of dice the target rolls), the creature has the\
  \ option to either reroll the result or add a +2 luck bonus to the result. The creature\
  \ must decide to use this ability before the success or failure of the original\
  \ roll is known. A creature can have only one lucky number at a time. If lucky number\
  \ is cast on a creature already affected by that spell, the new number replaces\
  \ the previous one."
