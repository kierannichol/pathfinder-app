name: "Recorporeal Incarnation"
description: "Recorporeal incarnation effectively replaces the target living creature's\
  \ body with that of the target corpse. The target corpse must be fresh--either dead\
  \ for no more than 24 hours or appropriately preserved by an effect such as gentle\
  \ repose. While casting the spell, you must remain in contact with the corpse while\
  \ touching the living target with the focus item. As the spell is cast, the dead\
  \ body's flesh unravels like ribbons to sheathe the living target, who must be within\
  \ one size category of the corpse. While the spell is in effect, the focus item\
  \ must remain within 30 feet of the target living creature."
