name: "False Future"
description: "You interfere with attempts to predict the target's future by preventing\
  \ divinations from revealing what the target will do and what will befall the target\
  \ while under the spell's effects. Instead of the target's true actions or experiences,\
  \ divinations resolve as if the target will experience some different future you\
  \ describe as you cast false future. The target creature can attempt a Will save\
  \ to avoid the initial effect, and creatures using divinations get a Will save to\
  \ disbelieve the illusion. This spell doesn't prevent divinations cast after the\
  \ duration's end from determining what the subject actually did during the time\
  \ you obscured using false future."
