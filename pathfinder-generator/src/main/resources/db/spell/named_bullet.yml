description: "You imbue the target with deadly accuracy against a selected creature\
  \ type (and subtype for humanoids or outsiders) or a specific creature you know\
  \ and can name. When used against the selected creature, the ammunition never misfires\
  \ and is unaffected by concealment (but not total concealment), and at a range of\
  \ 30 feet or less, the attack targets the selected creature's touch AC. When the\
  \ target hits the selected creature, you must overcome that creature's spell resistance,\
  \ or this spell has no effect. A normal hit scored using the target against the\
  \ selected creature is considered to be a critical threat and deals 1 extra point\
  \ of damage per caster level (maximum 20), which is not multiplied on a critical\
  \ hit. A natural critical hit deals the same extra damage, but that damage is multiplied\
  \ due to the critical."
