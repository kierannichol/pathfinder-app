name: "Shield Speech"
description: "You can securely communicate with one creature within range. So long\
  \ as your target remains within 10 feet of you, you and it can speak freely to each\
  \ other without fear of being overheard. Communications that involve shield speech\
  \ cannot be spied on, such as with a divination spell, and observers of the conversation\
  \ can tell you are communicating but cannot read lips or hear the conversation unless\
  \ they are the target of the spell. If you or the target speak to any other creatures,\
  \ they can hear you normally (only communication between you and the target is protected).\
  \ The spell does not shield writing, sign language, or any form of communication\
  \ other than speaking."
