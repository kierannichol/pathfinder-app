description: "This spell protects you (but not your gear) from a natural occurrence\
  \ or condition (not against a spell or the action of a creature) that would kill\
  \ you. You must specify the condition, and the spell is effective only against that\
  \ condition. If you are subjected to that condition during the duration of the spell,\
  \ you feel no discomfort and take no damage from the condition. At the end of the\
  \ spell's duration, the condition has full normal effects if you are still subjected\
  \ to it."
