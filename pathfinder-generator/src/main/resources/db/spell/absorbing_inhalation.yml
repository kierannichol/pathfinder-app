name: "Absorbing Inhalation"
description: "You grant your lungs inhuman strength and capacity, allowing you to\
  \ harmlessly and completely inhale one gas, fog, smoke, mist, or similar cloud-like\
  \ effect. If the targeted cloud is a magical effect, you must succeed at a caster\
  \ level check (DC 11 + the effect's caster level) to inhale it. Inhaling the cloud\
  \ removes it from the area, leaving normal air in its place. If the cloud is too\
  \ large for you to affect with a single casting of this spell, you may instead inhale\
  \ a portion of the cloud, but you must inhale the portion of the cloud closest to\
  \ you. This spell has no effect on gaseous creatures. It can only affect an instantaneous-duration\
  \ cloud (such as a breath weapon) if you ready an action to cast the spell in response."
