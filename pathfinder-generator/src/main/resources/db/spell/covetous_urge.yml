name: "Covetous Urge"
description: "You curse the target with insatiable greed, causing it to attempt to\
  \ steal any item worth 100 gp or more that it can see, each time it enters a new\
  \ room or area. If it can see multiple items of value in a single room or area,\
  \ it attempts to steal the item it thinks is worth the most. This covetous compulsion\
  \ might cause the target to act recklessly where it normally would not (unless acting\
  \ in this manner would clearly cause it to die, suffer great harm, or get caught)."
