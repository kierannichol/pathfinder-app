name: "Locate Portal"
description: "When this spell is active, you feel a mental pull in the direction of\
  \ any active or operable portal leading to another plane within range of the spell.\
  \ If multiple portals are present, you are pulled only to the nearest one. If moving\
  \ causes you to become closer to a different portal, you become drawn to that one\
  \ instead. The spell gives you the direction of the portal only, not a route. Once\
  \ you are within 10 feet of the portal, you no longer feel the pull, only the portal's\
  \ presence. The spell does not pinpoint or otherwise reveal hidden portals, nor\
  \ does it do anything to aid in opening or operating them."
