description: "You conjure an invisible team of tiny engineers to construct a trap\
  \ at alarming speed. Originating at your location, the team must remain within range\
  \ of you or the spell ends. The engineers construct a mechanical trap of your choice.\
  \ Construction takes a number of rounds equal to the trap's challenge rating. The\
  \ engineers must have the materials available. At the end of the construction time,\
  \ use your Craft (traps) skill with a +5 bonus to determine the success of their\
  \ work. If the engineers succeed, the trap is complete and the spell ends. If they\
  \ fail, the materials are deposited at that location and the spell ends. If the\
  \ spell's duration ends before the trap is complete, the engineers automatically\
  \ fail."
