name: "Call Animal"
description: "This spell calls the nearest wild animal of a particular type you designate\
  \ (provided the animal's CR is equal to or less than your caster level) to seek\
  \ you out. The animal moves toward you under its own power, so the time it takes\
  \ to arrive depends on how close an animal of the desired type is when you cast\
  \ the spell. If there is no animal of that type capable of reaching you within the\
  \ spell's duration, you are aware of this fact, but the spell is wasted. Knowledge\
  \ of the local fauna makes this spell more effective, and the GM may permit a Knowledge\
  \ (nature) skill check (DC 15) to know what animals can be found in an area."
