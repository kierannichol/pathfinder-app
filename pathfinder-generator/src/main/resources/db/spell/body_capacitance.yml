description: "If you take electricity damage while this spell is active, some of the\
  \ energy is stored on your skin, as with holding the charge on a touch spell. You\
  \ can release this stored electricity by making a melee touch attack. You gain a\
  \ +3 bonus on the attack roll if your opponent is wearing metal armor, is carrying\
  \ a metal weapon, or is made of metal. The target of your touch attack is dealt\
  \ electricity damage equal to half the amount of electricity damage you took after\
  \ you cast this spell (for example, if you saved for half damage against a lightning\
  \ bolt and took only 15 points of electricity damage, your next touch attack deals\
  \ 7 points of electricity damage). This spell is discharged once you hit with a\
  \ melee touch attack to deliver its damage. If you take electricity damage multiple\
  \ times while this spell is active, use the largest amount of electricity damage\
  \ you took to determine your touch attack damage."
