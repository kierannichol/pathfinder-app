name: "Alter Summoned Monster"
description: "You swap a creature summoned by a conjuration (summoning) spell for\
  \ a creature you could summon with a summon monster or summon nature's ally spell.\
  \ The new creature must be an option from a spell of the same level or lower as\
  \ the spell that summoned the target. The new creature cannot be summoned into an\
  \ environment that cannot support it. The target can attempt a Will saving throw\
  \ to negate this effect, but if the target is under your control, it receives no\
  \ saving throw. Alter summoned monster does not alter the duration of the spell\
  \ that summoned the target, nor does it affect any additional creatures summoned\
  \ by the same spell as the target. The new creature has the same conditions and\
  \ amount of damage as the target creature, and remains affected by all curses, diseases,\
  \ poisons, and penalties that affected the target, but no other spells or effects\
  \ carry over. Alter summoned monster is a spell of the same alignment type or types\
  \ as the creature for which you exchange the target. An eidolon can't be targeted\
  \ by this spell."
