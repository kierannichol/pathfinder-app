name: "Lesser Nondetection"
description: "This spell functions like nondetection, except it blocks the effects\
  \ of only divination spells and effects that target an area, rather than you or\
  \ an object in your possession specifically. For example, lesser nondetection doesn't\
  \ ward you against a spellcaster who is attempting to scry on you with the scrying\
  \ spell or find an object in your possession with locate object, but it does protect\
  \ you against effects that target an area you happen to be in, such as detect spells\
  \ or clairaudience/clairvoyance."
