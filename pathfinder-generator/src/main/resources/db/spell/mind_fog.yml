description: "Mind fog produces a bank of thin mist that weakens the mental resistance\
  \ of those caught in it. Creatures in the mind fog take a â€“10 penalty on Wisdom\
  \ checks and Will saves. (A creature that successfully saves against the fog is\
  \ not affected and need not make further saves even if it remains in the fog.) Affected\
  \ creatures take the penalty as long as they remain in the fog and for 2d6 rounds\
  \ thereafter. The fog is stationary and lasts for 30 minutes (or until dispersed\
  \ by wind)."
