description: "Your touch progressively transmutes the substance of creatures you touch\
  \ into stone. Once per round, you may deliver a touch attack that inflicts 1d4 points\
  \ of Dexterity damage and slows the target (as the spell) for 1 round. A successful\
  \ Fortitude save negates the slow effect but not the ability damage. A target reduced\
  \ to 0 Dexterity is petrified permanently. Break enchantment, restoration, or stone\
  \ to fleshcan reverse the effects of calcific touch."
