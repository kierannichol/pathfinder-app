description: "Any opponent attempting to directly attack the warded creature, even\
  \ with a targeted spell, must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the opponent\
  \ can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the spell. If the save\
  \ fails, the opponent can't follow through with the attack, that part of its action\
  \ is lost, and it can't directly attack the warded creature for the duration of\
  \ the spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected. This\
  \ spell does not prevent the warded creature from being attacked or affected by\
  \ area of effect spells. The subject cannot attack without breaking the spell but\
  \ may use nonattack spells or otherwise act."
