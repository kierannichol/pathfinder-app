name: "Suspend Drowning"
description: "The affected creatures immediately--though temporarily--stop drowning\
  \ and cannot suffocate or drown while this spell is in effect. A target that had\
  \ been reduced to below 1 hit point from drowning immediately returns to 1 hit point.\
  \ The magic of this spell allows the targets to breathe, drink, and talk normally\
  \ for the duration of the spell, but targets cannot inhale to increase the amount\
  \ of air remaining in their lungs. When the spell effect ends, the target resumes\
  \ drowning unless it is in an environment that allows it to breathe normally (such\
  \ as an air-breathing creature returning to the surface) or has obtained a method\
  \ of breathing normally (such as by consuming a potion of water breathing)."
