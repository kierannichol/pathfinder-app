name: "Malicious Spite"
description: "You invoke feelings of a driving malicious intent. The target's malice\
  \ is directed at a second individual as designated by you at the time of casting.\
  \ Thereafter, the target attempts to slander, abuse, and even plot murder against\
  \ the target of its spite. This loathing is not overt, and the target's actions\
  \ against the object of its spite remain subtle and indirect. The enchanted target\
  \ remains within its financial and ethical means when acting against the second\
  \ individual, though the malice toward this other person pushes the target to the\
  \ limit of what it would do to a hated individual."
