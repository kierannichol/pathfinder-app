name: "Suppressing Stone"
description: "You infuse arcane power into the focus ioun stone, which must be currently\
  \ floating around your head. If the ioun stone ever ceases floating around you,\
  \ the spell ends immediately, and the spell fails if the ioun stone in question\
  \ is cracked, burned, flawed, or otherwise of lesser value (such as a dull gray\
  \ ioun stone). While the spell is active, you gain a +1 resistance bonus on saving\
  \ throws against mind-affecting effects for every 4 caster levels (maximum +5 at\
  \ caster level 20). Whenever you fail a saving throw against a mind-affecting spell\
  \ or effect, you can burn out the focus, transforming it irrevocably into a dull\
  \ gray ioun stone and ending this spell, but suppressing the mind-affecting effect\
  \ for 1 round per 2,500 gp of value of the focus (minimum 1 round). Rounds during\
  \ which the effect is suppressed still count against its duration, and the effect\
  \ can still be dispelled or disrupted during this time."
