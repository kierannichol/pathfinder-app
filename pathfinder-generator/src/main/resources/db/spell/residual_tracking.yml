description: "By touching a footprint, you receive a clear mental image of the person\
  \ or creature that made it. The image has the exact same appearance as the creature\
  \ that made the footprint at the moment it made the imprint, including any telling\
  \ features or expressions, any gear or equipment, or anything else the creature\
  \ was carrying at the time. For example, the footprint of a horse would reveal both\
  \ the horse and any creature riding it when it made the footprint."
