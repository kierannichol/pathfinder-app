description: "The target's flesh becomes flexible and rubbery. It gains a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks and Escape Artist checks, as well as to\
  \ its CMD against combat maneuver checks to grapple. Anytime the target would take\
  \ falling damage, it treats falls as 20 feet shorter (minimum 0) for the purpose\
  \ of determining damage. In addition, if the target falls against a hard surface,\
  \ it can attempt an Acrobatics check (DC = the distance fallen) to attempt to bounce\
  \ upward; success means the creature bounces upward half the distance fallen."
