description: "You harness divine power to create one of four different ceremonies--a\
  \ funeral, holiday fete, marriage, or naming--and can also create two domain-based\
  \ ceremonies. Each ceremony provides a boon to two living, touched subjects for\
  \ 1 hour per caster level, representing the divine gifts granted by your deity as\
  \ well as the normal morale-boosting benefits of participating in an officiated\
  \ ceremony. Bonuses granted by these boons are sacred bonuses if you channel positive\
  \ energy or profane bonuses if you channel negative energy. (Bonuses in this section\
  \ are referred to simply as sacred bonuses for ease of reading.) Only subjects whose\
  \ alignments are within one step of your deity can be affected by this spell."
