description: "You restore up to 1 charge per level to a battery or half that number\
  \ of charges to a technological item capable of being charged by a battery. If you\
  \ recharge a battery, there is a 20% chance that the battery is destroyed by the\
  \ attempt. If you restore more charges than the item can hold, the item must succeed\
  \ at a Fortitude saving throw or take 1d6 points of electricity damage for each\
  \ excess charge. This spell provides no knowledge of how many charges an item can\
  \ safely hold, but you can choose to bestow fewer charges than the maximum allowed\
  \ to reduce the risk; you must declare how many charges you are restoring before\
  \ casting this spell."
