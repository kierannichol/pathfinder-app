name: "Substitute Trail"
description: "This spell can affect any creatures with which you interacted in the\
  \ last 24 hours. You alter the trails left by the chosen creatures, making it appear\
  \ that another creature with which you are familiar left the trail instead (you\
  \ must have met the creature with which you are familiar). If a tracker exceeds\
  \ the DC of the skill check to follow the trail by an amount equal to your caster\
  \ level, the tracker recognizes that the trail has been manipulated by this spell,\
  \ although it cannot see the trail's true nature unless it uses magical means, such\
  \ as true seeing."
