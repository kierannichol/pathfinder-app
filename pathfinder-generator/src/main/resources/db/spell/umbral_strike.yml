description: "You create a bolt of dark energy and use it to make a ranged touch attack\
  \ that ignores concealment (but not total concealment). If you hit, the target takes\
  \ 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). Half of this damage is cold\
  \ damage and half of it is negative energy. The bolt's shadow expands and covers\
  \ the target, rendering him blind for the duration of the spell. A successful Fortitude\
  \ save halves the damage and negates the blind condition."
