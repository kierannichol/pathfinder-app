description: "You transform a single weapon into an awe-inspiring instrument. The\
  \ weapon gains a +2 sacred bonus on damage rolls, and if the weapon scores a critical\
  \ hit, the target of that critical hit becomes shaken for 1 round with no saving\
  \ throw. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A ranged weapon affected by this\
  \ spell applies these effects to its ammunition."
