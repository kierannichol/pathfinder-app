name: "Hunger for Flesh"
description: "Your target's belly distends and its front teeth grow longer and sharper.\
  \ The creature ravenously craves the flesh of its own kind, gaining the staggered\
  \ condition as hunger pangs rack its altered body. The target gains a bite attack\
  \ as a primary natural attack that deals damage appropriate for its size (1d6 if\
  \ Medium, 1d4 if Small). There's a 25% chance on each of the creature's turns that\
  \ it can't overcome its hunger. If so, it must move directly toward the nearest\
  \ corporeal creature of its type and subtype (if applicable) and make a bite attack\
  \ against it. If the target lacks enough actions to attack on that turn, it moves\
  \ as close to the creature as it can, but on its next turn, if the percentile dice\
  \ indicate it overcomes its hunger, the target is not forced to pursue or attack\
  \ further."
