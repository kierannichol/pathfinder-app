description: "You dim your targets' perceptions of light and shadow, convincing them\
  \ the space they occupy is dark. Each creature that fails its save perceives the\
  \ world around it as one light level darker than its true illumination level. The\
  \ spell does not change the light level outside of the targets' perception, and\
  \ does not create magical darkness. However, the spell creates an illusion of darkness\
  \ rather than actual darkness, so low-light and darkvision don't allow a target\
  \ to see in the conditions created by the spell. Even targets that see normally\
  \ through magical darkness suffer a loss of vision from this spell."
