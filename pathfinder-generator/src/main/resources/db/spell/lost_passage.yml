name: "Lost Passage"
description: "Creatures in the area of this spell are subject to a subtle enchantment\
  \ that confounds their senses of direction, interferes with recognizing landmarks,\
  \ and causes them to misjudge distances and angles. Creatures that enter the area\
  \ must succeed at a new Survival check to avoid becoming lost immediately, whether\
  \ or not they succeed at their saving throws. Those that fail the save take a penalty\
  \ on such Survival checks equal to double your caster level, treat all squares they\
  \ enter as difficult terrain for as long as they are in the area and for 1 hour\
  \ per caster level thereafter, lose the benefit of all effects that allow them to\
  \ ignore difficult terrain, and take a â€“4 penalty to Dexterity."
