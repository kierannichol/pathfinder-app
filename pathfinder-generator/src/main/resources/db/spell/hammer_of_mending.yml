description: "Upon striking a piece of solid ground with the spell's focus or a holy\
  \ symbol, you let out a wave of energy that repairs items within its burst. All\
  \ objects or constructs within the burst are repaired of 1d6 points of damage per\
  \ level. When this spell affects constructs, the spell bypasses any immunity to\
  \ magic as if the spell did not allow spell resistance."
