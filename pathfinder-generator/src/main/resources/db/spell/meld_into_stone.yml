description: "Meld into stone enables you to meld your body and possessions into a\
  \ single block of stone. The stone must be large enough to accommodate your body\
  \ in all three dimensions. When the casting is complete, you and not more than 100\
  \ pounds of nonliving gear merge with the stone. If either condition is violated,\
  \ the spell fails and is wasted."
