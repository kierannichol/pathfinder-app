description: "You transform the target's fins, flippers, or tail into legs and feet,\
  \ allowing it to walk on land. The target loses its swim speed but gains a base\
  \ speed appropriate for a humanoid of its size (speed 30 if a Medium or larger creature,\
  \ speed 20 if Small). If the creature is immersed in water for 1 round, the transformation\
  \ reverts, allowing it to swim normally. One round after leaving the water, the\
  \ transformation occurs again, allowing it to walk."
