name: "Aquatic Trail"
description: "You use divination magic to enhance the underwater trails in the area\
  \ around you, allowing you to track creatures through the water as if across soft\
  \ ground as long as they passed through the area less than 1 week ago (this lets\
  \ you notice trails that are much older than normal underwater trails). The spell's\
  \ area moves with you, so you can follow the trail through the water over long distances.\
  \ Other creatures can also follow the trail as long as they move with you. Because\
  \ of the plethora of sea creatures in the higher zones, it's possible that the trail\
  \ that most interests you will be covered by the trails of other aquatic creatures,\
  \ making this spell even more useful than normal in the Abyssal and Abaddonian zones."
