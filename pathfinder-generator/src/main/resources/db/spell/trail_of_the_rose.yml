name: "Trail of the Rose"
description: "This spell creates an illusory trail in the form of a misty and visible\
  \ scent coming from the rose used as this spell's material component. When you cast\
  \ this spell, the scent of the rose leaves a faint pink-tinged illusion that ripples\
  \ and flows in the area. Only you and up to six creatures you designate upon casting\
  \ the spell can see the illusion. To designate a creature, you must know it well.\
  \ It is not enough simply to have met that creature once or heard of the creature.\
  \ When you move, this illusory scent leaves a trail, though there are no telltale\
  \ signs of which direction you moved if creatures designated by this spell find\
  \ a middle section of the trail. This is typically used to create backtracking method\
  \ for the caster's handpicked allies, useful for navigating in and out of mazes\
  \ or labyrinthine cave complexes without leaving behind an obvious trail."
