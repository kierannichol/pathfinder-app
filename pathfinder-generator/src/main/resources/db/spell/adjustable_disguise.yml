description: "This spell functions as disguise self, except as a swift action you\
  \ can alter the disguise (within the limitations of disguise self). For example,\
  \ you could make yourself look like a young human city guard, then an old elven\
  \ wizard of the opposite gender, then a halfling thief, and so on. You can change\
  \ the disguise a number of times equal to your caster level."
