name: "Antithetical Constraint"
description: "You constrain the target such that the target automatically misses with\
  \ all attacks made against creatures that are not of the opposite alignment of it.\
  \ For example, a lawful evil target would automatically fail at all attacks except\
  \ those made against chaotic good creatures, and a neutral good target would automatically\
  \ fail at all attacks except those made against neutral evil creatures. For the\
  \ purposes of antithetical constraint, creatures that are chaotic evil, chaotic\
  \ good, lawful evil, or lawful good are all considered to have the opposite alignment\
  \ of a target whose alignment is neutral with no other alignment components. This\
  \ restriction doesn't apply to effects that do not require attack rolls, such as\
  \ magic missile."
