name: "Excruciating Deformation"
description: "Your touch attack causes your target to become painfully malformed.\
  \ Its limbs twist and buckle, while its body contorts uncontrollably, shifting and\
  \ warping. Each round the target suffers excruciating pain and takes 2d6 points\
  \ of nonlethal damage, 1 point of Dexterity damage, and 1 point of Constitution\
  \ damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet. Once per round as a free action on\
  \ its turn, the target can attempt a new Fortitude saving throw to resist the spell\
  \ for 1 round."
