description: "The illusion makes undead creatures of Medium size or smaller appear\
  \ as if they were living humanoid creatures. You can target a number of undead creatures\
  \ whose total number of Hit Dice is no greater than twice your caster level. When\
  \ you create the illusion, you choose the races, genders, and attire for the undead\
  \ creatures. Additionally, the illusion makes the undead creatures' movements appear\
  \ lifelike (two shuffling zombies could be made to appear as two strolling lovers).\
  \ The illusion doesn't create smell, sound, texture, or temperature. Undead with\
  \ Intelligence scores can attempt a saving throw to negate the effect of the spell,\
  \ but mindless undead do not. Any creatures interacting with the illusion receive\
  \ a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion."
