name: "Transfer Regeneration"
description: "You bestow your regenerative abilities on the target. Your regeneration\
  \ stops functioning for the duration of the spell, and the target gains your regeneration.\
  \ For example, if you have regeneration 5 (acid or fire), your target gains regeneration\
  \ 5 (acid or fire). This regeneration overlaps (does not stack) with any regeneration\
  \ the creature already has, including other castings of this spell. This spell has\
  \ no effect if you don't have the regeneration ability or your regeneration isn't\
  \ functioning when you cast the spell."
