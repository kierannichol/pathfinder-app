name: "Phantasmal Reminder"
description: "You create a memory loop of a successful attack made against the target,\
  \ forcing its conscious mind to recall the details of the attack in such excruciating\
  \ detail that its physical body is racked by the recollection. This spell can affect\
  \ only a creature that has taken damage since the end of your last turn. The target\
  \ first can attempt a Will save to recognize the attack as unreal. If it fails that\
  \ saving throw, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or take an amount of\
  \ damage equal to 1d6 Ã— your caster level (maximum 10d6). Because the damage is\
  \ a quasi-real memory of existing wounds, this damage can't be reduced or prevented\
  \ (such as by the shield other spell)."
