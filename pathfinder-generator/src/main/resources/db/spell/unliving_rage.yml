description: "This spell functions as rage, except it affects only undead creatures\
  \ and bolsters them with necromantic energy rather than emotion. Each affected creature\
  \ gains a +2 profane bonus to Strength and Charisma, a +1 profane bonus on Will\
  \ saves, and a â€“2 penalty to AC. The effect is otherwise identical to a barbarian's\
  \ rage."
