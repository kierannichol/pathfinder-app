name: "Create Holds"
description: "You create a path of handholds on earthen, plaster, stone, or wooden\
  \ walls (not on walls made of metal or other, harder materials). The handholds are\
  \ created in pairs and are approximately 3 feet apart, located in a specific path\
  \ indicated by your gestures while casting the spell. The handholds' path can span\
  \ up to 30 feet out from you plus an additional 10 feet per 3 caster levels (maximum\
  \ 90 feet at 18th level). The handholds protrude approximately 6 inches from the\
  \ wall, measure 10 inches lengthwise, and are perfectly suited for gripping with\
  \ fingers or claws. At the end of the spell's duration, any creature being supported\
  \ by the handholds immediately begins to fall."
