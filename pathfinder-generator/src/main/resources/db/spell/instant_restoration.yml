name: "Instant Restoration"
description: "Instant restoration channels planar energy into a summoned creature.\
  \ This spell can be cast as an immediate action when a summoned creature you control\
  \ drops to 0 or fewer hit points. Rather than immediately disappear, the creature\
  \ is healed for 4d8 hp + 1 hit point per caster level (maximum 4d8+10 hit points).\
  \ If this healing brings your summoned creature's hit point total to 1 or more hit\
  \ points, it remains as if its hit points had never dropped to 0 or fewer. Creatures\
  \ slain by death effects cannot be saved by instant restoration. A summoner can\
  \ target his eidolon with this spell."
