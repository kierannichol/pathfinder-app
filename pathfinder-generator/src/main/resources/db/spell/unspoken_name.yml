description: "Prized among those who seek to monitor the attention paid to them, this\
  \ spell is said to be used by Arazni to identify those followers who dare refer\
  \ to her as â€œthe Harlot Queen\" so she might summarily dismiss them. When you cast\
  \ this spell, designate a word, phrase, or name. If a creature within 1 mile of\
  \ you uses that word, phrase, or name to refer to you, you immediately learn that\
  \ creature's name, appearance, and location. This discharges the spell."
