description: "A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point and burns\
  \ those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can\
  \ ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature,\
  \ it stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of fire damage to that creature,\
  \ though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. A flaming sphere rolls over\
  \ barriers less than 4 feet tall. It ignites flammable substances it touches and\
  \ illuminates the same area as a torch would."
