description: "Using the Path of Numbers, you are able to influence the seemingly random\
  \ elements in the environment around a creature, reducing that creature's efficacy.\
  \ Roll 3d8 and choose one of the dice--this die's result is the penalty mathematical\
  \ curse imparts. Next, choose either of the two remaining dice; the d20 roll corresponding\
  \ to that result on the Eight Basic Energies table is the roll the spell's penalty\
  \ applies to. The result of the final die represents the number of rounds that mathematical\
  \ curse lasts. A creature can be under the influence of only one mathematical curse\
  \ at a time. If mathematical curse is cast on a creature already affected by that\
  \ spell, the new curse replaces the previous one."
