description: "Each round, as a standard action, you can target a single living creature\
  \ of up to 9 HD and strike it with terrifying waves of power. If the target fails\
  \ its saving throw, it becomes panicked for 1d4 rounds, and you gain 5 temporary\
  \ hit points (which disappear after 1 hour). After the panic ends, the creature\
  \ remains shaken for 10 minutes per caster level, and it automatically becomes panicked\
  \ again if it comes within sight of you during that time."
