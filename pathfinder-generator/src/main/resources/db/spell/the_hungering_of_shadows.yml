    Effect: "The primary caster sits upon the onyx throne, invoking ancient rites\
      \ blaspheming against the light of the sun. The secondary casters offer up prayers\
      \ to the gods of darkness. In turn, each of the secondary casters consumes one\
      \ of the ioun stone shards, which induces a state of catatonia for 1 hour. Throughout\
      \ the ritual's casting, a localized partial solar eclipse marks the location\
      \ of the throne with an obvious pillar of darkness from above, easily noticed\
      \ by creatures throughout the ritual's area."
