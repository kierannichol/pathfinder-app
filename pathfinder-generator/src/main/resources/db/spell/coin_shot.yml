description: "You turn up to three coins into deadly projectiles that gain the velocity\
  \ of a bullet when thrown. The coins retain their normal appearance but can be used\
  \ as simple thrown weapons with a range increment of 20 feet and a critical multiplier\
  \ of Ã—2. The transmuted coins are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing\
  \ them. Like firearm bullets, the coins deal bludgeoning and piercing damage, and\
  \ attacks with them are resolved as touch attacks within the first range increment.\
  \ Regardless of whether a transmuted coin hits or misses the target, it is destroyed\
  \ after the attack. Only you can make attacks with the coins, though other creatures\
  \ can safely handle them without discharging the spell."
