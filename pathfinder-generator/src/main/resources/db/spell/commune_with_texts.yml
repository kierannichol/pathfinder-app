description: "You quickly absorb the knowledge in the target, which can be any assortment\
  \ of books, scrolls, or other texts. During the spell's duration, you can search\
  \ the texts and immediately find the most relevant information regarding any topic\
  \ the collection holds, potentially including singling out spellbooks or scrolls\
  \ containing individual or particular types of spells. You can attempt Knowledge\
  \ checks related to the collection's topics as if you were trained in those skills,\
  \ and you know whether the collection contains any information about which you failed\
  \ a Knowledge check in the past 24 hours. The bonus on Knowledge checks granted\
  \ by the collection of texts (if any) increases by 2."
