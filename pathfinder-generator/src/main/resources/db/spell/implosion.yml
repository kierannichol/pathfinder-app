name: "Implosion"
description: "This spell causes a destructive resonance in a corporeal creature's\
  \ body. Each round you concentrate (including the first), you can cause one creature\
  \ to collapse in on itself, inflicting 10 points of damage per caster level. If\
  \ you break concentration, the spell immediately ends, though any implosions that\
  \ have already happened remain in effect. You can target a particular creature only\
  \ once with each casting of the spell. Implosion has no effect on creatures in gaseous\
  \ form or on incorporeal creatures."
