name: "Hide from Undead"
description: "Undead cannot see, hear, or smell creatures warded by this spell. Even\
  \ extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities, such as blindsense, blindsight,\
  \ scent, and tremorsense, cannot detect or locate warded creatures. Nonintelligent\
  \ undead creatures (such as skeletons or zombies) are automatically affected and\
  \ act as though the warded creatures are not there. An intelligent undead creature\
  \ gets a single Will saving throw. If it fails, the subject can't see any of the\
  \ warded creatures. If it has reason to believe unseen opponents are present, however,\
  \ it can attempt to find or strike them. If a warded creature attempts to channel\
  \ positive energy, turn or command undead, touches an undead creature, or attacks\
  \ any creature (even with a spell), the spell ends for all recipients."
