name: "Conjure Carriage"
description: "You create a fine wooden carriage with whatever cosmetic embellishments\
  \ you desire. It is well constructed, although not exceptionally ostentatious. The\
  \ carriage can carry up to six Medium or Small passengers. When conjured, the carriage\
  \ comes with a team of two quasi-real light horses, which are already harnessed\
  \ to the carriage. At your command, an invisible coachman similar to an unseen servant\
  \ can assume the role of driver and direct the carriage, although it can't perform\
  \ any complex or dangerous driving, and fails any checks made to drive the carriage\
  \ in such conditions. At the end of the spell's duration, the carriage, horses,\
  \ and coachman disappear into nothingness, depositing everything on or in it on\
  \ the ground in its space."
