name: "Arcane Eye"
description: "You create an invisible magical sensor that sends you visual information.\
  \ You can create the arcane eye at any point you can see, but it can then travel\
  \ outside your line of sight without hindrance. An arcane eye travels at 30 feet\
  \ per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead as a human would (primarily\
  \ looking at the floor) or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute) if examining\
  \ the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. It sees exactly as you would\
  \ see if you were there."
