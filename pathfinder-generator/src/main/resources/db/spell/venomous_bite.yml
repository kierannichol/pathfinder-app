description: "When you touch the poison vial against the target creature and cast\
  \ this spell, the vial drains and the target's teeth become envenomed with the same\
  \ poison. The creature gains the use of 1 dose of the poison for every 5 caster\
  \ levels you possess (maximum 4 doses). The creature gains immunity to that poison\
  \ while this spell is in effect. The poison retains its normal properties, and this\
  \ spell does not alter the DC to resist or cure the poison."
