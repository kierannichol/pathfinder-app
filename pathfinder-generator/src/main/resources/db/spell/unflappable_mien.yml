description: "When a creature attempts to touch you with an attack (such as a touch\
  \ attack, an unarmed strike, an attack with a natural weapon, or a grapple), it\
  \ feels a field of force blocking its way. It can choose to abandon the attempt,\
  \ losing its action, or to push through the ward. If it pushes through, you can\
  \ trigger a wave of force against that creature. This discharges the spell, deals\
  \ 1d4 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 10d4), and pushes the creature\
  \ back 5 feet. If the creature cannot be pushed back 5 feet (if a solid surface\
  \ is directly behind it, for example), it takes 2d4 additional points of force damage.\
  \ A successful Fortitude saving throw halves the total amount of force damage the\
  \ creature takes."
