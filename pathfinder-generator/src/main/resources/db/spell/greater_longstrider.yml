description: "This functions as longstrider, except it gives you a +20-foot enhancement\
  \ bonus to your base speed and a +10-foot enhancement bonus to your other modes\
  \ of movement (burrow, climb, fly, swim, and so on). It does not affect movement\
  \ modes you do not actually have--for example, if you do not have a swim speed,\
  \ this spell does not grant you a swim speed."
