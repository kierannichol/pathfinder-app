name: "Storm Sight"
description: "You step into any magical or naturally occurring storm and commune directly\
  \ with the power of the wind and rain. This spell allows the storm's power to fill\
  \ you, granting you knowledge and images of what else lies within its reach. As\
  \ long as you remain within the storm, you can concentrate on it for 1 minute to\
  \ determine whether or not other living creatures with an Intelligence score of\
  \ 3 or higher are caught in the storm within 400 feet of you. Due to the nature\
  \ of the spell, you do not need to attempt concentration checks against violent\
  \ wind or storms when casting the spell, but other elements that might disrupt spellcasting\
  \ require checks as normal. While the spell is in effect, you no longer need to\
  \ attempt concentration checks as a result of wind or storms for spells you cast\
  \ or concentrate on."
