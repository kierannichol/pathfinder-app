description: "You make a conduit between the targeted master and her familiar, allowing\
  \ you to target the master or the familiar with your spells in order to affect the\
  \ other. If the master succeeds at its save to resist this spell but the familiar\
  \ fails, you can choose to have your spells that target the master affect the familiar\
  \ instead. If the familiar resists but the master doesn't, your spells that target\
  \ the familiar can affect the master instead. If both the familiar and the master\
  \ fail to resist this spell, you can affect either the familiar or the master when\
  \ you target either with a spell. When you target the master to affect her familiar\
  \ or vice versa, the target attempts a save (if one is allowed) with its own saving\
  \ throw bonus, but the other creature is affected by the spell."
