description: "This spell must be cast in an area with vegetation or it has no effect.\
  \ When you cast this spell, you draw the life force from the surrounding land and\
  \ hurl it at your enemies, dealing 1d6 points of positive energy damage per caster\
  \ level (to a maximum of 12d6 at 12th level) to any undead creatures in the spell's\
  \ area. However, doing so blights the land around you in a spread with a radius\
  \ of 5 feet per caster level you have (to a maximum of 60 feet at 12th level). All\
  \ vegetation in that area immediately withers and dies. Plant creatures aren't affected."
