name: "Permanent Hallucination"
description: "This spell functions as audiovisual hallucination, except that the phantasm\
  \ you create includes visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, and thermal components,\
  \ and the phantasm follows a complex script. The phantasm follows that script without\
  \ your having to concentrate on it and can react to stimuli the target perceives,\
  \ as appropriate for the script. Unlike most illusions with a save to disbelieve,\
  \ if the target disbelieves a permanent hallucination, she can choose to end the\
  \ effect entirely at any time."
