description: "This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which\
  \ can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible.\
  \ An arcane mark spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm\
  \ to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a detect\
  \ magic spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable."
