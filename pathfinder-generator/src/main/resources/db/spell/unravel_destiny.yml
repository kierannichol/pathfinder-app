description: "You utter a dire portent, causing destiny and fate to unravel around\
  \ the target. This profoundly disturbing effect causes the target to suffer a cumulative\
  \ â€“2 penalty on all ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks\
  \ for every hero point it possesses. The target can reduce this penalty by spending\
  \ hero points normally, but it takes 2d6 points of damage for each hero point spent\
  \ while this spell is in effect."
