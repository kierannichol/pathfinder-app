name: "Fleeting Memory"
description: "You create a gap in the target's memory, preventing the target from\
  \ remembering anything that happens from the moment you cast this spell until the\
  \ moment its complete duration ends. Fleeting memory doesn't wipe out its target's\
  \ memories until the end of its duration, so the target can remember the preceding\
  \ rounds until the spell's duration ends. If the spell ends prematurely, either\
  \ because you dismiss it or because it is dispelled, it disperses without affecting\
  \ its target's memory."
