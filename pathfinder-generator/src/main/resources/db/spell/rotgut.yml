description: "You transform the target into a cheap alcohol of your choice, such as\
  \ beer, grog, mead, rum, or wine. The alcohol doesn't taste good, but it's drinkable\
  \ and just as effective as normal alcohol in making creatures inebriated (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG GameMastery Guide 237). This spell doesn't work on holy water, potions, magical\
  \ liquids, or water that is part of a creature."
