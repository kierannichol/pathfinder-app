name: "Sleepwalk"
description: "You compel an unconscious or sleeping creature to rise and move in a\
  \ half-awake state. The target creature staggers about if led or guided, but remains\
  \ helpless for all other purposes. The subject moves at half speed and is limited\
  \ to a single move action each round. It is not capable of moving at a higher rate\
  \ of speed or taking actions other than movement except by magical assistance, and\
  \ automatically fails any Dexterity- or Strength-based skill checks. If the creature\
  \ takes any damage while sleepwalkingit must make a new saving throw or the spell\
  \ ends and the creature awakes (if it has more than 0 hit points). When the spell\
  \ ends or is dismissed, the target remains unconscious and must be awoken normally.\
  \ While sleepwalkallows an unconscious creature to move, it does not awaken the\
  \ creature, nor does it stabilize or otherwise heal them. A disabled creature that\
  \ moves about while under the effects of this spell does not start dying again as\
  \ a result of this movement."
