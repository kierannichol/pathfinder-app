name: "Aram Zey's Trap Ward"
description: "While he was researching the underlying causes of the resonance created\
  \ by overlapping abjurations, Aram Zey discovered a way to manipulate that resonance\
  \ to the caster's advantage when encountering magical traps. The protection provided\
  \ by Aram Zey's trap wardcomes into play whenever the caster is subjected to the\
  \ effects of a magical trap. The spell immediately discharges and interferes with\
  \ the trap's function in an attempt to counter the trap's magic. When this occurs,\
  \ make a caster level check as an immediate action. The DC of this check is equal\
  \ to the trap's Disable Device DC. If you're successful, the trap ward dispels the\
  \ magical effect of the trap before the effect actually manifests, effectively preventing\
  \ the trap from triggering for the next 1d4 rounds and ending Aram Zey's trap wardimmediately."
