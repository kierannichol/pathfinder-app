description: "This spell sends a spellbook into a random but safe location on the\
  \ Ethereal Plane, where it remains indefinitely. When you cast this spell, the target\
  \ spellbook dissolves into quickly fading lines of energy and runes that reflect\
  \ all of the spells stored within. Thereafter, you can retrieve the spellbook by\
  \ concentrating as a standard action, causing it to reappear in your hands. You\
  \ cannot cast this spell on another spellbook if you currently have a spellbook\
  \ in the Ethereal Plane. No other creatures or objects accompany the spellbook you\
  \ send away, and the duration of any spells currently affecting the spellbook continue\
  \ normally."
