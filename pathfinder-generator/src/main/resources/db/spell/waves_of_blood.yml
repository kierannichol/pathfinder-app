description: "You cause torrents of roiling blood to push your opponents away from\
  \ you. This wave attempts a bull rush combat maneuver against all creatures within\
  \ its area of effect, and you bull rush creatures of any size in this way. Attempt\
  \ a single combat maneuver check and apply the result to each creature within the\
  \ area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence,\
  \ Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush doesn't provoke\
  \ attacks of opportunity. Any creature in the area must also succeed at a Fortitude\
  \ saving throw or become sickened for 1d6 rounds by the tide of blood."
