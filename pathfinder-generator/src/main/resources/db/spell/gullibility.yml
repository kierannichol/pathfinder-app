description: "You befuddle the target's mind, making it more willing to believe even\
  \ the most outlandish tales. The target takes a â€“10 penalty on Sense Motive checks\
  \ for the spell's duration. In addition, creatures that attempt to lie to or deceive\
  \ the target gain a +10 bonus on their Bluff checks, as if the target wanted to\
  \ believe them and was drunk or impaired simultaneously. Furthermore, the believability\
  \ of any lie told to a creature under the effects of gullibility increases by one\
  \ step; an impossible lie seems far-fetched, a far-fetched lie seems unlikely, and\
  \ an unlikely lie seems believable."
