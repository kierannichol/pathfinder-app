code: "weapon_special_ability:mimetic"
name: "Mimetic"
description: "This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. Each time\
  \ the wielder damages a creature using a mimetic weapon, he gains resistance 10\
  \ to one energy type that the creature is resistant or immune to for 1 round (if\
  \ the creature damaged has multiple types of resistance, the wielder chooses one\
  \ of those resistances to take). This resistance stacks with itself, to a maximum\
  \ of 30 points of resistance against a given energy type, but not with other sources\
  \ of energy resistance. The creatureâ€™s own resistances and immunities are unaffected."
