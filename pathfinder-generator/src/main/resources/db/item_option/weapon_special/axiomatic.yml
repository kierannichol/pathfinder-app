name: "Axiomatic"
description: "An axiomatic weapon is infused with lawful power. It makes the weapon\
  \ law-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an\
  \ extra 2d6 points of damage against chaotic creatures. It bestows one permanent\
  \ negative level on any chaotic creature attempting to wield it. The negative level\
  \ remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no\
  \ longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration\
  \ spells) while the weapon is wielded."
