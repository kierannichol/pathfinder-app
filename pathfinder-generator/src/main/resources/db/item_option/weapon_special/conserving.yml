name: "Conserving"
description: "This ability cannot be placed on firearms. Only projectile weapons can\
  \ be made conserving. When the wielder misses with a ranged attack, the fired ammunition\
  \ teleports unharmed to its quiver, case, or pouch. If the ammunition in question\
  \ would be destroyed for other reasons than merely being launched, such as an arrow\
  \ that breaks apart in flight, this special ability does not function and the ammunition\
  \ is destroyed as normal. Effects that block teleportation prevent this special\
  \ ability from working."
