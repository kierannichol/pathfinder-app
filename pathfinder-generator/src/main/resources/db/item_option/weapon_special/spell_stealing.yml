name: "Spell stealing"
description: "This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A spellstealing\
  \ weapon allows its wielder to siphon protective magic from a target and transfer\
  \ it to herself. When the wielder rolls a critical threat against a target, she\
  \ can forgo confirming the critical hit and instead automatically learn which spells\
  \ or magical effects are active upon the target. The wielder may then make a caster\
  \ level check to steal her choice of one of those effects, using the spellstealing\
  \ weaponâ€™s caster level plus its enhancement bonus, against a DC of 11 + the caster\
  \ level of the effect. If the check succeeds, the target immediately loses the benefits\
  \ of that effect and the wielder gains the effect for 1 minute (or until the effect\
  \ expires, whichever comes first). If the spellstealing weapon has a critical multiplier\
  \ greater than x2, the wielder may attempt to steal one additional spell effect\
  \ per additional multiple beyond x2 (two effects for x3, and so on)."
