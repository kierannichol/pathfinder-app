code: "weapon_special_ability:ominous"
name: "Ominous"
description: "This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. An ominous\
  \ weapon trails a shadowy haze behind every stroke, and moans a menacing dirge in\
  \ battle. An ominous weapon adds its enhancement bonus on Intimidate checks made\
  \ by the wielder. In addition, when an ominous weapon confirms a critical hit, the\
  \ target is shaken for 1 minute (DC 13 Will negates); if the weaponâ€™s critical multiplier\
  \ is greater than x2, this condition lasts 1 additional minute per multiple over\
  \ x2. A creature that gains the shaken condition from an ominous weapon cannot gain\
  \ that condition again from the same weapon for 24 hours."
