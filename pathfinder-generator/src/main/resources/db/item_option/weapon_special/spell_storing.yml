description: "A spell storing weapon allows a spellcaster to store a single targeted\
  \ spell of up to 3rd level in the weapon. (The spell must have a casting time of\
  \ 1 standard action.) Anytime the weapon strikes a creature and the creature takes\
  \ damage from it, the weapon can immediately cast the spell on that creature as\
  \ a free action if the wielder desires. (This special ability is an exception to\
  \ the general rule that casting a spell from an item takes at least as long as casting\
  \ that spell normally.) Once the spell has been cast from the weapon, a spellcaster\
  \ can cast any other targeted spell of up to 3rd level into it. The weapon magically\
  \ imparts to the wielder the name of the spell currently stored within it. A randomly\
  \ rolled spell storing weapon has a 50% chance of having a spell stored in it already.\
  \ This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A spell storing weapon\
  \ emits a strong aura of the evocation school, plus the aura of the spell currently\
  \ stored."
