name: "Negating"
description: "A negating weapon briefly nullifies some forms of damage reduction when\
  \ it damages a creature. Whenever a negating weapon damages a foe with DR/chaotic,\
  \ DR/evil, DR/good, DR/lawful, or DR/magic, it reduces the value of that damage\
  \ reduction by 5 points for 1 round. For example, a +1 negating lance hitting a\
  \ creature with DR 10/good and lawful reduces the creatureâ€™s DR to 5/good and lawful.\
  \ If the creature has a component to its damage reduction other than the alignment\
  \ types listed above, that component is unaffected. Thus, if the +1 negating lance\
  \ above hits a demon with DR 10/good and cold iron, it would leave the demon with\
  \ DR 10/cold iron and 5/good for 1 round. The effects of multiple negating weapons\
  \ (or multiple hits from the same weapon) do not stack. This ability can only be\
  \ placed on melee weapons."
