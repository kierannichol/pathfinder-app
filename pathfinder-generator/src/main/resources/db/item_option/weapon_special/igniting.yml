description: "An igniting weapon functions as a flaming weapon that also causes the\
  \ target to catch fire upon striking it with a successful critical hit. The target\
  \ does not get a saving throw to avoid catching fire, but can make a save each round\
  \ on its turn to put out the fire. The flaming ability must be active for the weapon\
  \ to set enemies on fire."
