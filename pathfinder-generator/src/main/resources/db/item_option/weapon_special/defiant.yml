name: "Defiant"
description: "This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A defiant\
  \ weapon helps its wielder stay alive in desperate conditions. It stays in its wielder’\
  s hand even if she is panicked, stunned, or unconscious. She adds the weapon’s enhancement\
  \ bonus as a bonus on checks to stabilize when dying and on saving throws to end\
  \ ongoing conditions such as disease, poison, and hold person. If the wielder possesses\
  \ Heroic Defiance, Heroic Recovery, Improved Great Fortitude, Improved Iron Will,\
  \ or Improved Lightning Reflexes, she gains a number of additional daily uses equal\
  \ to the weapon’s enhancement bonus that can be used on any of these feats."
