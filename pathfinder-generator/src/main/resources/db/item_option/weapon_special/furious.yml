code: "weapon_special_ability:furious"
name: "Furious"
description: "This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A furious\
  \ weapon serves as a focus for its wielder’s anger. When the wielder is raging or\
  \ under the effect of a rage spell, the weapon’s enhancement bonus is +2 better\
  \ than normal. If the wielder has a rage power that gives a skill bonus while raging\
  \ (such as raging climber, raging leaper, or raging swimmer), the wielder gains\
  \ an enhancement bonus to that skill whenever the weapon is wielded or held in her\
  \ hand, even when she is not raging. This bonus is equal to the enhancement bonus\
  \ of the weapon (and also includes the +2 if the wielder is raging)."
