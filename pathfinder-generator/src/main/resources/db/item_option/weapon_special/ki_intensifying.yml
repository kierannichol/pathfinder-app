name: "Ki intensifying"
description: "The weapon channels and amplifies the wielder’s ki, allowing her to\
  \ use her special ki attacks through the weapon as though they were unarmed attacks.\
  \ These attacks include the monk’s ki strike, quivering palm, and the Stunning Fist\
  \ feat. The save DC for ki abilities used through the weapon increases by half the\
  \ enhancement bonus of the weapon (minimum 1). After a successful strike with a\
  \ ki intensifying weapon, the wielder can spend 1 ki point as a swift action to\
  \ perform a combat maneuver to bull rush, disarm, reposition, or trip as a free\
  \ action without provoking attacks of opportunity. Any bonuses or penalties applicable\
  \ to the weapon attack also apply to this combat maneuver check. The wielder cannot\
  \ move from her space as a part of the chosen maneuver. Only melee weapons can have\
  \ the ki intensifying ability. It cannot be placed on an amulet of mighty fist or\
  \ similar non-weapon item. Weapons with the ki focus ability can be upgraded to\
  \ be ki intensifying."
