name: "Dispelling"
description: "A dispelling weapon functions like a spell storing weapon, but it may\
  \ only store dispel magic; however, the caster level check to dispel gains an additional\
  \ bonus equal to the weapon’s enhancement bonus. This bonus also applies to a magus’\
  s dispelling strike arcana or a barbarian’s spell sunder or sunder enchantment combat\
  \ maneuver check."
