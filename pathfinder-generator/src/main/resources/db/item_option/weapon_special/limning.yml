name: "Limning"
description: "When a liming weapon is wielded, a pale glow outlines it. On a successful\
  \ strike against a creature affected by a means of magical concealment, the weapon\
  \ outlines the creature in faerie fire (as the spell) for 1 round. Magical means\
  \ of concealment include blur, displacement, invisibility, and similar effects,\
  \ whether from a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural means, but not those\
  \ provided by extraordinary abilities . A liming weapon has no special effect against\
  \ creatures merely hiding or concealed by non-magical means, or those hidden by\
  \ environmental conditions (even magical) such as darkness or fog."
