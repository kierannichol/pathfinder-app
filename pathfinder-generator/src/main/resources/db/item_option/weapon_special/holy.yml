name: "Holy"
description: "A holy weapon is imbued with holy power. This power makes the weapon\
  \ good-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an\
  \ extra 2d6 points of damage against all creatures of evil alignment. It bestows\
  \ one permanent negative level on any evil creature attempting to wield it. The\
  \ negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the\
  \ weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way\
  \ (including by restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded."
