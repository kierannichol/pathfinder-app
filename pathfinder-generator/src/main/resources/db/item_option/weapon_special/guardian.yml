name: "Guardian"
description: "This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A guardian\
  \ weapon allows the wielder to transfer some or all of the weapon’s enhancement\
  \ bonus to his saving throws as a bonus that stacks with all others. As a free action,\
  \ the wielder chooses how to allocate the weapon’s enhancement bonus at the start\
  \ of his turn before using the weapon. The bonus on saving throws lasts until his\
  \ next turn. Only the weapon’s own enhancement bonus can be sacrificed, not any\
  \ enhancement bonus provided by other effects such as a greater magic weapon spell.\
  \ However, the total of such effects is still diminished by the amount allocated\
  \ to improving saving throws. If a weapon has both the defending and guardian abilities\
  \ , allocating a single point of enhancement bonus increases either AC or saving\
  \ throws, but not both."
