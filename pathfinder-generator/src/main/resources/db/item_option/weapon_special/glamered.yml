name: "Glamered"
description: "A glamered weapon can be commanded to change its shape and appearance\
  \ to assume the form of another object of similar size. The weapon retains all its\
  \ properties (including weight) when so disguised but does not radiate magic. Only\
  \ true seeing or similar magic reveals the true nature of a glamered weapon while\
  \ it is disguised. After a glamered weapon is used to attack, this special ability\
  \ is suppressed for 1 minute."
