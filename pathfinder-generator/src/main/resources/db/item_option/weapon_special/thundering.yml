description: "A thundering weapon creates a cacophonous roar like thunder whenever\
  \ it strikes a target with a successful critical hit. The sonic energy does not\
  \ harm the wielder. A thundering weapon deals an extra 1d8 points of sonic damage\
  \ on a successful critical hit. If the weaponâ€™s critical multiplier is x3, add an\
  \ extra 2d8 points of sonic damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add an\
  \ extra 3d8 points of sonic damage. Subjects dealt critical hits by a thundering\
  \ weapon must make a successful DC 14 Fortitude save or be deafened permanently."
