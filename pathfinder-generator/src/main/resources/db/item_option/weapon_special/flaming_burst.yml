name: "Flaming burst"
description: "A flaming burst weapon functions as a flaming weapon that also explodes\
  \ with flame upon striking a successful critical hit. The fire does not harm the\
  \ wielder. In addition to the extra fire damage from the flaming ability (see above),\
  \ a flaming burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of fire damage on a successful\
  \ critical hit. If the weaponâ€™s critical multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d10 points\
  \ of fire damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d10 points\
  \ of fire damage. Even if the flaming ability is not active, the weapon still deals\
  \ its extra fire damage on a successful critical hit."
