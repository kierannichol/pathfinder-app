description: "This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A repositioning\
  \ weapon grants the wielder a +2 enhancement bonus on combat maneuver checks to\
  \ reposition a foe. If the wielder confirms a critical hit with the weapon, he can\
  \ attempt to reposition his opponent as a free action. These reposition attempts\
  \ still provoke attacks of opportunity as normal. A weapon cannot have both the\
  \ anchoring and repositioning special abilities ."
