name: "Unaligned"
description: "Typically forged by aeons or other creatures that eschew commonly held\
  \ structures of morality, unaligned weapons quell the effects of extreme alignments\
  \ on the wielder. The wielder counts her Hit Dice as 4 lower than her actual total\
  \ HD when someone attempts to detect her alignment using detect chaos, detect evil,\
  \ detect good, detect law, or similar spells or effects. Furthermore, if the wielder\
  \ is an outsider and is targeted by a spell or effect with an alignment descriptor\
  \ that deals additional damage to or has an additional effect on outsiders (such\
  \ as holy smite), she adds a bonus equal to the unaligned weapon’s enhancement bonus\
  \ on saving throws she attempts against that spell or effect. Finally, the wielder\
  \ takes no penalties on her Charisma-, Intelligence-, or Wisdom-based checks from\
  \ a plane’s mildly aligned or strongly aligned traits, regardless of her actual\
  \ alignment."
