name: "Corrosive burst"
description: "A corrosive burst weapon functions as a corrosive weapon that explodes\
  \ with searing acid upon striking a successful critical hit. The acid does not harm\
  \ the wielder. In addition to the extra acid damage from the corrosive special ability,\
  \ a corrosive burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of acid damage on a successful\
  \ critical hit. If the weapon’s critical modifier is x3, add an extra 2d10 points\
  \ of acid damage instead, and if the modifier is x4, add an extra 3d10 points. Even\
  \ if the corrosive ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra acid\
  \ damage on a successful critical hit."
