name: "Keen"
description: "This ability doubles the threat range of a weapon. Only piercing or\
  \ slashing melee weapons can be keen. If you roll this special ability randomly\
  \ for an inappropriate weapon, reroll. This benefit doesnâ€™t stack with any other\
  \ effects that expand the threat range of a weapon (such as the keen edge spell\
  \ or the Improved Critical feat)."
