description: "A countering weapon gives its wielder a +2 bonus to his combat maneuver\
  \ defense against combat maneuvers made to disarm or sunder this weapon. If the\
  \ attempt fails, the wielder can immediately attempt the same maneuver against the\
  \ opponent without provoking attacks of opportunity. The wielder never risks dropping\
  \ his weapon with a failed disarm combat maneuver when counterattacking in this\
  \ manner. This ability can be used even if the attacker is not within the wielderâ€™\
  s reach. Countering can only be placed on melee weapons."
