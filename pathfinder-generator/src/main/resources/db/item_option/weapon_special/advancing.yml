code: "weapon_special_ability:advancing"
name: "Advancing"
description: "This ability can only be placed on melee weapons. Once per round, when\
  \ the wielder damages a creature in melee with an advancing weapon, she can take\
  \ a 5-foot step as a swift action after the attack but before the end of her turn.\
  \ This movement does not count against her ability to move or take a 5-foot step\
  \ earlier or later in the round, though using this ability imposes a â€”2 penalty\
  \ on all attack rolls until the start of her next turn. This ability may not be\
  \ used in conjunction with any other ability or effect that allows moving as part\
  \ of an attack."
