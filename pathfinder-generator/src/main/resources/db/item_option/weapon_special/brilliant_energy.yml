name: "Brilliant energy"
description: "A brilliant energy weapon has its significant portion transformed into\
  \ light, although this does not modify the itemâ€™s weight. It always gives off light\
  \ as a torch (20-foot radius). A brilliant energy weapon ignores nonliving matter.\
  \ Armor and shield bonuses to AC (including any enhancement bonuses to that armor)\
  \ do not count against it because the weapon passes through armor. (Dexterity, deflection,\
  \ dodge, natural armor, and other such bonuses still apply.) A brilliant energy\
  \ weapon cannot harm undead, constructs, or objects."
