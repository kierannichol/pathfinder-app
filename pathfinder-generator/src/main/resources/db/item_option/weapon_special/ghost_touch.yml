description: "A ghost touch weapon deals damage normally against incorporeal creatures,\
  \ regardless of its bonus. An incorporeal creatureâ€™s 50% reduction in damage from\
  \ corporeal sources does not apply to attacks made against it with ghost touch weapons.\
  \ The weapon can be picked up and moved by an incorporeal creature at any time.\
  \ A manifesting ghost can wield the weapon against corporeal foes. Essentially,\
  \ a ghost touch weapon counts as both corporeal or incorporeal."
