name: "Glorious"
description: "A glorious weapon glows with a dazzling light equal to a daylight spell\
  \ when drawn. The wielder cannot suppress this light, though it can be temporarily\
  \ suppressed by any effect that can suppress daylight. A glorious weapon flashes\
  \ with light, and any creature the wielder attacks in melee is automatically dazzled\
  \ until the beginning of the wielder’s next turn. When a glorious weapon confirms\
  \ a critical hit, the target is blinded until the beginning of the wielder’s next\
  \ turn (DC 14 Will negates); if the weapon’s critical multiplier is greater than\
  \ x2, this blindness lasts 1 additional round per multiple over x2. Only a melee\
  \ weapon can have the glorious ability."
