name: "Anarchic"
description: "An anarchic weapon is infused with the power of chaos. It makes the\
  \ weapon chaotically aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction.\
  \ It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all creatures of lawful alignment.\
  \ It bestows one permanent negative level on any lawful creature attempting to wield\
  \ it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears\
  \ when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in\
  \ any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded."
