name: "Furyborn"
description: "This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A furyborn\
  \ weapon draws power from the anger and frustration the wielder feels when battling\
  \ foes that refuse to die. Each time the wielder damages an opponent with the weapon,\
  \ its enhancement bonus increases by +1 when making attacks against that opponent\
  \ (to a maximum total enhancement bonus of +5). This extra enhancement bonus goes\
  \ away if the opponent dies, the wielder uses the weapon to attack a different creature,\
  \ or 1 hour passes."
