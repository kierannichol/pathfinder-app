name: "Vorpal"
description: "This potent and feared ability allows the weapon to sever the heads\
  \ of those it strikes. Upon a roll of natural 20 (followed by a successful roll\
  \ to confirm the critical hit), the weapon severs the opponent’s head (if it has\
  \ one) from its body. Some creatures, such as many aberrations and all oozes, have\
  \ no heads. Others, such as golems and undead creatures other than vampires, are\
  \ not affected by the loss of their heads. Most other creatures, however, die when\
  \ their heads are cut off. A vorpal weapon must be a slashing melee weapon. If you\
  \ roll this special ability randomly for an inappropriate weapon, reroll."
