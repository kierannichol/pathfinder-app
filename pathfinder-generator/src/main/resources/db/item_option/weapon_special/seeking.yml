name: "Seeking"
description: "This special ability can only be placed on ranged weapons. A seeking\
  \ weapon veers toward its target, negating any miss chances that would otherwise\
  \ apply, such as from concealment. The wielder still has to aim the weapon at the\
  \ right square. Arrows mistakenly shot into an empty space, for example, do not\
  \ veer and hit invisible enemies, even if they are nearby."
