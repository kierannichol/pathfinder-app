name: "Nullifying"
description: "This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A nullifying\
  \ weapon suppresses a creature’s spell resistance for a short amount of time. Anytime\
  \ the weapon strikes a creature with spell resistance and the creature takes damage\
  \ from the weapon, the target’s spell resistance is reduced by 1 for 1 minute. On\
  \ a confirmed critical hit, its spell resistance is instead reduced by an amount\
  \ equal to the weapon’s critical multiplier. Multiple hits from a nullifying weapon\
  \ stack."
