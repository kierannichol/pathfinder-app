description: "The longer the wielder of a stalking weapon studies a target, the more\
  \ effective her strike. As a standard action, a character wielding a stalking weapon\
  \ can command it to study a creature within 60 feet. The wielder must have line\
  \ of effect and line of sight to that target. When the wielder attacks the studied\
  \ creature, on a successful hit the stalking weapon deals +1d6 points of bonus damage\
  \ per consecutive round spent studying a target, up to a number of bonus dice equal\
  \ to the stalking weaponâ€™s enhancement bonus. This bonus damage is precision damage\
  \ and only applies to the first successful hit against that creature. If the wielder\
  \ attacks a creature other than the studied creature, commands the weapon to study\
  \ a different creature, or ends her turn more than 60 feet from the studied creature,\
  \ the weapon loses all bonus damage dice against the previously studied creature."
