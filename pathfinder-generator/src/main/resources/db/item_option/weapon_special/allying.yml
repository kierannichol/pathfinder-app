description: "An allying weapon allows the wielder to transfer some or all of the\
  \ weapon’s enhancement bonus to one weapon being used by an ally of the wielder.\
  \ The wielder must have line of sight to the intended ally. As a free action, at\
  \ the start of her turn before using her weapon, the wielder chooses how to allocate\
  \ her weapon’s enhancement bonus. The bonus to the ally’s weapon lasts until the\
  \ allying weapon’s wielder’s next turn. The enhancement bonus from the allying weapon\
  \ does not stack with the enhancement bonus on the ally’s weapon (if any)."
