name: "Unholy"
description: "An unholy weapon is imbued with unholy power. This power makes the weapon\
  \ evil-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an\
  \ extra 2d6 points of damage against all creatures of good alignment. It bestows\
  \ one permanent negative level on any good creature attempting to wield it. The\
  \ negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the\
  \ weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way\
  \ (including restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded."
