name: "Dispelling burst"
description: "A dispelling burst weapon functions like a dispelling weapon but may\
  \ store dispel magic or greater dispel magic. In addition, these spells can be discharged\
  \ as a free action when the wielder of a dispelling burst weapon confirms a critical\
  \ hit. When the wielder does so, the bonus to the check made to dispel (including\
  \ from dispelling strike, spell sunder, or sunder enchantment) increases by an amount\
  \ equal to the weapon’s enhancement bonus or the weapon’s critical multiplier (whichever\
  \ is higher). If a dispelling burst weapon confirms a critical hit while it is not\
  \ currently storing a dispel magic or greater dispel magic spell, yet if the wielder\
  \ has either spell prepared (or is a spontaneous caster able to cast either spell),\
  \ she may cast either spell into the weapon as a swift action and then immediately\
  \ discharge it into the target as a free action."
