name: "Reliable, greater"
description: "This special ability can only be placed on firearms. A greater reliable\
  \ firearm is enchanted so as to be less likely to jam than other firearms. The greater\
  \ reliable special ability reduces the misfire value of the affected firearm by\
  \ 4 (minimum 0). This reduction occurs after any increases are calculated for firing\
  \ with the broken condition, or for any other effect that might increase the misfire\
  \ value of a firearm. A firearm with the greater reliable special ability cannot\
  \ have the reliable special ability."
