name: "Icy burst"
description: "An icy burst weapon functions as a frost weapon that also explodes with\
  \ frost upon striking a successful critical hit. The frost does not harm the wielder.\
  \ In addition to the extra damage from the frost ability, an icy burst weapon deals\
  \ an extra 1d10 points of cold damage on a successful critical hit. If the weaponâ€™\
  s critical multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d10 points of cold damage instead, and\
  \ if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d10 points. Even if the frost ability is\
  \ not active, the weapon still deals its extra cold damage on a successful critical\
  \ hit."
