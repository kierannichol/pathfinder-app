code: "weapon_special_ability:returning"
name: "Returning"
description: "This special ability can only be placed on a weapon that can be thrown.\
  \ A returning weapon flies through the air back to the creature that threw it. It\
  \ returns to the thrower just before the creature’s next turn (and is therefore\
  \ ready to use again in that turn). Catching a returning weapon when it comes back\
  \ is a free action. If the character can’t catch it, or if the character has moved\
  \ since throwing it, the weapon drops to the ground in the square from which it\
  \ was thrown."
