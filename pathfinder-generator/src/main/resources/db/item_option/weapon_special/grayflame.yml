name: "Grayflame"
description: "This weapon responds to channeled positive and negative energy. When\
  \ the wielder spends a swift action to channel energy through the weapon, it ignites\
  \ with a strange gray flame that sheds light as a torch, increases the weapon’s\
  \ enhancement bonus by +1, and deals +1d6 damage (as the divine power from flame\
  \ strike) to creatures struck by the weapon. This flame lasts for 1 round for every\
  \ d6 of damage or healing the channeling normally provides. When charged with positive\
  \ energy, the flame is a silvery gray, good creatures are immune to the weapon’\
  s extra damage, and the weapon counts as a good and silver weapon for the purpose\
  \ of bypassing damage reduction. When charged with negative energy, the flame is\
  \ an ashen gray, evil creatures are immune to the weapon’s extra damage, and the\
  \ weapon counts as an evil and cold iron weapon for the purpose of bypassing damage\
  \ reduction. This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons."
