name: "Transformative"
description: "This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A transformative\
  \ weapon alters its shape at its wielder’s command, becoming any other melee weapon\
  \ of the same general shape and handedness; the weapon’s categorization as simple,\
  \ martial, or exotic is irrelevant. For example, a Medium transformative longsword\
  \ can take the shape of any other Medium one-handed melee weapon, such as a scimitar,\
  \ flail, or trident, but not a Medium light or two-handed melee weapon (such as\
  \ a Medium short sword or a Medium greatsword). It can even take the shape of comparable\
  \ weapons of different size categories. For example, a Small greatsword is a two-handed\
  \ slashing weapon for a Small character, but is a one-handed slashing weapon for\
  \ a Medium character, which is very similar to a Medium longsword; a Small transformative\
  \ greatsword can thus become an actual Medium longsword, usable by a Medium creature\
  \ without the —2 penalty for using a weapon of the wrong size. The weapon retains\
  \ all of its abilities , including enhancement bonuses and weapon special abilities\
  \ , except those prohibited by its current shape. For example, a keen transformative\
  \ weapon functions normally in the form of a piercing or slashing weapon, but cannot\
  \ use the keen special ability when in the shape of a bludgeoning weapon. When unattended,\
  \ the weapon reverts to its true shape."
