name: "Endless ammunition"
description: "Only bows and crossbows can be made into endless ammunition weapons—\
  firearms and other projectile weapons cannot. Each time an endless ammunition weapon\
  \ is nocked, a single non-magical arrow or bolt is spontaneously created by the\
  \ magic, so the weapon’s wielder never needs to load the weapon with ammunition.\
  \ If the wielder attempts to load the weapon with other ammunition, the created\
  \ arrow or bolt immediately vanishes and the wielder can load the weapon as normal.\
  \ This ability does not reduce the amount of time required to load or fire the weapon.\
  \ The created arrow or bolt vanishes if removed from the weapon; it persists only\
  \ if fired. Unlike normal bow and crossbow ammunition, these arrows and bolts are\
  \ always destroyed when fired."
