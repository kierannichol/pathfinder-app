name: "Anchoring"
description: "This special ability can only be added to a melee weapon or a thrown\
  \ weapon. An anchoring weapon pins a target in place and prevents it from moving.\
  \ As a swift action, the weapon can be fixed in place in a point in space, functioning\
  \ as an immovable rod. This ability can also be used when the wielder hits a creature\
  \ with a melee attack using an anchoring weapon. This anchors the target to the\
  \ weapon, preventing it from moving away from the weapon. The target is not entangled\
  \ or paralyzed; it simply cannot move from its location without first destroying\
  \ the weapon or making a successful DC 30 Strength check as a full-round action\
  \ to move with the weapon up to 10 feet. An anchoring weapon remains motionless\
  \ and cannot be used to attack while it is anchoring a creature. An anchoring weapon\
  \ has no effect on amorphous creatures, including elementals, oozes, and creatures\
  \ in gaseous or liquid form. It also cannot anchor incorporeal creatures unless\
  \ the weapon also has the ghost touch special ability."
