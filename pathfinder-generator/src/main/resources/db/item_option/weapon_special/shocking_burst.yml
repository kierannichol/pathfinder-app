description: "A shocking burst weapon functions as a shock weapon that explodes with\
  \ electricity upon striking a successful critical hit. The electricity does not\
  \ harm the wielder. In addition to the extra electricity damage from the shock ability,\
  \ a shocking burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of electricity damage on a\
  \ successful critical hit. If the weaponâ€™s critical multiplier is x3, add an extra\
  \ 2d10 points of electricity damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add an\
  \ extra 3d10 points. Even if the shock ability is not active, the weapon still deals\
  \ its extra electricity damage on a successful critical hit."
