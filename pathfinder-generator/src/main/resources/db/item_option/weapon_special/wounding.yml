name: "Wounding"
description: "This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A wounding\
  \ weapon deals 1 point of bleed damage when it hits a creature. Multiple hits from\
  \ a wounding weapon increase the bleed damage. Bleeding creatures take the bleed\
  \ damage at the start of their turns. Bleeding can be stopped by a successful DC\
  \ 15 Heal check or through the application of any spell that cures hit point damage.\
  \ A critical hit does not multiply the bleed damage. Creatures immune to critical\
  \ hits are immune to the bleed damage dealt by this weapon."
