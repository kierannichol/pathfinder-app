name: "Heartseeker"
description: "This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A heartseeker\
  \ weapon is drawn unerringly toward beating hearts. A heartseeker weapon ignores\
  \ the miss chance for concealment against most living targets, though the attack\
  \ must still target the proper square. This special ability does not apply against\
  \ aberrations, oozes, plants, outsiders with the elemental subtype, or any creature\
  \ specifically noted to lack a heart."
