  \ weapon helps allies deal with flanked foes. When the wielder is adjacent to a\
  \ creature that is being flanked by an ally, the flanking bonus on attack rolls\
  \ for all flanking allies increases by +2. This ability works even if the wielder\
  \ is not one of the characters flanking the creature."
