  \ that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the weapon is in the possession\
  \ of another creature. This ability has a maximum range of 100 feet, and effects\
  \ that block teleportation prevent the return of a called weapon. A called weapon\
  \ must be in a creature’s possession for at least 24 hours for this ability to function."
