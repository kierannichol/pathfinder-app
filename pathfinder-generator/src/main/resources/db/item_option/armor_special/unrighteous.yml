description: "This armor is often sculpted with unholy symbols. Once per day on command,\
  \ the wearer can invoke an effect, as per the spell righteous might, lasting for\
  \ 10 rounds. Unrighteous armor is always aligned toward evil (negative energy),\
  \ for the effects of righteous might. Unrighteous armor bestows one permanent negative\
  \ level on any good creature attempting to wear it. The negative level remains as\
  \ long as the armor is worn and disappears when it is removed. This negative level\
  \ cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the armor\
  \ is worn."
