description: "Undead controlling armor and shields often have skeletal or other grisly\
  \ decorations or flourishes to their decor. They let the user control up to 26 Hit\
  \ Dice of undead per day, as the control undead spell. At dawn each day, the wearer\
  \ loses control of any undead still under his sway. Armor or a shield with this\
  \ ability appears to be made of bone; this feature is entirely decorative and has\
  \ no other effect on the armor."
