description: "On command, the hands and feet of this armorâ€™s wearer become incredibly\
  \ sticky, granting her a climb speed of 20 feet. The stickiness grants the wearer\
  \ a +2 enhancement bonus on combat maneuver checks made to disarm, grapple, reposition,\
  \ steal, or trip when the wearer is using a natural weapon or unarmed strike to\
  \ attempt the maneuver. The wearer can gain these benefits for 10 rounds per day.\
  \ These rounds need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-round intervals.\
  \ Ending the effect is a free action. Adhesive cannot be placed on armor with any\
  \ version of the slick special ability."
