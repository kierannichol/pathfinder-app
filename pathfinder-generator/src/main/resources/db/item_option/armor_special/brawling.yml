description: "The wearer of brawling armor gains a +2 bonus on unarmed attack and\
  \ damage rolls, including combat maneuver checks made to grapple. Her unarmed strikes\
  \ count as magic weapons for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. These bonuses\
  \ do not apply to natural weapons. This special ability does not prevent the wearer’\
  s unarmed strikes from provoking attacks of opportunity or make the wearer’s unarmed\
  \ strikes count as armed attacks. The brawling ability can be applied only to light\
  \ armor."
