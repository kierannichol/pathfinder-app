description: "Armor and shields with the radiant special ability shine as brightly\
  \ as a torch when worn. This radiance can be suppressed or resumed on command. Designs\
  \ usually feature bright colors and a brilliant sheen even when not illuminated.\
  \ Once per day, the wearer can command the armor or shield to brighten to the strength\
  \ of a daylight spell for 1 hour or until commanded to dim."
