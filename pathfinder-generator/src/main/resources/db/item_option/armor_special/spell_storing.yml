description: "This armor allows a spellcaster to store a single touch spell of up\
  \ to 3rd level in it. Anytime a creature hits the wearer with a melee attack or\
  \ melee touch attack, the armor can cast the spell on that creature as a swift immediate\
  \ action if the wearer desires. Once the spell has been cast from the armor, a spellcaster\
  \ can cast any other targeted touch spell of up to 3rd level into it. The armor\
  \ magically imparts to the wielder the name of the spell currently stored within\
  \ it. A randomly rolled suit of spell storing armor has a 50% chance to have a spell\
  \ stored in it already. Spell storing armor emits a strong aura of the evocation\
  \ school, plus the aura of the stored spell."
