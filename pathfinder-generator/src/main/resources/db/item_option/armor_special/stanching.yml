description: "A stanching suit of armor helps stop the flow of blood from the wearer’\
  s wounds, automatically tightening like a tourniquet in the appropriate places while\
  \ also magically reducing the severity of the wound. Stanching armor reduces hit\
  \ point damage, ability damage, or ability drain by an amount equal to its enhancement\
  \ bonus if the damage or drain was from a bleed effect. The wearer also adds the\
  \ armor’s enhancement bonus to Constitution checks to become stable."
