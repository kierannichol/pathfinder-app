description: "Armor with this special ability is often engraved or enameled with lawful\
  \ religious symbols. Once per day on command, the wearer can invoke an effect, as\
  \ per the spell righteous might, except the wearer gains DR 5/chaotic instead of\
  \ DR/evil or DR/good. This lasts for 10 rounds. Vigilant armor bestows one permanent\
  \ negative level on any chaotic creature attempting to wear it. The negative level\
  \ remains as long as the armor is worn and disappears when it is removed. This negative\
  \ level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the\
  \ armor is worn."
