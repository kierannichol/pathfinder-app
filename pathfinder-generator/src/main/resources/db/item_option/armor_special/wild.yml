description: "Armor with this special ability usually appears to be made from magically\
  \ hardened animal pelt. The wearer of a suit of armor or a shield with this ability\
  \ preserves his armor bonus (and any enhancement bonus) while in a wild shape. Armor\
  \ and shields with this ability usually appear to be covered in leaf patterns. While\
  \ the wearer is in a wild shape, the armor cannot be seen."
