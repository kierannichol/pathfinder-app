description: "A shield or suit of armor with this special ability is covered with\
  \ jagged burrs and razor-sharp serrations that saw and grind whenever the wearer\
  \ is grappled or entangled. Any creature succeeding at a grapple combat maneuver\
  \ check against the wearer takes damage equal to the armor or shield’s enhancement\
  \ bonus (with each successful check) as the barbs and blades bite into it. This\
  \ special ability counts as armor spikes for the purpose of making attacks on the\
  \ wearer’s turn."
