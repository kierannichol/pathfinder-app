description: "This armor or shield is brightly polished, and its mirror-bright surface\
  \ is magically endowed with the ability to bring comfort to the wearer’s companions.\
  \ Allies within 30 feet of the wearer gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against\
  \ fear effects. If the wearer has an ability that grants a morale bonus on saving\
  \ throws against fear (such as a paladin’s aura of courage, a bard’s countersong,\
  \ or a cavalier’s banner ability), the morale bonus increases to +6."
