description: "This armor exudes an exceptionally vile and bitter taste whenever something\
  \ bites or swallows a creature that is wearing it. Any creature that grapples the\
  \ wearer with a bite attack (or any other attack using the mouth) must succeed at\
  \ a DC 14 Fortitude save to avoid immediately ending the grapple. If the wearer\
  \ is swallowed whole, the swallowing creature must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude\
  \ save at the start of each turn that the armored victim remains alive inside of\
  \ the creature or become nauseated for 1 round. The creature may vomit up the victim\
  \ as a standard action. This is a poison effect."
