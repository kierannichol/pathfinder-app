description: "This armor pushes back against anything that threatens to knock its\
  \ wearer to the ground. The wearer gains a +4 bonus to his Combat Maneuver Defense\
  \ against combat maneuvers made to overrun or trip and on Acrobatics check made\
  \ to maintain balance. Dropping prone while wearing balanced armor is a move action\
  \ instead of a free action. The balanced ability can be applied to light or medium\
  \ armors, but not heavy armors or shields."
