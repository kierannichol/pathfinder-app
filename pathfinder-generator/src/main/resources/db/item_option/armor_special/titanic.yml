description: "A suit of armor with the titanic ability is almost comically oversized,\
  \ though the effect is superficial and the interior fits a creature normally, with\
  \ no adjustments necessary. A creature wearing titanic armor is considered one size\
  \ category larger for the purpose of using or being affected by special attacks\
  \ that depend on size, such as swallow whole and trample. Once per day on command,\
  \ the wearer can increase her size as if using enlarge person (even if the wearer\
  \ is not humanoid) for 1 minute. In addition, once per minute as a free action the\
  \ wearer can add the armorâ€™s enhancement bonus to a single Strength check or combat\
  \ maneuver check, or to her CMD against a single combat maneuver. Because of its\
  \ great bulk, the armor check penalty of titanic armor is increased by an amount\
  \ equal to its enhancement bonus."
