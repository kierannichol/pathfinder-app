description: "This armor allows the wearer to capitalize on her own injuries to heal\
  \ her allies. Once per day as an immediate action, when an enemy confirms a critical\
  \ hit against someone wearing martyring armor, the wearer can heal up to nine allies\
  \ within 30 feet as if using the mass cure light wounds spell (1d8+9 hit points\
  \ each). This special ability cannot be placed on armor that possesses an ability\
  \ that reduces the chance of or negates a critical hit (such as the fortification\
  \ special ability)."
