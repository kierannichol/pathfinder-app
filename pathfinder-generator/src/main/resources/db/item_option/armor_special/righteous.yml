description: "Armor with this special ability is often engraved or enameled with religious\
  \ symbols. Once per day on command, the wearer can invoke an effect, as per the\
  \ spell righteous might, lasting for 10 rounds. Righteous armor is always aligned\
  \ toward good (positive energy), for the effects of righteous might. Righteous armor\
  \ bestows one permanent negative level on any evil creature attempting to wear it.\
  \ The negative level remains as long as the armor is worn and disappears when it\
  \ is removed. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration\
  \ spells) while the armor is worn."
