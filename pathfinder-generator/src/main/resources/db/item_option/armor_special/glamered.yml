description: "Upon command, a suit of glamered armor changes shape and appearance\
  \ to assume the form of a normal set of clothing. The armor retains all its properties\
  \ (including weight) when it is so disguised. Only a true seeing spell or similar\
  \ magic reveals the true nature of the armor when it is disguised."
