description: "A shield or suit of armor with this special ability is especially hardy.\
  \ It gains double its enhancement bonus to hardness and hit points (instead of just\
  \ the enhancement bonus), its break DC increases by double its enhancement bonus,\
  \ and it gains a bonus on saving throws against direct attacks (such as a rust monsterâ€™\
  s rust ability) equal to its enhancement bonus."
