description: "Cotraveling armor is decorated with the embroidered image of a five-armed\
  \ spiral. While the armor is worn, the wearer can touch a willing creature and attune\
  \ that creature to one of the five arms; once an arm is attuned, it glows faintly\
  \ with what appears to be starlight. Once per day as a free action (even if it is\
  \ not the wearerâ€™s turn) when the wearer is sent to another plane by a spell or\
  \ effect, he can activate the armor to allow all creatures attuned to it to accompany\
  \ him, provided the attuned creature is within 30 feet. If an attuned creature is\
  \ willing, it travels along with the character, arriving with that character on\
  \ the destination plane at the same relative distance from the wearer as when the\
  \ wearer used this ability (or as close to it as possible, given the nature of the\
  \ new plane). Once used, all five arms of the spiral deactivate, even if not all\
  \ of the attuned characters were willing or able to accompany the traveler to the\
  \ new destination, and the wearer must wait 24 hours before attuning new creatures\
  \ to the spiral."
