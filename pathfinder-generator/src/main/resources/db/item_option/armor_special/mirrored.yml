description: "The polished surface of a mirrored shield or armor gleams and shines,\
  \ and can be used as an ordinary mirror. Furthermore, it aids in battling creatures\
  \ with gaze attacks. If the wearer averts his eyes, he can roll the miss chance\
  \ twice, selecting the better result. The wearer can deal sneak attack or other\
  \ precision-based damage to the target even though it has concealment against him.\
  \ This provides no benefit if the wearer closes his eyes, wears a blindfold, or\
  \ otherwise can’t see the target at all. The mirrored armor or shield also adds\
  \ it enhancement bonus to the wearer’s touch AC against rays. it. This special ability\
  \ may only be added to metallic armor or shields."
