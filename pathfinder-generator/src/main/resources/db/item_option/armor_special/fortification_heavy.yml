description: "This suit of armor or shield produces a magical force that protects\
  \ vital areas of the wearer more effectively. When a critical hit or sneak attack\
  \ is scored on the wearer, there is a chance that the critical hit or sneak attack\
  \ is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. The chance is 25% for light\
  \ fortification, 50% for moderate fortification, and 75% for heavy fortification."
