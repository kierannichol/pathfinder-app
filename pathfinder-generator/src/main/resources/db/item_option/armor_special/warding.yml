description: "Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer of warding armor can\
  \ activate it to end all active challenge, judgment, and smite abilities affecting\
  \ her. This does not prevent opponents from selecting her as a target for these\
  \ abilities in the future. As a swift action, the wearer can expend one of her own\
  \ challenge, judgment, or smite abilities to refresh the armorâ€™s ability to end\
  \ these attacks."
