description: "This armor protects its wearer from harmful negative and positive energy,\
  \ including channeled energy. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of positive\
  \ or negative energy damage per attack that the wearer would normally take. The\
  \ wearer has a 25% chance to ignore negative levels from any attack. Deathless armor\
  \ does not block healing of any kind and does not protect against positive or negative\
  \ energy effects that do not deal damage or bestow negative levels. The deathless\
  \ ability can be applied to armor of any sort, but not shields."
