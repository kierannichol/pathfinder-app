description: "Armor with this special ability is often engraved or enameled with chaotic\
  \ religious symbols. Once per day on command, the wearer can invoke an effect as\
  \ per the spell righteous might, except the wearer gains DR 5/lawful instead of\
  \ DR/evil or DR/good. This effect lasts for 10 rounds. Unbound armor bestows one\
  \ permanent negative level on any lawful creature attempting to wear it. The negative\
  \ level remains as long as the armor is worn and disappears when it is removed.\
  \ This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells)\
  \ while the armor is worn."
