  \ or ranged attack, he gains a +2 competence bonus on saving throws against that\
  \ creatureâ€™s abilities until the start of his next turn. The bolstering ability\
  \ can be applied to medium armor, heavy armor, light shields, heavy shields, and\
  \ tower shields, but not light armor or bucklers."
