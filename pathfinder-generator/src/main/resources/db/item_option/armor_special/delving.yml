description: "Armor with this special ability grants the wearer a burrow speed of\
  \ 10 feet. This speed allows the wearer to tunnel through any type of soil, including\
  \ rocky soil, but not actual solid stone. This special ability does not give the\
  \ wearer the ability to breathe underground, so he must hold his breath or use other\
  \ magic that provides air or allows him to breathe. The wearer gains a +4 bonus\
  \ on all saving throws against landslides, avalanches, tunnel collapses, and similar\
  \ effects."
