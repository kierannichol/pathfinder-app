description: "This suit of armor best serves a wearer who focuses on assisting and\
  \ protecting his allies. Benevolent armor is usually decorated with motifs of prosperity,\
  \ plenty, and generosity, such as helping hands, cornucopias, and flourishing plants.\
  \ When the wearer of a suit of benevolent armor uses the aid another action to give\
  \ an ally a bonus to AC against an opponent’s next attack, he also adds the benevolent\
  \ armor’s enhancement bonus to the ally’s AC."
