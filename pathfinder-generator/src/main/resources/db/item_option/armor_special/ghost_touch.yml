description: "This armor or shield seems almost translucent. Both its enhancement\
  \ bonus and its armor bonus count against the attacks of corporeal and incorporeal\
  \ creatures. It can be picked up, moved, and worn by corporeal and incorporeal creatures\
  \ alike. Incorporeal creatures gain the armor’s or shield’s enhancement bonus against\
  \ both corporeal and incorporeal attacks, and they can still pass freely through\
  \ solid objects."
