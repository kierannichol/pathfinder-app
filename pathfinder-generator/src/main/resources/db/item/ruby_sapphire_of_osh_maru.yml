description: "This fist-sized uncut gem looks like a human heart. One half is ruby-red\
  \ with blue flecks; the other is sapphire-blue with red flecks. Five times per day\
  \ when the gem is held in one hand, a spellcaster can use this item as an additional\
  \ focus component when casting a spell that deals electricity or fire damage, converting\
  \ up to half the spell's electricity damage to fire damage or vice versa, as if\
  \ using the Elemental Spell metamagic feat. Unlike the feat, this does not alter\
  \ the casting time or spell level of the spell.\nIn addition, when held, the gem\
  \ provides the bearer resistance 20 against electricity and fire. At will as a free\
  \ action, the bearer can command the Ruby Sapphire of Osh-Maru to glow as brightly\
  \ as a torch with either blue or red flame, manipulate this light as if it were\
  \ dancing lights, or snuff this light."
