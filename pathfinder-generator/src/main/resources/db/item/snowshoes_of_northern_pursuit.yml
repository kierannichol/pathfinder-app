description: "These masterwork snowshoes (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 91) provide\
  \ greater stability and weight distribution in snow. The snowshoes completely negate\
  \ the effects of normal snow on movement, and reduce the movement penalties in heavy\
  \ snow by half (i.e., it only costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square covered\
  \ with heavy snow instead of 4 squares of movement). In addition, the wearer can\
  \ increase her land speed in snowy terrain by 10 feet for up to 10 rounds per day.\
  \ This is considered an enhancement bonus and the duration need not be spent in\
  \ consecutive rounds. Finally, as a standard action once per day, the snowshoes\
  \ can generate a ripple effect that removes all trace of tracks left in the snow\
  \ in a 60-foot radius."
