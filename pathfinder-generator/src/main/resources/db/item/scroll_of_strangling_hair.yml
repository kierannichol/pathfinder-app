name: "Scroll of Strangling Hair"
description: "Your hair animates and extends to grapple and constrict an opponent.\
  \ Make a grapple check against the target using your caster level as the base attack\
  \ bonus plus a bonus equal to your Intelligence bonus (if a witch or wizard) or\
  \ Charisma bonus (if a sorcerer). This grapple check does not provoke attacks of\
  \ opportunity. If your hair succeeds in grappling a foe, that creature takes 1d6\
  \ points of damage or your unarmed strike damage, whichever is greater, and gains\
  \ the grappled condition. Your hair receives a +5 bonus on grapple checks made against\
  \ opponents it is already grappling, but cannot move foes or pin foes. Each round\
  \ that your hair succeeds on a grapple check, it deals an additional 1d6 points\
  \ of damage. The CMD of your hair, for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is\
  \ equal to 10 + its CMB."
