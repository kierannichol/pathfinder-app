description: "This elixir is barely an ounce of blue-gold bubbling liquid. For 1 minute\
  \ after drinking this elixir, a blue-gold aura surrounds the imbiber, shining light\
  \ as per a candle. Each arcane spell cast by the imbiber during this time gains\
  \ a +1 enhancement bonus to the DC of saving throws against the spell, and the spell\
  \ can be cast as if one of the following metamagic feats were applied to it without\
  \ increasing the spell level or casting time: Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Silent\
  \ Spell, or Still Spell. The imbiber can choose which metamagic feat to apply each\
  \ time she casts a spell and can use different metamagic feats throughout the duration\
  \ of the elixir's effects."
