description: "These specially modified caltrops have clusters of needle-sharp spines\
  \ that are slightly longer and more brittle than those on normal caltrops. Like\
  \ standard caltrops, a 2-pound bag of vicious caltrops covers a 5-foot-square area.\
  \ Vicious caltrops work just like normal caltrops, save that they have an attack\
  \ bonus of +4, do 1d2 points of damage, and require a DC 20 Heal check to fully\
  \ treat."
