description: "This ornate ring of sanctified silver is engraved with a golden signet\
  \ that incorporates the holy symbol of the wearer's deity after being worn for 24\
  \ hours. The ring can be used to seal parchments or to mark any surface as the arcane\
  \ mark spell at will. The wearer is marked as a scholarly leader of the faith and\
  \ gains a +5 competence bonus on Diplomacy and Knowledge (religion) checks. If the\
  \ wearer has the Leadership feat, she may attract double the normal number of followers,\
  \ and her followers' zealous devotion grants them a +4 morale bonus on Will saves\
  \ against enchantment spells and effects.\nOnce per day, the wearer of the ring\
  \ can use prayer and enter image (Advanced Player's Guide), often using the latter\
  \ power to speak and observe through portraits, statues, and even minted coinage\
  \ bearing their likeness."
