description: "Used by warriors of ancient Azlant, these strangely shaped ioun stones\
  \ are popular with combat-savvy members of the Pathfinder Society. These variant\
  \ ioun stones resemble a thorny sphere—each possesses a circular shape with dozens\
  \ of needle-like points jutting out. Each type of stone is a different color and\
  \ grants its wearer a +2 competence bonus on checks for a specific combat maneuver.\
  \ All varieties of thorny ioun stone have the same price and cost.\nThis ioun stone\
  \ grants a +2 competence bonus on trip attempts.\nResonance: Grants the bearer the\
  \ benefit of either the Acrobatic or the Athletic feat. The feat varies by individual\
  \ ioun stone, and each is equally likely (50% chance)."
