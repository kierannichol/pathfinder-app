description: "This hard-bristled tool has a handle that slips over the wearer's hand,\
  \ and is used by animal breeders, owners, and grooms to brush the animals in their\
  \ care, loosening dirt and detritus from the creatures' coats and stimulating the\
  \ skin so it produces the natural oils that keep them healthy and clean."
