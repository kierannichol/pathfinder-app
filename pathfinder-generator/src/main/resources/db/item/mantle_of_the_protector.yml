description: "This silvery cloak has steel pauldrons built into it, and always seems\
  \ to fit a little too loosely, no matter who happens to be wearing it. At the start\
  \ of each day, the owner of a mantle of the protector may spend 10 minutes attuning\
  \ the mantle to his armor and shield. He may then lend his attuned mantle to an\
  \ ally, who can activate it as an immediate action at any time to gain the owner's\
  \ armor and shield bonus as well as any other special properties the armor may have\
  \ for 10 minutes. When the mantle is activated this way, the owner's armor and shield\
  \ go dormant, and he loses any benefits they may provide for 1 minute."
