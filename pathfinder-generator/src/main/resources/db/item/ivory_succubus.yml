description: "This exquisitely crafted, 6-inch-tall ivory statue of a succubus seems\
  \ to change its pose every day or so, though its pose is always provocative. The\
  \ statue emits a constant magic aura to appear nonmagical. A creature that recognizes\
  \ the statue's true power can attune the statue to itself by carrying the statue\
  \ (as one would a talisman or holy symbol) and performing acts of passionate abandon\
  \ for 24 hours. Such revelry must come at a cost of least 500 gp (generally spent\
  \ on expensive companionship). Once attuned, the statue considers that creature\
  \ its owner.\nThe statue's owner can command the statue to change its shape to appear\
  \ as some other physically attractive biped in a provocative pose. If any creature\
  \ besides the owner has the statue in its possession (usually due to being given\
  \ the statue as a gift), the statue's magic slowly alters that creature's perception\
  \ of the statue's attuned owner. Each day, the creature that has the statue must\
  \ succeed at a DC 11 Will saving throw or have its attitude shift one step closer\
  \ to helpful toward the attuned owner (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 93â€“94). Such\
  \ a shift lasts until the creature that has the statue in its possession loses or\
  \ abandons the statue.\nIn most cases, any saving throws to resist the statue's\
  \ effect grant the creature in possession of the statue no information about the\
  \ source of the magic that attempted to change its attitude; however, if that creature\
  \ rolls a natural 20 on its Will saving throw, it experiences a slight intuition\
  \ that the statue is to blame. Once that creature has failed enough saving throws\
  \ to become helpful, it can no longer continue to attempt Will saving throws. The\
  \ creature with the statue remains friendly toward the attuned owner until it loses\
  \ or abandons the statue (or the owner does something to cause an attitude shift).\n\
  Once a creature in possession of the statue loses or abandons it, the statue influences\
  \ the attitude of any new creature that claims it toward the attuned owner, no matter\
  \ if the new creature in possession gained the statue by way of a gift from the\
  \ former creature in possession, theft, or some other means."
