description: "When a humanoid consumes these bitter herbs, they awaken the animal\
  \ within him, no matter how civilized the consumer believes himself to be. They\
  \ grant the partaker low-light vision and the scent ability for 1 hour. If the consumer\
  \ has the rage class feature, he can expend one use of mythic power as part of entering\
  \ a rage to take the form of an animal (as beast shape II) while gaining the usual\
  \ benefits of rage. When the rage ends, any remaining duration of the herbs is lost.\n\
  A creature without the humanoid type, including a monstrous humanoid, gains no benefits\
  \ from the herbs. It instead becomes nauseated for 1 round, then sickened for 1d4\
  \ rounds. A successful DC 13 Fortitude save leaves the creature sickened for 1 round\
  \ and negates the nausea."
