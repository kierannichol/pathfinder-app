description: "This amulet allows the wearer to command a number of undead skeletons\
  \ and zombies, which are keyed to the amulet when it is created. The animation of\
  \ the undead is part of the creation process—undead that have already been created\
  \ cannot be bound to a death's head talisman. The number of HD of undead tied to\
  \ the amulet is equal to twice the amulet's caster level. The amulet allows the\
  \ wearer to command the undead as if she had created them with animate dead, even\
  \ if she has no magical talent of her own. The undead are only under control while\
  \ the amulet is worn; if the amulet is removed, the undead revert to normal behavior,\
  \ standing in place but responding if attacked. Once the specific undead tied to\
  \ the amulet are destroyed, the talisman loses all power."
