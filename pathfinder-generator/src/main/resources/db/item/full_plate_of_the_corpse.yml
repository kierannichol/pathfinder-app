description: "This suit of +2 full plate has been etched and stained in such a way\
  \ that it resembles the form and shape of a decomposed body that is encased in a\
  \ suit of armor. The wearer is effectively hidden from non-intelligent undead, which\
  \ can't see, hear, or smell him; even extraordinary or supernatural senses capabilities\
  \ can't penetrate the magical shroud. An intelligent undead creature can attempt\
  \ a single Will saving throw (DC 14) to penetrate the ward. All affected undead\
  \ behave as if the wearer simply isn't there."
