description: "This small leather pouch is filled with a faintly radioactive ore called\
  \ caphorite, with a small percentage of reactants that activate the dust. When used,\
  \ caphorite dust must be sprinkled in a 5-foot square, which then becomes the center\
  \ of the dust's effect. All bright or normal light within 30 feet of the activated\
  \ dust is reduced to dim light, and any creature attempting to cast a spell with\
  \ the light descriptor in this area must succeed at a DC 15 caster level check or\
  \ have spell's effect be negated. If caphorite is exposed to sunlight, it immediately\
  \ becomes permanently inert. Each pouch contains enough dust for two applications.\
  \ Crafting this item requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
