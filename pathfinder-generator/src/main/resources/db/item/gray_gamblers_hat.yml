description: "This crumpled leather hat has roughly hammered metal studs around its\
  \ brim, and is often worn by worshipers of Droskar who venerate the dwarf god for\
  \ his cheating aspect. The wearer can use it as a hat of disguise, but only to disguise\
  \ herself as a dwarf. Three times per day as a free action, the wearer can manipulate\
  \ a rolled die within 10 feet (such as in a game of chance), altering the roll by\
  \ a value of 1 in either direction. The wearer adds 1 to the DC of any enchantment\
  \ (compulsion) spells she casts."
