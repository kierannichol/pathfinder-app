description: "This horn holds 20 doses of black powder for firearms. When a firearm\
  \ is loaded with black powder directly from this horn, the horn creates a small\
  \ pocket of air that envelops the gun and allows that shot to be fired underwater\
  \ or in an area lacking air, such as a vacuum. Once the gun is loaded with powder\
  \ from the dry load powder horn, it retains the pocket of air for 10 minutes or\
  \ until the firearm is fired, whichever comes first.\nFiring a firearm that has\
  \ been loaded from this horn underwater still incurs the â€“2 penalty on attack rolls\
  \ for every 5 feet of water the bullet passes through, in addition to the normal\
  \ penalties to range. When a shot loaded from a dry load powder horn results in\
  \ a firearm explosion while underwater or in an airless environment, that explosion\
  \ occurs normally."
