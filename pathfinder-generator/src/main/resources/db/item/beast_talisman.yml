description: "Carved to resemble a predatory animal, this small charm hangs from a\
  \ leather cord. While assuming the form of an animal (such as when using the wild\
  \ shape class feature or when under the effects of a beast shape spell), its wearer\
  \ can expend one prepared spell or spell slot of up to 4th level as a standard action\
  \ (0-level spells cannot be expended in this way). When the wielder does so, she\
  \ gains an enhancement bonus on all of her natural weapons equal to twice the level\
  \ of the spell or spell slot expended. This enhancement bonus applies to attack\
  \ and damage rolls made with the natural weapons and lasts for 5 minutes. The bonus\
  \ does not allow the wielder's natural weapons to bypass damage reduction, except\
  \ for DR/magic."
