description: "This +2 chainmail is attuned to a specific kind of element when created\
  \ (acid, cold, electricity, or fire) and takes on a colored sheen based on the elemental\
  \ type (green for acid, blue for cold, silver for electricity, or red for fire.)\
  \ On command, the wearer of an elemental bulwark can create an effect identical\
  \ to fire shield, except its effects apply to the type of elemental damage chosen\
  \ when the armor was crafted. This effect lasts for up to 10 rounds per day, but\
  \ these rounds need not be used consecutively. Ending this effect is a free action."
