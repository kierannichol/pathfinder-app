description: "This +1 distance net seems lighter than expected and is slightly sticky\
  \ to the touch. Three times per day, the wielder may speak the command word and\
  \ throw the net of snaring at a target. This is a ranged touch attack with a range\
  \ of 40 feet. The net immediately grows by two size categories. If the attack hits,\
  \ the target must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save or become entangled. So long as\
  \ the wielder retains control of the trailing rope, he may attempt or otherwise\
  \ act on a grapple as a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.\
  \ Speaking the command word again shrinks the item to normal size so long as no\
  \ creature is confined within it."
