description: "This large weight is attached to a sharp steel hook which doubles as\
  \ a carabiner. Once the steel hook is punched through the skin of a flying creature's\
  \ wing, the carabiner locks shut. The weight then acts as an anchor, unbalancing\
  \ the creature's wings, which prevents the creature from flying. The application\
  \ of wing hobbles causes 1d4 points of piercing damage, and does not permanently\
  \ disable the creature should the hobble be removed. A wing hobble can be attached\
  \ to a pinned creature's wing with a successful grapple check. Removing a wing hobble\
  \ from a creature's wing is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity\
  \ and requires the use of two hands."
