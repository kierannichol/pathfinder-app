description: "The wearer of these boots can, on command three times per day, cause\
  \ her current square to sprout a thick canopy of fruit-bearing or otherwise edible\
  \ plants. These plants count as difficult terrain and grant cover to any Medium\
  \ or smaller creature within the square. They also provide enough food to sustain\
  \ two Medium creatures for 1 full day. While the plants can grow on surfaces that\
  \ would not normally support vegetation such as a wooden floor or cave stone, they\
  \ cannot sprout on surfaces explicitly hostile to vegetation. The plants are usually\
  \ of a sort common to the terrain or climate of the area in which they were produced.\
  \ They disappear after 24 hours or when completely harvested, whichever comes first."
