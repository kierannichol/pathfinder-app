description: "This barbed ballista bolt is equipped with a heavy weight at the end\
  \ of a long chain. The bolt's extra weight makes the bolt harder to fire accurately,\
  \ and imposes a –2 penalty on attack rolls. In addition to the normal damage dealt\
  \ by a ballista bolt of its size, on a successful hit the weighted bolt lodges itself\
  \ into the target's body, leaving the weighted chain hanging loosely, imparting\
  \ a –5 penalty on all Fly checks made by the target. These penalties stack if a\
  \ target is hit with multiple weighted bolts. A weighted bolt can be removed with\
  \ a successful DC 25 Heal check or a DC 20 Strength check."
