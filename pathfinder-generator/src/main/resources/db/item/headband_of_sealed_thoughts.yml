description: "Uncomfortably sharp protrusions bristle on the inner edge of this heavy,\
  \ bronze headband. It grants its wearer a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence.\
  \ Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is\
  \ worn. It also grants skill ranks as a headband of vast intelligence +4. The wearer\
  \ is protected from all effects that gather information about her via divination,\
  \ and gains a bonus equal to her mythic tier on saving throws against mind-affecting\
  \ effects. This protection otherwise functions as mind blank, except the headband\
  \ provides no protection against limited wish, miracle, and wish, and it doesn't\
  \ grant a resistance bonus on saving throws.\nWhen the wearer succeeds at a saving\
  \ throw against a mind-affecting effect, she can rebound the effect onto the caster\
  \ as an immediate action by expending one use of mythic power. Treat this as the\
  \ original spell or effect, except the wearer is treated as the caster and the original\
  \ caster as the target. The rebounded spell affects only the original caster, and\
  \ rebounding doesn't prevent the original spell from affecting targets other than\
  \ the wearer of the headband of sealed thoughts."
