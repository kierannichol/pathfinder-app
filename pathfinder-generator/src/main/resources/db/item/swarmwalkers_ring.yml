description: "This shining, ash-white ring of bone is crafted to look like countless\
  \ interlocking rat fangs, set with a dozen dark, garnet eyes like those of albino\
  \ sewer-hunters. The wearer of this ring can utter a command word to call forth\
  \ 1d3 rat swarms within 40 feet. These swarms each act immediately and vanish after\
  \ 7 rounds. They are independent and not under the wearer's control, though the\
  \ wearer is immune to the effects and attacks of any swarm created through use of\
  \ this ring.\nAlternatively, upon command, the ring's wearer can use dimension door.\
  \ This magical transportation must begin and end in a square that includes a swarm\
  \ summoned by use of this ring.\nThis ring's abilities can be used a total of three\
  \ times per day, in any combination. An urban druid (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's\
  \ Guide 101) wearing this ring can gain one additional use per day by expending\
  \ three daily uses of her wild shape ability."
