name: "Wand of Sun's Disdain"
description: "You alter a creature so the touch of the sun is hostile to it. The cursed\
  \ creature gains light blindness and is blinded for 1 round if exposed to bright\
  \ light, such as sunlight or the daylight spell. The cursed creature is dazzled\
  \ as long as it remains in areas of bright light, and it is treated as being particularly\
  \ susceptible to sunlight for the purposes of resolving spells like searing light,\
  \ sunbeam, and sunburst."
