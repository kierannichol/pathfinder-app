description: "This divine food comes in many forms, from a light and airy honeyed\
  \ cake to a deep, rich chocolate. A mythic creature that eats this food is restored\
  \ and replenished. Eating this food takes 1 minute, and when the meal is done, the\
  \ consumer regains all her uses of mythic power for the day. If a nonmythic creature\
  \ consumes ambrosia, that creature is subject to neutralize poison, remove curse,\
  \ and remove disease, each at caster level 10th. A mythic creature can choose to\
  \ either gain this effect instead of regaining mythic power."
