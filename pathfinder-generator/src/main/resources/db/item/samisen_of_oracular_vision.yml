description: "This elegant, long-necked samisen is crafted of cat skin stretched over\
  \ a wooden frame. The samisen's three silken strings are magically keyed to the\
  \ past, present, and future. A user must succeed at a DC 20 Perform (string instruments)\
  \ check to play the correct tune and cast one of the following spell effects: legend\
  \ lore (using the string of the past), scrying (using the string of the present),\
  \ or divination (using the string of the future). Each tune can be performed once\
  \ per day, and the user must play the samisen for the required casting time of the\
  \ spell effect. In the case of legend lore, if the required casting time is 1 or\
  \ more days, the user needs to play for just 1 hour. As a masterwork samisen, the\
  \ samisen of oracular vision provides a +2 circumstance bonus on all Perform checks\
  \ using the instrument (including Perform checks to use its abilities)."
