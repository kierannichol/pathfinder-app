description: "This larger, bulkier version of the common club is heavy enough that\
  \ you can't wield it with one hand. It may be ornate and carved, reinforced with\
  \ metal, or a simple branch from a tree. Like simple clubs, greatclubs have many\
  \ names, such as cudgels, bludgeons, shillelaghs, and more."
