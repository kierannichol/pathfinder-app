description: "This +2 wounding (Ultimate Equipment 149) dagger allows the wielder\
  \ to use charm monster (DC 18) three times per day. When the wielder hits a creature\
  \ affected by the dagger's charm effect, the dagger deals an additional 2d6 points\
  \ of damage to that creature, even if the creature is no longer charmed because\
  \ of the hostile action. All other creatures charmed by the blade that see this\
  \ act of betrayal become sickened for 1d4 rounds, but are immediately freed from\
  \ the charm effect."
