description: "When lit, this small conical firework emits bright white sparks that\
  \ illuminate the area as a candle. It can be thrown to target an intersection as\
  \ a splash weapon. One round later, it begins to emit pulses of extremely bright\
  \ light for 1d6 rounds. Any creature that begins its turn within 15 feet of the\
  \ firework must succeed at a DC 12 Reflex saving throw or be blinded for 1d4 rounds."
