description: "This armor looks like a more massive and dangerous suit of demon armor.\
  \ It is a suit of +5 heavy fortification full plate that allows its wearer to make\
  \ claw attacks that deal 2d10 points of damage, and strike as +3 weapons that are\
  \ treated as chaotic and evil for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. Additionally,\
  \ those struck by the claws must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be affected\
  \ as per the spell contagion. The armor's claws are built into the armor so these\
  \ weapons cannot be disarmed. While wearing the armor, the wearer benefits from\
  \ the following demonic traits."
destruction: "The Demon Prince Armor dissolves if submerged in the tears of a demon\
  \ lord. If that foul concoction is then drank by an angel, the armor is destroyed."
