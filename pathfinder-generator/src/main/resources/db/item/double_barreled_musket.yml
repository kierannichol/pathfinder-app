description: "This musket has two parallel barrels; each barrel can be shot independently\
  \ as separate attacks, or both can be fired at once as a standard action (the attack\
  \ action). If both barrels are fired at once, they must both target the same creature\
  \ or object, and the gun becomes wildly inaccurate, taking a â€“4 penalty on each\
  \ shot. Each barrel of a double-barreled musket uses either a bullet and 1 dose\
  \ of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early\
  \ firearm."
