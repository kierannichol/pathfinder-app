description: "This clay container resembles a fuse grenade, but trails a pulley and\
  \ wire rather than a fuse. Pulling the cord (a move action) sparks a flint and steel\
  \ within the device, causing the grenade to explode. The pull cord can be attached\
  \ to a door or drawer within 5 feet, or strung across a 5-foot square, causing the\
  \ grenade to detonate when its tripwire is disturbed. A pull-cord grenade cannot\
  \ be reused.\nThis can be crafted with a DC 25 Craft (traps) check."
