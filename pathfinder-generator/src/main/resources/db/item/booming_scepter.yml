description: "This bejeweled scepter constantly emits a low hum that amplifies the\
  \ wielder's voice. A booming scepter acts as a +1 thundering light mace that grants\
  \ the wielder a +5 competence bonus on Intimidate checks and the ability to use\
  \ shout, as per the spell, once per day. When a booming scepter is held in both\
  \ hands, the wielder's voice carries far enough to be heard by all creatures within\
  \ 1 mile, regardless of ambient noise or intervening obstacles, although this feature\
  \ cannot penetrate the area of a silence spell."
