description: "A climber's plank is a 1-foot-wide wooden plank with a steelcapped spike\
  \ carved on one end. The spiked end can be driven into a wall to create a temporary\
  \ platform. Driving a climber's plank into a wall is a standard action and requires\
  \ a successful Strength check, with a DC equal to the break DC of the surface material.\
  \ Removing an embedded climber's plank requires a second Strength check at the same\
  \ DC. You can easily stand on a pair of climber's planks, but standing on a single\
  \ plank requires a successful DC 5 Acrobatics check. Climber's planks are sold in\
  \ pairs."
