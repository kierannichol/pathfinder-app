description: "Once per day, a creature can pour a potion with a duration longer than\
  \ instantaneous into the chalice, then drink it as a standard action that provokes\
  \ attacks of opportunity. The bearer and up to two willing allies within 30 feet\
  \ gain the benefits as though they had consumed the potion; however, the duration\
  \ is divided evenly between all recipients (including the bearer), rounded down\
  \ to the nearest round."
