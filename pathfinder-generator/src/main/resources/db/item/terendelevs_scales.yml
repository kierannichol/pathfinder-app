description: "These palm-sized silver dragon scales are unique items—essentially minor\
  \ artifacts resulting from Terendelev's death on the Storm King's blade.\nEach of\
  \ Terendelev's scales grants a different power to the person who carries them. The\
  \ powers granted do not function at all if more than one scale is carried. The powers\
  \ of the four scales are listed below—any nonevil creature that handles a scale\
  \ immediately understands its use.\nCloudwalking: Three times per day as a standard\
  \ action, a scale can be used to cast levitate. A pillar of roiling clouds rises\
  \ below the levitating object or creature, growing and shrinking with the target's\
  \ altitude. This pillar is 5 feet in diameter (regardless of the target's size)\
  \ and provides concealment (20% miss chance) to any creature or object wholly contained\
  \ within.\nDisguise: Three times per day as a standard action, a scale can be used\
  \ to cast alter self. While disguised, the target gains a +4 bonus on all Bluff\
  \ checks made against evil creatures.\nResistance: Three times per day as a standard\
  \ action, a scale can be used to cast resist elements —but only against electricity\
  \ or cold.\nSacred Weaponry: Three times per day as a standard action, a scale can\
  \ be used to cast align weapon, but only to make a weapon lawful or good. Unlike\
  \ a normal align weapon spell, this effect can be cast on an unarmed strike or natural\
  \ weapon."
destruction: "The Storm King Khorramzadeh can destroy each of Terendelev's scales\
  \ merely by eating it."
