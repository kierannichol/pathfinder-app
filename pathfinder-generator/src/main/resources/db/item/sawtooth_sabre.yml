description: "Crafted to evoke the barbed talons of the Mantis God himself, a sawtooth\
  \ sabre may be used as a Martial Weapon (in which case it functions identically\
  \ to a longsword). If you have the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (sawtooth sabre) feat,\
  \ for the purpose of two-weapon fighting you can treat it as a light melee weapon;\
  \ for all other purposes, it is a one-handed melee weapon."
