description: "This gum has alchemical properties that allow it to soak up magical\
  \ energy and release it when the gum is chewed. As a standard action, a stick of\
  \ tiller's gum can be imbued with a spell of up to 3rd level with a casting time\
  \ of less than 1 minute and that targets one or more creatures, as if the gum were\
  \ the target of the spell. The gum holds the spell's charge for 1 hour, during which\
  \ time a creature capable of casting the stored spell can chew the gum as a standard\
  \ action to gain the spell's effects, expending the stored spell and destroying\
  \ the gum. The stored spell uses the original caster's level to determine its effects.\
  \ If the spell-imbued gum isn't used before an hour passes, it is ruined. Crafting\
  \ a stick of tiller's gum requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
