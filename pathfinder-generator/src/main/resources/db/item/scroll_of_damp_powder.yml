name: "Scroll of Damp Powder"
description: "This spell causes ammunition already loaded into the target firearm\
  \ is ruined with moisture. Any attempt to fire that ammunition fails, with no chance\
  \ for misfire, and the user must then take a full-round action to clear the weapon\
  \ before reloading and firing it. If aware of this spell's effect prior to firing\
  \ the altered ammunition (a DC 16 Spellcraft check to identify the spell being cast\
  \ or similar effect), the firearm's user can spend a standard action to clear the\
  \ altered ammunition from the firearm. Doing so destroys that ammunition."
