description: "A retriever drone appears as a masterfully preserved spider the size\
  \ of a house cat, whose eyes have been replaced by four glittering gemstones. These\
  \ devices are created by spellcasters who wish to control their own retrievers,\
  \ since the secret of creating those monsters is beyond mortal capacity to understand.\n\
  A retriever drone can be used to usurp control of a retriever that is within 30\
  \ feet. To take control of a retriever, the user of a retriever drone must have\
  \ line of sight to the target and concentrate on it while holding the retriever\
  \ drone in both hands. The target retriever can resist the attempt to take control\
  \ by succeeding at a DC 16 Will save. If the retriever is currently on a mission\
  \ to retrieve a target, it gains a +8 bonus on this save. If the retriever's saving\
  \ throw is successful, the drone thrashes and scurries, making a single +15 bite\
  \ attack (1d6+4 damage) against its carrier before becoming inert for 24 hours.\n\
  If the retriever fails to resist, it falls under the control of the person who carried\
  \ the droneâ€”this control is permanent as long as the retriever drone exists and\
  \ the person who activated the drone is chaotic evil. If the controller isn't chaotic\
  \ evil, control granted lasts for only 24 hours. If the retriever controlled by\
  \ a drone is destroyed, the drone itself crumbles to dust.\nAs a full-round action\
  \ while touching an active retriever drone, the user can look through the eyes of\
  \ a controlled retriever and direct its actions. If the drone is destroyed while\
  \ the user is linked in this manner, the user takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage\
  \ (Fortitude DC 16 negates)."
