description: "This rod is similar in appearance to a metamagic rod. Once a creature\
  \ picks up such a rod, it cannot be discarded without use of a remove curse spell\
  \ or similar magic. Each time the wielder casts a spell, he takes the rod of foiled\
  \ magic in hand and treats the caster level of the spell as 2 levels lower. If this\
  \ would reduce the caster level to 0 or lower, than the caster has only a 50% chance\
  \ of casting the spell (any chance of arcane spell failure is added to this percentile\
  \ chance), but if he is able to cast the spell, the spell has a caster level of\
  \ 1st."
