description: "A flying skiff is a long, flat-bottomed vehicle akin to a naval ship,\
  \ and is covered in metallic veins. Without a psychic pilot, a flying skiff acts\
  \ in all regards as a keelboat (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 184). A single Large\
  \ directfire siege engine can be mounted on the front of a flying skiff.\nA control\
  \ helmet that fits a Small, Medium, or Large creature is linked by long, curling\
  \ cables to the metal veins of the skiff. Whenever a psychic creature (one with\
  \ levels in an occult class, the Psychic Sensitivity feat, or the ability to use\
  \ psychic spelllike abilities) wears the control helmet, the flying skiff gains\
  \ the following abilities."
