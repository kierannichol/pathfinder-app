description: "This stone absorbs your soul as the magic jar spell immediately prior\
  \ to your death. You can't transfer your soul from the ioun stone receptacle to\
  \ another creature's body, and are, for all intents and purposes, dead. While your\
  \ soul is in the ioun stone, you can sense any life forces within 120 feet as though\
  \ you were placed in a magic jar. At any point within 12 hours of your soul's transfer\
  \ into the pale orange rhombus ioun stone, you can return to your body as long as\
  \ it is within 120 feet of the ioun stone. Upon returning to your body, you are\
  \ unconscious and dying with a number of negative hit points equal to your Constitution\
  \ score minus 1. If you fail to stabilize and aren't healed after 1 turn, you die\
  \ and your soul is not absorbed by the ioun stone. Your soul can be absorbed into\
  \ a pale orange rhombus ioun stone only once per 24-hour period.\nResonance: A soul\
  \ held within the stone can remain there indefinitely as long as the wayfinder remains\
  \ on the soul's original body. If the wayfinder is removed from the body, the ioun\
  \ stone's resonant power is suppressed until the wayfinder is replaced."
