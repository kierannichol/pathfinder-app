description: "This handheld wooden spool spins freely within a boxlike housing. Inscribed\
  \ upon the exterior of the spool are dozens of samsaran prayers along with names\
  \ or symbols associated with a samsaran's past lives. Samsarans believe that spinning\
  \ the wheel during meditation strengthens the spiritual connections between their\
  \ former lives. If a samsaran meditates with her wheel for at least 10 minutes about\
  \ a Knowledge (history) question relating to her own history or the histories of\
  \ her past lives, she gains a +1 insight bonus on the check."
