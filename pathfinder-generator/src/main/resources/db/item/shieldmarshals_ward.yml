description: "Crafted from magnetic ore warped by exposure to the Mana Wastes, this\
  \ +1 arrow deflection buckler is thought to be one of the original shields granted\
  \ by Duke Alkenstar to the first shieldmarshals.\nWhenever the bearer of this shield\
  \ successfully deflects a projectile using the shield, she can, as a free action,\
  \ expend one use of mythic power to redirect the deflected projectile toward any\
  \ creature to which she has a clear line of effect, using the original attacker's\
  \ attack and damage rolls. The range increment penalty on the attack roll of this\
  \ deflected projectile is calculated from the original point at which the projectile\
  \ was fired. For example, a foe fires an arrow from his shortbow (range increment\
  \ 60 feet) at a mythic character bearing a shieldmarshal's ward who is 100 feet\
  \ away, taking a –2 penalty on his attack roll. The mythic character deflects the\
  \ arrow toward the same foe, meaning the arrow has traveled a total of 200 feet,\
  \ which imposes a –6 penalty on the attack roll to hit the foe (since three range\
  \ increments of 60 feet equals 180 feet).\nA character who possesses levels in the\
  \ shieldmarshal prestige class (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Paths of Prestige 48)\
  \ can bear a shieldmarshal's ward without penalty, even if she isn't proficient\
  \ with it."
