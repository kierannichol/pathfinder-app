description: "The armor worn by a Hellknight signifer is a vestment of armored plates,\
  \ chain, and dark fabric. It functions as half-plate, but it can be donned and removed\
  \ as though it were medium armor. Any spellcaster who wears this armor is treated\
  \ as if he were wearing Hellknight plate for the purposes of any feats and effects\
  \ that require one to be wearing Hellknight plate. This armor includes a signifer\
  \ mask, though signifer masks can be purchased separately."
