description: "Poison gum is often used by agents of Norgorber, particularly those\
  \ alchemists and poisoners who venerate the insidious god as Blackfingers. Chewing\
  \ a piece of poison gum —which resembles nothing so much as a lump of congealed\
  \ sap—is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity, though the user can\
  \ continue to chew the gum as a free action on consecutive rounds. Doing so fills\
  \ the user's mouth with three doses of Medium spider venom (Pathfinder RPG Core\
  \ Rulebook 560). This poison lasts for up to 5 minutes before losing its potency.\
  \ As a swift action while chewing poison gum, the user can apply the poison to a\
  \ wielded weapon. If the user lacks the poison use class feature, there is a 5%\
  \ chance that he exposes herself to the poison while chewing the gum or applying\
  \ the poison to a weapon, and if he rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with a poisoned\
  \ weapon, he also exposes himself to the poison."
