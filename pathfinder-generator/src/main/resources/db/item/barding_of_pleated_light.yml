description: "The barding of pleated light was crafted by angels in service to Pulura,\
  \ the Shimmering Maiden, an empyreal lord once venerated by the conquered people\
  \ of Sarkoris. This ornately crafted mithral full plate armor resizes to fit a horse,\
  \ warhorse, or equivalent mount that it is placed upon. It acts as +2 greater spell\
  \ resistance (19) full plate barding. The barding of pleated light grants additional\
  \ powers related to the rippling light of an aurora. These powers can be activated\
  \ by the wearer's rider; the wearer can activate the barding's powers only if it\
  \ has an Intelligence score of 3 or greater.\nFirst, the barding can be activated\
  \ as the blinding shield special ability at will, but the wearer and the wearer's\
  \ rider are both immune to this blinding effect. Second, as an immediate action,\
  \ the armor can be activated to divert harmful light or shadows. This grants the\
  \ armor's spell resistance to the wearer's rider for 1 round, but this spell resistance\
  \ only protects against spells with the light or shadow descriptor. Finally, the\
  \ armor allows the wearer to pass through shimmering curtains of light. As an immediate\
  \ action when charging, the armor can be activated to select any 10-foot-square\
  \ area in the path of the charge. A curtain of multicolored light appears momentarily\
  \ on each side of this area. The wearer can charge across this area as though it\
  \ did not exist, disappearing into a ripple of light on one side and reappearing\
  \ in a ripple of light on the other side. The wearer ignores terrain or obstacles\
  \ in the intervening area (allowing the wearer to charge through allies in the area,\
  \ for example), and the intervening area does not count toward the wearer's charge\
  \ movement. The ripple of light cannot be used for movement by anyone except the\
  \ wearer and the wearer's rider."
destruction: "The barding of pleated light is destroyed if it's reduced to 0 hit points\
  \ in an area of absolute darkness with no light—not even a candle's flicker or reflected\
  \ moonbeam—within 10 miles in any direction."
