description: "This +1 light repeating crossbow of deep mahogany rimmed with gold has\
  \ a stock carved in the likeness of Abadar's First Vault. An extradimensional space\
  \ within the crossbow can hold 20 bolts. Loading new bolts into the extradimensional\
  \ space requires a move action that provokes an attack of opportunity for each bolt.\
  \ The crossbow weighs the same no matter how many bolts are placed inside it. A\
  \ worshiper of Abadar treats the vaultbow as a light crossbow for purposes of proficiency\
  \ and applying the benefits of feats relating to a light crossbow.\nThree times\
  \ per day, the wielder can choose to have a bolt transform into a length of chain\
  \ that wraps around its target on a successful attack. This decision must be made\
  \ before the attack roll is made. A Large or smaller creature struck by this attack\
  \ becomes entangled (and if dependent on wings to fly, it must succeed at a DC 15\
  \ Reflex save or lose the ability to fly while entangled). An entangled creature\
  \ can break (and destroy) the chains with a successful DC 30 Strength check or escape\
  \ them with a successful DC 30 combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check. This\
  \ chain lasts for 5 rounds before fading from existence."
