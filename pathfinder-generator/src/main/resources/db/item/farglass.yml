description: "This telescoping brass spyglass functions as a normal spyglass and allows\
  \ clear vision to the horizon 3 miles away at sea level. From atop a typical crow's\
  \ nest or 70-foot-tall tower like Tidewater Rock, this vision extends to over 10\
  \ miles. Once per day, the user of a farglass can activate a clairaudience/ clairvoyance\
  \ effect upon any location seen through the farglass's lens. As long as the location\
  \ is kept in sight through the lens, the clairaudience/clairvoyance sensor can move\
  \ with the location. This effect lasts for up to 5 minutes."
