description: "This box features moving parts, secret panels, or unusual codes and\
  \ locking mechanisms. Depending on the box, a Disable Device, Knowledge (engineering),\
  \ Linguistics, or simple Intelligence check might open it. The DC of the check varies\
  \ with the complexity of the box, but is typically 15 or 20 (retry once per day).\
  \ Multiple skill checks might be necessary for different stages of the puzzle. If\
  \ the puzzle box was constructed with the intention that one specific person should\
  \ be able to open it, that person gets a +5 circumstance bonus on the check."
