description: "This dwarven version of the more famous rod of lordly might has no spell-like\
  \ powers; however, when wielded by a dwarf, it increases all AC, attack roll, CMD,\
  \ CMB, and saving throw bonuses from a dwarf's racial traits by +1. The rod shares\
  \ the mundane powers of a rod of lordly might, but its magical weapon forms are\
  \ tailored to dwarven preferences."
