description: "Wax and resin seal this smoked glass bottle. When the bottle is opened\
  \ or shattered, a shrill scream erupts in a 20-foot-radius burst. Any bardic performances\
  \ with audible components immediately end. Any spellcaster concentrating on or casting\
  \ a spell must succeed at a concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) or lose the\
  \ spell. In addition, the scream dispels any silence spells that overlap its area.\
  \ The bottle can be thrown as a splash weapon or opened by hand. If the bottle is\
  \ opened, its burst is centered on the opener's space."
