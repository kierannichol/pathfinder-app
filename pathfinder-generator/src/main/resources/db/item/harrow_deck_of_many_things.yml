description: "A Harrow Deck of Many Things is usually found wrapped in cloth or velvet\
  \ and hidden away within a simple wooden case, but nothing marks it as being anything\
  \ other than an oft-used and treasured focus of the Varisian fortune-telling art.\
  \ As soon as one of the deck's cards is drawn at random, though, its nature becomes\
  \ apparent and an effect determined by the chosen card is bestowed upon the user—\
  often to life-altering effect.\nA bearer of a Harrow Deck of Many Things who wishes\
  \ to draw a card must announce how many cards he will draw before doing so. These\
  \ cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw\
  \ any more cards from the deck than he announced (unless the effect of a drawn card\
  \ states otherwise). If the character does not willingly draw his allotted number\
  \ or is somehow prevented from doing so, the cards flip out of the deck on their\
  \ own after 1 hour. Future attempts to draw cards from the deck made by someone\
  \ who has already drawn his allotted number reveal only blank cards.\nEach time\
  \ a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced, making it possible to draw the\
  \ same card twice. A Harrow Deck of Many Things contains 54 cards, with the effects\
  \ of each detailed in the following Effects of the Harrow section."
destruction: "The Harrow Deck of Many Things possesses a strange sort of selfpreservation.\
  \ If the deck is damaged—regardless of how much damage it takes—one card is destroyed\
  \ and the deck randomly teleports somewhere else on the plane. If it is somehow\
  \ pursued and damaged again within 1 minute, another card is destroyed and the deck\
  \ teleports again. If this process is repeated until no cards are remaining, the\
  \ deck is destroyed. If the deck is not entirely destroyed, destroyed cards reappear\
  \ at a rate of 1 per hour."
