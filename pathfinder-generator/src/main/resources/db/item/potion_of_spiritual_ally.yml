name: "Potion of Spiritual Ally"
description: "An ally made of pure force appears in a single 5-foot square within\
  \ range. The ally takes the form of a servant of your god. The spiritual ally occupies\
  \ its space, though you and your allies can move through it, since it is your ally.\
  \ The spiritual allycarries a single weapon, one favored by your deity (as for spiritual\
  \ weapon), which has the same threat range and critical modifiers as a real weapon\
  \ of its form. Each round on your turn, starting with the turn that you cast this\
  \ spell, your spiritual allycan make an attack against a foe within its reach that\
  \ you designate. The spiritual allythreatens adjacent squares and can flank and\
  \ make attacks of opportunity as if it were a normal creature. The spiritual allyuses\
  \ your base attack bonus (gaining extra attacks if your base attack bonus is high\
  \ enough) plus your Wisdom bonus when it makes a melee attack. When the spiritual\
  \ allyhits, it deals 1d10 points of force damage + 1 point of damage per 3 caster\
  \ levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). It strikes as a spell, not a weapon, so it\
  \ bypasses DR and can affect incorporeal creatures."
