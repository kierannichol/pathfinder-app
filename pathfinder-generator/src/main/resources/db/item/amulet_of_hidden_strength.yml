description: "This glass teardrop hangs on a platinum chain and can be used once per\
  \ day to grant a surge of power. This surge can be used in one of two ways. As a\
  \ swift action, the wearer of the amulet can make one melee or ranged attack at\
  \ his highest attack bonus. Alternatively, if the wearer of the amulet has a ki\
  \ pool, he can instead focus on the power of the amulet as a full-round action and\
  \ regain two ki points."
