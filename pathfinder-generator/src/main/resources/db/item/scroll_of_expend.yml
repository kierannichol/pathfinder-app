name: "Scroll of Expend"
description: "You cause all creatures in the affected area to use up one or more of\
  \ their limited-use magical abilities without any actual effect. A limited-use magical\
  \ ability is any supernatural or spell-like ability which a creature can only activate\
  \ a certain number of times during a set interval (3/day, 1/hour, etc.). The spell\
  \ does not affect abilities which the creature can use at will or which are constant.\
  \ It also does not apply to magical items or anything else external to a creature.\
  \ A creature in the spell's area must make a Will saving throw or expend a single\
  \ use of one of its abilities. Abilities with the greatest number of uses per day\
  \ are affected first; if more than one ability has the same number of uses, randomly\
  \ determine which one is affected first. Creatures must continue making Will saves,\
  \ expending an additional use of an ability for each failed save, until they succeed,\
  \ at which point the spell has no further effect."
