name: "Oil of Snapdragon Fireworks"
description: "A favorite display at halfling midsummer festivals, this spell lets\
  \ you create fireworks in the shape of tiny dragons. Once per round, as a move action,\
  \ you may designate a target 5-foot-square within range and launch a pyrotechnic\
  \ in that direction. The pyrotechnic takes a zigzag path from you to that square,\
  \ always missing creatures and objects in its path, and detonates in that square\
  \ with a bang and a colorful burst of fire and light. Creatures in the target square\
  \ take 1d4 points of fire damage and are dazzled for 1 round (Reflex half, a successful\
  \ save negates the dazzled condition). Normally when this spell is used as part\
  \ of a festival, the chosen target is high in the sky to increase visibility and\
  \ protect observers."
