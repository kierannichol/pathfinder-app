description: "When a cleric with an icon of aspects prepares spells, she may replace\
  \ the granted powers of one of her domains with those of a different domain she\
  \ doesn't have but that is associated with her deity. This lasts until the next\
  \ time she prepares spells. The cleric must meet the level requirements for both\
  \ abilities. For example, a 6th-level cleric with the Good domain who swaps for\
  \ the Healing domain can't use healer's blessing even though she meets the level\
  \ requirement, because the holy lance power of the Good domain requires her to be\
  \ 8th level. The icon affects only granted powers, not domain spells, bonus feats,\
  \ or other benefits. The icon can affect only one person at a time."
