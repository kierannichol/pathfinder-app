description: "This metal canister contains alchemical reactants separated by parchment\
  \ and a slow-burning fuse. Lighting the fuse is a move action; 1d3 rounds later,\
  \ the chroma grenade explodes, spewing luminescent sparks and gases that fill a\
  \ 10-foot-radius area. Creatures in the area are dazzled and take a â€“2 penalty on\
  \ saving throws against illusion (pattern) spells for 3 rounds (DC 15 Will negates).\
  \ A chroma grenade can be thrown as though it were a splash weapon with a range\
  \ increment of 10 feet. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy)\
  \ check."
