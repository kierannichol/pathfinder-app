description: "Spartoi seeds appear as teeth stained by ash. The teeth themselves typically\
  \ take the form of tiny dragon teeth, though some appear to come from a serpent,\
  \ wolf, or human. When a tooth is cast upon the earth as a standard action, a spartolos\
  \ under the user's command erupts on the following round. The spartolos lasts for\
  \ 1 hour or until destroyed. A spartolos's equipment vanishes if its owner is destroyed\
  \ or after an hour.\nThese seeds are typically found in simple pouches of leather\
  \ or velvet containing 2d4 teeth. Up to six seeds can be sown by a single standard\
  \ action."
