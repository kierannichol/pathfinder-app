description: "This canopic jar containing Arazni's preserved lungs echoes with Arazni's\
  \ sense of duty and the lingering power of the dead god Aroden. The bearer of the\
  \ Lung Bloodstone of Arazni gains Improved Iron Will as a bonus feat. Any cleric\
  \ who bears the jar is granted the Knowledge domain as an additional domain, with\
  \ the associated granted powers and domain spells, for as long as she bears it.\
  \ If the bearer is not a cleric, she instead gains the lore keeper ability of the\
  \ Knowledge domain, treating her character level as her cleric level."
destruction: "Together, the tyrant Geb and the lich Arazni can destroy the Bloodstone,\
  \ binding the organ within the withered form of the fallen hero as part of a 24-hour-long\
  \ ritual."
