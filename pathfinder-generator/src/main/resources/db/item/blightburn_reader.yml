description: "A blightburn reader is a small wooden or metal frame, roughly 2 inches\
  \ wide and 4 inches long, containing a specially prepared alchemical paper pressed\
  \ between two thin panes of glass. Whenever a character wearing a blightburn reader\
  \ enters an area with a radiation hazard (such as those presented on page 24), the\
  \ paper within changes from white to black over the course of 1 minute. Once the\
  \ paper turns black, it is destroyed and must be replaced at a cost of 15 gp before\
  \ the blightburn reader can be used again."
