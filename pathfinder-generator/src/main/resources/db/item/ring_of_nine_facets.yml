description: "The gem set within this remarkably ancient ring is distinctly cut to\
  \ exhibit nine perfect facets, each of a different hue. Each day at sunrise, the\
  \ gem rotates to display a different facet. The active facet determines the ring's\
  \ power for that day. Each day, roll 1d10 on the Ring of Nine Facets Powers table\
  \ to determine which facet—and thus which power—is active.\nThe wearer of the ring\
  \ can, with a great deal of mental exertion, attempt to change the active facet\
  \ away from one she does not desire. The gem can only be turned in a particular\
  \ order that shifts the active facet to the next highest facet, and each facet is\
  \ a particular number of steps away from one another (see the Ring of Nine Facets\
  \ Powers table). To change the facet, the wearer must succeed at a Wisdom check\
  \ as a full-round action, and the wearer takes nonlethal damage, regardless of success.\
  \ The DC of the Wisdom check to turn the gem is 15 + 5 per 1-step increase, while\
  \ the nonlethal damage dealt equals 1d6 per 1-step increase. For example, if the\
  \ facet of the day were yellow, the wearer could attempt a DC 20 Wisdom check and\
  \ take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage to shift it to copper, or attempt a DC 25\
  \ Wisdom check and take 2d6 points of nonlethal damage to shift it to green. The\
  \ ring's facets cannot be shifted backwards (thus, yellow cannot turn directly to\
  \ white; it must shift through all seven other colors to reach white). The ring's\
  \ facet can only be changed once per day.\nAny nongood creature that wears the Ring\
  \ of Nine Facets immediately takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage and another 2d6\
  \ points of nonlethal damage every minute it continues to wear the ring.\n"
destruction: "If the wearer of the Ring of Nine Facets successfully shifts it through\
  \ all nine facets twice (requiring a DC 105 Wisdom check and incurring 18d6 points\
  \ of nonlethal damage) a tenth, black facet is revealed. This causes the ring to\
  \ deal 2d6 points of lethal damage to any nonneutral (not solely neutral) wearer\
  \ every round it is worn. The other powers of this new facet are a mystery, but\
  \ the wearer can use the tenth facet to completely destroy the Ring of Nine Facets."
