description: "You can form an existing piece of stone into any shape that suits your\
  \ purpose. While it's possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth with stone\
  \ shape, fine detail isn't possible. There is a 30% chance that any shape including\
  \ moving parts simply doesn't work."
