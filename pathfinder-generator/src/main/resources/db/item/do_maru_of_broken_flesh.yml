description: "Once per day as a standard action, the wearer of this +2 do-maru armor\
  \ (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 128) can activate the armor to heal 4d8+9 points\
  \ of damage and end any and all of the following conditions affecting the wearer:\
  \ ability damage, blinded, confused, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued,\
  \ nauseated, poisoned, and sickened. In addition, this effect functions as break\
  \ enchantment upon a single additional effect of the wearer's choice that is affecting\
  \ the wearer and that can be legally affected by this effect. Such healing, however,\
  \ comes at a cost. The do-maru of broken flesh creates vivid, ugly scars on the\
  \ wearer, who takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage each time this ability is used.\n\
  Do-maru is medium armor that provides a +5 armor bonus. The armor has an arcane\
  \ spell failure chance of 25%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +4, and an armor check\
  \ penalty of -4. Do-maru costs 200 gp and weighs 30 lbs."
