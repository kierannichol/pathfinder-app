description: "This black deerstalker cap features a subtle, sinister, eye-like design\
  \ stitched on the front flap. The hat grants a +2 competence bonus on all Knowledge\
  \ checks to identify monsters.\nIf the wearer is an investigator, the hat allows\
  \ him to take advantage of his deductions in combat. Whenever he uses inspiration\
  \ to identify a nonhumanoid creature, he can record the result of the inspiration\
  \ die and use it again later. Within the next minute, before rolling an attack roll\
  \ against that creature, a skill check against that creature, or a saving throw\
  \ against one of that creature's attacks, he can add the recorded inspiration die\
  \ result to his roll—if he does so, he can't use inspiration to apply another inspiration\
  \ die to the roll. Using the recorded result doesn't require the investigator to\
  \ spend a use of inspiration, and the recorded result goes away once it's used.\
  \ He can have only one inspiration die result recorded in this way. If he uses inspiration\
  \ to identify another monster before using his recorded inspiration die, he must\
  \ decide whether to replace the old result before rolling."
