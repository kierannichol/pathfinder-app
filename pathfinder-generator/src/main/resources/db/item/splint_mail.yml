description: "Splint mail is made up of overlapping layers of metal strips attached\
  \ to a backing of leather or sturdy fabric. These splints are of greater size and\
  \ durability than those that compose a suit of scale mail, improving the protection\
  \ they afford the wearer, but at the cost of flexibility. A suit of splint mail\
  \ includes gauntlets."
