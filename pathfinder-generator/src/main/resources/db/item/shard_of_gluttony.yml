description: "The Shard of Gluttony is made of pale inubrix. As long as the Shard\
  \ of Gluttony is carried, its owner can use vampiric touch as a spell-like ability\
  \ once per day, gains a +2 insight bonus on saves versus necromancy spells, and\
  \ increases his maximum hit points by 1 point per Hit Die.\nCurse: The owner is\
  \ always hungry and thirsty, and is sickened whenever he has not eaten food in the\
  \ past hour. The owner must make a DC 20 Will save to resist consuming any food\
  \ or beverage (including potions and the like) he carries immediately. If the save\
  \ is successful, the owner can resist the urge for 1 hour before being forced to\
  \ make the save again."
destruction: "A shard of the Sihedron cannot be destroyed individually. Only by recombining\
  \ them into the Sihedron and then using that artifact's method of destruction can\
  \ one destroy the shards."
