description: "This shimmering black dust causes one creature to be coated in a layer\
  \ of darkness for 1 minute. In normal light, the creature gains concealment (20%\
  \ miss chance). In dim light, the creature gains total concealment (50% miss chance).\
  \ It has no effect in areas of bright light or darkness (though in bright light,\
  \ a viewer can make a DC 20 Perception check to notice the target is slightly shadowed).\
  \ Creatures with darkvision see through the dust's darkness as if it were normal\
  \ darkness. The dust dispels and counters the outlining effects of glitterdust,\
  \ but doesn't affect the spell's blinding effects. Glitterdust dispels and counters\
  \ the effects of the dust of darkness."
