name: "Potion of Paranoia"
description: "The target believes everyone it sees is an enemy. The target becomes\
  \ hostile to all creatures, treating all creatures as enemies and only itself as\
  \ an ally. The target must attempt attacks of opportunity whenever any creature\
  \ provokes them. Finally, whenever the target is adjacent to two or more creatures,\
  \ its paranoia overwhelms it, and it takes a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls, weapon\
  \ damage rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws."
