description: "This treated wafer dissolves into a chalky paste when placed under the\
  \ tongue and then gives the imbiber a jolt of restless energy. It eliminates the\
  \ effects of fatigue for the next 8 hours; when the drug's effect ends, the user\
  \ is exhausted. Allnight makes its users jittery and unable to focus; they suffer\
  \ a –2 penalty on all skill checks until its effects wear off."
