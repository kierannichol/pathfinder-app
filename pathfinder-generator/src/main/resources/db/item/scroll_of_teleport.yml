name: "Scroll of Teleport"
description: "This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which\
  \ may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible.\
  \ You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum\
  \ load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying\
  \ gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels.\
  \ A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four\
  \ Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact\
  \ with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with\
  \ you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you\
  \ need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only\
  \ objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and\
  \ spell resistance."
