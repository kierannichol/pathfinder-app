description: "A frontovik's gas mask has the appearance of a typical Zelinsky- Kummant\
  \ gas mask used by the Russian army: a rubberized cloth bag worn over the face,\
  \ with two thick glass eyepieces and a rectangular filter canister (see page 67).\
  \ Named for the frontovik, the typical combat-hardened veteran of the front line,\
  \ a frontovik's gas mask allows its wearer to breathe freely, even underwater or\
  \ in a vacuum, as well as making its wearer immune to harmful gases and vapors,\
  \ including inhaled diseases, poisons, and magic spells such as cloudkill and stinking\
  \ cloud. In addition, the wearer can see through magical and normal clouds, fogs,\
  \ mists, and similar effects that grant concealment, but only so long as the wearer\
  \ is within the area of such concealment. A frontovik's gas mask does not grant\
  \ any other kind of vision (such as darkvision or low-light vision). Wearing a gas\
  \ mask imposes a â€“2 penalty on hearing- and sight-based Perception checks."
