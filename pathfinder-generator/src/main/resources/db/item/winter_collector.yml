description: "Winter collectors are always located in areas of severe cold, and are\
  \ typically surrounded by thick snow or ice. A winter collector siphons a portion\
  \ of the ambient cold weather and condenses it into concentrated cold energy, which\
  \ the collector then beams like a signal across worlds to the winter receiver in\
  \ the Royal Palace in Whitethrone. This energy then radiates out to the borders\
  \ of Irrisen, keeping the weather in a perpetual wintry state. In addition, a winter\
  \ collector functions as a permanent gate, allowing instant travel from the collector's\
  \ location to the Royal Palace (but not in the other direction), even if the collector\
  \ is located on the Material Plane.\nA winter collector radiates an aura of cold\
  \ out to 50 feet. This aura deals 6d6 points of cold damage each round to creatures\
  \ in this area. Creatures within 10 feet of the winter collector take 12d6 points\
  \ of cold damage each round. Half of this cold damage is not subject to being reduced\
  \ by resistance or immunity to cold-based effects."
destruction: "Each winter collector has a unique means of destruction, which is left\
  \ for the GM to develop, though successfully destroying a winter collector should\
  \ be a trial worthy of gaining a mythic tier."
