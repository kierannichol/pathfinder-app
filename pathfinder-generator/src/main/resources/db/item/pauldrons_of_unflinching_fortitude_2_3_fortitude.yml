description: "The wearer of these elegant, polished steel pauldrons gains a bonus\
  \ on all saving throws, as with a cloak of resistance, but the resistance bonus\
  \ on Fortitude saves is one greater. Furthermore, if the wearer fails a Fortitude\
  \ saving throw, he can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to\
  \ reroll that saving throw. If the wearer fails the saving throw on the reroll,\
  \ he can't use this ability again for 24 hours."
