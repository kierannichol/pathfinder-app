description: "This pair of hammers is linked by a loose chain. While the two hammers\
  \ are balanced to wield in melee together, the chain is long enough that you can\
  \ throw one hammer a short distance and then pull it back; pulling the chain to\
  \ retrieve the thrown hammer is a move action. The chain-hammer's maximum throwing\
  \ range is 10 feet. Dwarf rangers are fond of using chain-hammers, often using a\
  \ locked gauntlet to make sure one of the hammers remains secure."
