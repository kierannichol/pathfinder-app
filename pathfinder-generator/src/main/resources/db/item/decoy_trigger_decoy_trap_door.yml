description: "Decoy triggers are misleading mechanisms intended to divert a victim's\
  \ attention from a real trap by presenting an easily found decoy. Ideally, the victim\
  \ spots the fake mechanism and, in attempting to disarm or evade it, triggers the\
  \ real trap.\nA decoy trigger grants a bonus to the Perception DC of any trap it\
  \ accessorizes—the decoy itself has an intentionally low Perception DC. Though a\
  \ decoy trigger increases the CR of the trap it augments, as a standalone accessory\
  \ it doesn't increase the trap's Craft DC. Instead of a Disable Device DC, decoy\
  \ triggers have a Sense Motive DC. If a creature succeeds at the decoy's Sense Motive\
  \ check, it immediately recognizes the decoy trigger as a fake, and the real trap\
  \ loses the bonus to its Perception DC. All decoy triggers are single-use only."
