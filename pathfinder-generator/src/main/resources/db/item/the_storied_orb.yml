description: "From this cup poured the poison that killed the Caliph of the Djinn.\
  \ According to a djinn fable, the Caliph berated the cup for failing to warn him\
  \ of the treachery, and so abashed was the vessel that it swore from that time on\
  \ to warn if it was ever again filled with poison.\nThe storied cup is a golden\
  \ chalice decorated with scenes of the djinn court. If a poisonous liquid is poured\
  \ into the cup the images change from those of friendly discourse to impressions\
  \ of angry fighting. A character unaware of this property must make a DC 20 Spot\
  \ check to notice the sudden change."
