description: "Tanks full of normal air don't last long as breathing devices, but a\
  \ large air tank is excellent for ensuring a character has a swiftly rising buoyancy,\
  \ and a savvy diver can adjust her air tank just enough to give her a neutral buoyancy,\
  \ making it much easier to explore underwater. Every 6 gallons of air is enough\
  \ to breathe for roughly 1 minute underwater; it takes far less air for a Medium\
  \ creature to achieve neutral buoyancy unless it's carrying a significant amount\
  \ of metal and other dense material."
