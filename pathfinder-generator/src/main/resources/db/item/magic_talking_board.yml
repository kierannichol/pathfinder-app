description: "This rectangular wooden board displays an arch of alphabetical letters,\
  \ numbers, and short affirmative and negative messages, and comes with a small,\
  \ heart-shaped, three-legged pointer. Though it can be used in place of a mundane\
  \ talking board (such as those used by spiritualists and seance-holders to speak\
  \ to nearby haunts or their own subconscious minds), this item's magical properties\
  \ don't rely on the presence of a haunt or a psychically sensitive individual to\
  \ establish communications. When used for the automatic writing skill unlock in\
  \ place of a mundane talking board, a magic talking board provides a +5 circumstance\
  \ bonus on the Linguistics check.\nOnce per day, a magic talking board can be used\
  \ to call upon the spirit of a single deceased humanoid creature, as the spell call\
  \ spirit. The spirit can attempt a DC 17 Will save to resist the summons; if it's\
  \ successful, a spirit with malevolent intent always takes the place of the intended\
  \ spirit. The spirit does not manifest as a vaporous apparition or speak; its communications\
  \ instead come through the board itself. The spirit answers posed questions by guiding\
  \ the pointer to specific letters at the rate of one word per round for as long\
  \ as the user concentrates. Up to four creatures can use the board simultaneously,\
  \ and the called spirit takes a penalty on its saving throw equal to the number\
  \ of users beyond the first."
