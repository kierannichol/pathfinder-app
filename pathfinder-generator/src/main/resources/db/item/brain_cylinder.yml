description: "A brain cylinder allows the surgically extracted brain of a Large or\
  \ smaller creature to continue to function even after it has been removed from the\
  \ body. Technically, the creature from whom the brain was harvested is dead, but\
  \ as long as the brain remains in the cylinder, the creature can continue to think.\
  \ Dials on the cylinder's side control whether the brain can see, hear, or speak\
  \ using a raspy speaker built into the cylinder's surface. The brain can speak and\
  \ understand any languages it knew in life, and retains the use of the following\
  \ skills at the values it possessed while alive: Appraise, Bluff, Diplomacy, all\
  \ Knowledge skills, Linguistics, Perception, and Sense Motive. It retains no other\
  \ abilities it possessed in life, including purely mental abilities. Mi-go typically\
  \ preserve humanoid brains in this manner when they wish to interrogate a creature\
  \ at a later date, or when they wish to preserve a creature as a resource for consultation\
  \ or research purposes.\nA brain cylinder is usually made of dark metal and has\
  \ hardness 10 and 30 hit points—cylinders made of other materials might have higher\
  \ or lower hardness scores and hit point totals. If a brain cylinder is destroyed,\
  \ the brain within is lost. Likewise, if the creature from which the brain was harvested\
  \ is restored to life, the brain within the cylinder is destroyed, and only powerful\
  \ effects capable of building entirely new bodies can restore to life a creature\
  \ that has had its brain removed. Note that the gp price to create a brain cylinder\
  \ only accounts for the basic creation— the brain of a particularly knowledgeable\
  \ creature could be worth far more than 5,000 gp to some buyers, especially if the\
  \ information contained in the brain is of a particularly sensitive nature."
