description: "Forged from solid steel, this magically animated prosthetic hand is\
  \ elaborately sculpted down to the finest detail. Nargrym's steel hand can be used\
  \ to replace the normal hand of a humanoid creature—it can't be worn in addition\
  \ to an already existing hand. When attached to the wrist stump of a living humanoid\
  \ creature, Nargrym's steel hand magically forms a permanent bond to the wearer's\
  \ flesh and nerves. Once the hand has bonded to the wearer's wrist, the wearer gains\
  \ full control over the hand as if it were part of his own body. The hand has a\
  \ full range of motion and functions as a normal hand. While worn, Nargrym's steel\
  \ hand grants its wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength (treat this as a temporary\
  \ ability bonus for the first 24 hours the hand is worn) and a +5 bonus to CMD against\
  \ disarm attempts. In addition, the wearer can wield weapons of one size category\
  \ larger than the wearer's size without penalty and without altering the weapon's\
  \ designation as a light, one-handed, or twohanded weapon. For example, a Medium\
  \ creature wearing Nargrym's steel hand could wield a Large longspear as a two-handed\
  \ weapon without penalty. However, whenever the wearer of the hand is within line\
  \ of sight of a creature with the giant subtype, he must succeed at DC 15 Will save\
  \ or be compelled to attack the giant, as suggestion. Once bonded to a wearer, Nargrym's\
  \ steel hand cannot be removed except by the wearer or after the wearer's death."
destruction: "Nargrym's steel hand is destroyed if it is smashed by a giant wielding\
  \ a hammer of thunderbolts."
