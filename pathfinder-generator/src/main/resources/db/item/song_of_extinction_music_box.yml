description: "Winding this music box causes it to play a haunting, 30-secondlong melody.\
  \ However, a bard can learn this tune as though it were a masterpiece (Ultimate\
  \ Magic 21). When performed by a bard, the tune becomes the Song of Extinction masterpiece\
  \ (see below). Once per week, as a standard action, the wielder can command the\
  \ music box to perform the Song of Extinction masterpiece itself, affecting all\
  \ within range except the bearer. After being used in this way, the music box cannot\
  \ be reactivated in any way for 1 week."
destruction: "Any creature that makes a successful DC 35 Craft (traps) check while\
  \ manipulating the music box can rig the device to play in reverse once. In this\
  \ way, a bard can learn the Song of Extinction masterpiece, but backwards. Performing\
  \ this reverse version of the Song of Extinction causes the music box to implode,\
  \ but also kills the performer. The performer cannot be brought back to life by\
  \ any means short of divine intervention."
