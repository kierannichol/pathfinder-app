description: "Wearing these form-fitting fingerless black gloves makes the wearer's\
  \ arms and body more flexible. As a swift action, the wearer can lengthen his arms\
  \ for up to 10 rounds per day, gaining an additional 5 feet of reach. These rounds\
  \ need not be consecutive. Attacking with these extended arms is unwieldy, and the\
  \ wearer takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, increasing to –4 if he is using two-handed\
  \ weapons. Even when his limbs aren't extended, the wearer gains a +5 enhancement\
  \ bonus on Escape Artist checks and Acrobatics checks to avoid falling damage. The\
  \ wearer is still able to use hand-based natural attacks such as claws while wearing\
  \ the gloves."
