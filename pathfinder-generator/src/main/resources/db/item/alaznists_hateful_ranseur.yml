description: "Alaznist's Hateful Ranseur is a +3 keen spell-storing wounding adamantine\
  \ ranseur that bears a charred human skull—a representation of Runelord Alderpash's—\
  impaled upon its blade, though this does not impede its use as a weapon. The ranseur\
  \ grants the wielder a +2 luck bonus on attacks, saves, and ability and skill checks.\
  \ On a critical hit, Alaznist's Hateful Ranseur deals 1d4 points of damage to the\
  \ target's Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom—whichever score is the highest. The\
  \ weapon tirelessly threatens destruction and vengeance upon any wielder who is\
  \ not a rightful ruler of Bakrakhan, given its purpose of defeating all others than\
  \ its wielder. The ranseur can cast cure serious wounds and protection from energy\
  \ on its wielder each three times per day, and it can cast lightning bolt three\
  \ times per day."
destruction: "Alaznist's Hateful Ranseur can be destroyed if it is hurled under the\
  \ crushing feet of the Oliphaunt of Jandelay, but only if there is no current Runelord\
  \ of Wrath living in the world."
