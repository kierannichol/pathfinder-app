description: "An axe-gauntlet is a locked gauntlet covering the hand and forearm up\
  \ to and over the elbow, with an axe blade built around the gauntlet's permanently\
  \ closed fist. Axe-gauntlets were developed during the long Quest for Sky, when\
  \ dwarven warriors often had to engage in running fights against larger, stronger\
  \ opponents in areas the dwarves did not intend to ever return to. Losing a weapon\
  \ in such circumstances often made it irretrievable, and the axe-gauntlet became\
  \ popular with rearguard warriors. Though these weapons have seen significantly\
  \ less use since the dwarves reached the surface, some dwarven warriors still appreciate\
  \ the reliability of such designs. An axe-gauntlet takes a full-round action to\
  \ don, and it gives you a +10 bonus to your CMD against disarm attempts. You can't\
  \ use the hand on which an axe-gauntlet is worn for anything else."
