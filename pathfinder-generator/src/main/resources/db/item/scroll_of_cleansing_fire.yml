name: "Scroll of Cleansing Fire"
description: "A ring of fire surrounds the area affected by the spell. The flames\
  \ radiate heat, but not enough to damage adjacent creatures. The flames deal 2d6\
  \ points of fire damage to any creatures that pass through them (or 4d6 points of\
  \ damage to undead creatures). If you manifest a portion of the ring in a square\
  \ that contains a creature, that creature takes damage as if it passed through the\
  \ ring."
