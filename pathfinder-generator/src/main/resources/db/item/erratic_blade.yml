description: "The blade of this +1 transformative scimitar is adorned with gemstones\
  \ that shift in size and coloration. An erratic blade provides the wielder with\
  \ some control over the fickle nature of wild magic. While the scimitar is held\
  \ in the hand, the wielder gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks to prevent a\
  \ spell or spell-like ability from going awry because of a plane's wild magic trait.\
  \ If the wielder's spell or spell-like ability goes awry anyway, he rolls twice\
  \ on Table 2–1: Wild Magic Effects and chooses which result occurs. Also, when an\
  \ erratic blade damages a creature, that creature takes a –4 penalty for 1 round\
  \ on caster level checks to prevent a spell or spell-like ability from going awry\
  \ because of a plane's wild magic trait. The effects of multiple hits from an erratic\
  \ blade don't stack."
