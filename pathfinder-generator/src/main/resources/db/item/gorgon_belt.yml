description: "This belt grants its wearer a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, and\
  \ the ability to ignore difficult terrain while charging or making an overrun, bull\
  \ rush, or trample attempt. Furthermore, once per day on command, its wearer can\
  \ spew a 60-foot cone of poisonous green gas as a breath weapon. Any creature caught\
  \ in the area of the gas can attempt a DC 18 saving throw to resist its effect,\
  \ but if the creature fails the saving throw, it is paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. At\
  \ the end of its turn, a creature petrified by this breath weapon can attempt a\
  \ new save to end the paralysis effect. Treat the enhancement bonus to Strength\
  \ as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn."
