description: "Created in pairs, these simple golden rings allow for short-range communication\
  \ between the wearers. The listed and cost are for both rings. As long as the wearers\
  \ are within 1 mile of one another, they can communicate by whispering, causing\
  \ the other ring to whisper the words to the recipient. Words spoken into or recited\
  \ by a communique ring can be heard by nearby creatures if the wearer speaks too\
  \ loudly. A communique ring transmits sound only while worn, and a wearer can remove\
  \ the ring if she needs to be silent. Only magical silence or distance will block\
  \ this communication, and wearers can speak through walls and other obstructions\
  \ normally. The rings pick up only sound directly spoken into them by the wearer\
  \ with the intent to transmit, not ambient sounds or the voices of other creatures."
