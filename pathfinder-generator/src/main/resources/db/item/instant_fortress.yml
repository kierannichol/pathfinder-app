description: "This metal cube is small, but when activated by speaking a command word\
  \ it grows to form a tower 20 feet square and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on\
  \ all sides and a crenellated battlement atop it. The metal walls extend 10 feet\
  \ into the ground, rooting it to the spot and preventing it from being tipped over.\
  \ The fortress has a small door that opens only at the command of the owner of the\
  \ fortressâ€”even knock spells can't open the door.\nThe adamantine walls of an instant\
  \ fortress have 100 hit points and hardness 20. The fortress cannot be repaired\
  \ except by a wish or a miracle, which restores 50 points of damage taken.\nThe\
  \ fortress springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the device's owner.\
  \ The door opens and closes instantly at his command. People and creatures nearby\
  \ (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress's sudden growth.\
  \ Anyone so caught takes 10d10 points of damage (Reflex DC 19 halves).\nThe fortress\
  \ is deactivated by speaking a command word (different from the one used to activate\
  \ it). It cannot be deactivated unless it is empty."
