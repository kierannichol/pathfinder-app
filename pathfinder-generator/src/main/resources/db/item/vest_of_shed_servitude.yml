description: "This pale leather vest's surface is decorated with a web of veinlike\
  \ ridges. Once per day as an immediate action when you are struck by a critical\
  \ hit or sneak attack, your shed blood or flesh coagulates into a short-lived guardian\
  \ that appears in any adjacent square and follows your commands. This guardian has\
  \ all the abilities of a homunculus, except that its type is undead. If the triggering\
  \ attack inflicted bleed damage, the homunculus also gains the giant simple template.\
  \ This homunculus lasts for 7 rounds before melting, and it doesn't deal damage\
  \ to you when it's destroyed."
