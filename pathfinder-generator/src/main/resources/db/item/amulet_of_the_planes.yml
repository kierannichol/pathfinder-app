description: "This device usually appears to be a black circular amulet, although\
  \ any character looking closely at it sees a dark, moving swirl of color. The amulet\
  \ allows its wearer to utilize the spell plane shift. However, this is a difficult\
  \ item to master. The user must make a DC 15 Intelligence check in order to get\
  \ the amulet to take her to the plane (and the specific location on that plane)\
  \ that she desires. If she fails, the amulet transports her and all those traveling\
  \ with her to a random location on that plane (01–60 on d%) or to a random plane\
  \ (61–100)."
