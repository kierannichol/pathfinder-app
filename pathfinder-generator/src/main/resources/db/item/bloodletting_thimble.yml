description: "This platinum thimble, intricately crafted in the shape of an animal\
  \ claw, is worn on one finger. A vampire wearer can use the thimble to inflict a\
  \ tiny wound as part of the use of a blood drain, energy drain, or drain chi ability;\
  \ use of the thimble in this way isn't an action. This wound deals no additional\
  \ damage, but it turns the target's pain to pleasure. The target must succeed at\
  \ a DC 14 Will save or become fascinated by the wearer and make no attempt to resist\
  \ the draining on that round and the following 2 rounds. At the end of this time,\
  \ the creature's senses return and it can react accordingly."
