description: "This roll of flexible green leather can be easily wrapped around the\
  \ stump of a severed limb (a finger, toe, hand, foot, arm, leg, tail, or even neck—\
  though the last works only in the case of multi-headed creatures). The body part\
  \ regrows over a period of 24 hours as long as the trollskin tourniquet is not removed.\
  \ While a creature wears a trollskin tourniquet, it does not need to remain entirely\
  \ still. However, if it sustain an amount of hit points of damage equal to or greater\
  \ than 3 × its Hit Dice, the tourniquet is jostled out of position and must be reset.\
  \ This also resets the regrowth time period required; the tourniquet must remain\
  \ on the stump for 24 hours from the time it was reset to regrow the limb.\nWhile\
  \ a trollskin tourniquet can't restore a dead creature to life, it can repair a\
  \ corpse to make it easier to resurrect. This requires at least a partially whole\
  \ decomposed or skeletonized inanimate corpse, and the tourniquet must be placed\
  \ around an intact limb, the chest, or some other portion of the corpse. The corpse\
  \ regenerates over a period of 24 hours as long as the trollskin tourniquet is not\
  \ removed (if the tourniquet is jostled, the regrowth time resets, as described\
  \ above with regard to a living creature). At the end of this time, the corpse becomes\
  \ whole and any missing parts are restored. The deceased creature is treated as\
  \ having been dead for no more than 1 day for the purposes of resurrection magic.\
  \ Each trollskin tourniquet is usable once."
