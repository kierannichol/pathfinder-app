description: "This unusual type of immovable rod has a button near each end, and it\
  \ can be activated only by two separate creatures, each one pressing a button while\
  \ speaking a different command word. Once set in place, it can only be moved by\
  \ the same method. A creature using a Strength check to move the inviolate marker\
  \ risks being affected by a bestow curse effect (â€“6 Str; Will DC 16 negates and\
  \ grants the creature immunity to the curse effect for 24 hours).\nAn inviolate\
  \ marker projects an illusory banner or crest from each side, each chosen by the\
  \ creature that activated it, and is used to demarcate territorial boundaries. If\
  \ an inviolate marker would be buried by a change in the landscape or environment,\
  \ the marker teleports to the surface of the newly formed terrain in order to maintain\
  \ its position relative to the new terrain."
