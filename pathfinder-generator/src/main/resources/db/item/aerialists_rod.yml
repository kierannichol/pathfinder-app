description: "A small, metal loop caps each end of this well-worn, 2-foot-long brass\
  \ rod. Pressing on each of three smooth studs on the rod's surface activates a different\
  \ special ability. Pressing a stud a second time collapses the rod back into its\
  \ ordinary form.\nBalancing Pole: The rod extends to 7 feet in length and grants\
  \ its holder a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks and a +3 enhancement bonus\
  \ on Reflex saving throws. The user must hold the rod in both hands to gain these\
  \ bonuses, and they apply only on checks and saving throws related to maintaining\
  \ balance. In this form, the rod also acts as a masterwork quarterstaff.\nTightrope:\
  \ A line of rope lashes out from each end of the rod, anchoring to create a horizontal\
  \ tightrope up to 100 feet long. Characters can traverse the tightrope by hanging\
  \ below it with a successful DC 15 Climb check, or walking atop it with a successful\
  \ DC 20 Acrobatics check.\nTrapeze: Two lines of rope fly from the ends of the rod\
  \ and anchor in a ceiling up to 40 feet overhead. Using the trapeze requires a successful\
  \ DC 10 Acrobatics check and allows the user to traverse gaps up to 50 feet wide.\
  \ If the user is trying to go farther than 50 feet, she can attempt to jump upon\
  \ releasing her grip. The trapeze counts as a running start for the purposes of\
  \ performing a long jump, and grants the user a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics\
  \ checks to determine how far she can jump. When the user is outdoors, this ability\
  \ functions only if there are branches, buildings, or other overhangs to which the\
  \ trapeze can attach."
