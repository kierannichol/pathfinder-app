description: "This thick, smooth leather collar is made from delicate but sturdy panels\
  \ of calfskin and has a dainty green gem dangling from its center in an elaborate\
  \ golden setting. The gem glows when poisons or toxins are within 10 feet of the\
  \ wearer. Additionally, as a swift action after failing a saving throw against a\
  \ poison, the wearer can pull the gem from the collar and crush it, which allows\
  \ her to reroll the saving throw against the poison with a +2 competence bonus.\
  \ The wearer must take the second roll, even if it is worse. Activating this ability\
  \ destroys the collar."
