description: "Commonly used by Erutaki hunters and whalers, this +1 harpoon is wrapped\
  \ in fur, and several small gourds dangle from the weapon and the rope attached\
  \ to it. If the wielder uses the harpoon to successfully grapple a creature, he\
  \ can, as a swift action, command the harpoon to hinder the creature's movement.\
  \ The grappled creature must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be slowed (as the slow\
  \ spell) and forced to surface if underwater, remaining unable to submerge for the\
  \ duration of the effect. The slow effect lasts until the grappled condition ends.\
  \ Hunters often decorate their harpoons in colorful baubles to help them stand out\
  \ in icy waters, but these adornments don't impact the weapon's buoyancy."
