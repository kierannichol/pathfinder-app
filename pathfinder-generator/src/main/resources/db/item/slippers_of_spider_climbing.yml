description: "When worn, a pair of these slippers enables movement on vertical surfaces\
  \ or even upside down along ceilings, leaving the wearer's hands free. Her climb\
  \ speed is 20 feet. Severely slippery surfaces—icy, oiled, or greased surfaces—\
  make these slippers useless. The slippers can be used for 10 minutes per day, split\
  \ up as the wearer chooses (minimum 1 minute per use)."
