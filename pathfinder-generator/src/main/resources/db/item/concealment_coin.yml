description: "A concealment coin appears in all respects like a typical coin of the\
  \ realm and is often crafted from an ordinary coinâ€”though for soft metals like gold,\
  \ the coin is typically made with an iron or steel interior and then plated with\
  \ the more valuable metal. Twisting the coin along its edge unscrews the two halves,\
  \ revealing a thin, hollow space inside. Such coins are often used to hide small\
  \ messages written on very fine paper for covert delivery. Noticing a concealment\
  \ coin's true nature requires a successful DC 25 Perception check."
