description: "An elaborately carved stopper caps this black gourd. It was once a decanter\
  \ of endless water, but the bottle's magic has been warped by the daemon spirit\
  \ trapped within. The Calabash of Last Draughts can be slung over a creature's chest\
  \ with its leather strap, and grants a +2 profane bonus to Intelligence when worn.\
  \ Five times per day, the wearer can unstopper the bottle and splash a creature\
  \ with the tainted water within as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet.\
  \ A successful attack deals 1d4 points of Intelligence damage as the waters wipe\
  \ away a creature's memories and sense of self. A successful DC 18 Will save reduces\
  \ this Intelligence damage by half. If a target is helpless or willing, the wearer\
  \ can instead unstopper the calabash and feed the target its tainted waters, either\
  \ dealing 2d4 points of Intelligence damage or allowing the wearer to change or\
  \ eliminate the target's memories as per the modify memory spell.\nThe Calabash\
  \ of Last Draughts also erodes an outsider's connection to the physical world. If\
  \ a possessing creature's Intelligence is reduced to 1 or lower in this way, it\
  \ is immediately exorcised from its host's body.\nUpon picking up the Calabash of\
  \ Last Draughts, a creature must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or immediately drink\
  \ from the accursed gourd."
destruction: "The Calabash of Last Draughts must be filled with water from the Progenitor\
  \ Wave at the heart of the Sea of No Shadows in Nirvana, then dashed against the\
  \ shores of the Mere of Broken Angels in Abaddon."
