name: "Potion of Sanctify Corpse"
description: "This spell blesses a corpse with positive energy, preventing it from\
  \ being turned into an undead creature. Attempts to raise the corpse as an undead\
  \ automatically fail. If the corpse is of a person slain by a creature that creates\
  \ undead out of its slain foes (such as a shadow, vampire, or wraith), that effect\
  \ is delayed until the end of this spell. It is possible to protect a corpse for\
  \ an extended time by casting this spell each day."
