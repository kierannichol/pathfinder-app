description: "This unassuming +1 buckler has an array of small tools and implements\
  \ embedded into the backside of its rim, able to be folded and snapped out for use\
  \ at a moment's notice to attack, defend, or accomplish roguish tasks. A burglar's\
  \ buckler grants the wielder a +2 competence bonus on Disable Device and Sleight\
  \ of Hand checks, combat maneuver checks made to perform dirty tricks, and to CMD\
  \ against dirty tricks.\nOnce per day on command, the wielder may transform a burglar's\
  \ buckler into any mundane tool weighing 1 to 5 pounds, such as a crowbar, hammer,\
  \ saw, small shovel, grappling hook, artisan's tools, or thieves' tools. The burglar's\
  \ buckler retains its normal hardness and hit points in this form and can be converted\
  \ back into shield form on command."
