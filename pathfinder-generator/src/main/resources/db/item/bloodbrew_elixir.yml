description: "This ruby red wine carries an aroma of fresh-spilled blood with a persistent\
  \ finish tasting of iron and scarberries. Anyone who drinks the concoction gains\
  \ 1d10+3 temporary hit points for 1 hour. In addition, an enslaved vampire or vampire\
  \ spawn who drinks the elixir is freed from its creator's control for 1 hour, becoming\
  \ a free-willed undead creature for that time. At the end of the hour, the vampire\
  \ is once again enslaved under its creator's control.\nBloodbrew elixir is highly\
  \ addictive to vampires, and any vampire who drinks it must make a DC 20 Fortitude\
  \ save or become addicted to the bloodbrew. Thereafter, the vampire must drink a\
  \ new dose of bloodbrew every day, or take a –2 penalty to Dex, Con, Str, and Wis\
  \ and lose her fast healing ability, until a new dose is taken. The addiction can\
  \ only be cured with greater restoration, or the vampire must make three consecutive\
  \ saves, one per day, against the elixir's DC, after a day of not taking the drug.\
  \ Should the vampire take a new dose of the elixir before the addiction is cured,\
  \ any past successful saves are negated.\nA living creature who drinks the elixir\
  \ gains the temporary hit points, but takes a –2 penalty on saves against energy\
  \ drain and negative energy effects, including channeled negative energy, for 1\
  \ hour. Bloodbrew elixir is not addictive to living creatures."
