description: "This +1 leather armor usually looks like heavy protective work clothing,\
  \ such as the garb of a professional blacksmith, butcher, or woodcutter. Once per\
  \ day when an adjacent ally falls unconscious, the wearer can use cure light wounds\
  \ on that ally as a swift action; if the wearer falls unconscious and this ability\
  \ has not already been expended for the day, it automatically triggers on the wearer."
