description: "The Shackles are rife with tales of legendary treasures, but the story\
  \ of the loss of Aiger's Kiss has seen a resurgence of late, it being the 25th anniversary\
  \ of the blade's loss in the Black Tower near the Cannibal Isles. Wielded before\
  \ that loss by Captain Tevenida Aiger—and rumored to have been given to her by Norgorber's\
  \ herald as a reward for an unknown task— Aiger's Kiss is said to have been a particularly\
  \ potent weapon against outsiders. In addition to being a notorious pirate captain,\
  \ Tevenida Aiger was a priestess of Norgorber, and her specialty was the capture\
  \ of Chelish warships, particularly those employing devils or other extraplanar\
  \ defenses. Some whisper that Captain Aiger and her sword vanished in the Black\
  \ Tower due to a Chelish trap set in the structure, but in fact her fate was much\
  \ grimmer than that (see Part Three of \"The Price of Infamy\" for details).\nAiger's\
  \ Kiss is a short sword of the planes (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 477). Three\
  \ times per day, it can be used to cast dimensional anchor on a creature the sword\
  \ has just struck— activating this effect is a swift action for the sword's wielder.\
  \ If the strike is a critical hit, the effect gains a +10 bonus on its caster level\
  \ check to penetrate the target's spell resistance, if any.\nThe weapon's greatest\
  \ power, though, is its ability to destroy portals or seal planar rifts. Once per\
  \ year, Aiger's Kiss can be plunged into an extraplanar portal as a standard action—\
  doing so immediately results in two effects. First, it targets the portal with a\
  \ mage's disjunction (this effect lasts for as long as the sword remains in the\
  \ portal). Second, as long as the sword remains lodged in the portal, it becomes\
  \ affected by an antipathy effect against all outsiders. Once removed from a portal,\
  \ it takes the sword a year to build up its magic to be able to use this ability\
  \ again."
destruction: "If Aiger's Kiss is used to attempt to seal a planar rift from the Material\
  \ Plane to an extraplanar realm under Norgorber's control, the sword is immediately\
  \ destroyed and the planar rift is unharmed—in fact, doing so immediately summons\
  \ the herald of Norgorber to the site to claim the fragments of the sword and punish\
  \ those who destroyed it."
