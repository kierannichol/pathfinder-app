description: "Made from a large dragon bone, wrapped in scales and topped with the\
  \ fearsome image of a dragon, this staff radiates power. Each dragon staff is linked\
  \ to one type of chromatic dragon: black, blue, green, red, or white. All the spells\
  \ that can be cast using the staff are tied to that choice. If the wielder uses\
  \ the staff to cast form of the dragon II, she must assume the type linked to the\
  \ staff. Any energy types chosen by spells from the staff must match the type as\
  \ well (black and green are linked to acid, blue is linked to electricity, red is\
  \ linked to fire, and white is linked to cold). The staff allows use of the following\
  \ spells:"
