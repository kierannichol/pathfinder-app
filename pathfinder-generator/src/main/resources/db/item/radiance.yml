description: "In 4692 AR, soon after the start of the Fourth Crusade, a paladin of\
  \ Iomedae and renowned demon slayer named Yaniel spoke out against the Mendevian\
  \ crusaders, accusing them of negligence and sloth, and claiming these faults were\
  \ what allowed Khorramzadeh to invade Kenabres and damage the wardstone. Her accusations\
  \ cut too close to the truth, and in a moment of weakness her superiors threatened\
  \ to excommunicate her. Instead, she said she would enter the Worldwound and fight\
  \ the Fourth Crusade on her own, with only her magic sword Radiance for company.\
  \ The church was happy to see Yaniel go, and in the 2 years that followed, she was\
  \ thought to have been slain. Yet when she returned to Kenabres in 4694 AR, leading\
  \ a small army of crusaders she'd rescued, both Yaniel and her superiors had changed.\
  \ For her part, Yaniel had shed her pride and insubordination, and had gained a\
  \ new appreciation for the difficult decisions leaders are forced to make. And the\
  \ church leaders had learned that sometimes the truth is exactly what you need to\
  \ hear. Alas, Yaniel was assassinated before the year was out, slain by the lilitu\
  \ demon Minagho only a week into her second personal crusade. Her followers managed\
  \ to return to Kenabres with Radiance, but Yaniel's body had been taken. The sword\
  \ had gone dark after Yaniel's death, its magical powers apparently lost, and so\
  \ the crusaders elected to place it in the Gray Garrison on display. Yet several\
  \ months ago it was stolen by the Templars of the Ivory Labyrinth, who plan to soon\
  \ send the sword north to Drezen for corruption into a weapon of evil.\nRadiance\
  \ was once a powerful weapon, yet since Yaniel's death the blade has become inert.\
  \ When handled by a paladin, however, the blade suddenly glows with golden light\
  \ and functions as a +1 cold iron longsword that radiates light as a torch on command.\
  \ The weapon shifts and changes its form to match the paladin's deity's favored\
  \ weapon (in the hands of a paladin who doesn't worship a deity, the weapon remains\
  \ a +1 longsword). Certain events and tasks can awaken Radiance's latent powers,\
  \ eventually transforming it into a full-fledged holy avenger—these events are noted\
  \ in the following adventures in Wrath of the Righteous as they occur.\nIn addition,\
  \ Radiance is a legendary item (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 169) that bonds\
  \ with a mythic paladin a s soon as it is wielded in combat—in this adventure, Radiance\
  \ bonds if a paladin uses it in the final encounter against Vorlesh's babaus. The\
  \ weapon has two daily uses of legendary power that recharge each day, but does\
  \ not currently possess any legendary attributes, for it has yet to be wielded by\
  \ a mythic paladin. As Radiance has its own ability to grow in power, it cannot\
  \ be given the upgradable legendary item ability."
destruction: "A paladin must knowingly slay an angel with the blade, at which point\
  \ the sword can be destroyed normally with damage."
