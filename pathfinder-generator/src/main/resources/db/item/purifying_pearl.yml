description: "A favored tool of diplomats and those tasked with protecting the lives\
  \ of regents and other important people, this small luminescent white pearl purifies\
  \ putridity and poison in two ways. First, up to 10 cubic feet of food or drink\
  \ that it touches per day is affected as if a purify food and drink spell had been\
  \ cast upon the food or drink. Second, once per day, if placed in the mouth of a\
  \ creature (as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity), the pearl\
  \ acts as a neutralize poison spell cast on that creature (caster level 10th)."
