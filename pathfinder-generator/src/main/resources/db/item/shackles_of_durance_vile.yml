description: "These masterwork iron manacles sap the will of their wearer. When they\
  \ are attached to a humanoid creature as their command word is spoken, they affect\
  \ their prisoner with a dominate person spell, except that if the prisoner fails\
  \ its saving throw, the effect lasts for as long as the shackles are attached. Removing\
  \ or destroying the shackles immediately breaks the enchantment. The shackles can\
  \ be so used once per day. Shackles of durance vile can only be activated against\
  \ a helpless, restrained, or willing creature; if attached to a creature still able\
  \ to resist they function only as manacles, albeit superior ones. Shackles of durance\
  \ vile have hardness 15, 20 hit points, and a superior lock. They have a break DC\
  \ of 30 and an Escape Artist DC of 35."
