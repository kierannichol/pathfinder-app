description: "Roughly the size of a saucer, this thin ceramic disc is painted red\
  \ and marked with an inverted pentagram, the unholy symbol of Asmodeus. A pentacle\
  \ token must first be attuned to a devil by touching the token to a devil as a standard\
  \ action. A single pentacle token can be attuned to one devil of CR 9 or higher,\
  \ or up to five devils of CR 8 or lower. An individual devil can be attuned to only\
  \ one pentacle token at a time. Attuning a pentacle token to additional devils beyond\
  \ these limits replaces earlier attunements, starting with the earliest attunement.\n\
  An attuned pentacle token can be broken as a standard action, immediately alerting\
  \ all devils attuned to that token of the owner's location and the distance and\
  \ direction to it. If the devil has the greater teleport spell-like ability, it\
  \ can use that ability as an immediate action to transport itself to a square adjacent\
  \ to the broken pentacle token. Teleporting to the token's location in this way\
  \ increases the devil's damage reduction by 5 (for example, from DR 10/good to DR\
  \ 15/good) for 1 hour (if the devil does not already have damage reduction, it gains\
  \ DR 5/good for 1 hour). The creature breaking a pentacle token has no control over\
  \ or command of any devils attuned to that token. Once a pentacle token is broken,\
  \ it loses its magic and cannot be used again."
