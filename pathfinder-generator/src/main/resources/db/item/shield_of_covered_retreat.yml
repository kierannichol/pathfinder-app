description: "A shield of covered retreat is a wide wooden kite shield emblazoned\
  \ with the image of a mighty tree, the original design of which is thought to come\
  \ from Nirmathas. Three times per day as a swift action, the bearer of this +1 arrow\
  \ deflection heavy wooden shield can select a single square within 5 feet (including\
  \ the square occupied by the bearer) and extend a barrier of protective force around\
  \ the square that lasts for 1d4 rounds. The barrier appears as a shimmer in the\
  \ air, but it does not impede vision, movement, or other actions. As long as this\
  \ barrier is in place, the creature occupying the square can stand up from prone\
  \ or leave the square without provoking attacks of opportunity, even if the square\
  \ is threatened by another creature. Other actions provoke attacks of opportunity\
  \ as normal. Large or larger creatures cannot benefit from this effect. A creature\
  \ occupying the square is not hindered by the barrier and may make attacks of opportunity\
  \ normally."
