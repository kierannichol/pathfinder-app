description: "Similar to sunrods, these small white pebbles are alchemically treated\
  \ so that they shed a soft light once activated by striking them together. The glow\
  \ is faintâ€”just barely enough to illuminate the stone. Though not bright enough\
  \ to serve as an effective light source, they can be placed in patterns to create\
  \ messages or laid out in a path, marking it for others to follow."
