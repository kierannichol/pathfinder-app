description: "Unlike with most rods, one end of this rod curls and twists back on\
  \ itself in a crookâ€”the tip of this crook sometimes looks like the head of a snake.\
  \ The rod itself is about 4 feet long and weighs 10 pounds. It strikes as a +1/+1\
  \ quarterstaff. If the user throws the rod to the ground (a standard action), it\
  \ grows to become a constrictor snake by the end of the round. The python obeys\
  \ all commands of the owner. (In animal form, it retains the +1 enhancement bonus\
  \ on attack and damage rolls possessed by the rod form.) The serpent returns to\
  \ rod form (a full-round action) whenever the wielder desires, or whenever it moves\
  \ farther than 100 feet from the owner. If the snake form is slain, it returns to\
  \ rod form and cannot be activated again for 3 days. A rod of the python only functions\
  \ if the possessor is good."
