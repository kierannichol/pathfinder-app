description: "About half again the size of a standard wayfinder, a wayfinder of the\
  \ stars features an extra outer ring around the normal directional compass in the\
  \ center. Embedded into this outer ring are 13 semi-precious stones, each representing\
  \ one major celestial body of Golarion's solar system.\nAt will, the owner can speak\
  \ the item's command word to cause the wayfinder 's compass needle to stop pointing\
  \ north and instead indicate the direction of the nearest active interplanetary\
  \ portal within 500 miles. If no such portal is within range, the compass needle\
  \ hangs listlessly. A second command word causes the wayfinder of the stars to once\
  \ again function as a basic wayfinder.\nOnce per day, the owner can touch one of\
  \ the semi-precious stones on the wayfinder of the stars to teleport her and any\
  \ willing creatures touching her to a safe location on the indicated planet, as\
  \ interplanetary teleport."
