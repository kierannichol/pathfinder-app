description: "Each yithian thought ring is attuned to a particular type or category\
  \ of creature, and this decision is made at the item's creation. This can go beyond\
  \ simple creature typesâ€”a yithian thought ring can be made to function for very\
  \ specific conditions. For example, the one in this adventure is keyed into minds\
  \ that have been exposed to Xhamen-Dor, which is how Kaklatath was able to reach\
  \ out across great distances to the PCs. A yithian wearing one of these devices\
  \ can also use its mind swap and amnesia abilities at the same range.\nOnce a yithian\
  \ thought ring has been created with a particular parameter, it can be attuned again,\
  \ but this process requires partially dismantling the original device and rebuilding\
  \ it. This process takes 1d4 days and costs an additional 5,000 gp in materials.\n\
  A yithian thought ring can be used only by yithians."
