description: "This Large +4 adamantine heavy pick has a haft of petrified bone and\
  \ a head of crudely formed adamantine. Blancher is unusually heavy and must be wielded\
  \ with two hands, but it deals damage as if it were a Huge weapon rather than a\
  \ Large weapon. On a successful critical hit, it deals 1d12 points of bleed damage\
  \ (this bleed damage does not stack with multiple hits) and 1d3 points of Charisma\
  \ damage as the victim's flesh, hair, and eyes are blanched and whitened."
