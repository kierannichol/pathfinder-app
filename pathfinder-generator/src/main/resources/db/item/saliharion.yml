description: "Named for Nashina aj-Salihar, the Sarenite monk who penned the original\
  \ work, this hefty tome contains inspiring parables, simple folk remedies for widespread\
  \ illnesses and injuries, and helpful hints for dealing with common monsters. Its\
  \ pages are expertly illuminated with brilliant inks and metallic foil, depicting\
  \ scenes of angels battling various monstrosities. While in possession of this book,\
  \ the owner gains a +2 sacred bonus on Heal checks and Knowledge skill checks to\
  \ identify the abilities and weaknesses of monsters.\nIf Sarenrae is the owner's\
  \ patron, the owner may instead choose to gain a sacred bonus equal to her Wisdom\
  \ or Charisma modifier on these skill checks instead of the normal +2 bonus."
