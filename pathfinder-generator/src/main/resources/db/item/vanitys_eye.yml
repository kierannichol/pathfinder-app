description: "This pair of fine, silver hand mirrors secretly steals the confidence\
  \ and finesse of one bearer and transfers them to another. Two distinct components\
  \ make up vanity's eye: a silver hand mirror set with flawless glass (the master)\
  \ and a silver hand mirror set with slightly warped glass (the slave).\nThe mirrors\
  \ have no effect until one looks into the slave mirror. Once a creature looks into\
  \ the slave mirror, it must make a DC 20 Will save or be deceived by the mirror\
  \ into believing that it has magically made him more dashing, suave, and glib. In\
  \ truth, however, the slave mirror is cursed and steals the bearer's Charisma, causing\
  \ him to take a â€“6 penalty to his Charisma score. The bearer is unaware of this\
  \ penalty, and will not willingly part with the magical mirror. This penalty persists\
  \ for as long as the mirror's curse lasts. Should the mirror be lost or taken, the\
  \ bearer does all he can to retrieve the mirror. Only break enchantment, limited\
  \ wish, remove curse, miracle, or wish can make the mirror's holder willingly part\
  \ with the item and return his stolen Charisma. Breaking the slave mirror also restores\
  \ the victim's Charisma. The slave mirror can only affect one creature at a time\
  \ and has no affect on other creatures that look into it.\nFor as long as the slave\
  \ mirror imposes a Charisma penalty upon a victim, the bearer of the master mirror\
  \ gains a +6 enhancement bonus to his Charisma. This bonus applies as long as the\
  \ master mirror's bearer is within 10 feet of the mirror. If the master mirror is\
  \ destroyed, its bearer loses this bonus and the slave mirror is rendered inert,\
  \ freeing any victim and restoring his Charisma."
