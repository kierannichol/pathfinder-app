description: "This amulet of gold and red crystal grants the wearer a +5 enhancement\
  \ bonus to her natural armor. In addition, the wearer becomes attuned to both the\
  \ runewell of greed and the soul lens that controls it—allowing the wearer to benefit\
  \ from the fragmentary souls gathered and absorbed by the runewell. As long as the\
  \ runewell functions, the wearer does not age and has no need for food or water.\
  \ In addition, she can fly at a speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability and\
  \ gains fast healing 10. If the runewell amulet is removed, the wearer loses all\
  \ of these abilities. While this does mean the wearer begins aging normally and\
  \ must eat and drink, she does not suffer any ill effect from the years that passed\
  \ or the meals she missed while she wore the amulet."
destruction: "A runewell amulet must be thrown into an active runewell of an opposing\
  \ magic (a runewell of lust or a runewell of pride in the case of this particular\
  \ amulet)—doing so causes the amulet to shatter into four fragments, which then\
  \ scatter throughout the region that was once Thassilon. If these four fragments\
  \ can be gathered and placed back in the associated runewell (the runewell of greed\
  \ in this case), the amulet reforms and returns to full use."
