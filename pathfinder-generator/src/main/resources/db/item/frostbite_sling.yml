description: "This +1 frost sling is crafted of blue-dyed leather. In lieu of adding\
  \ cold damage to normal ammunition, three times per day wielder may create and hurl\
  \ a magical snowball with the sling instead. This ranged touch attack has a maximum\
  \ range of 40 feet, deals 1d6+6 points of nonlethal cold damage, and leaves the\
  \ target fatigued. The fatigued condition ends when the target recovers from the\
  \ nonlethal damage. This effect cannot make the target exhausted even if it is already\
  \ fatigued."
