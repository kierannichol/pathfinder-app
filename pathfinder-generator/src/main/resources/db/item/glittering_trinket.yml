description: "Though actually made of cheap tin and colored glass, this adornment\
  \ appears to be a beautiful and expensive piece of jewelry worth 1,000 gp. A glittering\
  \ trinket can come in the form of a necklace (using the neck item slot), a bracelet\
  \ (taking up the wrists slot), a belt buckle (taking the waist slot), or a ring\
  \ (taking up one ring slot). The trinket's inflated price affects only people's\
  \ opinion of the wearer. It uses its actual price and cost for any abilities or\
  \ effects that depend on the item having a certain value. Anyone who physically\
  \ interacts with a glittering trinket can attempt a DC 11 Will save to disbelieve\
  \ the illusion, and a successful DC 20 Appraise check identifies it as false. Because\
  \ of these factors, selling the trinket—especially to a merchant—rarely fetches\
  \ the inflated price."
