description: "These leather gauntlets grant the wearer a +2 morale bonus on unarmed\
  \ strikes, natural attacks, and combat maneuver checks versus creatures with the\
  \ change shape special ability or similar abilities that allow it to change shape\
  \ at will. While the wearer has such a creature grappled or pinned, it cannot use\
  \ any shape-changing spells or abilities unless it succeeds at a concentration check;\
  \ the DC of this check is 4 + the DC of casting the spell while grappled. If the\
  \ wearer has such a creature pinned, a successful grapple check allows him to force\
  \ the target into a specific shape it can take naturally (without the use of a spell).\
  \ this involuntary transformation only forces the creature into a shape it is normally\
  \ capable of and does not cost the creature an action."
