description: "Also known as a signal whistle, a whistle's piercing report can be clearly\
  \ heard (DC 0) up to half a mile away. With a DC 5 Perform (wind instruments) check\
  \ you can use it to signal the same sorts of situations as signal horns (see page\
  \ 8). For each additional quarter mile, Perception checks to hear a whistle suffer\
  \ a –2 penalty."
