description: "This finely constructed mask of colored cloth and carved bone incorporates\
  \ parts of the animal it represents, such as its hair, hide, horn, fur, and teeth.\
  \ Depicting the head of an ape, bear, boar, cat, fox, horse, pig, rat, or wolf,\
  \ the mask completely covers the wearer's face, but the wearer can see through the\
  \ mask's eyes as though they were her own.\nAs a swift action, the wearer can transform\
  \ her head into the form of the animal depicted by the mask for up to 5 minutes\
  \ per day, absorbing the mask into her body in the process but leaving in place\
  \ any other item she wears on her head. While so transformed, the wearer retains\
  \ the ability to speak normally and can complete verbal spell components, utter\
  \ command words, and activate spell-completion and spell-trigger items. She also\
  \ gains low-light vision, scent, and either a bite or gore attack (as appropriate\
  \ to the animal) that deals 1d4 points of damage for a Medium wearer (1d3 if Small).\n\
  This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments."
