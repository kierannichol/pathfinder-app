description: "Ancestor worship is common among the peoples of the Mwangi Expanse,\
  \ and many display wooden planks in their homes that contain depictions of enormous\
  \ trees with the names of their ancestors carved onto branches. Ancestry planks\
  \ made of darkwood are much lighter and smaller than their conventional counterparts,\
  \ which make them appealing to Mwangi adventurers looking to honor their lineages\
  \ while venturing away from home. Many from the Mwangi Expanse recognize the difficulty\
  \ in obtaining darkwood and view those who carry darkwood ancestry planks with respect."
