description: "This pistol has six barrels instead of one. The entire barrel housing\
  \ can be quickly rotated by hand between shots (a free action requiring one free\
  \ hand), allowing all six bullets to be fired before the weapon must be reloaded.\
  \ Each barrel of a pepperbox uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or\
  \ a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm."
