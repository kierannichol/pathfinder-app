description: "Sculpted into the intricate form of a golden cacodaemon, this ring's\
  \ wide-open mouth is designed to hold a soul gem created by a cacodaemon. The ring\
  \ allows its wearer to tap into the residual memories of the mangled soul it encapsulates.\
  \ Once per day, the wearer may interrogate the soul in the gem, similar to using\
  \ speak with dead, except the soul answers telepathically.\nOnce per day, the bearer\
  \ can project the soul's last tormented moments before it was consumed and bound,\
  \ creating a cone of terror equivalent to a fear spell (DC 16)."
