description: "Only Large or larger creatures can wear these sturdy leather gauntlets.\
  \ If the wearer has the rock catching ability (Bestiary 303), the Reflex DC to catch\
  \ rocks is reduced by 5 while she's wearing the gauntlets. Furthermore, the wearer\
  \ can attempt to catch a thrown rock of which she's unaware, but doesn't benefit\
  \ from the DC reduction granted by the primary function of the gauntlets. If the\
  \ wearer does not have the rock catching ability, these gauntlets bestow that ability\
  \ on the wearer instead of their normal effects."
