name: "Wand of Alter Musical Instrument"
description: "You alter an instrument so it sounds like a different kind of instrument\
  \ you are familiar with. The change could be minor (such as making a lute sound\
  \ like a guitar) or major (making a keyboard sound like drums). All other aspects\
  \ of the instrument--such as volume, pitch, and how it is played-- are unchanged.\
  \ For example, a piccolo made to sound like an organ is no louder than a normal\
  \ piccolo, can produce only high notes in the piccolo range, and is a wind instrument."
