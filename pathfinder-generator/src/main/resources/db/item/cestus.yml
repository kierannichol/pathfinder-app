description: "The cestus is a glove of leather or thick cloth that covers the wielder\
  \ from mid-finger to mid-forearm. The close combat weapon is reinforced with metal\
  \ plates over the fingers and often lined with wicked spikes along the backs of\
  \ the hands and wrists. While wearing a cestus, you are considered armed and your\
  \ unarmed attacks deal lethal damage. If you are proficient with a cestus, you can\
  \ have your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning or piercing damage. Monks are proficient\
  \ with the cestus. When using a cestus, your fingers are mostly exposed, allowing\
  \ you to wield or carry items in that hand, but the constriction of the weapon at\
  \ your knuckles gives you a â€“2 penalty on all precision-based tasks involving that\
  \ hand (such as opening locks). A cestus can't be disarmed."
