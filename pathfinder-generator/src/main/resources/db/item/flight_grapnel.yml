description: "This masterfully crafted grappling hook sports hinged flukes that collapse\
  \ down to the sides of the hook's base. A collapsed flight grapnel is thrown like\
  \ a dart (typically while attached to rope), and the flukes spring out only when\
  \ it strikes a solid object. This makes the grappling hook more aerodynamic, though\
  \ heavier. A flight grapnel acts as a grappling hook in all ways, except it's treated\
  \ as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet."
