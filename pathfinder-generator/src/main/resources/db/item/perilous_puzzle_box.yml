description: "Brass latticework decorates the faces of this cubical mahogany puzzle\
  \ box. While in its solved configuration, the puzzle box is safe to open and close,\
  \ and the user can access an extradimensional compartment that can store up to 10\
  \ pounds of objects. The user can store a single touch spell of 4th level or lower\
  \ in the box by casting the spell and touching the box. This spell has no effect\
  \ until the box is changed to an unsolved state and someone subsequently tries and\
  \ fails to solve it.\nAny creature can close the box and twist its segments, at\
  \ which point the puzzle box becomes unsolved and requires a successful DC 20 Intelligence\
  \ check to solve and open. Each subsequent consecutive round spent randomly twisting\
  \ the segments increases the number of Intelligence checks needed to solve the puzzle,\
  \ to a maximum of three checks after 3 rounds of scrambling. As soon as the creature\
  \ ceases twisting the segments, it is no longer safe to change the configuration.\
  \ Thereafter, twisting any segment triggers a 1-minute timer, during which the holder\
  \ can safely attempt to solve the puzzle with a series of Intelligence checks. This\
  \ requires two hands and a full-round action for each Intelligence check. If the\
  \ timer runs out before the puzzle is solved or the creature pauses for 1 round\
  \ in the middle of attempting to solve the puzzle, the touch spell stored in the\
  \ perilous puzzle box (if any) discharges, automatically hitting any creature holding\
  \ the box.\nUnless the attempt to solve the puzzle succeeds, after 1 minute, the\
  \ box automatically reverts to the configuration it had before the attempt to solve\
  \ the puzzle and locks itself for 24 hours. If a perilous puzzle box is destroyed\
  \ (hardness 10, 20 hp), any contents stored in the extradimensional space are lost\
  \ on the Ethereal Plane.\nA found puzzle box has a 75% chance of having a touch\
  \ spell stored within it, usually bestow curse, contagion, or inflict critical wounds."
