description: "This holy symbol has a small nail or spike somewhere along its length,\
  \ allowing it to be hammered it into a wall, tree, floor, or any hard surface. Once\
  \ fixed in place and activated, it stores channeled energy until it is touched by\
  \ a creature of at least Small size or 24 hours pass. If touched, the focus releases\
  \ the stored power as if you used channel energy, though it only heals or deals\
  \ half the normal damage (including all feats and abilities that affect the DC and\
  \ damage). Good clerics use these items to provide healing in large battles where\
  \ a cleric may not be nearby; evil clerics often use them as traps."
