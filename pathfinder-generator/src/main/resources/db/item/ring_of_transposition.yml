description: "On command, the wearer of this ring can touch it to another ring, magical\
  \ or mundane, and bind it to the ring of transposition. Once per day, the wearer\
  \ of the ring of transposition can speak a command word to exchange places with\
  \ the creature wearing the bonded ring, which must be within 800 feet, as though\
  \ using a dimension door spell against a willing target. In the process, the ring\
  \ of transposition trades places with the ring on the other creature's hand, and\
  \ the bond between the rings is broken. The bonding property of the ring of transposition\
  \ can be used as often as desired, breaking any existing bond each time it is used.\
  \ An existing bond can be broken by a successful dispel check against the caster\
  \ level of the ring."
