description: "Skill slugs are tiny, segmented parasites incubated primarily in the\
  \ exposed brains of imprisoned caulborn. Long as a baby's finger and twice as plump,\
  \ these quivering gastropods draw sustenance from the memory fragments extracted\
  \ from the caulborn. A measure of those memories lives on within the slug. When\
  \ consumed, the skill slug grants 3 +10 competence bonus on a single Intelligence-based\
  \ skill for 1 hour. Each slug's associated skill is determined at the time of its\
  \ creation, and cannot be changed. The swallower counts as trained in the skill\
  \ even if he does not have ranks in it."
