description: "Shaped and carved from quartz or stranger subterranean crystals, these\
  \ circular throwing discs have jagged razor-sharp edges. When a crystal chakram\
  \ strikes a foe, the weapon shatters into tiny sharp fragments; if it misses, there\
  \ is a 50% chance the chakram shatters when it hits the ground or another solid\
  \ object; otherwise it can be retrieved and used again. A crystal chakram is treated\
  \ as ammunition for the purpose of creating magic weapons."
