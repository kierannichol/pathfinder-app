id: "item:scroll_of_shadowform"
name: "Scroll of Shadowform"
description: "You replace the target's body with mystic shadow material drawn from\
  \ the Shadow Plane, rendering the target's physical form only quasi-real. Whenever\
  \ a foe tries to directly attack the target of the spell (for instance, with a weapon\
  \ or a targeted spell), that foe must attempt a Will save to disbelieve. If successful,\
  \ the opponent can attack the target normally and is unaffected by shadowform for\
  \ 1 round. If the foe fails, the target takes only one-fifth the normal amount of\
  \ damage from the foe's successful attack or effect, and if the attack has a special\
  \ effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong as normal (if applicable)\
  \ or only 20% as likely to occur. Objects automatically succeed at their Will saves\
  \ against this spell."
