name: "Potion of Qualm"
description: "The target is suddenly beset with unexplainable doubts about the effectiveness\
  \ of its actions and the righteousness of its cause. The creature takes a â€“10 penalty\
  \ on its ability checks, skill checks, and concentration checks, until the duration\
  \ ends, or until it spends its entire turn doing absolutely nothing (it spends a\
  \ full-round action gaining focus). Spending an entire turn doing nothing discharges\
  \ the spell."
