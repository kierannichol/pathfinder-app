name: "Scroll of Temporary Resurrection"
description: "You restore temporary life to a body that has been dead for less than\
  \ 48 hours. The spell lasts for 24 hours, after which the target dies again. The\
  \ target gains 1 permanent negative level while under the effect of this spell;\
  \ this negative level goes away when the target dies or is permanently raised from\
  \ the dead (such as with raise dead). The target still counts as a dead corpse (but\
  \ not undead) for the purpose of spells that revive dead creatures, so a cleric\
  \ can cast raise deador a similar spell on the target even while this spell is active.\
  \ Once a creature has been revived with temporary resurrection, this spell cannot\
  \ be used on it again until it is permanently raised from the dead."
