description: "This heavy warhammer is capped with steel spikes on both ends of its\
  \ massive head, and a leather thong prevents it from falling from the wielder's\
  \ hand. Molvënn is a +3 warhammer that deals both piercing and bludgeoning damage.\
  \ Yet although it is already a formidable weapon, its true potential is only realized\
  \ in the hands of a barbarian.\nWielded by a barbarian, Molvënn becomes a +5 thundering\
  \ warhammer. The barbarian gains an additional 1 hit point per barbarian level when\
  \ raging and can add twice her Strength modifier (instead of half again her Strength\
  \ modifier) to damage rolls while wielding Molvënn two-handed. Additionally, while\
  \ Molvënn's wielder is raging, she cannot be disarmed, nor can Molvënn be sundered."
