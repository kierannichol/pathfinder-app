description: "Crafted from the finest materials, the Golden Carriage of Gaspar Longfellow\
  \ is a vehicle fit for royalty. Larger than an average carriage, the Golden Carriage\
  \ can accommodate six occupants in the interior, as well as two drivers and a footman\
  \ on the exterior. The interior is lavishly furnished and magically maintainedâ€”\
  occupants are protected from extreme heat and cold as if under the effects of endure\
  \ elements, and are treated as acclimated creatures for altitudes up to 15,000 feet\
  \ (see altitude zones, Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 430). Both doors of the carriage\
  \ are secured against intruders with alarm and arcane lock spells, and an invisible\
  \ driver can control the reins as unseen servant if no living driver is controlling\
  \ the carriage.\nThe most prominent features of the Golden Carriage are the four\
  \ spectral steeds that pull it. Adorned in beautiful scarlet leather harnesses,\
  \ these gray horses pull the carriage tirelessly over nearly any terrain. These\
  \ horses function as phantom steed cast by a 12th-level caster, and grant their\
  \ air walk, water walk, and other abilities to the carriage."
