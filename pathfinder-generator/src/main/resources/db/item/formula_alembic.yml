description: "This magically-augmented alchemical device distills a potion or alchemist\
  \ extract into the knowledge needed to create its formula. By gently heating a potion\
  \ or extract in the alembic for 1 hour, the device creates a few drops of magical\
  \ liquid. If consumed by an alchemist, this liquid gives him knowledge of the potion's\
  \ or extract's formula, as if it were an extract he recorded in his formula book.\
  \ This knowledge lasts for 24 hours. He may scribe this formula in his formula book\
  \ in the normal fashion.\nUsing the alembic does not harm the potion, but the process\
  \ makes it nearly boiling hot (it cools normally). The alembic can only distill\
  \ the knowledge of formulas on the alchemist extract list (for example, it cannot\
  \ turn a potion of a cleric-only spell into something an alchemist can learn)."
