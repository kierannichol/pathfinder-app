name: "Scroll of Purge Spirit"
description: "Purge spirit rips away at the target's spiritual substance, scattering\
  \ it over a wide area and hampering the target's ability to reform. The target takes\
  \ 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) and is staggered for 1 round.\
  \ On a successful saving throw, the target takes half damage and is not staggered.\
  \ This spell affects astrally projected creatures, ethereal creatures, haunts, incorporeal\
  \ creatures, mediums channeling a spirit, and phantoms, and at the GM's discretion\
  \ can affect other spirits or creatures made of ectoplasm. Incorporeal creatures\
  \ take full damage from purge spirit."
