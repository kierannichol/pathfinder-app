name: "Scroll of Psychic Asylum"
description: "You retreat into a mindscape (see page 234) of your own making that\
  \ allows you to perform a lengthy mental task in an instant. You create a mental\
  \ landscape that provides succor and calm for you, such as a library, sitting room,\
  \ garden, or childhood tree house. You can spend up to 15 minutes in your psychic\
  \ asylum. While you are within, no time passes for your body, and when you emerge\
  \ you can continue with your turn. The mindscape is overt, finite, and has a rapid\
  \ passage of time."
