description: "This hand-sized metal plate is covered with a thin layer of light-sensitive\
  \ transparent paste. If exposed to light, the paste darkens and becomes opaque,\
  \ depending on the amount of light. Bright light causes it to fully darken in 1\
  \ round, normal light in 3 rounds, and dim light in 10 rounds. It is mainly used\
  \ by creatures with darkvision to determine whether creatures carrying light have\
  \ recently passed through an area. The plate is sold wrapped in a thick black cloth\
  \ to prevent accidental light exposure from ruining the plate."
