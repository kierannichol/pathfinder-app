description: "This collection of eight heavy wooden or metal cones, cylinders, and\
  \ spheres fills an ordinary backpack. None of the shapes is precisely regular, and\
  \ when stacked atop each other, they teeter precariously and easily topple. Acrobats\
  \ practice by stacking these blocks in unstable configurations and attempting to\
  \ balance while standing upon them.\nUsing surefoot training blocks to improve your\
  \ balance requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 15 Acrobatics check. If you succeed\
  \ at the check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks and on Acrobatics\
  \ checks to balance on narrow surfaces or uneven ground. This bonus lasts for 24\
  \ hours or until you fail a Climb or Acrobatics check."
