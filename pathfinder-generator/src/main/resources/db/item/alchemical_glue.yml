description: "This glue is stored as two flasks of syrupy liquid. When mixed together\
  \ and allowed to cure, they form a strong bond. The glue is sufficient to coat 1\
  \ square foot of surface, or (because of waste, spills, and inaccurate mixing) up\
  \ to 20 smaller applications of approximately 2 square inches each. The glue is\
  \ tacky after 1 minute and fully cured after 1 hour. Pulling apart a large glued\
  \ surface (at least 1 square foot) requires a DC 20 Strength check for tacky glue\
  \ or DC 25 for cured glue. Pulling apart a small glued surface (anything less than\
  \ 1 square foot) is a DC 15 Strength check for tacky glue or DC 20 for cured glue."
