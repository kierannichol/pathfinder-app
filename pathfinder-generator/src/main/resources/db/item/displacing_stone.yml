description: "Upon activation, this pulsing white pebble creates an instantaneous\
  \ burst of reverse gravity, which clears a 5-foot-diameter sphere of any loose stone\
  \ or earth. The displacing stone then holds the affected stone or earth in place,\
  \ keeping a collapsed tunnel clear for 1 minute. Once the duration ends, the loose\
  \ earth collapses if it's not supported. Displacing stones are destroyed when used,\
  \ and don't affect living creatures. Activating a displacing stone is a standard\
  \ action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity."
