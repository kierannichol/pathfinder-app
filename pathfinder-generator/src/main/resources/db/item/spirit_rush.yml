description: "Inside this elegantly styled bottle is a purple liquid that sparkles.\
  \ For 1 hour after the imbiber drinks this elixir, anytime she would be reduced\
  \ to 0 hit points or below, the elixir immediately restores 3d8 + 5 hit points.\
  \ Additionally, the imbiber becomes ethereal for 1 round and is immediately shunted\
  \ 30 feet away from the source of the damage. While ethereal, the imbiber can move\
  \ through walls, objects, or barriers in her path; this movement does not provoke\
  \ attacks of opportunity. She must end the bonus movement in an unoccupied square.\
  \ If no such space is available along the trajectory, the elixir heals the imbiber\
  \ but does not move her away from the source of the damage."
