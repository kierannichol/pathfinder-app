description: "This porous wooden mask fits against the wearer's face much more tightly\
  \ than its bulky, abstract design suggests. The mask is capable of storing air;\
  \ the wearer can breathe normally underwater for 5 minutes before he has to hold\
  \ his breath. While underwater, so long as there is still air left in the mask,\
  \ it converts speech into vibrations in the water and vice versa, allowing the wearer\
  \ to speak normally and hear the speech of other creatures wearing hollow masks\
  \ within 60 feet as though they were not underwater. After a wearer has used the\
  \ mask underwater, the mask needs an equal amount of time (maximum 5 minutes) to\
  \ replenish its air supply."
