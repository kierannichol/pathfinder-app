description: "This is a clear, viscous liquid that is typically kept in a frosted\
  \ glass vial with an unassuming label and cork. The oil is used to reduce the sound\
  \ armor and weapons make while moving. Applying this oil to a single piece of equipment\
  \ takes 1 minute and grants the wearer a +2 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks\
  \ for 30 minutes. A vial of this oil is enough to coat one Medium piece of equipment,\
  \ while a Large piece of equipment requires 4 vials. Two pieces of Small equipment\
  \ can be covered with a single vial of oil. Exposure to or submersion in large amounts\
  \ of water, such as swimming, immediately ends the effect of the oil."
