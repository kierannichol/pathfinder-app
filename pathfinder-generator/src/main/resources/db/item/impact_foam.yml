description: "This milky white liquid bubbles into a 1-foot-thick semisolid sheet\
  \ of foam when splashed across the ground. You can spend a minute to apply a flask\
  \ of impact foam to a 10-foot-radius area, or you can throw the flask as a splash\
  \ weapon. The foam does not interfere with movement, but reacts strongly to sudden\
  \ force. A creature that falls onto a sheet of impact foam ignores the first 1d6\
  \ points of falling damage and converts the second 1d6 points of falling damage\
  \ into nonlethal damage. A sheet of impact foam dissolves after 10 minutes or when\
  \ exposed to at least a gallon of water."
