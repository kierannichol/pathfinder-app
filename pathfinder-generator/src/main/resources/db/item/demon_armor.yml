description: "This plate armor is fashioned to make the wearer appear to be a demon.\
  \ Glowing red energy emanates from sigils engraved on the armor's key plates and\
  \ joints, and the runes intermittently surge with fiendish power. This +4 full plate\
  \ allows the wearer to make claw attacks that deal 1d10 points of damage, strike\
  \ as +1 weapons, and afflict the target as if she had been struck by a contagion\
  \ spell (Fortitude DC 14 negates). Use of contagion requires a normal melee attack\
  \ with the claws. The \"claws\" are built into the armor's vambraces and gauntlets,\
  \ and cannot be disarmed.\nA suit of demon armor is infused with evil, and as a\
  \ result it bestows one negative level on any nonevil creature wearing it. This\
  \ negative level persists as long as the armor is worn and disappears when the armor\
  \ is removed. The negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration\
  \ spells) while the armor is worn."
