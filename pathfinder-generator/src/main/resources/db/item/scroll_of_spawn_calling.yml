name: "Scroll of Spawn Calling"
description: "Having attained the highest and most profane form of magical achievement\
  \ in the Great Destroyer's service, you are able to call forth his most dreaded\
  \ creations: the Spawn of Rovagug. Casting this spell requires a week-long ritual\
  \ involving the sacrifice of one or more sentient humanoid creatures that between\
  \ them possess a total of at least 15 Hit Dice. You may not eat, sleep, or cast\
  \ any other spells for the duration of this ritual. After the third day of the ritual,\
  \ you must succeed at a Constitution check on each remaining day of the ritual (DC\
  \ 10 + 1 for each previous check) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from hunger.\
  \ At the end of the ritual, you gain the exhausted condition from lack of sleep."
