description: "This +1 bashing light steel shield features a brilliant sun motif, and\
  \ always seems comfortably warm to the touch. Once per day when the shield's bearer\
  \ successfully hits a creature with a shield bash attack, he may activate the shield\
  \ as a swift action to mark the target with radiant energy. This radiant energy\
  \ lasts for 1d4 rounds. During this time, the marked creature shines like a sunrod,\
  \ and the wielder's allies gain a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls against the marked\
  \ creature as long as they are within 30 feet of it. If the marked creature is vulnerable\
  \ to light, this insight bonus increases to +3.\nWhen a marked creature is hit by\
  \ a melee or ranged attack, the radiant energy discharges in a burst of light, dealing\
  \ 1d6 points of damage to the marked creature and ending the marking effect. If\
  \ the creature is vulnerable to light, it is also dazed for 1 round."
