description: "The boss of this large black shield resembles a deformed skull of tarnished\
  \ silver. The shield bears many dents and scratches from past battles.\nThe Shield\
  \ of Xin-Undoros is a +5 heavy steel shield that makes its bearer unnaturally strong\
  \ and resilient like a rune giant, granting a +6 enhancement bonus to Constitution\
  \ and Strength as long as the shield is readied. As a standard action, the bearer\
  \ can increase his size by up to two size categories, to a maximum of Gargantuan.\
  \ For each size category increased, the bearer gains a +2 size bonus to Constitution\
  \ and Strength and takes a –2 penalty to Dexterity. The bearer can shrink back to\
  \ his normal size with another standard action; the effect also ends if he loses\
  \ the shield.\nWhen readied, the Shield of Xin-Undoros also grants the bearer spell\
  \ resistance 31. The bearer can ready an action to attempt to reflect a spell; if\
  \ a spellcaster fails her caster level check to overcome the spell resistance granted\
  \ by the shield, the shield's bearer can reflect the spell back at its caster as\
  \ per spell turning."
destruction: "The shield explodes if an enemy successfully targets the bearer of the\
  \ shield with a spell that overcomes the shield's spell resistance and then, within\
  \ 1 round, succeeds at a sunder combat maneuver check against the shield that deals\
  \ enough damage to destroy it in a single blow. The explosion of the shield's destruction\
  \ deals 12d8 points of sonic damage to each creature and object within 30 feet (no\
  \ save)."
