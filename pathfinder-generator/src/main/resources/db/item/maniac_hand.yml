description: "This dried and withered hand ends in a jagged stump. When it is touched\
  \ against the arm stump of a humanoid who has lost a hand, the maniac hand bonds\
  \ instantly and returns to a lifelike appearance. It shrinks or grows to match the\
  \ size of its new owner, and transforms itself to match the hand lost, becoming\
  \ either a right or left hand. After merging, an uneven scar and unhealthy hue identify\
  \ it as alien to its new owner.\nAttacks made with a maniac hand receive a +2 competence\
  \ bonus on attack and damage rolls. In addition, when making a full attack, the\
  \ wielder can accept a â€“2 penalty to AC in order to make one extra attack with the\
  \ hand using the wielder's full base attack bonus. This benefit is not cumulative\
  \ with similar effects, such as a haste spell. For the purposes of these bonuses,\
  \ any weapon held in the maniac hand or in both hands qualifies, and the hand itself\
  \ can deal damage as a slam attack appropriate to the wielder's size (1d4 for a\
  \ Medium creature).\nA maniac hand has an insidious will that slowly usurps control\
  \ from the owner. It has Intelligence 8, Wisdom 12, and Charisma 10. Incapable of\
  \ communication and bereft of rational thought, a maniac hand knows only an insatiable\
  \ urge to destroy. When first attached, a maniac hand has an Ego score of 5. At\
  \ least once each day, when presented with an opportunity to murder a friend or\
  \ innocent without being witnessed, the maniac hand attempts to assert control using\
  \ the rules for items against characters (Core Rulebook 535). If it succeeds, the\
  \ hand takes control of its owner until it can commit the murder or 5 minutes pass,\
  \ whichever comes first. The owner remembers nothing of the crime save a blinding\
  \ rage, and the hand's Ego score returns to 5. If the hand fails to assert control,\
  \ the owner feels a momentary surge of anger, but can't identify the source. Each\
  \ day that passes without the hand's murderous impulse killing a creature of Intelligence\
  \ 3 or higher, its Ego score increases by 1. If its Ego score increases above 20,\
  \ the hand no longer cares for caution, and attempts murder regardless of the chance\
  \ of getting caught.\nA maniac hand that's denied the death of friends or innocents\
  \ for more than 30 days turns against its owner. If in a position to sabotage the\
  \ owner, such as by letting go of a rope, it attempts to assert control. It can\
  \ assert control while the owner sleeps, strangling its host or seizing a weapon\
  \ to deliver a coup de grace. The hand attempts such an act at most once per day.\
  \ An owner willing to slaughter innocents can keep the hand satisfied by finding\
  \ an innocent victim and voluntarily relinquishing control to the hand.\nIf the\
  \ owner tries to rid herself of the maniac hand by destroying or amputating it,\
  \ the hand resists to the best of its ability. It makes attacks and one-handed grapple\
  \ attempts with its owner's own Strength and Dexterity scores, augmented by the\
  \ hand's bonuses. The hand has an AC equal to its owner's touch AC, except with\
  \ a +4 size bonus that stacks with its owner's size modifier. Its owner loses her\
  \ Dexterity bonus against the hand's attacks, but the hand retains its Dexterity\
  \ bonus against its owner. The hand's hp is equal to 1/4 that of its owner.\nSuccessfully\
  \ casting remove curse on a maniac hand prevents it from resisting amputation for\
  \ 1 hour."
