  \ Its wearer is able to see in all directions at the same moment due to scores of\

  \ darkvision.\nThe robe of eyes sees all forms of invisible or ethereal creatures\
  \ or objects within 120 feet. The wearer of a robe of eyes gains a +10 competence\
  \ bonus on Perception checks. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC even when flat-footed,\
  \ and can't be flanked. She is not able to avert or close her eyes when confronted\
  \ by a creature with a gaze attack.\nA light or continual flame spell cast directly\
  \ on a robe of eyes causes the wearer to be blinded for 1d3 minutes. A daylight\
  \ spell blinds the wearer for 2d4 minutes."
