description: "This black iron choker chain forges a link between the wearer and any\
  \ undead creature of the wearer's choice. Creating this link requires a command\
  \ word. The wearer can dismiss this bond with another command word, and reforge\
  \ it with the same or a different undead creature at a later time. While the two\
  \ are bound and within 100 feet of one another, any positive energy damage the undead\
  \ would take is instead transferred to the wearer as healing. Likewise, any negative\
  \ energy damage the wearer would take transfers to and heals the undead. The collar\
  \ can transfer up to 70 total points of damage per day."
