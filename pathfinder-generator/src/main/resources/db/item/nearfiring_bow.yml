description: "This bow appears to be a +2 distance shortbow, but its curse is that\
  \ it suffers a –4 cumulative penalty for each range increment beyond the first.\
  \ Furthermore, it takes an additional –4 penalty on critical confirmation rolls\
  \ when firing beyond the first range increment. This bow must be used as its wielder's\
  \ primary ranged weapon and can only be discarded after the owner is subject to\
  \ a remove curse spell or similar effect."
