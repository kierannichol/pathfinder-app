description: "This suit of +1 stanching padded armor is of traditional Osirian design,\
  \ consisting of a quilted cuirass of lightweight, breathable linen; a linen kilt;\
  \ and a teardrop-shaped groin guard of stiffened linen. Besides its anti-bleeding\
  \ properties, Akhentepi's armor grants its wearer a sense of impending danger. Once\
  \ per day as a free action when the wearer attempts an initiative check, the wearer\
  \ can add a +3 insight bonus on that initiative check."
