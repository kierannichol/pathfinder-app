description: "This version of a standard holy symbol is oversized and has a watertight\
  \ compartment that can hold 1 pint (the same volume as a flask of holy water). Adventurers\
  \ normally use the compartment to hold holy water or alcohol. A holy symbol flask\
  \ is not meant for you to throw at enemies and is not fragile like a flask or vial.\
  \ Like using holy water on incorporeal opponent, you unstopper the flask and pour\
  \ the contents onto an adjacent target. Detecting the compartment requires a successful\
  \ DC 10 Perception check."
