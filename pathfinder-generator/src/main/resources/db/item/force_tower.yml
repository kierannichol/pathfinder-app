description: "This +1 arrow deflection ghost touch mithral tower shield glows with\
  \ a perpetual bluish radiance. Infused with magical force, a force tower renders\
  \ its wielder immune to magic missiles and also allows its wielder to use its arrow\
  \ deflection special ability to deflect magical rays and ranged touch attacks. The\
  \ Reflex save DC to deflect such attacks is equal to 20 + the level of the spell\
  \ (or 1/2 the class level or Hit Dice of the creature that created the effect, if\
  \ a supernatural effect). If a spell or effect creates multiple rays or attacks,\
  \ the force tower deflects only one of them per round."
