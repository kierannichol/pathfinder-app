description: "If a blind creature holds this orb, that creature can see with darkvision\
  \ with a range of 120 feet, but also gains light sensitivity (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary\
  \ 301). If a sighted creature holds this orb and holds his eyes shut for 1 minute,\
  \ he gains the blinded condition until he opens his eyes (as a free action), but\
  \ can see through the orb as if he were a blind creature.\nBy expending one use\
  \ of mythic power, a creature using the eye orb can see as though using true seeing,\
  \ and loses light sensitivity. These effects last for 1 minute or until he stops\
  \ using the orb to see, whichever comes first."
