description: "The Eclipsing Eye is a +4 adamantineaxiomatic unholy wounding heavy\
  \ mace; it is a token of esteem and power granted by Asmodeus himself to the governor\
  \ of Hell's greatest city. It allows the wielder to command allegiance as per a\
  \ rod of rulership with an unlimited duration when activated in Hell. Outside of\
  \ Hell, it remains limited to 500 total minutes of this effect, but does not crumble\
  \ to dust if these minutes are used up. Every hour it spends in Hell restores 1\
  \ minute of expended duration. When used as a weapon, The Eclipsing Eye has a critical\
  \ multiplier of ×3. The Eclipsing Eye automatically casts blindness (as per blindness/deafness\
  \ heightened to 9th level, save DC 23) on the first creature it strikes each round.\
  \ The Eclipsing Eye is Dispater's rod of office, and he can summon it to his hand\
  \ as a free action from any distance, even across planar boundaries. As long as\
  \ he wields it, all lawful evil, neutral evil, and lawful neutral creatures treat\
  \ him as if he were under a sanctuary spell (CL 30th, save DC 23 as if heightened\
  \ to a 9th level spell). Three times per day, The Eclipsing Eye can create any of\
  \ the following spell effects, heightened to 9th level as per the Heighten Spell\
  \ feat: calm emotions, demand, discern lies, and discern location."
destruction: "Asmodeus can will the destruction of The Eclipsing Eye as a free action,\
  \ but otherwise it can be destroyed only by immersing it in the headwaters of the\
  \ River Styx for a century, allowing the artifact to rust away."
