description: "Molded from a pale, milky-green wax into the shape of a column of screaming\
  \ souls and stamped on the bottom with the unholy symbol of one of the Four Horsemen,\
  \ a candle of Abaddon is a boon to evil spellcasters and any who would summon or\
  \ interact with daemons. When burned, the candle sheds eerie dim illumination in\
  \ a radius of 15 feet similar to Abaddon's perpetual eclipse. This candle lowers\
  \ existing light levels in the area to dim conditions; this effect functions as\
  \ a 6th-level spell with the darkness descriptor. A spellcaster within the radius\
  \ of a burning candle of Abaddon gains a +2 bonus to his effective caster level\
  \ when casting spells with the evil descriptor. The light also acts as per magic\
  \ circle against evil, but only against daemons. Natural healing doesn't work within\
  \ the light's radius of illumination, and magical healing requires a successful\
  \ DC 25 caster level check to take effect.\nA candle of Abaddon normally burns for\
  \ 4 hours, but any burning consumes at least 10 minutes of its overall life span,\
  \ even if it was lit for less than 10 minutes. It is possible to extinguish the\
  \ candle simply by blowing it out, so users often place it in a lantern to protect\
  \ it from drafts and the like (this doesn't interfere with its magical properties)."
