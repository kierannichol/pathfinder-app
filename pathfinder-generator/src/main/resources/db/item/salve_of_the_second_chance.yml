description: "Under tutelage from Embeth Forest sprites, Mother Nightmoss developed\
  \ this potent salve from the distillation of nightmoss. When smeared on a body or\
  \ body part from a recently deceased creature, the salve mimics the effects of a\
  \ reincarnate spell. If this salve is used on a creature during the night of a new\
  \ moon, roll twice on the reincarnate table and have the recipient player or NPC\
  \ choose his preferred result."
