description: "This pistol acts as a normal +2 pistol, but it has a strange aversion\
  \ to talk of peace. Anytime the wielder or an ally within line of sight that the\
  \ wielder can hear attempts to improve a creature's initial attitude with the Diplomacy\
  \ skill, without spending an action, the pistol leaps into the wielder's hand and\
  \ takes a single shot at the creature the wielder or ally is using Diplomacy against.\
  \ If the wielder or ally is attempting to affect multiple creatures, the gun shoots\
  \ a random member of the group. This occurs even if the pistol is unloaded, as the\
  \ pistol's curse magically loads itself with a normal bullet and black powder when\
  \ the action is taken."
