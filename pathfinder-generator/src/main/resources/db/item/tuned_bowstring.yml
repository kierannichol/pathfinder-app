description: "This faintly glowing bowstring is twined from the hair of a lillend.\
  \ When strung on a bow, a tuned bowstring also functions as a masterwork stringed\
  \ instrument, granting the wielder an enhancement bonus on Performance (string)\
  \ checks equal to the bow's enhancement bonus (if any). A tuned bowstring produces\
  \ a perfect note with every arrow fired by its wielder, allowing a character with\
  \ the bardic performance class feature to maintain a performance in combat without\
  \ expending rounds of bardic performance as long as she fires at least one arrow\
  \ each round. Activating a bardic performance or switching to a different performance\
  \ still costs a round of bardic performance."
