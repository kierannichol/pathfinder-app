description: "This ball of iron bands and hinges is about the size of a human fist.\
  \ Three times per day, when thrown at a creature or space as a thrown weapon, the\
  \ contraption opens up as it strikes a solid surface, taking the shape of a metal\
  \ muzzle. If it hits the target, the muzzle immediately attaches itself to the face\
  \ of any Large or smaller creature struck by the ball or any single Large or smaller\
  \ creature in the 5-foot square so targeted. The muzzle harmlessly clatters to the\
  \ ground and returns to ball form if it fails to strike a creature or no creature\
  \ is present in the space in which it landed, and it does not return to its thrower.\n\
  A creature muzzled with an instant muzzle cannot speak properly (if it was normally\
  \ able to do so), and gains a 20% spell failure chance for any spell it attempts\
  \ to cast with verbal components, and a 20% chance to incorrectly use a command\
  \ word when activating a magic item. The muzzled creature cannot make bite attacks\
  \ or even drink or eat properly. The muzzle has hardness 10 and 25 hit points. An\
  \ instant muzzle remains attached to a creature for 4 rounds before detaching and\
  \ returning to ball form, immediately teleporting back to the hand of the creature\
  \ that originally threw the item."
