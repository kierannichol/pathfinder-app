description: "This strangely shaped, ebon-colored rock streaked with deep purple veins\
  \ is actually the petrified heart of a long-forgotten mythic hero. Over the centuries,\
  \ the heart has appeared as an amulet, the head of a staff, and a mace head. Regardless\
  \ of its form, the Shadowwraith Heart functions the same. The heart seeks out the\
  \ location of the nearest source of mythic power— either a creature or place—and\
  \ when brought to the source devours its power. As soon as it comes within a 60-foot-radius\
  \ of a mythic creature, it begins to leech off that creature's mythic power. Each\
  \ round a mythic creature remains within the area of effect, it must succeed at\
  \ a DC 25 Fortitude save or lose 1d4 uses of mythic power. If the heart drains a\
  \ mythic creature of all its daily uses of mythic power, the creature loses a mythic\
  \ tier. The tier loss is semi-permanent, remaining until the creature successfully\
  \ completes one trial."
destruction: "Implanting the Shadowwraith Heart into the chest of a dying mythic hero\
  \ reanimates the heart, restoring the hero as the heal spell (CL 15th), though the\
  \ hero loses all mythic tiers."
