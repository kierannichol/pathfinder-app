description: "This oversized wooden mask covers the face and extends down to a point\
  \ at the wearer's waist, covering most of his chest and abdomen. It is simplistically\
  \ carved as a stylized, bestial face distorted with rage or nightmarish styles.\
  \ The light wood provides little protection, yet is magically reinforced to grant\
  \ a +1 armor bonus. In addition, once per day as a free action, the wearer can cause\
  \ the mask to warp and contort ferociously, causing a single creature within 15\
  \ feet to make a DC 14 Will save or become frightened. This is a mindaffecting fear\
  \ effect."
