description: "These black leather gloves feel like warm, living skin to the touch.\
  \ When the wearer delivers a coup de grace that kills an opponent, she can target\
  \ a single creature within 30 feet that has died within the previous 3 rounds as\
  \ a free action. The target creature is healed as if with a breath of life spell\
  \ (regaining 5d8+9 hit points), and if the creature's hit point total is then greater\
  \ than a negative amount equal to its Constitution score, it comes back to life\
  \ and stabilizes at its new hit point total. As with the breath of life spell, creatures\
  \ brought back to life gain a temporary negative level that lasts for 1 day, but\
  \ this effect can save creatures slain by death effects. This effect cannot damage\
  \ undead creatures. The opponent killed by the coup de grace must have a number\
  \ of Hit Dice equal to or greater than the target slain creature's Hit Dice or the\
  \ gloves' ability is not triggered."
