description: "This dust looks like dust of appearance and is typically stored in the\
  \ same manner. A creature or object touched by it becomes invisible (as greater\
  \ invisibility). Normal vision can't see dusted creatures or objects, nor can they\
  \ be detected by magical means, including see invisibility or invisibility purge.\
  \ Dust of appearance, however, does reveal people and objects made invisible by\
  \ dust of disappearance. Other factors, such as sound and smell, also allow possible\
  \ detection. The greater invisibility bestowed by the dust lasts for 2d6 rounds.\
  \ The invisible creature doesn't know when the duration will end."
