description: "Though Taramai is long dead, and that first Keleshite invasion now little\
  \ more than scattered stone foundations crumbling amid the grass, his legacy remains\
  \ a point of great cultural pride among the Kara, with several leaders since having\
  \ claimed to be his reincarnation. Taramai also pioneered the now-standard Kara\
  \ practice of wearing the litchinaâ€”a metal face mask sculpted to match a given warrior's\
  \ face, so that the enemy can never read any fear or pain in a Kara's expression.\
  \ Each warrior must earn his or her litchina in battle, and most Kara would sooner\
  \ fight naked than go without theirs.\nTo be worn properly, a litchina must be attached\
  \ to a helm or headpiece of some sort (usually via small hooks). While worn in this\
  \ manner, it grants the wearer a +1 competence bonus to Intimidate. A magically\
  \ enhanced litchina can count as occupying either the head, headband, or eyes slot\
  \ (determined at the time of item creation). A standard litchina costs 100 gp and\
  \ weighs 2 pounds."
