  \ rest on the wearer's forehead. The headband grants the wearer a +2 enhancement\
  \ bonus to Intelligence. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24\
  \ hours the headband is worn. It also grants skill ranks as a headband of vast intelligence,\
  \ but always grants ranks in a Knowledge skill.\nAs a swift action three times per\
  \ day, the wearer can call upon the headband to reveal the abilities and weaknesses\
  \ of a creature within line of sight. The headband fills the wearer's mind with\
  \ information as though the wearer had made a Knowledge check with a natural roll\
  \ of a 5, adding her bonuses to the check as normal. At the start of her next turn,\
  \ the wearer receives additional information as though she had made the check with\
  \ a natural roll of 10. At the start of her turn after that, the wearer receives\
  \ a final piece of information, treating her natural roll as 15."
