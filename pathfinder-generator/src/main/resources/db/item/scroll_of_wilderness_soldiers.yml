description: "You call on the plants nearby to aid you in combat. This spell is ineffective\
  \ if no plants you can direct are within the area. You can spend a swift action\
  \ and/or a standard action on each of your turns to direct one of the following\
  \ attacks. The attack bonus or CMB for these attacks equals your base attack bonus\
  \ + your Wisdom modifier. You grant a +1 bonus per three caster levels (maximum\
  \ +5) on damage rolls due to this spell. Your wilderness soldiersnever provoke attacks\
  \ of opportunity, and they do not count as allies for flanking or other purposes."
