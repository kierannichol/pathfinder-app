description: "This quartet of books is held together by a shining silver strand wound\
  \ around the four tomes and tied in an intricate knot. Inside, the writing is expansive\
  \ and sloppy, filled with marginalia; the author's notes indicate clear excitement\
  \ about her discoveries, and while the thinker is obviously brilliant, she is also\
  \ apparently undisciplined."
