description: "You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You\
  \ can use a composite shortbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a\
  \ particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier\
  \ to use with proficiency). If your Strength modifier is lower than the strength\
  \ rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a â€“2 penalty\
  \ on attacks with it. The default composite shortbow requires a Strength modifier\
  \ of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite shortbow can be made with\
  \ a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this\
  \ feature allows you to add your Strength modifier on damage rolls, up to the maximum\
  \ bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds\
  \ 75 gp to its cost. you have a negative modifier due to low Strength, apply it\
  \ to damage rolls when you use a composite shortbow. A composite shortbow fires\
  \ arrows.\nFor the purposes of Weapon Proficiency, Weapon Focus, and similar feats,\
  \ a composite shortbow is treated as if it were a shortbow."
