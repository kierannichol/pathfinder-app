description: "This bronze wayfinder is decorated with garnets and emeralds, and even\
  \ without its magical properties would be worth a small fortune. A wayfinder of\
  \ infinite doorways has 10 charges; these charges automatically replenish at a rate\
  \ of 1 charge every 24 hours. The wayfinder has one ioun stone slot—as a standard\
  \ action, the user can drain the power of an ioun stone inserted in the wayfinder\
  \ to restore a number of charges equal to the ioun stone's cost divided by 2,000\
  \ (thus, draining an ioun stone worth 8,000 points would instantly restore 4 charges).\
  \ The item can be used to activate any of the following powers as a standard action\
  \ that expends a variable number of charges."
