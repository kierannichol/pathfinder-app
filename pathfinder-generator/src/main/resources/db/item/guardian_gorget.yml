description: "This flanged collar of mithral and steel protects the wearer's neck\
  \ and shoulders. It provides a +2 armor bonus to AC (this does not stack with other\
  \ armor bonuses) and grants the light fortification property to the wearer. In addition,\
  \ the wearer may engrave a glyph of warding directly onto the guardian gorget. When\
  \ the wearer is struck in melee, she can trigger the glyph as an immediate action,\
  \ causing the glyph to discharge against the creature making the attack (and other\
  \ creatures within 5 feet, if a blast glyph was placed, though the wearer is not\
  \ harmed by the glyphâ€˜s effects). The glyph can be triggered even if the attack\
  \ would normally leave the wearer incapable of taking actions (such as killed, stunned,\
  \ dazed, or knocked unconscious)."
