description: "This vile-smelling white paste keeps vermin at bay if spread on your\
  \ skin. Normal-sized (Fine) vermin avoid you. Swarms of vermin must make a successful\
  \ DC 15 Fortitude saving throw in order to enter your square. Vermin repellent has\
  \ no adverse effect on vermin of Small size or larger, though if an attacking vermin\
  \ has a choice of targets that are respectively covered and not covered in repellent,\
  \ it usually chooses the creatures without repellent. Once applied, vermin repellent\
  \ remains effective for 4 hours or until you spend 1 round washing it off.\nVermin\
  \ repellent counts as a strong scent, allowing creatures with the scent ability\
  \ to detect it at a greater range (see the Universal Monster Rules in the Bestiary)."
