description: "This set of magical paints comes in a set of three small clay pots,\
  \ each containing a different color - blue, yellow, and red. You may use the sorcerous\
  \ pigments to store spells in a painting and set a specific condition that triggers\
  \ the spells. You must succeed at a Craft (painting) check (DC 10 + spell level)\
  \ in order to successfully store each spell. On a failed check, the spell and the\
  \ sorcerous pigments that would have been used are wasted. A set of sorcerous pigments\
  \ can be used to \"paint\" up to 12 levels of spells."
