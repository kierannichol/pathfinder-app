description: "This small flask smokes with an odorless black mist when opened. Each\
  \ flask contains a single use of ebon flame, a strange sort of fire that is hostile\
  \ to normal fire. Cool to the touch even in hot environs, when poured out, a flask\
  \ creates a 20-footradius burst of black fire centered on the user. This burst of\
  \ ebon flame extinguishes all natural fires and dispels magical fire (dispel check\
  \ 1d20+5) in the area, including magic items that have fire effects (such as a flametongue\
  \ sword or a necklace of fireballs), although items dispelled merely cease to function\
  \ for 1d4 rounds.\nThe ebon flame can cure damage caused by fire— each creature\
  \ in the burst is healed 5d6 points of damage caused by fire effects.\nA creature\
  \ with the fire subtype inside the area of the burst takes 5d6 points of damage\
  \ and is stunned for 1 round—a successful DC 15 Fortitude save halves the damage\
  \ and negates the stun effect.\nEbon flame is unstable, and when combined in doses\
  \ larger than a single use, or when not stored in a specially prepared flask, it\
  \ dissipates harmlessly in a cloud of faint black smoke. Overlapping areas of ebon\
  \ flame do not stack their effects."
