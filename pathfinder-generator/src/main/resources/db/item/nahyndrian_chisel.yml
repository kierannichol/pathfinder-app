description: "This large chisel appears to be made of deep purple crystal— it is,\
  \ in fact, carved from the heart of a single enormous Nahyndrian crystal. Imbued\
  \ with devastating magic, the Nahyndrian chisel may be used three times per day\
  \ to target a creature or object with a mage's disjunction. Activating this ability\
  \ requires the user to make a successful touch attack against the target. A Nahyndrian\
  \ chisel can be used as an improvised weapon in combat—when so utilized, it has\
  \ a +3 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, deals 1d4 points of piercing\
  \ damage on a hit, and automatically bypasses any damage reduction (including DR/epic\
  \ or DR/—)."
destruction: "If a Nahyndrian chisel is successfully used to destroy an artifact,\
  \ it must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be destroyed."
