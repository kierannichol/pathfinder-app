description: "By imbibing this potent concoction, a creature gains the ability to\
  \ see as well as walk through the mysterious mountaintop portals that lead to the\
  \ nightmare dimension of Leng. This effect lasts for 1d6 hours, during which time\
  \ the drinker experiences phantasmagoric hallucinations in addition to the very\
  \ real effect of seeing Leng's secret doorways. While in Leng, a creature under\
  \ the effects of Leng tea can see the portal back to the Material Plane on the other\
  \ side. As soon as the tea's effects end, the creature loses the ability to see\
  \ gateways into or out of Leng, regardless of where the creature is. In addition,\
  \ a creature coming down from the effects of Leng tea takes 1d4 points of Dexterity\
  \ damage and is fatigued."
