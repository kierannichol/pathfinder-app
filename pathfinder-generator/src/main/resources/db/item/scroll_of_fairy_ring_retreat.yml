name: "Scroll of Fairy Ring Retreat"
description: "You conjure up an extradimensional meadow that can be accessed from\
  \ a single entrance on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry point\
  \ looks like a circle of toadstools enclosing a 10-foot square. Only those you designate\
  \ can enter the meadow before you do, and the portal is shut and made invisible\
  \ behind you when you enter. You can open it again from your own side at will. Once\
  \ a visitor has passed through the entry point, they find themselves in an idyllic\
  \ twilight meadow surrounded by an impassable grove of fruit and nut trees. The\
  \ atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm."
