description: "This pistol has two parallel barrels; each barrel can be fired independently\
  \ as a separate action, or both can be shot at once with the same action. If both\
  \ barrels are shot at once, they must both target the same creature or object, and\
  \ the pistol becomes wildly inaccurate, imposing a â€“4 penalty on each shot. This\
  \ is an early firearm."
