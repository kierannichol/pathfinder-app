description: "This large metal canister releases a cloud of toxic gas. It is usually\
  \ placed on the ground and triggered so that the wind blows the gas toward enemy\
  \ positions. Normally, multiple gas cylinders are placed in line and triggered together\
  \ to cover a wider area of the battlefield. First, determine what direction the\
  \ wind is blowing by rolling 1d4 (1 is north, 2 is east, 3 is south, and 4 is west).\
  \ When triggered, a gas cylinder releases a cloud of mustard gas (see the sidebar\
  \ on page 67) in a 15- foot cone. On the following 2 rounds, the cloud extends by\
  \ an additional 15-foot square away from the canister, forming a 15-foot-wide, 45-foot-long\
  \ cloud at the end of 3 rounds. The cloud moves with the wind, rolling along the\
  \ surface of the ground, and disperses after 10 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph)\
  \ disperses the cloud in 4 rounds, and a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses it in 1\
  \ round."
