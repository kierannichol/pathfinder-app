description: "This wooden marotte is topped with a jester's head whose comical face\
  \ takes on the likeness of the wielder. As a free action, the wielder of a fool's\
  \ scepter can speak through the jester's head and imitate voices and sounds with\
  \ a volume up to that of a dragon's roar. The wielder can also cause the jester's\
  \ face to transform into the comic likeness of any creature she can visualize. Using\
  \ a fool's scepter in this manner grants a +5 circumstance bonus to Perform (comedy)\
  \ checks.\nOnce per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the jester head\
  \ to take on the likeness of an individual creature within 60 feet and then harangue\
  \ that creature with magically honed mockery. If the creature possesses an Intelligence\
  \ of 3 or higher, they are dazed with humiliation for 2d6 rounds and shaken for\
  \ 10 minutes. This is a mind-affecting, language-dependent compulsion effect, and\
  \ is negated by a successful DC 15 Will saving throw.\nOnce per week as a standard\
  \ action, the wielder can query the jester's head for information regarding an individual\
  \ creature. The head transforms into the likeness of that creature and recites a\
  \ number of jocular stories over the next 2d6 Ã— 10 minutes, providing information\
  \ as per the legend lore spell. If the subject of the wielder's query is present\
  \ and within 60 feet, the head also provides information regarding the subject's\
  \ thoughts, desires, personality, and motivations as if using detect thoughts, though\
  \ the subject may negate this divination with a successful DC 15 Will save. In this\
  \ circumstance, the head always answers in a voice that is loud enough to be audible\
  \ to the subject of the query."
