description: "This specialized suit of full plate is made from the tanned hide of\
  \ a linnorm and acts as +4 dragonhide plate. If a creature is slain while wearing\
  \ such armor, its killer is subject to a curse. The cursed creature must succeed\
  \ at a DC 17 Will save or gain vulnerability to fire until the curse is removed.\
  \ This curse can be removed only by a break enchantment, miracle, or wish spell.\
  \ This particular suit of armor is made from the hide of a crag linnorm, though\
  \ others exist, each with a different curse effect similar to the curse of the associated\
  \ linnorm.\nOnce per day as a swift action, the wear of this armor can summon forth\
  \ the uncanny movement powers of a linnorm, gaining the benefits of freedom of movement\
  \ for 10 minutes."
