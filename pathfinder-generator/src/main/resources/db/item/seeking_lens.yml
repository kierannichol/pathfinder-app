description: "This telescope is adjustable as a full-round action, allowing magnifications\
  \ anywhere from ×2 to ×250. The user gains a +5 competence bonus on Knowledge (geography)\
  \ and Perception checks when using the device to study planets, stars, and other\
  \ celestial bodies.\nAs a full-round action, the user can press the two lenses together,\
  \ compressing the device to a small assayer's lens small enough to occupy the eyes\
  \ slot. In this form, the lens grants a +5 competence bonus on Appraise checks,\
  \ Perception checks, and Survival checks to follow tracks. Once per week, after\
  \ studying the possessions or tracks of a creature, the wearer may designate that\
  \ creature as his quarry. This functions as the ranger's quarry ability. If the\
  \ wearer already has the quarry ability, the lens instead allows him to designate\
  \ a creature as his quarry even if it is not one of his favored enemies."
