description: "This +2 arrow is fitted with a head of pure, crystallized blightburn.\
  \ Unless contained in a lead-lined case or quiver, the arrow deals 1 point of fire\
  \ damage per round to the creature carrying it. If the arrow hits, the arrowhead\
  \ embeds itself in the target, dealing an additional 3d6 points of fire damage.\
  \ The arrow continues to deal 2d6 points of fire damage each round for the following\
  \ 6 rounds unless it's pulled out as a move action. A creature taking recurring\
  \ damage from a blightburn arrow also suffers from low-level blightburn radiation\
  \ as long as the arrow remains embedded. An arrow that misses its target can be\
  \ recovered as normal, but an arrow removed after hitting a target is destroyed."
