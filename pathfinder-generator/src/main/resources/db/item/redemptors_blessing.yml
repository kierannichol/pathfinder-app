description: "This soothing holy symbol is carved from a single chunk of soapstone,\
  \ and its graceful curves draw the eye. When used to channel positive energy to\
  \ heal living creatures, it also calms nearby creatures.\nAny creature healed by\
  \ the positive energy channeled by a user of a redemptor's blessing must attempt\
  \ a DC 13 Will save or become affected by a calm emotions spell. This effect lasts\
  \ as long as the user continues to brandish the holy symbol and maintain concentration\
  \ or until anyone takes an aggressive action against a calmed creature."
