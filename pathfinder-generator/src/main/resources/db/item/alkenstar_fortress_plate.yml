description: "This dwarf-forged armor features layers of overlapping plates molded\
  \ to deflect projectilesâ€”especially those from firearms. Whenever you are the target\
  \ of a ranged weapon attack that would ignore your armor bonus to AC, you add half\
  \ the fortress plate's armor bonus (including enhancement bonuses) to your AC against\
  \ that attack. This benefit does not apply to energy attacks or magical touch attacks\
  \ such as rays. Because the armor is designed with dwarves in mind, If you have\
  \ the dwarf's weapon familiarity racial trait, you increase this projectile-only\
  \ bonus by 1. Fortress plate is incredibly bulky, and its armor category can't be\
  \ reduced by any effect (including by special materials, such as mithral). Fortress\
  \ plate includes gauntlets and a helm."
