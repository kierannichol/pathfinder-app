description: "This short lash has a reach of only 10 feet, but is otherwise identical\
  \ to a normal whip. The wielder gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Handle Animal checks\
  \ to push a trained animal and on Intimidate checks made to demoralize any animal\
  \ as long as the animal is within the whip's reach. When using the whip to demoralize\
  \ a trained animal, the wielder may choose to fascinate the animal rather than causing\
  \ it to become shaken for the same duration as the shaken condition, but the fascinate\
  \ effect ends if line of sight between the wielder and the animal is broken."
