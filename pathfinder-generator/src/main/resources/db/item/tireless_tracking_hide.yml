description: "This +1 hide armor is always made from the pelt of a migratory herd\
  \ animal. Anyone wearing this armor can maintain a hustle for a full 8 hours without\
  \ growing fatigued, doubling her normal daily overland movement rate. After that,\
  \ the wearer begins to take nonlethal damage each hour, per the hustle rules (Core\
  \ Rulebook 171). This armor does not increase tactical movement during combat. The\
  \ benefits of this armor aren't replenished until the character has had a full night's\
  \ rest."
