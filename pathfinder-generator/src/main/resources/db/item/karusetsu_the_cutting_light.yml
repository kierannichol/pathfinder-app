description: "This exquisitely detailed +3 nodachi (Ultimate Combat 133) comes sheathed\
  \ in a black-lacquered scabbard with gold filigree. Its hilt is wrapped in red dragonhide,\
  \ and a single golden feather hangs from the pommel. Karusetsu enables its wielder\
  \ to execute a flourishing slash three times per day in the direction of a single\
  \ distant opponent (i.e., one not already engaged in melee combat with the wielder)\
  \ up to 60 feet away. This flourishing slash projects a plane of scintillating force\
  \ across the intervening distance, functioning as a ranged attack with a thrown\
  \ weapon using the wielder's highest base attack bonus. On a successful hit, the\
  \ blade's cutting light deals 4d6+3 points of force damage to the target, with a\
  \ threat range of 18–20 and a critical multiplier of ×2. In addition, a creature\
  \ struck by the cutting light must succeed at a DC 14 Reflex save or be blinded\
  \ for 1d4 rounds."
