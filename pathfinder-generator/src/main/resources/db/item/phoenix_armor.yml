description: "This brilliant golden +2 fire resistant full plate is decorated with\
  \ an ornate feather motif curling across its surface and seems to radiate warmth.\
  \ Once per day, the wearer can invoke the name of the phoenix that blessed the armor\
  \ and bring the might of that phoenix against the wearer's foe. Activating the armor\
  \ causes it to ignite, wreathing the wearer in red-gold flames as if under the effects\
  \ of fire shield. In addition, great golden wings unfold out of the back of the\
  \ armor, allowing the wearer to fly as per the spell. Both of these effects last\
  \ for 9 rounds."
