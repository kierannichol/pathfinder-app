description: "This +2 elysian bronze spear is capable of warping space to strike faraway\
  \ targets as if they stood within arm's reach. As a standard action, the farspear's\
  \ wielder can make a single melee attack against a creature within 60 feet as though\
  \ it were within his melee reach. Cover and concealment apply as if making a ranged\
  \ attack. The wielder can use any Vital Strike feat he has as part of this melee\
  \ attack. The Spiresworn based these weapons upon the legendary Azlanti farspears,\
  \ artifacts created by the warrior goddess Acavna that allowed wielders to strike\
  \ from leagues away."
