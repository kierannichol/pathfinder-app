description: "This small wooden ring resembles a serpent with tiny gemstone eyes coiling\
  \ around the wearer's finger. If worn for 24 hours, it causes its wearer to manifest\
  \ many serpentine traits. The wearer's skin develops a faint, diamond-shaped pattern,\
  \ and the pupils of her eyes elongate. The wearer grows a pair of fangs, gaining\
  \ a bite attack as a primary natural attack that deals 1d4 points of piercing damage\
  \ for a Medium wearer or 1d3 points of damage for a Small wearer.\nThree times per\
  \ day as a free action, the wearer of the ring may cause her fangs to drip with\
  \ venom, making her bite attack poisonous for 1 round. The save DC of this poison\
  \ is equal to 10 + 1/2 the wearer's Hit Dice + the wearer's Constitution modifier,\
  \ but otherwise acts as black adder venom. If the wearer rolls a natural 1 on an\
  \ attack with her poisonous bite, she is exposed to the poison.\nOnce per day as\
  \ a standard action, the wearer may command her tongue to lengthen and become forked\
  \ for 1 minute, gaining the scent special ability. While this ability is active,\
  \ the wearer has a 20% chance of failure when casting any spell with a verbal component,\
  \ as the tongue makes it difficult to speak.\nThe ring makes its wearer more sensitive\
  \ to cold. She takes a –2 penalty to saves against spells with the cold descriptor\
  \ and the effects of cold weather. Additionally, if the wearer is successfully affected\
  \ by a spell with the cold descriptor, she is slowed for 1 round."
