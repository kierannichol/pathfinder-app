description: "This suit of +4 greater shadow greater slick leather armor fits as snugly\
  \ as a tight suit of silk against its wearer's skin and harbors an amoral and bloodthirsty\
  \ intelligence. Via the telepathy it shares with its wielder, the armor gives constant\
  \ advice on how to be stealthy, reach out of the way spots, and get the drop on\
  \ foes. It also grants an extra +1d6 points of sneak attack damage, but the wearer\
  \ must already have the sneak attack class feature to gain this bonus. Furthermore\
  \ the armor has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +10 and no arcane spell failure."
