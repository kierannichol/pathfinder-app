description: "Typically worn by jailers or executioners, this outfit includes a black\
  \ woolen shirt, a tunic, pants, a belt, sturdy boots, a balaclava or hood, and a\
  \ great cloak. This outfit is generally too intimidating and macabre to be worn\
  \ in polite company. Some executioner's outfits prominently bear the symbol of the\
  \ government or lawenforcing institution the wearer serves, while others are left\
  \ ragged and stained to appear all the more threatening."
