description: "Circle of death snuffs out the life force of living creatures, killing\
  \ them instantly. The spell slays 1d4 HD worth of living creatures per caster level\
  \ (maximum 20d4). Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; among creatures\
  \ with equal HD, those who are closest to the burst's point of origin are affected\
  \ first. No creature of 9 or more HD can be affected, and HD that are not sufficient\
  \ to affect a creature are wasted."
