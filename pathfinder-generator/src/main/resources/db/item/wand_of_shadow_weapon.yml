name: "Wand of Shadow Weapon"
description: "Drawing upon the Plane of Shadow, you shape a quasi-real masterwork\
  \ melee weapon of a type you are proficient with. You may use this weapon to make\
  \ attacks as if it were a real weapon, dealing normal damage for a weapon of its\
  \ type. The first time you hit a creature with the weapon, it may make a Will save\
  \ to disbelieve; failure means the weapon deals damage normally, success means it\
  \ only takes 1 point of damage from the weapon's attacks. The weapon only deals\
  \ 1 point of damage to objects."
