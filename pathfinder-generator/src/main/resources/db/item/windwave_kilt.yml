description: "This kilt is made of thick woven strips of sea-green and sky-blue cloth\
  \ decorated with tiny pearls and bits of coral along the beltline. The wearer gains\
  \ a +3 competence bonus on Swim checks. When not worn, a windwave kilt floats on\
  \ water like a dry log, automatically buoying upward any creature that weighs 100\
  \ pounds or less and aiding in flotation for heavier creatures.\nIf Gozreh is the\
  \ wearer's patron, once per day the wearer can use gaseous form. In this form, the\
  \ wearer does not need to breathe and can enter water or other liquid, appearing\
  \ as a mass of fine bubbles and gaining the ability to swim at a speed of 10 feet.\
  \ The wearer can also drink salt water as if it were fresh water."
