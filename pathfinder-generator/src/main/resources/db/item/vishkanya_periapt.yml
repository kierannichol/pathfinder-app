description: "This ruby is cut like a droplet of blood and suspended on an elaborate\
  \ golden necklace. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can envenom a wielded\
  \ weapon with her saliva or blood as though she were a vishkanya (Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Advanced Race Guide 208). The wearer must be injured to use her blood with this\
  \ ability, but can voluntarily deal 1 point of damage to herself with piercing or\
  \ slashing weapon in order to use it.\nIf the wearer is a vishkanya, she can use\
  \ her toxic racial trait two additional times per day, and the DC of saving throws\
  \ against her venom increases by 1."
