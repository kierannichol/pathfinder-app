description: "Not every lich that attempts the transition to undeath succeeds. For\
  \ most, this means an excruciating, spellblasted death; for a small fraction of\
  \ others, this means a typically brief but painful existence as a failed lich; but\
  \ for an exceedingly rare few, this means something in between. A phylactery of\
  \ the failed has a minute chance of coming into being anytime a spellcaster attempts\
  \ to achieve lichdom and fails (equivalent to 1 in 100). In such cases, the magicuser's\
  \ body is destroyed, but the phylactery he prepared remains and is invested with\
  \ a remnant of his shattered consciousness. The creature that opens a phylactery\
  \ of the failed must immediately succeed at a DC 30 Will saving throw or be affected\
  \ by a disease-like curse known as a parasitic soul (detailed below). Those affected\
  \ by a parasitic soul have their own personality and sanity overwhelmed by the remnant\
  \ ambitions and memories of the would-be lich whose destruction created the phylactery.\
  \ If the cursed creature is killed by the parasitic soul, her body is animated 1\
  \ day later as a lich with the same memories and abilities of the magic-user who\
  \ created the phylactery, essentially allowing that spellcaster to finally achieve\
  \ lichdom. The cursed creature cannot be returned to life until the lich is destroyed.\n\
  If the parasitic soul is excised from a victim, it returns to the phylactery and\
  \ attempts to infect the next creature to open the box. The parasitic soul can only\
  \ infect one creature at a time. While a creature is infected by a parasitic soul,\
  \ the phylactery the soul is bound to has no dangerous properties and cannot infect\
  \ other creatures.\nThe invasive nature of phylacteries of the failed has spawned\
  \ the creation of several other pernicious magic items, such as the disease-spreading\
  \ death's head coffer (see Pathfinder Adventure Path #8).\nParasitic Soul Curse\
  \ and disease; save Will DC 30; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Intelligence damage;\
  \ cure a parasitic soul can only be cured by casting both a spell that prevents\
  \ the target from being mentally controlled (like protection from evil) and remove\
  \ curse."
destruction: "Casting resurrection upon a phylactery of the failed restores the would-be\
  \ lich to life as a living spellcaster with the statistics the magic-user had before\
  \ attempting the transformation into lichdom. This destroys the phylactery, but\
  \ brings a powerful evil spellcaster back into being."
