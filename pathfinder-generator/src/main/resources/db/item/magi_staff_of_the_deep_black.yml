description: "This crystalline blue-white staff fell from the sky during a dazzling\
  \ display of falling stars. Sages believe it was once part of an enormous piece\
  \ of ice drifting between worlds since the dawn of time, only coming to the world\
  \ on a quirk of chance. Though as hard as crystal, the staff feels like wet ice,\
  \ is cold to the touch, and gives the impression of great age. It slowly sinks in\
  \ fresh or salt water (unlike true ice, which floats), and while it creates a cocoon\
  \ of ice around itself when submerged, it is only after several hours that this\
  \ coating is thick enough to cause the staff to bob to the surface. The staff's\
  \ powers (and the equivalent staff of the magi powers they replace) are:"
destruction: "This item can be destroyed in the same manner as a normal staff of the\
  \ magi. It is also destroyed if consumed by an elder fire elemental or an efreeti,\
  \ or if cast into an active volcano."
