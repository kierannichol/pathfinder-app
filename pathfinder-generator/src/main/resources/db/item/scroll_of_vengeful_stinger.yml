name: "Scroll of Vengeful Stinger"
description: "You grow a long, wasp-like tail complete with stinger that can strike\
  \ those who dare attack you. While you are under the effects of this spell, when\
  \ a creature adjacent to you hits you with a melee attack, you can make an attack\
  \ of opportunity with your stinging tail, even if your opponent's attack would not\
  \ otherwise provoke an attack of opportunity. You must otherwise be eligible to\
  \ make an attack of opportunity to use this ability. The attack is made with your\
  \ full attack bonus, and with a +2 sacred bonus on the attack roll. The stinging\
  \ tail is considered a light weapon with a critical range of 19–20/×2. On a successful\
  \ hit, the target takes 1d8 points of damage plus an amount of damage equal your\
  \ Strength modifier and must succeed at a Fortitude save or it takes 1d4 points\
  \ of Dexterity damage. This poison damage is also modified on a confirmed critical\
  \ hit."
