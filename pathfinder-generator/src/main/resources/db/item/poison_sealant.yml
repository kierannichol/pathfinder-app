description: "Applied poison generally washes off weapons underwater in 1d10 rounds\
  \ unless the poison is contained inside the weapon and injected, so undersea alchemists\
  \ developed poison sealant to circumvent this limitation. Applying poison sealant\
  \ to a poisoned weapon takes the same amount of effort as applying a poison. Once\
  \ applied, the sealant protects the poison from the elements, keeping the weapon\
  \ poisoned underwater. Poison sealant dissolves in blood, allowing the poison's\
  \ delivery (and also meaning that it doesn't prevent accidental poisoning)."
