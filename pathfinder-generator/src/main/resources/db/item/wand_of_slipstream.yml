name: "Wand of Slipstream"
description: "You create a low-cresting wave of water that carries the target along\
  \ the surface of water or the ground. When moving across level ground, the target's\
  \ speed increases by 10 feet. If going downhill, speed increases by 20 feet instead,\
  \ but slipstreamprovides no movement bonus when going uphill. While swimming, the\
  \ slipstreamincreases the target's swim speed by 20 feet--if the target does not\
  \ have a swim speed, this spell grants a swim speed of 20 ft."
