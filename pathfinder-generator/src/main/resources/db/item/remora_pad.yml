description: "This foot-long strip of double-sided alchemical adhesive is sealed with\
  \ waxed paper. When unsealed (this requires a move action) and pressed between two\
  \ surfaces (this also requires a move action), a remora pad creates a firm and waterproof\
  \ bond between two creatures or objects for up to 24 hours. If two creatures connect\
  \ themselves in this way, both gain the grappled condition. However, if they are\
  \ different size categories, only the smaller creature gains this condition.\nThis\
  \ bond survives light buffeting and movement, such as that created by incoming tides\
  \ or by one attached surface dragging the other along underwater. Sharp tugs can\
  \ break the seal fairly easily, and a willingly attached creature can pull free\
  \ of the pad with a successful DC 5 Strength check as a standard action (DC 10 as\
  \ a swift action). This weakness makes remora pads fairly ineffective when attempting\
  \ to grapple a target, though a grappling creature that sticks itself to a target\
  \ with a remora pad receives a +6 circumstance bonus on grapple combat maneuver\
  \ checks to sustain the grapple in subsequent rounds (instead of the normal +5 bonus).\n\
  A remora pad's bond is strong enough to support 200 pounds of material, so bonding\
  \ two heavier objects together requires multiple pads. Underwater travelers often\
  \ use remora pads to attach themselves to trained aquatic animals for long journeys."
