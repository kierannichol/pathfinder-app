description: "Behind this long pole weapon's spearhead, several short branches project\
  \ from the shaft at irregular intervals, each angled forward and tipped with a smaller\
  \ leaf like blade. When you make attacks of opportunity provoked by movement, you\
  \ gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply\
  \ your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls with\
  \ an elven branched spear sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon. Elves\
  \ treat elven branched spears as martial weapons."
