name: "Scroll of Jolting Portent"
description: "The creature you designate is surrounded by a glowing red aura of vengeful\
  \ fate. Once per round when the target makes an attack or casts a spell, it must\
  \ succeed at a Fortitude saving throw with a DC = 10 + 1/2 caster level + Charisma\
  \ (in the case of oracles) or Wisdom (in the case of clerics). If the target fails\
  \ the saving throw, it takes 4d6 + your Charisma modifier (in the case of oracles)\
  \ or Wisdom modifier (in the case of clerics) electricity damage. It takes no damage\
  \ on a successful saving throw. You can dismiss this spell as an immediate action\
  \ when its subject confirms a critical hit to negate the critical hit and daze the\
  \ creature for 1 round. The attack still hits its target and deals normal damage.\
  \ The effects of the daze occur after the attack."
