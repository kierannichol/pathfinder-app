description: "This elixir, derived from ambergris and cytillesh fungus, is used by\
  \ spies, secret agents, and hidden cultists to erase their own memories if they\
  \ might become a liability to themselves or their allies. When drinking the elixir,\
  \ the drinker can select one event or specific piece of information (such as the\
  \ password to enter a thieves' guild, the secret identity of a local vigilante,\
  \ or the location of stashed loot) to forget (Will DC 14 negates). The forgotten\
  \ memory can be restored only with a modify memory spell or similar effect. This\
  \ is a mind-affecting compulsion enchantment."
