description: "The tall, silver collar on this +2 mithral armored coat is attractively\
  \ set off by the coat's deep navy hues and ivory silk trim. A lifecollar coat occupies\
  \ both the chest and the neck magic item slots. The wearer receives a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus to AC and CMD against attacks or maneuvers that specifically target the\
  \ wearer's neck or throat (such as a vampire's check to establish or maintain a\
  \ pin or the roll to confirm a critical hit with a vorpal weapon).\nAdditionally,\
  \ when struck by an attack that would bestow a negative level, the wearer has a\
  \ 50% chance of avoiding the negative level. The wearer may not avoid more than\
  \ 1 negative level per round in this fashion. This effect does not mitigate any\
  \ other damage or remove negative levels previously gained.\nThe silver collar can\
  \ be collapsed and lowered as a full-round action. Doing so frees up the wearer's\
  \ neck slot for other items, but the wearer loses the circumstance bonus to AC and\
  \ CMD against attacks and maneuvers targeting the neck or throat."
