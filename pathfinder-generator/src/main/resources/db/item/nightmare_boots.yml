description: "Prized by evil warriors, these boots are made of inky black leather\
  \ trimmed with a crimson mane of fiendish horsehair. Some bear the hair of actual\
  \ nightmares along their rims, causing them to occasionally flare and crackle with\
  \ flames reminiscent of the foul equines. When the wearer runs or charges, smoke\
  \ issues up from the boots, acting as concealment (20% miss chance) when the wearer\
  \ provokes attacks of opportunity while making those actions. Secondly, three times\
  \ per day, as a swift action, the wearer can make the boots smoke, which grants\
  \ her concealment until the end of her turn. Lastly, once per day, when the wearer\
  \ hits a creature with a melee attack, she can command the boots to ignite. When\
  \ the boots ignite, all creatures within a 5-foot radius take 2d6 points of fire\
  \ damage. A DC 13 Reflex saving throw halves the damage."
