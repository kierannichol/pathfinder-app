description: "This mundane-looking but serviceable sheath fits any bladed slashing\
  \ weapon, from a dagger to a greatsword. When a weapon is placed into the sheath\
  \ of bladestealth, both it and the weapon become invisible (as the invisibility\
  \ spell) until the weapon is drawn, at which point it and the sheath become visible\
  \ again. The invisible sheathed weapon can still be detected by touch, but the bearer\
  \ gains a +5 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal the weapon, and casual inspection\
  \ does not reveal it at all. Other effects that detect or reveal invisible things\
  \ work normally on the sheathed weapon."
