description: "The head of this rod is carved to resemble the visage of the Ancient\
  \ Osirian deity Apep, Devourer of the Dawn, god of chaos, darkness, destruction,\
  \ and snakes. A rod of the devoured dawn can be wielded as a +1 heavy mace. When\
  \ holding the rod, the wielder gains darkvision with a range of 30 feet. Once per\
  \ day, the rod can create a shadowy hypnotic pattern that also functions as dispel\
  \ magic and targets any spells with the light descriptor in the area of effect.\n\
  When the wielder confirms a critical hit with a rod of the devoured dawn on a Medium\
  \ or smaller foe, the head of the rod animates and grants an automatic grapple check\
  \ against the creature struck (this does not provoke an attack of opportunity).\
  \ If the grapple check is successful, the rod's jaw unhinges and expands momentarily\
  \ to swallow the creature, gulping it into a flesh-walled extradimensional space.\
  \ The swallowed target gains the grappled condition and takes 1d8 points of bludgeoning\
  \ damage per round on its turn. The creature can cut its way out (AC 14, hp 24)\
  \ or wriggle out with a successful DC 25 Escape Artist check as a full-round actionâ€”\
  either method of escape causes the victim to be disgorged from the rod into an adjacent\
  \ space. The rod automatically disgorges a swallowed victim if the swallowed creature\
  \ dies or if the rod is destroyed. Only one creature can be swallowed at a time.\
  \ A rod of the devoured dawn only functions if its wielder is chaotic."
