description: "This decrepit longship seems barely seaworthy. Its boards are splintered\
  \ and it is branded with a number of angular runes, each said to bind the soul of\
  \ a sailor to the vessel. Due to its powerful magic, it is seaworthy and very fast\
  \ (though it doesn't offer its passengers much in the way of comfort). It needs\
  \ no crew. Creatures that spend a week on the boat (which is usually discovered\
  \ drifting aimlessly at sea) find that they can control the boat by just speaking\
  \ the name of a port or a description of a specific destination that can be reached\
  \ by way of the sea the runescarred dragonship is currently sailing. The runescarred\
  \ dragonship then sets sail toward that destination. It always takes the safest\
  \ path, navigationally speaking, to the spoken destination. If there is more than\
  \ one creature capable of giving the boat commands, the runescarred dragonship gives\
  \ each order equal weight, changing its course each time a new command is given.\
  \ A runescarred dragonship can carry 5 tons of cargo or 120 Medium creatures. It\
  \ moves at a rate of 10 miles per hour."
destruction: "If a runescarred dragonship is taken 100 miles inland, it crumbles to\
  \ dust."
