description: "This delicate black veil is made of black lace and crepe and affixed\
  \ to a midnight blue bonnet. When it's donned, amorphous shadows swirl beneath the\
  \ veil across the wearer's face.\nWhenever an ally within 30 feet of the wearer\
  \ falls unconscious by taking lethal damage, the bitter widow's veil gains 1 charge.\
  \ The wearer can expend 1 charge as a standard action to unleash a bereaved scream\
  \ in a 30-foot cone. Creatures within the area must succeed at a DC 16 Will save\
  \ or become shaken for 4 minutes. If a creature that brought a humanoid or monstrous\
  \ humanoid to fewer than 0 hit points within the past 12 hours fails the save, it's\
  \ dazed for 1 round as it is consumed with sorrow, after which it's subject to the\
  \ shaken effect.\nAs long as the bitter widow's veil has an unspent charge, the\
  \ wearer can see and hear ethereal creatures as though affected by see invisibility.\
  \ The veil can contain only 1 charge at a time. Unused charges dissipate after 1\
  \ hour."
