description: "This small sack appears empty. Anyone reaching into the bag feels a\
  \ small, fuzzy ball. If the ball is removed and tossed up to 20 feet away, it turns\
  \ into an animal. The animal serves the character who drew it from the bag for 10\
  \ minutes (or until slain or ordered back into the bag), at which point it disappears.\
  \ It can follow any of the commands described in the Handle Animal skill. Each of\
  \ the three kinds of bags of tricks produces a different set of animals. Use the\
  \ following tables to determine what animals can be drawn out of each.\n"
