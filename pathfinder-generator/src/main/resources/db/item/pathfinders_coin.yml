description: "This apparently simple coin, usually styled to resemble ancient currency,\
  \ hides intricate gold and platinum wires within. This matrix, carefully modeled\
  \ after fragmentary Azlanti coins, causes the Pathfinder's coin to rise an inch\
  \ into the air and slowly spin in place if placed atop a wayfinder. In addition,\
  \ when levitating above a wayfinder, the coin can be given a message of 25 words\
  \ or fewer. This message repeats in the speaker's voice the next time the coin is\
  \ floated above a wayfinder. Only one message may be stored at a time, and once\
  \ it is triggered, the message is expended and a new one may be recorded."
