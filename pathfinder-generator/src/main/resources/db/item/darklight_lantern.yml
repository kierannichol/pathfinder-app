description: "This lantern does not burn oil, but instead burns shadowcloy (see below).\
  \ When shadowcloy is used as its fuel, this lantern creates a strange, hazy darkness\
  \ that decreases the light level for 30 feet around it by one step . Unlike when\
  \ shadowcloy is thrown at a single target, this haze does not decrease natural darkness\
  \ to supernatural darkness. One flask of shadowcloy fuels a darklight lantern for\
  \ 1 minute."
