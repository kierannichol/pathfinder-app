description: "This heavy leaden rod is carved with a series of glyphs that resemble\
  \ Terran writing. It has a single activation stud at its base. A creature can activate\
  \ the rod by pressing the stud or by placing the rod on the ground. Once activated,\
  \ the rod creates a field of intensified gravity within a 100-foot radius. Creatures\
  \ within the area weigh twice as much as normal, can move only at half speed, can\
  \ jump only half as far as normal, and can lift and carry only half as much as normal.\
  \ Any flying target has its maneuverability worsened by two steps (from good to\
  \ poor, for example; minimum clumsy) and plummets to the ground unless it succeeds\
  \ at a DC 25 Fly check."
