description: "This silver ring features arboreal motifs, and is set with a small but\
  \ brilliant sapphire. If the wearer has the channel energy class feature, the radius\
  \ of his channeled energy increases by 5 feet. Additionally, when the wearer channels\
  \ energy, he may choose to exempt one creature from the effects of his channeling.\
  \ If the wearer has the Selective Channeling feat, the ring of protected life increases\
  \ the number of creatures he may normally exempt by one. Finally, once per day the\
  \ wearer may channel energy as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity;\
  \ doing so renders the ring of protected life inert for 24 hours, during which time\
  \ it does not confer any benefits."
