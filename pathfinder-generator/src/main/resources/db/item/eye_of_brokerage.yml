description: "This golden, eye-shaped amulet is relatively unassuming save for the\
  \ stunning diamond in the center of the piece. An eye of brokerage grants the wearer\
  \ additional prowess while bartering with merchants and otherwise making deals.\
  \ The wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Appraise checks and on Sense Motive\
  \ checks to avoid being bluffed. In addition, once per day, the wearer can hold\
  \ the eye of brokerage to one of her eyes for up to 7 rounds to determine whether\
  \ up to seven creatures within 40 feet are lying (Will DC 16 negates), as discern\
  \ lies."
