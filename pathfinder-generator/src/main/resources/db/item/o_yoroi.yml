description: "Worn almost exclusively by highranking samurai, o-yoroi—or \"great armor\"\
  —is a heavy combat armor that consists of various supplementary components that\
  \ include both plate and lamellar elements. Each suit is crafted for a specific\
  \ individual and displays the owner's aesthetic. Upon completion, the suit is colored\
  \ and sealed with a final lacquer finish. The centerpiece of o-yoroi is a cuirass\
  \ consisting of two parts—a separate reinforcement for the right side called a waidate,\
  \ and a kikko cuirass. The upper part of the waidate consists of a leather-covered\
  \ iron plate. The cuirass's leather shoulder straps—called watagami—are likewise\
  \ armored with metal plates. Affixed to the cuirass are a number of supplementary\
  \ pieces, including wide lamellar shoulder guards, a kikko sleeve for the shield\
  \ arm, lacquered iron greaves worn over padded silk leggings, and a groin protector.\
  \ The signature component of each suit of armor is the tiered kabuto helmet and\
  \ its accompanying ho-ate mask. Ho-ate masks can be made of hardened leather or\
  \ metal and are fashioned into fearsome visages such as oni, dragons, or other mythical\
  \ beings."
