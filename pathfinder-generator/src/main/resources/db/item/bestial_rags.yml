description: "These tattered and ragged garments extend the duration of a shifter's\
  \ bestial transformations, allowing her to shift into her aspects' minor forms for\
  \ 5 additional minutes per day. Each set of bestial rags is also tied to a specific\
  \ aspect, typically being made of the hide of that creature and embossed with crude\
  \ pictograms of it, allowing a shifter to assume that aspect's minor and major form,\
  \ as appropriate for her level. If the shifter already has the ability to shift\
  \ into that form, that aspect's major form functions as if she were 2 levels higher."
