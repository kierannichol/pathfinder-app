description: "This necklace is a string of intricately carved bones that hold fragments\
  \ of drowned souls. The wearer can mimic the voice of anyone whose spirit is stored\
  \ in the necklace as if using sound mimicry. Additionally, the wearer can destroy\
  \ a bone as a standard action to summon a drowned shade, which has the stats of\
  \ a water elemental with the following changes. A drowned shade gains undead immunities\
  \ and is treated as undead, and it projects a 20-foot-radius drowning aura, which\
  \ imposes a â€“5 penalty on Swim checks to creatures without the aquatic or water\
  \ subtype and negates magical means of breathing underwater. Each round a creature\
  \ holds its breath within the aura counts as 2 rounds for the purpose of drowning.\n\
  Once per day, if the wearer falls below 0 hit points, she can destroy a bone to\
  \ heal herself (this is not an action).\nA minor soul bone summons a Small water\
  \ elemental drowned shade or heals 1d8+11 hit points; a lesser soul bone summons\
  \ a Medium water elemental drowned shade or heals 3d8+11 hit points; a standard\
  \ soul bone summons a Large water elemental drowned shade or heals 5d8+11 hit points;\
  \ and a greater soul bone summons a Huge water elemental drowned shade or heals\
  \ 7d8+11 hit points.\nThe necklace's listed price does not include the price of\
  \ bones. The wearer can add a new soul bone to the necklace by ritually drowning\
  \ a sentient creature and paying the additional cost. The requirements are as follows\
  \ minor (300 gp, 2-HD sacrifice), lesser (1,400 gp, 4-HD sacrifice), standard (2,250\
  \ gp, 8-HD sacrifice), and greater (3,300 gp, 10-HD sacrifice)."
