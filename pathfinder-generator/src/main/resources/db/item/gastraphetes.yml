description: "The gastraphetes, sometimes called a \"belly bow,\" is an oversized\
  \ crossbow reloaded by pressing one end against the ground, the other against one's\
  \ abdomen, and locking the string in place through ratchet action. Reloading takes\
  \ a full-round action, uses two hands, and requires that the wielder be standing.\
  \ Wielding a gastraphetes requires two hands, and due to the weapon's bulk, firing\
  \ it while standing without support (such as a wall, a window, or a stand) imposes\
  \ a â€“4 penalty on attack rolls; you take no penalty for firing a gastraphetes while\
  \ prone. A Large or larger creature can use a gastraphetes one size smaller than\
  \ itself without any support, but takes the normal penalty for firing an inappropriately\
  \ sized weapon."
