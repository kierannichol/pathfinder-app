description: "This rod strikes as a +2 heavy mace. Once per day, upon the wielder's\
  \ command, the head of the rod becomes that of an actual serpent for 10 minutes.\
  \ During this period, any successful strike with the rod deals its usual damage\
  \ and also poisons the creature hit. This poison deals 1d3 points of Constitution\
  \ damage per round for 6 rounds. Poisoned creatures can make a DC 16 Fortitude save\
  \ each round to negate the damage and end the affliction. Multiple hits extend the\
  \ duration by 3 rounds and increase the DC by 2 for each hit. The rod only functions\
  \ if its possessor is evil."
