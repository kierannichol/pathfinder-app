description: "Once each year, a Cradle of Night can infuse a single living creature\
  \ that handles it with a manifestation of the shadowbound corruption. If the creature\
  \ wishes to reject the manifestation, it can do so by succeeding at a DC 25 Will\
  \ save, but if the creature fails this saving throw, it gains the manifestation's\
  \ stain without its gift. A creature with a manifestation of the shadowbound corruption\
  \ that carries a Cradle of Night on its person ceases aging, gains a +4 profane\
  \ bonus to Strength and Constitution, and gains fast healing equal to its total\
  \ Hit Dice. These effects are suppressed whenever the creature is in bright light,\
  \ but time spent not aging does not catch up to the bearer at such times."
destruction: "A Cradle of Night that is exposed to direct sunlight for 8 consecutive\
  \ hours becomes relatively fragile and can be destroyed by damage, but spending\
  \ at least a minute in shadow or darkness removes this fragility. While fragile,\
  \ a Cradle of Night has hardness 15 and 30 hp. If the artifact is destroyed, each\
  \ creature that has willingly accepted a manifestation from the Cradle of Night\
  \ must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or be immediately destroyed, as if by a\
  \ sphere of annihilation. Creatures that did not willingly gain the Cradle of Night's\
  \ manifestations instead immediately lose the shadowbound corruption (and all manifestations\
  \ it granted), but suffer no other ill effect."
