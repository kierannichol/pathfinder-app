description: "This clear, viscous oil comes in a squat bottle with a dropper that\
  \ dispenses one drop of oil at a time. When applied to an early or advanced firearm,\
  \ it seeps into the weapon's inner workings and protects the gun from powder residue\
  \ and everyday wear and tear. Applying firearm oil takes 1 minute; once applied,\
  \ it reduces the misfire value of the firearm by 1 for 1 hour or until the firearm\
  \ is discharged. Firearm oil can't reduce a firearm's misfire value to lower than\
  \ 1. A single bottle contains enough oil for 20 applications on one-handed firearms\
  \ (or 10 applications on two-handed firearms). Crafting firearm oil requires a successful\
  \ DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check."
