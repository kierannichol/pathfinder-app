description: "This tough wickerwork cylinder is typically 3 feet tall and 2 feet wide.\
  \ It has no top or bottom, and can be filled with about 10 cubic feet of earth,\
  \ stone, or other heavy materials while standing upright to provide substantial\
  \ cover. Filling a gabion with earth using a shovel generally requires 4 minutes\
  \ of work for a Medium character or 8 minutes of work for a Small character. One\
  \ gabion provides cover for a Small character and might provide partial cover for\
  \ a Medium character, at the GM's discretion. Two gabions together can provide cover\
  \ to a Medium character, although if they aren't stacked atop each other, they can\
  \ form only a low obstacle depending on the character's height.\nGabions can be\
  \ made of different materials, but the type described here is one of the most common\
  \ varieties.\nCraft (traps) DC 10"
