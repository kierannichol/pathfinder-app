description: "Of the Seven Blades of Conviction wielded by the runelords' champions—\
  weapons known as the Alara'hai to the Thassilonians, the sword of greed was the\
  \ most extravagant—for it was made of magically hardened gold, tempered to the strength\
  \ of adamantine yet retaining its luster. Although made of gold, Chellan functions\
  \ as an adamantine weapon for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing\
  \ hardness. Chellan is a +5 keen scimitar, and its density allows it to damage foes\
  \ as if it were one size category larger than its actual size. It can be properly\
  \ wielded only by characters with a Strength of 18 or higher—all other characters\
  \ must either wield it as a two-handed weapon or take a –2 penalty on attack rolls\
  \ with the weapon.\nWhenever Chellan strikes a foe, the target must succeed at a\
  \ DC 20 Fortitude save or be slowed as per the spell slow (CL 16th). If the sword\
  \ scores a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or be\
  \ turned into a crystalline statue, as if by flesh to stone. Characters turned to\
  \ crystal by Chellan appear to be made of ruby, diamond, or some other valuable\
  \ gem, but are in fact merely colored quartz of little value to looters.\nFanatical\
  \ in the extreme, Chellan seeks to force its wielder into serving Karzoug and furthering\
  \ the runelord's goals. To enforce this purpose of their existence, it can use its\
  \ intelligence and special abilities to aid and manipulate those who think to wield\
  \ it."
destruction: "Karzoug can destroy the sword of greed merely by commanding its destruction\
  \ with his voice (a free action for the runelord)."
