description: "Twice per day, when thrown into the air as a standard action, this palm-sized,\
  \ tufted, purple seed drifts at a rate of 60 feet per round toward a spot clearly\
  \ visualized by the thrower. It can be grabbed out of the air with a successful\
  \ combat maneuver check against a CMD of 20, which ends its flight. The seed flies\
  \ for up to 12 miles (taking 2 hours) before it settles to the ground. A gathlain\
  \ thrower can choose to speak a message of up to 25 words when throwing the seed;\
  \ in this case, the seed repeats the message in the thrower's voice when its flight\
  \ ends.\nIf the thrower speaks a command word as part of the action to throw it,\
  \ the herald seed flies back to where it was last thrown, even if the thrower can't\
  \ visualize the location."
