description: "These soft and subtle boots are constructed of silk and specially cured\
  \ leather. They are specially designed for catfolk feet. They work with the feline\
  \ structure of the race's feet to soften footfalls and to reduce the imprints of\
  \ their tracks. While wearing softpaw boots, a catfolk gains a +1 circumstance bonus\
  \ on Stealth checks. Furthermore, the DC to notice or follow the tracks of a catfolk\
  \ wearing softpaw boots increases by +2."
