description: "This holy symbol is always warm to the touch, and whenever it strikes\
  \ metal it rings out with the sound of a choir of angels. When used as a divine\
  \ focus for a divine spell, the symbol emits a bright light that heals its wearer\
  \ of a number of points of damage equal to the spell's level.\nIf the wearer expends\
  \ one use of mythic power when casting a divine spell that uses this holy symbol\
  \ as its divine focus, the emblem glows for a number of rounds equal to the wearer's\
  \ mythic tier, shedding light like a torch. Instead of this item's normal effect,\
  \ at the start of each of the wearer's turns, she and all her allies within 30 feet\
  \ heal a number of points of damage equal to 1d6 + the wearer's tier. This effect\
  \ lasts as long as the light persists."
