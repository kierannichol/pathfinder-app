description: "This small lacquered box made from exotic and colorful woods contains\
  \ five vials and a single dropper. The vials are labeled \"glass,\" \"iron,\" \"\
  paper,\" \"stone,\" and \"wood,\" and each contains a magical fluid that permanently\
  \ transforms solid objects it touches into that material. Administering the fluid\
  \ requires the included dropper, is a standard action, and provokes an attack of\
  \ opportunity (similar to drinking a potion, and the attacker can strike at the\
  \ dropper instead of the bearer). For example, using the vial marked \"paper\" on\
  \ a lock transforms the lock into paper, with all of the various properties of paper\
  \ (hardness, hit points, flammability, and so on). If the target object has a volume\
  \ of one cubic foot or less, the transformation occurs instantly. Larger objects\
  \ slowly transform at a rate of 1 hour per cubic foot of material (maximum 10 cubic\
  \ feet affected). Each vial contains 5 applications of that particular fluid. Magical\
  \ and attended objects may resist this transformation with a successful DC 17 Fortitude\
  \ save."
