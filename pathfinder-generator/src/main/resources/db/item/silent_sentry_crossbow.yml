description: "Popular with assassins and vigilantes due to its ease of concealment\
  \ and lack of need for ammunition, this durable +2 endless ammunition light crossbow\
  \ is crafted from wood blackened over an alchemically treated fire. When used in\
  \ conjunction with the Stealth skill, the silent sentry crossbow reduces the penalty\
  \ imposed by sniping by 5.\nThree times per day, the wielder can fire two invisible\
  \ magical bolts that deal no damage. These bolts must each be fired at a solid surface,\
  \ into which they embed themselves. As long as both bolts have an unobstructed line\
  \ between them, no longer than 180 feet, they create an invisible 1-inch-wide line\
  \ between themselves. The wearer is mentally alerted anytime a visible Tiny or larger\
  \ creature passes through this line, and gains a vision of the creature's appearance.\
  \ Creatures that can see invisible objects can see the line, and if they recognize\
  \ it for what it is, they can duck under it or leap over it, thus avoiding detection.\
  \ The bolts last for 6 hours before they dissipate."
