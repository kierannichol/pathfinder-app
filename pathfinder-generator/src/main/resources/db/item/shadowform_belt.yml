description: "When wrapped around a wearer's waist, this belt grants a +6 enhancement\
  \ bonus to Dexterity. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours\
  \ the belt is worn. Furthermore, as a swift action, its wearer can become incorporeal.\
  \ While incorporeal, he does not gain a deflection bonus to AC based on his Charisma,\
  \ but his natural armor bonus is converted to deflection bonus. The wearer can remain\
  \ incorporeal for up to 10 rounds per day. The rounds need not be consecutive."
