  \ out of its nightmares. Each round, the subject makes a full-attack action against\
  \ the creature. A flying creature can still attempt a Fly check to hover. Each round\
  \ on its turn after making a full attack against the imaginary creature, the subject\
  \ can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. The subject is fatigued for\
  \ 1 minute after the spell ends."
