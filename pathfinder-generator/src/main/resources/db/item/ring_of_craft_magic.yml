description: "A ring of craft magic always bears some sort of tool-like design in\
  \ its craftsmanship. The wearer of the ring sees spells as similar to crafts, and\
  \ vice versa. The wearer may make a Craft check in place of a Spellcraft check to\
  \ identify an item that could be created with that Craft skill. The wearer may also\
  \ expend a spell slot or prepared spell to gain an enhancement bonus equal to the\
  \ level of the expended spell on a single Craft or Profession check (regardless\
  \ of the amount of time needed to make the check)."
