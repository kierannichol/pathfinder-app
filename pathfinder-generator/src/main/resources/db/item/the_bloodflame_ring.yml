description: "This beautiful adamantine ring is warm to the touch. Artful pictures\
  \ etched inside it tell the tale of its creation; the imagery claims that this ring\
  \ was one of the first items crafted by employing heat to coerce metal into shape.\
  \ When worn, it transforms your blood into pure molten iron, which does not harm\
  \ you, and provides certain benefits: you gain the fire subtype. Any creature striking\
  \ you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time\
  \ the attacker takes 1d6 points of fire damage. Creatures that drain blood (such\
  \ as stirges and vampires) take the standard fire damage for attacking you and you\
  \ do not suffer any effects of their blood drain special ability. you count as a\
  \ ferrous creature for the purpose of rusting grasp and similar effects."
