description: "A wind fan appears to be nothing more than a wood and papyrus or cloth\
  \ instrument with which to create a cooling breeze. By uttering the command word,\
  \ its possessor causes the fan to duplicate a gust of wind spell. The fan can be\
  \ used once per day with no risk. If it is used more frequently, there is a 20%\
  \ cumulative chance per usage during that day that the device tears into useless,\
  \ nonmagical tatters."
