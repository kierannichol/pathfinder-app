description: "Crafted from the flayed skin of a barbed devil, this imposing +2 spiked\
  \ hide armor weighs half the normal weight. When its wearer rages, the armor's spikes\
  \ elongate and the hide bonds to her skin, providing fire resistance 10. Any creature\
  \ that strikes the wearer with a melee weapon, unarmed strike, or a natural weapon\
  \ while the spikes are elongated takes 1d8+6 points of piercing damage from the\
  \ armor's barbs (unless using a weapon with reach). While the wearer is enraged,\
  \ spells that cause additional damage to evil outsiders deal that increased damage\
  \ to her.\nA barbarian with fiend totem rage powers gains additional benefits from\
  \ hamatula hide. If she has the lesser fiend totem rage power, she gains a +1 profane\
  \ bonus to Armor Class while raging. If she has the fiend totem rage power, the\
  \ damage caused by her barbs increases to 2d8+6 and stacks with the barbed defense\
  \ granted by the armor. If she has the greater fiend totem ability, she gains fire\
  \ resistance 20 when raging."
