description: "This chalky yellow powder is usually kept in a finely woven canvas pouch.\
  \ When you mix firepowder with fine sand, the resultant mixture quickly heats up\
  \ until it combusts, creating a slow-burning flame that requires no additional fuel.\
  \ Half a pound of firepowder takes 1 minute to mix, and the fire produced burns\
  \ for 8 hours, equivalent to a standard campfire."
