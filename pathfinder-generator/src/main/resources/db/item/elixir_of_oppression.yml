description: "This elixir is normally made from the juice of tomb herald brambles,\
  \ though other formulae have also been discovered. It allows creatures with the\
  \ scent ability to smell fear, and instills a bloodlust in the imbiber when it's\
  \ facing a fearful creature. The imbiber gains a +4 competence bonus on Perception\
  \ checks made with the scent ability, and a successful DC 15 Perception check allows\
  \ the imbiber to determine by scent whether a creature is shaken, frightened, or\
  \ panicked. Once a creature's condition has been identified, the imbiber gains a\
  \ +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and opposed skill checks against that opponent.\n\
  These effects last for 1d4+1 hours. If a creature drinks a second elixir of oppression\
  \ within 24 hours of the first, it is sickened for 24 hours and does not gain the\
  \ benefits of the second dose."
