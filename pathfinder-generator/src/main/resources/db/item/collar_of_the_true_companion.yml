description: "Although it appears to be a simple thong of leather, this collar was\
  \ initially conceived by druids who believed that there were animals who possessed\
  \ spirits worthy of elevation to true sentience. If worn by a creature of the animal\
  \ type with an Intelligence less than 3, a collar of the true companion grants a\
  \ +2 enhancement bonus to Intelligence. This does not give the animal the ability\
  \ to speak, but it does allow it to understand one spoken language (chosen by the\
  \ item's creator).\nIf the collar is worn for at least 1 week by a creature of the\
  \ animal type, the creature is raised to humanlike sentience, as though by the awaken\
  \ spell. Once this occurs, the collar loses its magical properties.\nIf a collar\
  \ of the true companion is worn for more than 1 week by a creature not of the animal\
  \ type, the wearer is feebleminded until the collar is removed."
