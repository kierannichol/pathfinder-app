description: "While antitoxin, as presented in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook, presents\
  \ a generalized tool for protecting oneself from poison, more specialized antivenoms\
  \ can provide even greater protection against specific poisons. Creating a dose\
  \ of antivenom requires a dose of the specific poison that the antivenom is designed\
  \ to protect against.\nAntivenom Effects: A single dose of antivenom automatically\
  \ neutralizes the first exposure of the specific poison it is made to combat and\
  \ provides a +8 alchemical bonus on saving throws against additional exposure to\
  \ that specific poison; this bonus decreases by 1 every hour, until the effect ends\
  \ after 8 hours.\nCrafting Antivenom: To create a dose of antivenom, a living creature\
  \ must first be exposed to a half dose of the poison in question. The creature suffers\
  \ the poison's effects normally, except the saving throw DC to resist the poison\
  \ is reduced by 2. In order to be able to produce antivenom, the creature must succeed\
  \ at the necessary saving throws to be cured of the poison. If the poison's duration\
  \ expires without the creature being cured, no antivenom can be harvested. Once\
  \ the creature has resisted the poison's effects, a viable sample of the creature's\
  \ blood can be extracted with a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) or Heal check.\
  \ This blood must then be refined to extract the natural antibodies that combat\
  \ the poison in a process that takes 1 hour and requires a successful Craft (alchemy)\
  \ check (DC = 5 + the poison's saving throw DC). Success yields 1 dose of antivenom.\
  \ Antivenom can also be harvested in the same fashion from a creature that has been\
  \ afflicted by a full dose of poison, rather than a creature deliberately given\
  \ a half dose for this purpose. Regardless of how much poison the creature is exposed\
  \ to, the antibodies in its system can be harvested only for 24 hours after it has\
  \ recovered from the poison.\nPurchasing Antivenom: Antivenom is not particularly\
  \ expensive, but because it is highly specialized, it can be difficult to find.\
  \ A dose of antivenom has a market price equal to half the market price of a dose\
  \ of the poison in question, but it is treated as though its price were five times\
  \ the market price of the poison for the purposes of determining its availability\
  \ in any given settlement. Alternatively, if 1 or more doses of the poison in question\
  \ can be provided, most alchemists will supply as much antivenom as they can produce\
  \ from the doses for a fee of 10% of the market price of the poison."
