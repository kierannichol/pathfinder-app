name: "Wand of Blade of Light"
description: "This spell infuses a weapon with pure sunlight (the weapon need not\
  \ be a bladed weapon). A weapon enhanced by this spell sheds light as if daylight\
  \ had been cast on it. It functions as a magic and good weapon for the purposes\
  \ of overcoming damage reduction. The weapon grants a +2 sacred bonus on attack\
  \ rolls against undead and deals +1d6 points of damage on a successful hit against\
  \ such foes; against incorporeal undead, it functions as if it had the ghost touch\
  \ weapon special ability. The weapon automatically confirms critical hits against\
  \ foes that are vulnerable to sunlight."
