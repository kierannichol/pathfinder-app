name: "Wand of Unbearable Brightness"
description: "Your body glows with a terrible light. Creatures within 30 feet of you\
  \ that can see you are dazzled (no saving throw). Creatures with light sensitivity\
  \ must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or be blinded. This light counts as daylight\
  \ for the purpose of affecting darkness effects (and vice versa). If the emanation\
  \ enters an area under the effect of magical darkness (or vice versa), both effects\
  \ are temporarily negated so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist\
  \ in the overlapping areas of effect. Dazzled and blinded conditions from your light\
  \ end when the spell ends or when the creature is out of line of sight."
