description: "This masterwork harrow carrying case protects the harrow deck within\
  \ from harm. When the case is used as part of a harrowing, the light level within\
  \ 15 feet of the case darkens to dim light and miniature illusions of the interpreted\
  \ cards appear in front of the harrower and her subjects. While stored in a traveler's\
  \ grandiose carrying case, a harrow deck gains a +2 bonus on saves against effects\
  \ that specifically target the deck."
