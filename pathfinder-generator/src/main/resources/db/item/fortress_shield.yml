description: "The wearer of this +1 tower shield may, as a full-round action, transform\
  \ the shield into a 1-inch-thick cube of iron that springs into being around him,\
  \ completely enclosing his space. The cube has hardness 10 and 30 hit points per\
  \ side. This cube grants the wearer total cover against everything outside the cube,\
  \ including (as it is perfectly sealed) swarms and gas attacks. The inside of the\
  \ cube is dark, and air cannot get in or out so the wearer must hold his breath\
  \ starting on the third round after activating the cube. Attacks sufficient to destroy\
  \ one side of the cube cause it to immediately transform back into a shield, which\
  \ loses half its hit points and gains the broken condition. Otherwise, the cube\
  \ reverts to shield form upon command, if the wearer moves from his current space,\
  \ or if the wearer falls unconscious or dies."
