  \ the brick, allowing her to repair damaged constructs and objects as if they were\
  \ living creatures. The item works whether the bearer channels positive or negative\
  \ energy. If the bearer has the Artifice domain, she adds +2d6 points of damage\
  \ to her artificer's touch domain power when repairing constructs and objects."
