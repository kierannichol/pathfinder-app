description: "This item appears to be a normal cloak, with a pattern very similar\
  \ to a major cloak of displacement nocturnal designs, but when worn its magical\
  \ properties distort and warp light waves. This displacement works similar to the\
  \ blur spell, granting a 20% miss chance on attacks against the wearer. It functions\
  \ continually."
