description: "Slave collars are popular items among drow, duergar, and other Darklands\
  \ societies that require obedience and servitude from slave castes. As these collars\
  \ are relatively costly, they are typically reserved for use on particularly powerful\
  \ or desirable slaves. A slave collar consists of a simple ring of metal (typically\
  \ brass or bronze) that latches in place with a lock. Many feature additional adornments\
  \ like short lengths of chain. Each slave collar's lock is attuned to a unique key.\
  \ The person who carries a collar's key is aware of that collar's wearer as if it\
  \ were the target of a constant status spell. In addition, the key carrier can communicate\
  \ telepathically with the wearer of the collar as long as the wearer is within 100\
  \ feet of her. As long as a slave collar is worn, that collar's key carrier automatically\
  \ penetrates the collar wearer's spell resistance (if any), and the collared creature\
  \ takes a –5 penalty on all saving throws against the key carrier's spells. A slave\
  \ collar's lock can be picked with a successful DC 40 Disable Device check, or broken\
  \ open with a successful DC 30 Strength check—either method immediately destroys\
  \ the slave collar. The wearer of a slave collar takes a –10 penalty on Disable\
  \ Device or Strength checks made to disable the slave collar it wears."
