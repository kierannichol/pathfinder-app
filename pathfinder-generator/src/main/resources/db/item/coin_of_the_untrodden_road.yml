description: "When tossed into the air, this tarnished copper coin brings forth potential\
  \ lost by life's decisions. If a human, half-elf, or half-orc flips the coin and\
  \ catches it, she takes a –2 penalty to the ability score modified by her +2 racial\
  \ ability score bonus, but gains a +2 inherent bonus to a random other ability score.\
  \ The bonus and penalty last for 1 hour. Negating the penalty automatically negates\
  \ the bonus as well. The coin can be used three times per day."
