description: "This chalice can be made to a variety of specifications, but is usually\
  \ elegantly designed. Once per day when the user speaks a command word, the next\
  \ time any potable liquid is poured into the chalice, it is infused with poison,\
  \ as per the spell (Fortitude DC 16), which can be delivered as an ingested or contact\
  \ poison (chosen when the command word is spoken). The poison remains potent for\
  \ 24 hours, after which it becomes inert."
