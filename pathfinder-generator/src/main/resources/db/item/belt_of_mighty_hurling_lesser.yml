description: "This thick leather belt is buckled with a bright bronze clasp in the\
  \ shape of a fist. When worn, it grants its wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength\
  \ and allows him to apply his Strength modifier as a bonus on attack rolls instead\
  \ of his Dexterity modifier when making ranged attacks with thrown weapons. Also,\
  \ the range increment of any weapon thrown by the wearer gains a +10-foot bonus.\
  \ Treat this Strength bonus as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours\
  \ the belt is worn."
