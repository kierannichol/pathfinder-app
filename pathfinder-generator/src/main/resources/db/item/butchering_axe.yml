description: "A creation of the orc smiths of Belkzen, this axe has an oversized head\
  \ bristling with spikes and a long, thick haft that only barely counterbalances\
  \ its weight. If your Strength is less than 19 (or 17 for a Small or smaller butchering\
  \ axe), you take a â€“2 penalty on attacks with it, as you're unable to maneuver its\
  \ daunting size and weight."
