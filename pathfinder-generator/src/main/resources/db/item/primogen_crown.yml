description: "This crenellated gold coronet, decorated with jewels and etchings of\
  \ lions, seems heavier in the hand than expected. A single roaring lion's head decorates\
  \ the crown's front. The Primogen Crown grants its wearer a +5 resistance bonus\
  \ on saving throws, a +5 deflection bonus to AC, immunity to mind-affecting effects,\
  \ spell resistance equal to the wearer's CR + 11, a constant true seeing effect,\
  \ and the ability to speak and be clearly heard by all sentient creatures within\
  \ 1,000 feet. The crown also grants a +4 enhancement bonus to the wearer's Intelligence,\
  \ Wisdom, and Charisma scores (with ranks in Knowledge [history] and Knowledge [nobility]\
  \ as well as the ability to speak and read Azlanti and Celestial, as per a headband\
  \ of vast intelligence). Once per day, the wearer of the Primogen Crown can cast\
  \ the following as spell-like abilities (CL 20th): banishment, control weather,\
  \ and greater dispel magic.\nThe Primogen Crown must be bonded to its wearer in\
  \ a coronation ceremony in the Imperial Palace of Taldor to access its full power.\
  \ Without this ceremony, the crown does not grant its wearer any spell-like abilities,\
  \ spell resistance, bonus to AC, immunity to mind-affecting abilities, or bonus\
  \ to mental attributes—only the +5 resistance bonus on saving throws. Once bonded\
  \ to the crown, the wearer cannot knowingly speak or write a lie while wearing the\
  \ Primogen Crown."
destruction: "The Primogen Crown must be heated in Glory's Flame, in the grand lighthouse\
  \ of Mut to the east, and then cast into the icy headwaters of the Porthmos River\
  \ to the west while still hot. The sudden cooling shatters it."
