description: "A combination of a coat pistol and a blade, the dagger pistol can be\
  \ used as both weapons. The awkwardness of the configuration means you do not gain\
  \ the bonus on Sleight of Hand checks that either of those stand-alone weapons grants.\
  \ The dagger pistol is considered a double weapon for the purpose of creating masterwork\
  \ or magical versions of this weapon. If this firearm gains the broken condition,\
  \ both the firearm component and the dagger component are considered broken. A dagger\
  \ pistol uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical\
  \ cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm."
