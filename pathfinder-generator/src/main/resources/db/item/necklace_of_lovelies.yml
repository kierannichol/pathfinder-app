description: "This repugnant and cruel magic item consists of a chain of cold iron\
  \ on which dangle six tiny, cold iron cages, each of which contains a living but\
  \ miniaturized pixie. While the pixies are free to shriek and yell and cry, the\
  \ item prevents them from taking any action that would directly free them from their\
  \ cage and suppresses all of their supernatural and spell-like abilities.\nAs a\
  \ swift action, the wearer of a necklace of lovelies can redirect hit point damage\
  \ inflicted on him from any single attack or effect that damages him onto one of\
  \ the pixies on the necklace—doing so automatically kills the poor pixie in a tiny\
  \ explosion of blood. Once all of the necklace's pixies are dead or released, the\
  \ necklace becomes nonmagical.\nThe magic of a necklace of lovelies can also be\
  \ released by breaking open one of the tiny pixie cages (hardness 10; hp 10; Break\
  \ DC 20). If the cage contains a living pixie, the grateful fey quickly escapes\
  \ and returns to normal size—in so doing, the wash of energy allows the pixie to\
  \ bestow luck upon the creature who broke that particular cage if the pixie so chooses\
  \ (most pixies are grateful enough to a rescuer to automatically grant this boon).\
  \ An instant after the luck is bestowed, the grateful pixie vanishes (presumably\
  \ back to the area in which he or she was first imprisoned in the necklace during\
  \ its creation). The luck granted by this effect can be used at any point once during\
  \ the next 7 days as a swift action whenever a d20 is rolled—it allows the lucky\
  \ soul to roll 2d20 and pick which result he wishes to accept."
