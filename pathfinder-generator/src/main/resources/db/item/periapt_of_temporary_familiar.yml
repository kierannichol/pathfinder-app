description: "This clear blue crystal amulet contains a pearl figurine depicting a\
  \ miniature animal on the familiar list, such as a bat, monkey, or raven. Three\
  \ times per day, the wearer can call forth the animal depicted in the amulet to\
  \ serve as her familiar. This temporary familiar has all of the familiar abilities\
  \ as if the wearer was a 5th-level wizard, and remains for 5 minutes or until it\
  \ is reduced to 0 hit points. If the temporary familiar is reduced to 0 hit points,\
  \ it cannot be summoned again for 24 hours. The familiar retains memories from past\
  \ summonings. Only those without familiars of their own can activate a periapt of\
  \ temporary familiar."
