description: "The haunting strains of any music played on this unusually light, gold-inlaid\
  \ oak lute travel farther than that of any mundane instrument, as if carried by\
  \ the wind. If a bard uses this lute to play a bardic performance with a limited\
  \ range (such as countersong or distraction), the range of the bardic performance\
  \ increases by 10 feet. If the bard is a sylph, the range increases by 20 feet instead."
