description: "The eye of the void normally appears to be a small black glass or crystal\
  \ ball 3 to 4 inches in diameter. However, when commanded to open, the eye reveals\
  \ itself as the terrifying, multi-pupilled eye of some abomination from the dark\
  \ spaces between the stars. Once per day, the bearer may hold the eye and speak\
  \ one of two command words to open the eye. The first word creates a gaze effect\
  \ in a 30-foot cone. The second word creates a gaze effect in a 15- foot sphere.\
  \ Each creature subject to the gaze must make a DC 16 Will save; success means the\
  \ creature is shaken for 1 minute, failure means it becomes frightened for 1 minute\
  \ and takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage. This is a mindaffecting fear effect."
