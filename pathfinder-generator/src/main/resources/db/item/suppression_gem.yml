description: "This small gem crackles and sparks with arcing electricity. As a standard\
  \ action, a creature can attempt to place the gem on a construct with a touch attack\
  \ that provokes an attack of opportunity. Once placed, the creature that placed\
  \ the gem can issue orders to the construct as if that creature were the original\
  \ creator until the gem is destroyed. The construct can resist any self-destructive\
  \ commands with a successful DC 14 Will save. The original owner of the construct\
  \ can use a standard action to attempt to regain control of the construct with a\
  \ successful Charisma check, opposed by a Charisma check attempted by the gem's\
  \ user. The gem's user can attempt to regain control in the same fashion. A suppression\
  \ gem has 30 hit points and hardness 10."
