description: "The blade of this +1 limning short sword pulsates with a faint blue\
  \ glow when wielded. When its wielder is targeted by ranged attacks, an arrow slicer\
  \ shines even brighter, alerting its user of the incoming danger and granting a\
  \ +2 bonus on Perception checks to act in the surprise round.\nOnce per round when\
  \ the wielder is targeted by an attack from a ranged weapon that uses nonfirearm\
  \ ammunition, he can attempt a DC 20 Reflex saving throw as an immediate action\
  \ to deflect the projectile. If he exceeds the DC by more than 5, he not only deflects\
  \ the projectile but also slices it in half, and all foes within 30 feet that can\
  \ see the wielder do so become shaken for 1d4 rounds; this is a fear effect and\
  \ can affect a given creature only once per day. Large projectiles, such as boulders\
  \ hurled by giants and ballista bolts, can't be deflected or cut in half."
