description: "On command, this ring gives its wearer the ability to see into and through\
  \ solid matter. Vision range is 20 feet, with the viewer seeing as if he were looking\
  \ at something in normal light even if there is no illumination. X-ray vision can\
  \ penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or\
  \ dirt. Thicker substances or a thin sheet of lead blocks the vision.\nUsing the\
  \ ring is exhausting, causing the wearer 1 point of Constitution damage per minute\
  \ after the first 10 minutes of use in a single day. The ring must be used in 1-minute\
  \ increments."
