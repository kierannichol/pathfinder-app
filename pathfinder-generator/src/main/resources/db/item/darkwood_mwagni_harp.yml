description: "Musicians in the Mwangi Expanse make frequent use of carved harps strung\
  \ with strings made from natural materials. These harps often feature ornately detailed\
  \ soundboards and necks shaped like creatures that inhabit the region. Harps crafted\
  \ from darkwood are very light compared to similar instruments, yet they retain\
  \ the resonance and tonal quality demanded by the pickiest of musicians. A darkwood\
  \ Mwangi harp is a masterwork musical instrument (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment\
  \ 78) that grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform checks when using it."
