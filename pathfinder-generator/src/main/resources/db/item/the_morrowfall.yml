description: "The Morrowfall is one-half of the Aohl, an artifact gifted to the ancient\
  \ Jaytirian Society following a sacred truce between their two feuding gods of millennia\
  \ past. The Morrowfall is the remaining manifestation of the power of Easivra, a\
  \ potent sun god now all but forgotten (it's a DC 30 Knowledge [religion] check\
  \ to learn Easivra's name, but any good-aligned creature that touches the Morrowfall\
  \ immediately knows the name and how to use the artifact's powers). The Morrowfall\
  \ constantly emits daylight, as per the spell. In addition, by presenting it strongly\
  \ and uttering Easivra's name (a standard action), the Morrowfall can be used to\
  \ cast the following spells.\nAt Will — detect undead, disrupt undead, daze monster\
  \ (DC 13)\n3/day — blindness (DC 13), daylight, searing light\n1/day — sunbeam (DC\
  \ 20), sunburst (DC 22)"
destruction: "When the Morrowfall is joined with its counterpart, the Totemrix, its\
  \ powers (as well as those of the Totemrix) are suppressed. In this state, both\
  \ it and the Totemrix can be destroyed by anything capable of destroying a magic\
  \ metal object of its size."
