description: "This bone ring is the shape of an elongated rat biting its own tail.\
  \ The wearer gains a bite attack as a primary natural attack. This attack deals\
  \ 1d4 points of piercing damage for a Medium wearer or 1d3 points of damage for\
  \ a Small wearer. After about a week of wearing the ring, the wearer's appearance\
  \ becomes more ratlike, though she still looks like a member of her original race\
  \ (for example, a human might gain prominent teeth)."
