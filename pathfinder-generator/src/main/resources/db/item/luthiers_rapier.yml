description: "Many stories feature Luthier, Knight of the Vineyard, champion of good\
  \ and Cayden Cailean's trusted ally. These legends often mention Luthier's elegant\
  \ rapier, and while the original Luthier's rapier undoubtedly remains with its owner,\
  \ copies surface from time to timeâ€”usually when a faithful follower of Cayden Cailean\
  \ requires assistance.\nRose-hued steel forms the length of the blade, and gold\
  \ flowers seem to blossom in the filigreed basket-hilt. A large ruby glimmers at\
  \ the hilt's center. Luthier's rapier is a +1 holy rapier. Once per day, you can\
  \ activate the power of the ruby embedded in the rapier's hilt to gain a +4 sacred\
  \ bonus to Charisma and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects.\
  \ These bonuses last for 10 minutes.\nAlso, once, you can command the gem to shatter\
  \ in an explosion of red light. Every creature except you within 30 feet must make\
  \ a DC 20 Will save or be dazed for 3 rounds. Once you shatter the gem in this fashion,\
  \ the rapier becomes just a normal +1 rapier."
