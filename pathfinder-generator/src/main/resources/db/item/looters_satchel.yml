description: "This maroon satchel is embroidered with slightly glowing runes. The\
  \ satchel functions as a bag of holding (type I). Additionally, as long as the satchel\
  \ is not overloaded, the bearer can hold it over an adjacent creature that is dead\
  \ or unconscious and speak a command word. When the command word is spoken, the\
  \ satchel removes any magic items from the creature's person (such as magic weapons\
  \ and armor, potions, scrolls, and wondrous items) and deposits them into the bag.\
  \ This process takes 1 uninterrupted round. If the bearer moves into a different\
  \ space while the satchel is gathering items in this way, no items are moved into\
  \ the satchel and the bearer must start the process over. If the satchel would become\
  \ overloaded from the creature's magic items, it transports as many magic items\
  \ as it can, from smallest to largest, until it would become overloaded, at which\
  \ point it stops gathering items."
