description: "This set of 54 cards is adorned with designs reminiscent of doors and\
  \ gates. As a standard action, the user can press a card from the deck against a\
  \ 5-foot section of a wall. The wall must be nonmagical, can be up to 2 feet thick,\
  \ and must have hardness 8 or lower. In a flash of silvery light, the card grows\
  \ into a good wooden door (hardness 5, 15 hp) and embeds itself in the wall for\
  \ 5 rounds, its appearance matching the style of the surrounding architecture. If\
  \ the user presses two cards against a wall at the same time, the cards instead\
  \ turn into a double door for 10 rounds. The door can be opened from either side,\
  \ allowing passage through the affected section of the wall. When the duration ends,\
  \ the door peels off the wall and withers into a blank, nonmagical card, leaving\
  \ the wall intact. When used in an urban chase encounter (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery\
  \ Guide 232), a card from the deck lowers the DC of any one Strength- or Dexterity-based\
  \ obstacle by 5 for 5 rounds (or 10 rounds if two cards are used)."
