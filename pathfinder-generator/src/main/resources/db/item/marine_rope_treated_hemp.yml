description: "Rope used by surface dwellers breaks down when submerged for long periods,\
  \ so undersea dwellers make use of rope designed to withstand their environment.\
  \ Treated hemp rope is usually created by surfacers in the same manner as hemp rope,\
  \ but it is infused with beeswax or linseed oil to preserve its integrity underwater.\
  \ This rope is therefore only commonly used by underwater races that trade with\
  \ land dwellers on a regular basis. Woven kelp rope is crafted from specially grown\
  \ seaweed by undersea communities and is much more common in insular or deepwater\
  \ communities.\nBoth types of marine rope are sold in 50-foot lengths. Treated hemp\
  \ has 2 hit points and can be broken with a DC 23 Strength check. Woven kelp has\
  \ 3 hit points and can be broken with a DC 24 Strength check."
