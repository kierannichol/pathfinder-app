description: "Reprisal is an unusually well-balanced and responsive +2 rapier. Reprisal\
  \ 's wielder can apply her Dexterity modifier to damage rolls with the weapon in\
  \ place of her Strength modifier—this bonus is not increased if Reprisal is wielded\
  \ two-handed, but is halved if the rapier is wielded in an off-hand. If Reprisal\
  \ confirms a critical hit against an evil outsider, the rapier gains the evil-outsider-bane\
  \ special ability and is treated as silver, cold iron, and good for the purposes\
  \ of overcoming damage reduction for the next minute. Subsequent critical hits extend\
  \ this duration by 1 minute per blow. As long as this effect persists, Reprisal\
  \ 's wielder gains a +2 sacred bonus on all saving throws against attacks from evil\
  \ outsiders. These effects end prematurely if Reprisal is sheathed, disarmed, or\
  \ is otherwise no longer wielded."
destruction: "If Reprisal is used to knowingly and deliberately murder a true worshiper\
  \ of Cayden Cailean, the rapier may thereafter be destroyed normally, as if it were\
  \ not an artifact."
