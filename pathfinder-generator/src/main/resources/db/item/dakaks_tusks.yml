description: "Containing the bound essence of a troll warlord, this matched pair of\
  \ +1 vicious heavy picks rends flesh with horrifying efficiency. Each pick is a\
  \ darkwood shaft pierced by a weathered tusk. The ends of the picks are connected\
  \ with a cord of dried sinew. This cord is long enough that the picks can be wielded\
  \ with one in each hand. A wielder holding only one of the picks can recover its\
  \ mate with a swift action as though the unattended pick were on a weapon cord.\n\
  If the wielder hits an opponent with both picks in the same round, the picks additionally\
  \ deal 1d4 points of bleed damage."
