description: "This brass compass's needle appears to be of a weird material, one that\
  \ shimmers silver and blue. When held in hand in a magic-warped region such as the\
  \ Mana Wastes, a wanderer compass points toward the nearest pocket of magical non-interference-an\
  \ area where there is little or no chance of spellcasting being warped by primal\
  \ magic. This effect has a range of 1 mile. If no pockets of non-interference are\
  \ within range, the compass's needle slowly spins clockwise. If the bearer of a\
  \ wanderer compass is already within a pocket of non-interference, the compass needle\
  \ spins counter-clockwise."
