description: "These weapons fit snugly around the knuckles and allow you to deal lethal\
  \ damage with an unarmed strike. You may hold, but not wield, a weapon or other\
  \ object in a hand wearing brass knuckles. You may cast a spell with a somatic component\
  \ while wearing brass knuckles if you make a successful concentration check (DC\
  \ 10 + the level of the spell you're casting). Monks are proficient with brass knuckles.\
  \ Brass knuckles can't be disarmed."
