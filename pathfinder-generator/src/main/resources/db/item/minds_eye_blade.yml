description: "The hilt of this ornate +2 dagger is engraved with a depiction of a\
  \ human clutching the sides of her head. When a creature takes damage from the blade,\
  \ its mind rejects the presence of the wielder. The blade's wielder gains concealment\
  \ (20% miss chance) against the damaged creature's attacks for 1 round. Multiple\
  \ hits don't further increase the concealment effect or its duration. This is a\
  \ mind-affecting effect.\nThree times per day, when the wielder of a mind's eye\
  \ blade performs a coup de grace or sneak attack against an opponent, the wielder\
  \ immediately receives a piece of information from the target's mind. The target\
  \ can attempt a DC 16 Will save to negate this effect. The target can then attempt\
  \ a DC 21 Bluff check; if it fails, the wielder gains the information she desires.\
  \ If the target succeeds at its check, the wielder gains no information. If the\
  \ target succeeds by 5 or more, however, it can choose what answer to provide, and\
  \ the wielder believes that answer to be true. Subsequent attempts to gain the same\
  \ piece of information from the same creature yield the same result. If the wielder\
  \ doesn't specify the piece of information she wishes to retrieve, the GM determines\
  \ what information she learns."
