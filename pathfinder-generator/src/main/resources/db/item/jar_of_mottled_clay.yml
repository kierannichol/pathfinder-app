description: "This empty clay jar, suitable for holding a few ounces of liquid, smells\
  \ of freshly tilled earth and changes hue in sunlight. A jar of mottled clay can\
  \ be thrown as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.\nWhen the\
  \ jar strikes a creature or a solid object, a mound of earth and clay rises up from\
  \ where it struck. The mound is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall, and has a hardness\
  \ of 2 and 40 hit points. A creature struck by a direct hit must succeed at a DC\
  \ 13 Reflex save or be pushed back 5 feet and knocked prone as the mound erupts\
  \ where the target was standing. Success allows the creature struck to move 5 feet\
  \ in any direction and avoid being knocked prone.\nThe mound lasts for 3 rounds\
  \ before losing its structure and collapsing into a pile of dirt. A creature can\
  \ topple a mound with a successful DC 18 Strength check; creatures within 10 feet\
  \ on the opposite side of the mound must attempt Reflex saves as if directly struck\
  \ by the jar of mottled clay. When a mound collapses or is destroyed, it creates\
  \ difficult terrain in a 5-foot-radius area centered on the square where it was\
  \ created.\nA jar of mottled clay can optionally be filled with an alchemical item.\
  \ Filling a jar requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check. When thrown,\
  \ a modified jar applies the effects of the alchemical item along with its own effect;\
  \ contradictory or bizarre combinations of effects are subject to the GM's discretion."
