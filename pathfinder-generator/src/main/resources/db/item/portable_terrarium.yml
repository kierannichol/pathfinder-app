description: "This small glass enclosure is 1 foot wide, 1 foot tall, and reinforced\
  \ with a wooden or metal frame. Tiny air holes in the lid allow living creatures\
  \ inside the portable terrarium to breathe, and the interior can be outfitted with\
  \ a variety of substrates and other materials the creatures might require. A portable\
  \ terrarium is usually fitted with straps so it can be tied to a pack. Diminutive\
  \ and smaller creatures, such as some familiars, can be safely carried within a\
  \ portable terrarium and have total cover while inside it. Healers and botanists\
  \ often store living plants in these containers; a successful DC 12 Knowledge (nature)\
  \ check is required to transplant a plant into a portable terrarium, and most plants\
  \ can live in a portable terrarium indefinitely so long as they are properly tended."
