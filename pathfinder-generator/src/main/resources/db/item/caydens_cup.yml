description: "On command, this battered pewter tankard fills with ale perfectly matched\
  \ to the bearer's taste and desire. Ale poured out the tankard quickly loses its\
  \ flavor and virtue, becoming common swill within minutes. The tankard prevents\
  \ most of the ill effects of excessive drinking, such as hangovers and blackouts,\
  \ as long as it remains in its owner's possession. It also provides a +4 bonus on\
  \ saving throws against poison.\nOnce per hour as a move action, by drinking the\
  \ contents of the tankard and voicing a toast the imbiber gains a +2 morale bonus\
  \ to Strength and Constitution, but takes a –2 penalty on Dexterity- and Intelligence-based\
  \ ability and skill checks. These effects last for 10 minutes. If the tankard is\
  \ empty, it must be filled prior to drinking. If the imbiber expends one use of\
  \ mythic power while drinking from the cup, the morale bonus increase to +4, the\
  \ penalties to –4, and the duration of the tankard's effects to 1 hour."
