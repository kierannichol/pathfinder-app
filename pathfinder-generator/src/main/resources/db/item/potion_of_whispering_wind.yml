name: "Potion of Whispering Wind"
description: "You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The whispering\
  \ wind travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided\
  \ that it can find a way to the location. A whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed\
  \ as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet\
  \ message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether\
  \ anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates."
