description: "This congealed incendiary functions like alchemist's fire, but its white-hot\
  \ flames deal 2d6 points of fire damage on a direct hit and 1d6 points of splash\
  \ damage to adjacent creatures.\nMythic: You can expend one use of mythic power\
  \ while throwing a flask of Artokus's fire to cause the substance to burn hotter\
  \ and longer than normal. A creature struck by a direct hit of Artokus's fire must\
  \ succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or continue to take 1d4 points of fire damage each\
  \ round at the beginning of its turn. A burning creature can attempt a new save\
  \ as a full-round action. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the\
  \ user's mythic tier, and otherwise acts as the burn universal monster rule (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Bestiary 298). Artokus's fire used in this way burns even underwater, offering\
  \ no relief to creatures that try to extinguish the fire by dousing or immersing\
  \ themselves in water."
