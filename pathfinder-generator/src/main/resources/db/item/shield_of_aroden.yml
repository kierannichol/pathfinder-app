description: "The Shield of Aroden is a +5 light fortification spell resistance (17)\
  \ heavy wooden shield. Once per day, the bearer can invoke a form of fire shield\
  \ that protects against cold attacks and damages opponents with fire and holy damage\
  \ similarly to the spell flame strike. Once per round as an immediate action, if\
  \ an adjacent ally is hit by a ranged or melee attack, the bearer can use the shield\
  \ to redirect the attack to himself, taking all effects from that attack as if he\
  \ were the intended target. All allies within 100 feet of the bearer gain the effect\
  \ of bless and prayer. Additionally, all allies within 100 feet of the bearer know\
  \ his relative position and condition, as per the spell status.\nBeyond these properties,\
  \ the Shield of Aroden is designed to protect its bearer from death. Any attack\
  \ that would kill the bearer (not merely make him unconscious or dying) triggers\
  \ this ability, redirecting the lethal attack fully upon the shield and leaving\
  \ the bearer unharmed (even if the attack normally only works on living creatures).\
  \ For example, if the bearer failed a saving throw against flesh to stone, the shield\
  \ would turn to stone and shatter instead, whereas if the bearer failed his save\
  \ against horrid wilting, the shield would turn to dry splinters. This power always\
  \ destroys the shield, reducing it to 1d20 nearly invulnerable shards that suggest\
  \ the way in which it was last destroyed.\nThe Shield of Aroden bestows two negative\
  \ levels on any chaotic creature that attempts to wield it. These negative levels\
  \ remain as long as the shield is held or carried. These negative levels never result\
  \ in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration\
  \ spells) while the creature possesses the shield."
destruction: "The Shield of Aroden is designed to be destroyed, but the supposedly\
  \ invulnerable shards left by its destruction can be utterly destroyed if they are\
  \ consumed by a chaotic neutral being at least as powerful as a demigod, such as\
  \ the proteans' Speakers of the Depths or the Eldest known as Count Ranalc."
