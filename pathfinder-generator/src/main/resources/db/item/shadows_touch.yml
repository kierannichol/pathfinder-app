description: "Amazingly light, this ebon +2 keen dagger fades into near intangibility\
  \ at its tip. It ignores bonuses to AC provided by deflection and force effects,\
  \ and deals 2 points of Strength damage on a confirmed critical hit. By expending\
  \ one use of mythic power while attacking, the wielder can strike a force effect\
  \ and disintegrate it as a touch attack. This effect also automatically dispels\
  \ force effects that can be dispelled whether or not they're subject to disintegrate.\n\
  As a standard action, the wielder can expend a use of mythic power while slashing\
  \ at the air to open up a rift to the Shadow Plane. This functions as shadow walk,\
  \ except that a maximum number of creatures equal to double the wielder's tier can\
  \ pass through before the rift closes."
