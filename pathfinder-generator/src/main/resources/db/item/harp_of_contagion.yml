description: "This grand-looking wooden harp is carved with images of various venomous\
  \ creatures. Once per day the bearer may play the harp to target a single opponent\
  \ with a poison spell (DC 16). Alternatively, the bearer may play the harp to grant\
  \ allies within 30 feet a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against disease and\
  \ poison; maintaining this benefit each round is a standard action. If the player\
  \ has the countersong bardic performance ability, he may expend rounds of bardic\
  \ performance to use the harp to refocus his countersong against disease and poison\
  \ instead of sonic or language-dependent effects."
