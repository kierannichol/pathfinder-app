description: "This large, oaken bureau has a double-door cabinet that sits atop three\
  \ horizontal drawers. A user can concentrate on a set of clothing he would like\
  \ to wear, then open the cabinet or one of the drawers to retrieve a set of magically\
  \ fabricated clothing matching what he imagined. Clothing created in this way can't\
  \ have any magical properties other than those listed here, but does provide all\
  \ benefits based on the type of clothing it is (a cold-weather outfit would grant\
  \ a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves against exposure to cold weather, for instance).\
  \ The bureau can't create armor.\nThe clothes fade to worthless scraps after 24\
  \ hours, as do any pieces separated from the whole (such as buttons, buckles, gem\
  \ adornments, or strips torn off as bandages). The costume bureau can generate a\
  \ total of four sets of clothing per dayâ€”one from the wardrobe and one from each\
  \ of the three drawers."
