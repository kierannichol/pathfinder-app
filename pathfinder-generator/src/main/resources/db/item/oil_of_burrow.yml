id: "item:oil_of_burrow"
name: "Oil of Burrow"
description: "The subject can burrow at a speed of 15 feet (or 10 feet if it wears\
  \ medium or heavy armor, or if it carries a medium or heavy load) through sand,\
  \ loose soil, or gravel, or at a speed of 5 feet through stone. Using burrowrequires\
  \ only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells\
  \ normally. The burrowing creature cannot charge or run. Loose material collapses\
  \ behind the target 1 round after it leaves the area. This spell does not give the\
  \ target the ability to breathe underground, so when passing through loose material,\
  \ the creature must hold its breath and take only short trips, or else it may suffocate."
