description: "A familiar bubble looks like nothing more than a pair of reinforced\
  \ leather straps designed to fit over the shouldersâ€” until it is worn. Once the\
  \ straps are donned, a bubble of force forms on the wearer's back, large enough\
  \ to hold a Tiny or smaller creature and 1 pound of items (usually food for the\
  \ creature). The bubble is transparent and continuously generates fresh, breathable\
  \ air within. While the bubble keeps air in and water out, it is permeable to other\
  \ objects. Spells and weapons can target the creature in the familiar bubble normally.\n\
  As a standard action, the familiar bubble's user can designate a specific creature\
  \ within 30 feet that can pass freely in and out of the bubble. All other living\
  \ creatures find the bubble impenetrable. This selection remains until the wearer\
  \ chooses a different creature or removes the familiar bubble (which causes the\
  \ bubble to disappear). Normally, the user selects a creature in order to get it\
  \ into the bubble and then selects himself so he can retrieve the creature, if needed."
