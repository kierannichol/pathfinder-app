description: "This tarnished gold scepter's ends are shaped into sickly, withered-looking\
  \ leaves. The scepter's rod has four slots, into which four large rings can be placed.\
  \ Each ring is engraved with a phrase in Abyssal, and can be placed upon or removed\
  \ from the scepter as a standard action.\nRing 1: \"Princess of the Blasted Heath.\"\
  \nRing 2: \"Shall stand proud to station earned.\"\nRing 3: \"Moss and rot shall\
  \ grow unchecked.\"\nRing 4: \"‘Til all hands bear the sin they've earned.\"\nThe\
  \ corrupted Dryad's Song grants some limited control over the Darkblight. With a\
  \ single ring, the bearer can cast entangle and wood shape each 3/day. With two\
  \ rings, the bearer can also cast blight, diminish plants, plant growth, and tree\
  \ stride each 1/day. With three rings, the bearer can also cast black tentacles\
  \ 1/day, animating the fungal matter in the area in lieu of creating extradimensional\
  \ tendrils. With all four rings, the bearer can recite the full poem on the scepter\
  \ as a full-round action to purge a single creature within 60 feet of the Darkblight's\
  \ taint, as if she had successfully cast remove curse and remove disease —even removing\
  \ the blighted fey template from a target creature (unwilling fey can resist this\
  \ effect with a successful DC 28 Will save). All of these spell-like abilities affect\
  \ only fungus and plants infected with the Darkblight.\nA single ring on its own\
  \ maintains some control over the Darkblight—reading a ring's phrase as a standard\
  \ action grants the creature holding it and up to nine other creatures she can see\
  \ immunity to Darkblight infestation for 1 hour. A single ring does nothing to reverse\
  \ the effects of Darkblight already infesting a creature."
destruction: "If the blighted dryad Arlantia is killed, Dryad's Song slowly reverts\
  \ to its original state."
