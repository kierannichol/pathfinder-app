  \ hostile creature within a 20-foot radius of you must make a Will save to resist\
  \ the effects of this aura. If the creature fails, it takes a â€“2 penalty on attack\
  \ rolls and saving throws and to Armor Class for the duration of this spell, or\
  \ until it successfully hits you with an attack. A creature that has resisted or\
  \ broken the effect cannot be affected again by this particular casting of archon's\
  \ aura."
