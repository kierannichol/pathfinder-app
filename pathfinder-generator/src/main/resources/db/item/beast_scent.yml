description: "This mixture of scent-gland extracts and aromatic herbs serves as both\
  \ attractor and olfactory camouflage. It masks the natural scent of a creature with\
  \ a pungent musk that is alluring to animals. Beast-scent provides a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus on Handle Animal and wild empathy checks and a â€“5 penalty on attempts to\
  \ track the wearer by his original scent. If the tracking creature is following\
  \ the smell of beast-scent itself, Survival checks to track gain a +10 circumstance\
  \ bonus instead.\nA single vial of beast-scent masks the scent of one Medium creature\
  \ or two smaller creatures; larger creatures require proportionally more to gain\
  \ the benefits. Beast-scent becomes inert after 1 hour of exposure to air. Applying\
  \ a vial is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity."
