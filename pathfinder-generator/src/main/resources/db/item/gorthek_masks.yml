description: "This set consists of two masks of hammered iron, one sized for a gorthek's\
  \ face and the other sized for the face of its orc handler. To bond a gorthek with\
  \ its handler, orcs permanently nail the gorthek masks to the respective wearers'\
  \ faces. The magic functions only when the gorthek masks are affixed to one orc\
  \ and one gorthek. It doesn't work with animals other than gortheks. There's only\
  \ a 60% chance an orc's mask will function when affixed to a non-orc humanoid—and\
  \ it's impossible to tell whether a mask will work until after it has been permanently\
  \ attached.\nThe orc's mask is fashioned with horns on the side, resembling those\
  \ of a gorthek. With its bonded gorthek, the wearer gains the benefits of speak\
  \ with animals and a +10 competence bonus on Handle Animal checks.\nThe gorthek's\
  \ mask depicts fearsome tusks, scales, or other features meant to make the creature\
  \ look more terrifying. A gorthek wearing its mask ignores the first 5 points of\
  \ hardness of any object it hits with a gore attack when performing a sunder combat\
  \ maneuver or when smashing an object. Any creature other than its handler takes\
  \ a –10 penalty on Handle Animal checks against a bonded gorthek."
