description: "A mirrored mask emblem adorns this black-lacquered jewelry box. When\
  \ a user speaks a fact into the open box and closes it (a full-round action that\
  \ provokes attacks of opportunities), the whisper safe attunes to him. While holding\
  \ the attuned box, he can spend an immediate action at will to learn how many people\
  \ know the fact. Furthermore, he can concentrate on the box for 1 minute as if he\
  \ were concentrating on a spell to learn the general details of each of those people,\
  \ including alignment, gender, race, character class, and the name by which each\
  \ person is most commonly known. However, if a person has taken any effort to obscure\
  \ any of these details from the public eye, the box omits that individual detail\
  \ or details. Similarly, the box reveals no details about a person who knows the\
  \ fact and is a vigilante or otherwise has dual identity or a similar class feature.\
  \ Opening an attuned whisper safe releases the fact in an audible whisper, after\
  \ which the box can be used to store another fact as described."
