description: "While anvil sizes vary depending on the type of smithing for which they\
  \ are used, all anvils have the same basic shape and construction. Blacksmith anvils\
  \ are much heavier and larger (100 pounds) than farrier anvils (50 pounds), which\
  \ in turn are much bigger than silver- or goldsmith anvils (10 pounds). Many metalworking\
  \ tasks are impossible without the proper anvil."
