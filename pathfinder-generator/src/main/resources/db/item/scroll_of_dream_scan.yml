name: "Scroll of Dream Scan"
description: "This spell functions as dream, but rather than sending a message to\
  \ a sleeping target, you can instead read the target's thoughts. The target must\
  \ be asleep for you to perform a dream scan, though if the target isn't asleep,\
  \ you can wait in a trance until your target falls asleep. Once the target is asleep,\
  \ you can concentrate in order to read its surface thoughts as if using detect thoughts.\
  \ You can continue concentrating for up to 1 minute per caster level."
