description: "A leather or wooden scroll case easily holds four scrolls; you can cram\
  \ more inside, but retrieving any of them becomes a full-round action rather than\
  \ a move action. You must destroy the scroll case to damage its contents (hardness\
  \ 2 for leather or 5 for wood, 2 hit points, break DC 15). A scroll case is not\
  \ watertight, and must still be protected from the elements."
