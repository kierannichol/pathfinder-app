description: "When the command word is spoken, this palm-sized stone teleports one\
  \ Medium creature and up to 100 pounds of equipment to a specific elf gate (see\
  \ page 27) that the stone is keyed to. Only one creature may travel this way per\
  \ home stone. The stone crumbles when activated. Home stones were originally invented\
  \ by the Lantern Bearers as a way to quickly escape the Darklands when raids went\
  \ poorly, with a typical raiding party carrying only one such stone, allowing a\
  \ lone survivor to return and report on the mission."
