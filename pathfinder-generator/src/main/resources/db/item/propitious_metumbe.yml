description: "This polished talisman of darkwood inscribed with the pictogram of a\
  \ specific wendo hangs from a loop of twine. The wearer gains a +2 luck bonus on\
  \ saving throws against witch hexes, spells and abilities with the curse descriptor,\
  \ and any spells or effects that would force the wielder to reroll a die or roll\
  \ multiple dice and take the worst result.\nOnce per day when the wearer is targeted\
  \ by such a spell or effect that doesn't normally grant a saving throw, she can\
  \ make a Will saving throw to negate the effect. If she attempts the save against\
  \ a spell, the save DC is equal to 10 + the spell's level + the caster's primary\
  \ casting ability bonus (Cha for sorcerers, Int for wizards, Wis for clerics, and\
  \ so forth). If she attempts the save against a non-spell effect, the save DC is\
  \ equal to 10 + half the HD of the effect's source + the source's Charisma modifier."
