description: "Crafted by Uqtaal spirit-shamans, this ancient +1 ghost touch four-mirror\
  \ armor (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 128, or use breastplate) consists of four\
  \ polished steel plates harnessed together with leather shoulder straps. Two round\
  \ plates protect the wearer's front and back, while two smaller rectangular plates\
  \ cover the sides of the torso. The wearer of ghost mirror armor can cast deathwatch\
  \ (caster level 1st) three times per day. In addition, when the wearer is attacked\
  \ by an incorporeal undead creature, the armor automatically casts protection from\
  \ evil on the wearer as an immediate action up to once per day."
