description: "When you imbibe this syrupy black serum, your blood thins dramatically\
  \ and gushes forth from even minor wounds. Anytime you take bleed damage, any creatures\
  \ adjacent to you must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the amount of bleed\
  \ damage taken) or be nauseated for 1 round. A dose of bloodgorge lasts for 1 hour."
