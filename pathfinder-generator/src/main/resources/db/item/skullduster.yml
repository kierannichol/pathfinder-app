description: "This +2 disruption morningstar's metal head resembles the face of a\
  \ half-orc. The weapon can cast remove paralysis three times per day. Skullduster\
  \ rarely speaks, and then usually only to utter grim predictions. The weapon craves\
  \ the destruction of undead creatures, and it uses death ward at will so long as\
  \ its owner diligently pursues this goal. If Skullduster's owner ever parleys with\
  \ an undead creature, the weapon withholds any further aid, grumbles constantly\
  \ in Orc about treachery, and seeks a new owner."
