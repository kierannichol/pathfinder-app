description: "This item normally looks like a heavy steel brooch or cloak clasp, often\
  \ depicting a heavy helm or sturdy shield. On command, the brooch transforms in\
  \ a clatter of metallic plates and panels to instantly cover the wearer in a complete\
  \ suit of +1 full plate, with the design of the brooch displayed on the armor's\
  \ breastplate. The same command word causes the armor to transform into the brooch.\
  \ The brooch only transforms if the wearer's armor slot is unoccupied, thus it won't\
  \ work if the wearer is already armored. The brooch associated with this armor weighs\
  \ less than a pound and occupies the neck slot when in this form."
