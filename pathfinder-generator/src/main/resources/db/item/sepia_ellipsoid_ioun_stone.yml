description: "This dark stone sometimes appears to be made of transparent crystal\
  \ filled nearly to the brim with dark ink. It provides the benefits of an iridescent\
  \ spindle (sustains you without air), pearly white spindle (regenerate 1 hit point\
  \ per 10 minutes), and an orange prism (+1 caster level). However, it has two drawbacks.\
  \ First, once set loose to orbit your head, it dislikes being contained (including\
  \ being placed in a wayfinder) and frees itself to orbit again 1d4+1 hours after\
  \ being removed from its spinning path. Second, it drains the power out of other\
  \ ioun stones, rendering them dull gray and powerless at a rate of one every 24\
  \ hours. Thus, it is an excellent and valuable item if you only have one ioun stone,\
  \ but hard to conceal and dangerous to your other treasures. A remove curse or similar\
  \ spell can put the stone at rest and prevent it from returning to its orbit.\n"
