description: "This +1 dagger is forged for Daggermark assassins by Lady Smilos's orders\
  \ alone. It allows slayers, rogues, and assassins who work for the Daggermark Assassins'\
  \ Guild the chance to finish the job if their initial strikes prove less than successful.\
  \ If the wielder of this blade studies his target for 3 rounds (which can be the\
  \ same 3 rounds of study for a death attack) either unseen or without being recognized\
  \ as an enemy, he can sneak attack with all attacks he makes with this dagger against\
  \ that target for the next 3 rounds. If his target has improved uncanny dodge, the\
  \ wielder of the Daggermark blade must be 4 levels higher than the target in order\
  \ to sneak attack."
