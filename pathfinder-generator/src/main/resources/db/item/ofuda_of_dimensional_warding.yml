description: "These talismans are 6-inch-long strips of paper bearing mystic words\
  \ of sealing written in traditional calligraphy. Hailing from the province of Tianjing,\
  \ they are one of several methods the aasimars of that land have kept qlippoth invaders\
  \ from entering the Material Plane, and the government of Tianjing pays a high price\
  \ for them. If an ofuda of dimensional warding is placed on a prominent structure\
  \ (such as a large tree, a statue, or a gate), and a special 24-hour ritual is performed,\
  \ it creates a dimensional lock effect in a 240-foot-radius area which lasts until\
  \ the ofuda of dimensional warding is removed. Any effect that moves the object\
  \ that the ofuda of dimensional warding is attached to ends the effect until the\
  \ ritual is performed again."
