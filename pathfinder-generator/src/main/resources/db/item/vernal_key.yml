description: "The Vernal Key consists of three lattice orbs, one inside the other,\
  \ all carved from a single piece of blue mineral. The key was created to unlock\
  \ a jarl's prison, but as a side effect it also protects the region around it from\
  \ the ravages of winter.\nWithin a 5-mile radius of the Vernal Key, otherwise cold\
  \ weather (below 40° F) becomes moderate, while severe cold (below 0° F) becomes\
  \ only cold. A mild wind demarcates the edge of this effect. The key must remain\
  \ stationary (unattended) to produce this effect; it takes 24 hours for the artifact\
  \ to attune itself to its locale. The key only ameliorates natural weather; it has\
  \ no effect on magically created effects or extraplanar environments."
destruction: "The power of the Vernal Key is intrinsically tied to the Elemental Plane\
  \ of Air, where it was created. It can only be destroyed by returning it to that\
  \ plane and then using a rod of cancellation on it."
