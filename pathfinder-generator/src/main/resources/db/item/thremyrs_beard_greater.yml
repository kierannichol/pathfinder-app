description: "This mithral helm has a faceplate resembling a frost giant's face, complete\
  \ with a beard formed from layered, thin metal rods. While wearing a Thremyr's beard,\
  \ a creature gains a +5 competence bonus on Intimidate checks and a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate a frost giant or svathurim (though the\
  \ helm does nothing to increase the wearer's size).\nOnce per day as an immediate\
  \ action after being successfully hit by a melee weapon, the wearer of a lesser\
  \ Thremyr's beard can order the helm to animate, whereupon the thin metal rods of\
  \ the helm's beard reach out to grasp the weapon. This functions as a disarm combat\
  \ maneuver that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.\nA lesser Thremyr's beard\
  \ has a CMB of +23; the wearer can use the helm's CMB or her own CMB, whichever\
  \ is higher.\nA greater Thremyr's beard functions identically to the lesser version,\
  \ but offers more protection for the wearer's vulnerable neck. Once per day as an\
  \ immediate action after a critical hit is confirmed against the wearer with a melee\
  \ weapon, the wearer can force the attacker to reroll the confirmation roll and\
  \ take the worse result."
