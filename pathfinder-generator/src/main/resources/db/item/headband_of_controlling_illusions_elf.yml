description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis elaborately woven leather beaded cord shifts\
  \ in coloration from light gray at the front to pitch black at the back. Once per\
  \ day on command, the headband allows the wearer to make any choices for an ongoing\
  \ nonpermanent illusion as if she were casting the illusion, although its duration\
  \ is not reset and she cannot change its target or area. The spell's effect changes\
  \ to match those choices, and its remaining duration plays out as if the wearer\
  \ were its original caster. To affect the illusion, the wearer must succeed at a\
  \ caster level check (with a +13 bonus for the headband's caster level) with a DC\
  \ equal to 11 + the illusion's creator's caster level.\nIf the wearer is an elf,\
  \ she can use a second command word to cause the headband to produce illusory duplicates\
  \ of up to six allies similar to how mirror image functions once per day. The wearer\
  \ can control any number of the duplicates with a move action provided they all\
  \ receive the same commands, but otherwise they mimic the actions of the originals\
  \ and remain in the original's square. When in the original creature's square, the\
  \ image functions exactly as mirror image, but when the headband's wearer directs\
  \ them separately, the images have an AC equal to the original's AC – 5 and are\
  \ destroyed by any successful attack roll against that AC."
