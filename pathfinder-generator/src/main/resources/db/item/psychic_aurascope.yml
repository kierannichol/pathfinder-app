description: "A magical version of a haunt detector (see page 12), a psychic aurascope\
  \ is filled with a strange, swirling white vapor. A psychic aurascope acts in all\
  \ ways as a haunt detector, but in addition, while the aurascope's bulb is touching\
  \ a creature or object, the user can utter a command word to activate the aurascope,\
  \ causing the vapor contained within it to rapidly shift between multiple hues for\
  \ as long as it continues to touch that creature or object. The hues displayed within\
  \ the aurascope relate to the touched creature or object's alignment aura, emotion\
  \ aura, health aura, and magic aura, allowing the user to use the read aura occult\
  \ skill unlock (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 197) once per day, even if she\
  \ has no levels in an occult class or doesn't have the Psychic Sensitivity feat.\
  \ If the user has levels in an occult class or the Psychic Sensitivity feat, she\
  \ can attempt a Perception check with a DC equal to 25 + the creature's Hit Dice\
  \ or the item's caster level and apply the result to all of the target's auras instead\
  \ of just one single aura. The user can use this version of the read aura occult\
  \ skill unlock at will; it doesn't count as her one daily use of the read aura skill\
  \ unlock.\nIn addition, if the user attempts to read the auras of an object that\
  \ is associated with a haunt, the object's auras twist and writhe in the shape of\
  \ skulls, anguished faces, and flashes of scenes relating to the haunt's formation,\
  \ allowing her to use Knowledge (religion) to attempt to identify the haunt's elements,\
  \ such as its area, notice DC, weakness, trigger, destruction requirements, and\
  \ so on. The DC to identify a haunt's elements with a psychic aurascope is equal\
  \ to 20 + the haunt's CR, which allows the user to determine one of the haunt's\
  \ elements, chosen randomly. For every 5 by which the check's result exceeds this\
  \ DC, the user randomly determines another one of the haunt's elements."
