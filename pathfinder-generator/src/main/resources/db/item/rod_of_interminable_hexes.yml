description: "Three times per day when a wielder of this rod uses a hex (but not an\
  \ advanced hex or grand hex), she can use this rod's power to double the duration\
  \ of the hex, so long as the hex's normal duration is longer than 1 round. When\
  \ augmented with this rod, a hex that might have a longer duration if a target fails\
  \ its save but only a 1-round duration if the target succeeds at its save (such\
  \ as evil eye) still has only a 1-round duration against a target that succeeds\
  \ at its save."
