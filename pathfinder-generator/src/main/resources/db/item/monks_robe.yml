description: "When worn, this simple brown robe confers great ability in unarmed combat.\
  \ If the wearer has levels in monk, her AC and unarmed damage are treated as a monk\
  \ of 5 levels higher. If donned by a character with the Stunning Fist feat, the\
  \ robe lets her make one additional stunning attack per day. If the character is\
  \ not a monk, she gains the AC and unarmed damage of a 5th-level monk (although\
  \ she does not add her Wisdom bonus to her AC). This AC bonus functions just like\
  \ the monk's AC bonus."
