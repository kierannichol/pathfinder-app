description: "This diminutive, shiny brass construct looks like a spider made of gears\
  \ and cogs. It's roughly the size of an adult human's hand, and its legs are all\
  \ picks, chisels, pliers, and other tools of fine manipulation. Its body contains\
  \ reservoirs of powders and oils it can spray 2 inches out of its nozzle-spinnerets.\
  \ A fine chain can be played out of a winch on the brass spider's back, connecting\
  \ it to a small disk with studs and levers that control the construct's actions,\
  \ enabling it to walk and crawl like a spider. It has no autonomous motivation.\n\
  Once per day, a character holding the brass spider's chain can use the Disable Device\
  \ skill from 15 feet away without penalty, though he must have line of sight to\
  \ the device he is attempting to disable. In most cases, this means any mishap caused\
  \ by the skill affects the brass spider (which has hardness 5 and 25 hit points)\
  \ rather than the spider's controller. Additionally, the brass spider can be used\
  \ without limit as masterwork thieves' tools, without the advantage of any additional\
  \ range."
