description: "This +2 light fortification banded mail has a small, ovoid stone set\
  \ in the left shoulder. The armor monitors the wearer's hit point total as the spell\
  \ status. If an attack against the wearer does enough damage to kill him outright,\
  \ he and his gear are teleported to a specific location determined at the time of\
  \ the armor's creation. This effect acts in all other ways as the spell word of\
  \ recall, with the predetermined location considered the place of sanctuary. The\
  \ wearer's body is protected from decomposition for 18 days as per the gentle repose\
  \ spell. Once this ability has been used, the stone set into the armor crumbles\
  \ to dust and the armor reverts to being a suit of +2 light fortification banded\
  \ mail."
