description: "This bauble, bit of clothing, or relic has some minor historical significance.\
  \ Though not especially valuable, it's useful to an occultist, who can use it as\
  \ an implement. Any such item is nonmagical, even if it appears to be a rod or wand.\
  \ Implements that already have a mundane version with a price higher than 10 gp\
  \ (such as armor, shields, weapons, and harrow decks) use their normal item entries\
  \ instead of this catchall."
