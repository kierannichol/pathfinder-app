description: "These stylized red gloves are often employed by agents of the Red Mantis\
  \ for stealthy assassinations. If the wearer successfully pins an opponent with\
  \ a grapple combat maneuver, she can perform a special coup de grace attack the\
  \ next round with the gloves, treating them as if they were sawtooth sabres (1d8\
  \ points of slashing damage, critical threat range of 19â€“20) for the purpose of\
  \ this attack. Should the wearer of these gloves slay her opponent with this attack,\
  \ the target's head erupts in a geyser of blood, preventing life-restoring spells\
  \ that require an intact body. A creature that survives this coup de grace attack\
  \ is immune to subsequent attempts from any mantis embrace for 24 hours."
