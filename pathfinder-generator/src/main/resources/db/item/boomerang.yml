description: "The boomerang is primarily a hunting tool, but it is not uncommon for\
  \ these versatile thrown weapons to be carried into battle. A boomerang is made\
  \ of wood and is flat, with a long haft, a pronounced forward curve, and a sharp\
  \ backward bend at the head. A hunting boomerang does not fly in a returning path."
