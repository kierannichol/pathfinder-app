description: "When the wearer enters a stance from a style feat while wearing a dhoti\
  \ of style mastery, he gains 1d8+3 temporary hit points plus an additional 1d8 temporary\
  \ hit points for each feat he has that lists that style feat as a prerequisite (maximum\
  \ 3d8+3 temporary hit points). These temporary hit points last as long as the wearer\
  \ maintains the stance during that combat, but vanish when the combat concludes.\
  \ The wearer cannot gain temporary hit points in this way more than once per day."
