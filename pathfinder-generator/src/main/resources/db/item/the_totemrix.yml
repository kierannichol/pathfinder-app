description: "The Totemrix is the dark half of the Aohl, an artifact gifted to the\
  \ lost Jaytirian Society of the Mwangi Expanse following a sacred truce between\
  \ their two feuding gods. The Totemrix is a manifestation of power from the now-dead\
  \ demon lord of shadows, Vyriavaxus. It's a DC 30 Knowledge (religion) check to\
  \ know this, but any evilaligned creature that touches the Totemrix immediately\
  \ knows the name and how to use the artifact's powers. The Totemrix constantly emits\
  \ darkness, as per the spell of the same name, reducing illumination levels in a\
  \ 20-foot radius by one step.\nAs long as the Totemrix is carried, the wielder's\
  \ demeanor and attitude become increasingly morbid. After a day of keeping the Totemrix\
  \ in his possession, its owner becomes incredibly possessive of the artifact and\
  \ will not voluntarily relinquish it—if the wielder loses possession of the Totemrix,\
  \ he becomes obsessed with recovering it. Every day that the owner maintains possession\
  \ of the Totemrix, he gains 1 \"shadow point.\" When the owner's shadow point total\
  \ equals his experience level, he must make a DC 25 Fortitude save. Regardless of\
  \ the results of this save, the owner dies—if the Fortitude save is a success, though,\
  \ he rises the next evening as a vampire. If a player character succumbs to this\
  \ potent curse and becomes a vampire, you should assume control of that PC until\
  \ the other characters can defeat him and, hopefully, resurrect him. The compulsion\
  \ to maintain ownership of the Totemrix is a curse that functions at CL 15th.\n\
  A vampire created in this manner continues to covet the Totemrix, and indeed, if\
  \ separated from its ownership (or unable to benefit from its power, as in the case\
  \ of it being joined to the Morrowfall), suffers a –4 penalty on all skill checks,\
  \ attack rolls, and saving throws until he recovers the artifact.\nIn the hands\
  \ of a vampire, the Totemrix gains a potent new ability—when the vampire uses his\
  \ children of the night ability, he may call upon shadow beasts. When he calls upon\
  \ shadow beasts, he calls 2d6 shadowgarms (see Pathfinder Adventure Path volume\
  \ #25), 1d4 shadow rat swarms (see page 37), 1d4+1 shadows, or 1d3 shadow mastiffs\
  \ (see page 31). Although the vampire can only do so as often as he can use children\
  \ of the night (once a day for most vampires), shadow beasts called in this manner\
  \ persist in the area and follow the vampire's last command until they are slain\
  \ or banished. At any one time, a vampiric wielder of the Totemrix can maintain\
  \ a number of shadow beasts equal to the amount of spawn he can control (up to 52\
  \ at a time for Ilnerik); attempts to call more shadow beasts while this total number\
  \ is maxed still function, but the called shadow beasts persist for only up to 1\
  \ hour before vanishing."
destruction: "When the Totemrix is joined with its counterpart, the Morrowfall, its\
  \ powers (as well as those of the Morrowfall) are suppressed. In this state, both\
  \ it and the Morrowfall can be destroyed by anything capable of destroying a magic\
  \ metal object of its size."
