description: "This bloodshot eye is larger than a grown man's fist. Its vivid green\
  \ iris suggests strange depths, and is unnerving to look at for too long. Once per\
  \ day you may use it to cast clairaudiance/clairvoyance. If you can cast scrying,\
  \ you may use the eye as your focus object for the spell."
