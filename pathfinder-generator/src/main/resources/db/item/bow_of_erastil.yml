description: "This golden +1 endless ammunition distance composite longbow (+6 Str)\
  \ produces a golden arrow whenever it's drawn. By expending one use of mythic power,\
  \ the bow's wielder can make a single attack and compare the result against every\
  \ enemy within 60 feet of her. The wielder rolls damage only once, and applies it\
  \ to all foes hit by the attack. If the attack is a critical threat, the wielder\
  \ chooses only one enemy hit and attempts to confirm the critical against that enemy."
