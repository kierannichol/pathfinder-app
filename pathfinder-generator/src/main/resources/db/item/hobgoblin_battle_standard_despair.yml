description: "A battle standard is a cloth flag or standard, typically 2 feet wide\
  \ and 4 feet long, meant to be carried and displayed on a lance, polearm, frame,\
  \ or staff. It has no effect when not mounted properly or when lying on the ground.\
  \ Hobgoblin battle standards normally depict the device or insignia of a tribe or\
  \ nation, and different types of standards grant different effects.\nA battle standard\
  \ may be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the standard\
  \ does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses\
  \ its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of its owner.\nDespair:\
  \ Enemies of the bearer of a hobgoblin battle standard of despair are sickened while\
  \ within 60 feet of the banner. Any enemy that sustains a critical hit while sickened\
  \ because of the standard must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 15) or become\
  \ dazed for 1 round.\nFerocity: Allies of the bearer of a hobgoblin battle standard\
  \ of ferocity gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saving\
  \ throws against mind-affecting effects as long as they are within 60 feet of the\
  \ banner.\nIron Resolve: Allies of the bearer of a hobgoblin battle standard of\
  \ iron resolve gain 10 temporary hit points and the benefits of the Diehard feat\
  \ for as long as they are within 30 feet of the banner. The temporary hit points\
  \ can only be gained once per day per creature."
