description: "This length of prickly green vine is woven into a living aiguillette\
  \ worn around the shoulder. Once per day as an immediate action when the wearer\
  \ is struck by a melee attack, she can compel the vine to uncoil and wrap around\
  \ the attacker, causing the attacker to become entangled (Reflex DC 13 negates).\
  \ An entangled creature cannot move from its space. At the start of the entangled\
  \ creature's turn, it can attempt a new saving throw against the entangling aiguillette,\
  \ though the DC increases by 1 for each round the creature fails its save (to a\
  \ maximum of 16 after 3 rounds). The entangled creature can also untangle itself\
  \ as a move action by succeeding at a DC 13 Strength or Escape Artist check. The\
  \ entangling aiguillette's owner cannot move while entangling a creature, but can\
  \ release an entangled creature as a free action."
