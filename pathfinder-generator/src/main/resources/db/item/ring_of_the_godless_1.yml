description: "These rings are said to have first been forged in Rahadoum by the Council\
  \ of Elders to help root out the hidden faithful and other practitioners of the\
  \ divine. A ring of the godless grants a luck bonus on saving throws against divine\
  \ spells. This bonus does not apply to spell-like or supernatural abilities unless\
  \ they are class abilities of a divine spellcasting class, such as channel energy\
  \ or domain powers, or unless they are used by a creature that has been called,\
  \ created, or summoned by divine magic. The wearer's spell resistance (if any) increases\
  \ by an amount equal to the ring's luck bonus, though this increase applies only\
  \ against divine spells (and spell-like abilities as described above).\nA ring of\
  \ the godless also allows the wearer to use detect magic at will, though it detects\
  \ only divine magic. In addition, the wearer can use a specialized form of arcane\
  \ sight a number of times per day equal to the ring's luck bonus. This ability can\
  \ be activated as a swift action, its effect lasts until the end of the wearer's\
  \ turn, and it detects only divine magic or divine spellcasting ability."
