description: "This braid, crafted from strips of pugwampi pelts, is 1 inch in diameter\
  \ and 12 inches long. It can be carried in the hand like a riding crop or worn as\
  \ an adornment.\nOnce per day with a command word, the owner of the braid can create\
  \ a 5-foot-radius aura around the braid for 1 minute. Creatures other than the owner\
  \ within the aura must roll twice and use the lower result whenever a situation\
  \ calls for a d20 roll. This is a mind-affecting effect that does not work on humanoids\
  \ with the gnoll subtype, animals, or gremlins. A creature under the effect of a\
  \ luck bonus is immune to the aura."
