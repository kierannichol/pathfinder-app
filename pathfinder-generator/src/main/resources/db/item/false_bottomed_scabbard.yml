description: "The space at the bottom of this sword scabbard is just large enough\
  \ to hold a potion flask. Some are accessed from the outside; others open on the\
  \ inside with a secret catch at the top end. Finding the secret compartment requires\
  \ a DC 25 Perception check, or DC 20 if you can compare the sword's length to that\
  \ of the scabbard."
