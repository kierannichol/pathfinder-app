description: "This spongy sac has a permeable membrane that can absorb, distill, and\
  \ store toxins. When harvesting parts (see the Harvest Parts feat) from a poisonous\
  \ creature, you can use a poison sponge to harvest and store one dose of the creature's\
  \ poison instead. The DC to harvest poison is equal to 20 + the creature's CR, and\
  \ the poison retains its potency for 3 days. A successful check stores a single\
  \ dose of the creature's poison in the sponge, which you can then apply like any\
  \ poison. Poison sponges become saturated over time, imposing a cumulative â€“2 penalty\
  \ on checks to harvest poison each subsequent time they are used."
