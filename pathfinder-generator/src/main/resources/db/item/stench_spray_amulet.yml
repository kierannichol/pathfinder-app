description: "This fetish of bone, shed reptilian skin, and small stones can be worn\
  \ around the neck to convert a creature's stench into a breath weapon. It has no\
  \ benefits for a creature that doesn't have the stench special ability. While a\
  \ creature wears this amulet, its stench aura is suppressed. Once per hour as a\
  \ standard action, the creature can spray a brown slime from its mouth in a 30-foot\
  \ cone. Any creature hit by the slime must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or\
  \ become sickened for the same duration. The save DC and duration are the same as\
  \ those of the wearer's stench aura.\nFurthermore, the floor in the cone becomes\
  \ coated in the slick slime for 1 minute. This has the same effects as coating a\
  \ solid surface with a grease spell (DC 11), but doesn't require creatures to attempt\
  \ saving throws if they're in the area when the cone is created—only if they move\
  \ through the area."
