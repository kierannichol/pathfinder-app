description: "Crafted from the skull of the dragon Kazavon, the Armor of Skulls is\
  \ a Large intelligent +4 greater electricity resistance breastplate that grants\
  \ its wearer a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Constitution. Once per day,\
  \ the wearer can unleash either a bolt or burst of electricity. The bolt is a 120-foot\
  \ line of electricity that deals 24d8 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 37\
  \ for half). The burst deals 6d8 points of electricity damage to all creatures within\
  \ a 30-foot-radius burst (Reflex DC 37 for half)."
destruction: "One who has never killed another creature must bind the Armor of Skulls\
  \ in gold chains (worth 1,000,000 gp), then slowly shatter the armor by shortening\
  \ the chain by one link every day for 1,000 days."
