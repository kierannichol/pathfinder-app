description: "This red elixir is always the temperature of freshly spilled blood.\
  \ A creature can consume a gobbet of flesh and drink this liquid as a single standard\
  \ action.\nIf the drinker is an animal, it is stunned for 1 round, and must succeed\
  \ at a DC 17 Will save or permanently acquire the maneating animal template. If\
  \ the blood of Baphomet is consumed with humanoid flesh, the animal receives no\
  \ saving throw.\nIf the drinker is not an animal, it enters a frenzy, as the rage\
  \ spell. The drinker must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be confused for as long\
  \ as it rages. If the blood of Baphomet is consumed with humanoid flesh (a chaotic\
  \ evil act), the drinker receives no saving throw."
