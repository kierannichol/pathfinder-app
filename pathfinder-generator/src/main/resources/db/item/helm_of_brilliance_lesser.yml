description: "This helm functions like a helm of brilliance but is lower-powered.\
  \ Instead of the standard helm's allotment of gems, the lesser helm has 10 diamonds\
  \ (fireball, 10d6 damage, Reflex DC 20 half), 20 corals (flaming sphere), 30 garnets\
  \ (scorching ray), and 40 agates (light). It still glows near and harms undead,\
  \ has the flaming weapon special ability, and provides fire resistance (though only\
  \ 20 instead of 30).\nJust like the standard helm, the wearer risks detonation if\
  \ damaged by magical fire; diamonds become fireballs centered on the wearer, corals\
  \ become flaming spheres in and adjacent to the wearer's space, garnets become scorching\
  \ rays that fire randomly at creatures in range, and the agates and the helm itself\
  \ are destroyed."
