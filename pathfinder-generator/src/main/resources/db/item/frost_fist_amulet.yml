description: "Shaped like a fist, this iron amulet is surrounded by a frigid fog.\
  \ On command, this amulet causes the wearer's hands to become encased in a layer\
  \ of freezing iron. The wearer is protected from the frigid cold and can make savage\
  \ blows with his hands. Unarmed strikes and natural attacks the wearer makes with\
  \ hands gain the frost weapon special ability and are treated as cold iron for the\
  \ purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The wearer's hands become rigid while using\
  \ this amulet and cannot be use to hold or manipulate objects (unless that manipulation\
  \ could be accomplished with a club and is not damaged by cold). The transformation\
  \ can be ended as a swift action."
