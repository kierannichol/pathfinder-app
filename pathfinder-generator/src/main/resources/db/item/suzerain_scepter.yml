description: "This ornately bejeweled baton confers the mark of rightful rulership\
  \ on its bearer. The wielder of this scepter gains a +5 competence bonus on Knowledge\
  \ (nobility) and Diplomacy checks. Furthermore, once per day, and on command, the\
  \ wielder can affect up to seven living creatures with good hope, as the spell.\
  \ If the wielder of a suzerain scepter has the Leadership feat, she may attract\
  \ double the normal number of followers for her Leadership score; however, if the\
  \ rod is out of the wielder's possession for more than 1 week these extra followers\
  \ leave. In addition, a suzerain scepter radiates a continuous bless effect that\
  \ affects any cohort, follower, animal companion, familiar, special mount, or creature\
  \ charmed or summoned by the wielder (but not called creatures or those under dominate\
  \ or other compulsion effects). Whenever the wielder creates an effect that provides\
  \ a morale bonus to such creatures (not including the scepter's bless effect), that\
  \ bonus increases by 1."
