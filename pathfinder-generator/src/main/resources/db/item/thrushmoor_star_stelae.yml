description: "The Star Stelae in Thrushmoor are partially operational and provide\
  \ the following benefits to any creature bearing an unholy symbol of Hastur—the\
  \ Yellow Sign. Each Star Stela has a number of charges that can be replenished with\
  \ an appropriate sacrifice, and activating one of the artifact's effects expends\
  \ a number of charges. Each stone can hold a maximum of 50 charges. Because these\
  \ artifacts are damaged and not operating at their full potential, their auras register\
  \ as faint instead of strong or overwhelming.\nIf a creature in possession of a\
  \ Yellow Sign touches a Star Stela, it immediately receives a flow of telepathic\
  \ impressions that it can attempt to interpret with a DC 25 Knowledge (arcana) or\
  \ Knowledge (religion) check. If the creature succeeds, it understands what the\
  \ Star Stela can do, and can attempt to tap into their power.\nAny creature using\
  \ a Star Stela for any of these effects is bombarded with strange images and distant\
  \ whispers. If the creature makes use of the teleportation effect, it steps into\
  \ one wall and emerges into what looks like an abandoned and eerily quiet city filled\
  \ with swirling yellow mist before exiting to its desired location.\nA creature\
  \ bearing the unholy symbol of Hastur can make use of the following effects.\nCity\
  \ Stride: By touching one of the Star Stelae, a user can create a temporary portal\
  \ on a wall within 200 feet of the stone. The user can then travel to another wall\
  \ within 200 feet of one of the other two Star Stelae as if via dimension door.\
  \ A sooty mural of a gloomy and abandoned city appears on any wall used for this\
  \ manner of travel. This use expends 2 charges.\nSinister Whispers: By touching\
  \ one of Thrushmoor's Star Stelae, a user can transmit a short, whispered message\
  \ to any point within 300 feet of any of the three artifacts. All creatures wearing\
  \ an unholy symbol of Hastur within that area hear the whispered message and can\
  \ give a short reply. This use expends 1 charge. If the user and another creature\
  \ are touching different stones at the same time, one of them can expend 2 charges\
  \ to communicate telepathically for 1 minute.\nIf a stone is depleted of all its\
  \ charges, it becomes inactive and can't be used anymore. An inactive Star Stela\
  \ can be activated again only through the successful completion of a specific occult\
  \ ritual (the same one that Melisenn used to originally awaken the stones).\nCharges\
  \ can be replenished through sacrifice. If a sentient living creature is killed\
  \ in the name of Hastur while in contact with one of the Star Stelae, the artifact\
  \ gains a number of charges equal to 1 per Hit Die of the sacrificed victim."
destruction: "Thrushmoor's Star Stelae can be destroyed by a flying polyp using its\
  \ wind blast to deal 500 points of damage to each stone during a particular celestial\
  \ alignment that occurs once per year."
