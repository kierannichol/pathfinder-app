description: "Made to resemble a courtier's fan, this device consists of silk paper\
  \ stretched and folded over a folding frame of hardened steel. Folding fans are\
  \ typically wielded in pairs using a technique that distracts the opponent. The\
  \ fans sport sharp tips, which can be poisoned. For a list of appropriate poisons,\
  \ see Poisons on page 110."
