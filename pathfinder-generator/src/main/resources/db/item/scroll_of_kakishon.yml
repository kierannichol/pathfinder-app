description: "This innocuous-looking scrap is nothing less than the physical manifestation\
  \ of a man-made demiplane known as Kakishon, and the rune covering the scroll is\
  \ in fact a representation of the plane's several island regions. To open the gate,\
  \ one must unfurl the scroll and speak the names Aliskiren, Isles of Night, Ismaizade,\
  \ Kakishon, Khandelwal, Khosravi, and Serpent Isles, each time touching the section\
  \ of the rune corresponding to the named island group. Once, this process allowed\
  \ the user to choose where to appear within the realm, but the scroll is now damaged,\
  \ and upon activation, all creatures within 50 feet with line of effect to the scroll\
  \ must make a DC 40 Reflex save. Those who fail are sucked into the scroll and bodily\
  \ transported to one of the waypoints within the demiplane of Kakishon (see map).\
  \ At the same instant creatures enter the plane, any being that previously entered\
  \ the plane involuntarily may choose to depart, being expelled from the scroll back\
  \ to the Material Plane. Once inside Kakishon, escape can prove difficult, requiring\
  \ those trapped within to wait for others to enter, for the casting of a spell similar\
  \ to plane shift, or for the discovery of one of the foundations of Kakishon's reality,\
  \ all of which transport the subjects back to the Material Plane to a point within\
  \ 10 feet of the Scroll of Kakishon."
destruction: "Containing even a small group of chaotic beings such as azatas, proteans,\
  \ or demons will gradually cause Kakishon to unravel, while a larger group or a\
  \ more powerful chaotic entity can rend the demiplane to shreds in moments."
