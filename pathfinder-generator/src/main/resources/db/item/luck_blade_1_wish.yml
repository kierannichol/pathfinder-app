description: "This +2 short sword gives its possessor a +1 luck bonus on all saving\
  \ throws. Its possessor also gains the power of good fortune, usable once per day.\
  \ This extraordinary ability allows its possessor to reroll one roll that she just\
  \ made, before the results are revealed. She must take the result of the reroll,\
  \ even if it's worse than the original roll. In addition, a luck blade may contain\
  \ up to three wishes (when randomly rolled, a luck blade holds 1d4â€“1 wishes, minimum\
  \ 0). When the last wish is used, the sword remains a +2 short sword, still grants\
  \ the +1 luck bonus, and still grants its reroll power."
