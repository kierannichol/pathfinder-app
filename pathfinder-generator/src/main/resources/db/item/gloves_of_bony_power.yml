description: "These black gloves are decorated with images of white bones, as if revealing\
  \ the bones within the wearer's hands. The left glove can be used once per day to\
  \ create a spectral hand, which makes the bony hand image on that glove slide off\
  \ and manifest as a ghostly skeletal hand for the duration of the effect. The right\
  \ glove can be used once per day to deliver an inflict moderate wounds spell, which\
  \ gives that hand's bones a pale, sickly glow until the touch is delivered or discharged.\
  \ If the wearer is a living creature, he can also use the right glove on himself\
  \ to cast cure moderate wounds instead of inflict moderate wounds."
