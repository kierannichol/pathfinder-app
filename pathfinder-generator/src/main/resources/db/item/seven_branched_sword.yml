description: "This unusual sword has a straight 2-foot-long blade with six shorter\
  \ L-shaped blades protruding from it, three on each side in a staggered pattern.\
  \ The shorter blades can be used to snag opponents' clothing or armor, or can target\
  \ weapons in order to disarm them. To snag armor or clothing, the attacker makes\
  \ a trip attempt. If successful, the victim doesn't fall prone, but instead is snagged\
  \ and stumbles forward, leaving the victim flat-footed for the remainder of the\
  \ round."
