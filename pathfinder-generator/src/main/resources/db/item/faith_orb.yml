description: "This brass orb is a bit larger than a human fist. It is covered with\
  \ symbols of goodness and law and thick studs. If used as an improvised weapon,\
  \ it deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage and serves as a good weapon for the\
  \ purpose of overcoming damage reduction.\nThe faith orb is activated when a special\
  \ stud is depressed (usually marked by a different metal). Activating the orb is\
  \ a standard action, but the orb may be thrown as a ranged touch attack (10-foot\
  \ range increment) with the same action that is used to activate it. at the end\
  \ of the action or when it hits its target (use the chart on PHB 158 to see where\
  \ it goes if you miss), it triggers a flame strike centered on the orb. Creatures\
  \ caught in the blast area suffer 9d6 damage as the spell, or half with a Dc 17\
  \ Reflex save. The faith orb is consumed in the process."
