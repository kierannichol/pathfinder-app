description: "Killers use smoke bombs of forgetfulness to conceal their identities\
  \ and cover their escapes in the event of failed assassination attempts. The smoke\
  \ bomb can be thrown to the ground as a standard action, destroying the item and\
  \ creating a cloud of smoke with a 15-foot radius. This acts like the smoke from\
  \ a smokestick, and can be thrown at the user's feet or as a ranged touch attack\
  \ with a range of 20 feet.\nAny creature in the smoke cloud that isn't aware of\
  \ the smoke bomb's nature must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or have its memory altered\
  \ as though its sight had been obscured during the previous 2 rounds. This can cause\
  \ it to forget the appearance of any creatures with which it had interacted or battled\
  \ with during that time. From the point the smoke bomb is thrown, it functions as\
  \ normal smoke, giving the user time to escape but no longer protecting its identity\
  \ from creatures that leave the smoke and can see the user.\nA creature that is\
  \ already aware of the abilities of a smoke bomb of forgetfulness and suspects this\
  \ smoke bomb is one automatically succeeds at the save. The memory alteration is\
  \ a mind-affecting effect."
