description: "This sight can be attached to a single two-handed firearm. When this\
  \ is done, the sight becomes part of the weapon, but can be removed from that weapon\
  \ with a full-round action. A firearm wielder using a firearm that has this sight\
  \ can choose to spend a full-round action to either locate an invisible creature\
  \ within line of sight or make a single shot that ignores the invisibility of a\
  \ creature that she knows is in the area."
