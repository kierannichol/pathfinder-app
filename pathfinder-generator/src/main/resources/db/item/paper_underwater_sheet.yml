description: "Not all underwater creatures use sight as their primary means of reading\
  \ text, so underwater paper is significantly thicker than surface paper, allowing\
  \ the writer to carve the letters into the sheet. This lets creatures with blindsight\
  \ see the textured writing from afar as well as allowing others to read it by touch,\
  \ or sometimes from a short distance if they have unusually precise tremorsense.\
  \ For underwater societies where vision is more prominent, the writer can fill the\
  \ carved grooves with colorful ink (and potentially bioluminescent ink) and then\
  \ adhere a transparent waterproof sheet on top to prevent the ink from washing away.\
  \ This transparent sheet costs an additional 4 sp."
