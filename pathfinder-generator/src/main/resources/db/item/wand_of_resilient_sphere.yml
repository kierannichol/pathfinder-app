description: "A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the creature\
  \ is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains\
  \ its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere functions as a wall of force,\
  \ except that it can be negated by dispel magic. A subject inside the sphere can\
  \ breathe normally. The sphere cannot be physically moved either by people outside\
  \ it or by the struggles of those within."
