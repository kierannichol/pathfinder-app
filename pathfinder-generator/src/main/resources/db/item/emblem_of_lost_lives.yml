description: "This unassuming pendant whispers a constant discordant chorus of voices\
  \ into the mind of its wearer. As a standard action, the wearer can focus on these\
  \ voices and pick out one from a past life. The voice whispers information related\
  \ to a particular subject, granting the wearer a +2 insight bonus on one type of\
  \ Knowledge check for 1 minute. The wearer can use this ability once per day for\
  \ each type of Knowledge in which she is trained, choosing a different type of Knowledge\
  \ each time. Additionally, once per day, the wearer can spend 1 minute consulting\
  \ with the voices for aid with a future task, as per augury."
