description: "This simple musical instrument seems and behaves in all ways like any\
  \ other kind of magical pipes until its owner plays it in an urban setting. Once\
  \ he does, it requires all people within hearing range to make a DC 15 Will saving\
  \ throw to avoid falling into a murderous fury. Those who fail their saves gain\
  \ the effects of a rage spell for the next 1d6 hours and experience a strong compulsion\
  \ (DC 15 Will save negates) to attack any stranger or disliked person whom they\
  \ encounter during this time. If the owner spends more than 3 consecutive days in\
  \ an urban setting, he must make a DC 15 Will saving throw each day to avoid playing\
  \ the riot pipes at some point during each subsequent day. The pipes remain with\
  \ the player until the curse is broken."
