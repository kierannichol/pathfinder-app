description: "This squat, golden idol looks like a bald, obese wise man with an extra\
  \ eye in his forehead. It can be used once per day to gain information as with an\
  \ augury spell, and once per day as a divination spell. Once per week, a single\
  \ yes-or-no question can be asked of it (as with a commune spell). The answers do\
  \ not come from a deity, but instead from insights granted by celestial movements\
  \ and conjunctions; a sample insight might be, \"Because Aballon and Eox are in\
  \ conjunction in the House of the Eagle, the answer is yes.\""
