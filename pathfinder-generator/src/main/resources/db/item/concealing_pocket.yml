description: "This 4-inch-square cloth pocket has no powers unless it is sewn onto\
  \ a garment (which takes 1d4 minutes). Once sewn, it changes its appearance to match\
  \ the garment. Any magic item inside it cannot be magically detected, as if protected\
  \ by magic aura. Hiding an item in the pocket gives the garment's wearer a +5 competence\
  \ bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal the item. The pocket can be removed\
  \ from the garment with a DC 10 Heal check or an appropriate Craft check such as\
  \ Craft (cloth) or Craft (leather); failing this roll by 5 or more gives the pocket\
  \ the broken condition."
