name: "Scroll of Pied Piping"
description: "You call forth a melody so compelling and attractive that creatures\
  \ belonging to a group with a specific, identifiable physical trait (such as type,\
  \ subtype, age, gender, or hair color) find it almost impossible not to approach\
  \ and follow you. You choose the nature of the creatures you seek to attract when\
  \ you cast the spell and, once you make this choice, cannot alter it. You can only\
  \ use physical traits to determine your audience. You can never use social and other\
  \ more voluntary criteria (such as alignment, religion, nationality, or class) to\
  \ select targets for this spell."
