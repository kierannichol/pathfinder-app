description: "This +1 net is made from fine silvery cords rather than simple rope.\
  \ The net prevents extradimensional travel, affecting any creature entangled by\
  \ it as per dimensional anchor for as long as it remains entangled. Additionally,\
  \ any invisibility effects targeting a creature entangled by the net are suppressed\
  \ so long as it remains entangled. Devils take a â€“4 penalty on Strength checks and\
  \ Escape Artist checks to free themselves from a devil catcher."
