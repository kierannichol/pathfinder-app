description: "These massive pauldrons take the shape of a pair of clenched fists made\
  \ of beaten bronze. They bestow a +4 bonus on CMD, and grant the wearer the ferocity\
  \ ability (Bestiary 300). On command, the wearer can increase its size, as though\
  \ subject to an enlarge person spell, and can revert to regular size with another\
  \ command. Three times per day, as an immediate action after the pauldrons' wearer\
  \ kills an opponent, the wearer gains the benefit of the deadly juggernaut spell\
  \ (Ultimate Combat) for 1 minute."
