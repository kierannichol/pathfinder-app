description: "This +1 scythe has five onyx gems set into its blade. A creature with\
  \ the ability to channel negative energy can expend one use of that ability to charge\
  \ the weapon with power, causing one onyx gem per 1d6 points of channeled energy\
  \ to glow (multiple channels do not stack; the wielder must be able to channel 5d6\
  \ points of negative energy to activate all five gems). Anytime the wielder deals\
  \ damage to a creature with the scythe, he can activate one charged gem as a swift\
  \ action, releasing its energy and dealing 1d6 points of channeled negative energy\
  \ damage to the target. Alternatively, as a standard action the wielder can touch\
  \ the scythe to a willing creature healed by negative energy (such as undead) and\
  \ release any number of stored charges, each of which heals the target for 1d6 points\
  \ of damage."
