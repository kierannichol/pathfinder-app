description: "This fine dust causes bare skin that it comes in contact with to burn\
  \ and tingle. When sprinkled on a corpse or an inanimate skeleton, it causes the\
  \ dead flesh and bones to disintegrate into a fine brown powder similar to that\
  \ left by a disintegrate spell. Assassin's dust comes in a small vial suitable for\
  \ treating eight Small corpses, four Medium corpses, or one Large corpse. A skeletal\
  \ corpse counts as half a corpse of its size. This dust has no effect on living\
  \ or undead creatures."
