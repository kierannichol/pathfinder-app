description: "A gnome hooked hammer is a double weapon—an ingenious tool with a hammer\
  \ head at one end of its haft and a long, curved pick at the other. The hammer's\
  \ blunt head is a bludgeoning weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage (critical multiplier\
  \ ×3). Its hook is a piercing weapon that deals 1d4 points of damage (critical multiplier\
  \ ×4). You can use either head as the primary weapon. Gnomes treat hooked hammers\
  \ as martial weapons."
