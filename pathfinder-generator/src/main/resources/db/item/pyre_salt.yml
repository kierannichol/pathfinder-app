description: "Said to be crafted from witches' tears and the ashes of burned heretics,\
  \ pyre salt is composed of glistening black-and-white granules and smells of smoke.\
  \ It typically comes in a narrow glass vial containing one use. When pyre salt is\
  \ cast into any magical or mundane flame whose area is at least 10 feet by 10 feet,\
  \ the fire in that area deals double the normal amount of damage to any objects\
  \ or creatures in that space for 1 round. Pyre salt cannot be activated by fire\
  \ spells or effects cast onto it.\nAdditionally, any objects or creatures destroyed\
  \ by the affected fire prove exceptionally difficult to restore. Anyone who casts\
  \ mending, make whole, or a similar spell on an object destroyed by the fire must\
  \ first succeed at a DC 20 caster level check or the spell fails. By the same token,\
  \ anyone who casts raise dead, resurrection, or a similar spell on a creature killed\
  \ by the fire must also succeed at a DC 20 caster level check or the spell fails."
