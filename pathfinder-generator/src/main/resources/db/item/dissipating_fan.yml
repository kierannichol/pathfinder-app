description: "This large wood-and-canvas fan is 2 feet wide and ideal for quickly\
  \ dispersing smoke or other harmful gases. While waving a dissipating fan, you gain\
  \ a +2 circumstance bonus on Fortitude saving throws to avoid taking nonlethal damage\
  \ from heat exposure and to avoid the effects of smoke inhalation. You can use a\
  \ dissipating fan to clear nonmagical smoke, fog, or similar vapors from your square\
  \ or an adjacent square as a full-round actionâ€”although dense smoke or fog in the\
  \ surrounding area eventually refills the space (how long this takes depends on\
  \ the source and the size of the area, at the GM's discretion). When folded and\
  \ closed, a dissipating fan is the size of a thick walking stick. Some dissipating\
  \ fans are decorated with paint or elaborate embroidery, and have a higher price\
  \ to reflect their adornment."
