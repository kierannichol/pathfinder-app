name: "Scroll of Suffocation"
description: "This spell extracts the air from the target's lungs, causing swift suffocation.\
  \ The target can attempt to resist this spell's effects with a Fortitude save--if\
  \ he succeeds, he is merely staggered for 1 round as he gasps for breath. If the\
  \ target fails, he immediately begins to suffocate. On the target's next turn, he\
  \ falls unconscious and is reduced to 0 hit points. One round later, the target\
  \ drops to â€“1 hit points and is dying. One round after that, the target dies. Each\
  \ round, the target can delay that round's effects from occurring by making a successful\
  \ Fortitude save, but the spell effect continues for 3 rounds, and each time a target\
  \ fails his Fortitude save, he moves one step further along the track to suffocation.\
  \ This spell only affects living creatures that must breathe. It is impossible to\
  \ defeat the effects of this spell by simply holding one's breath--if the victim\
  \ fails the initial saving throw, the air in his lungs is extracted."
