description: "A dozen tiny gemstones line the outer edges of this golden ring. As\
  \ long as one or more creatures can see it, the ring grants its wearer a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks to influence those creatures. In addition,\
  \ the wearer can allow a willing creature to inspect the ring as a full-round action.\
  \ If she does, for the following 3 rounds the creature and the wearer can speak\
  \ while the ring's power obfuscates the details of the conversation. To every other\
  \ creature able to hear the creature and the wearer's words during this time, the\
  \ conversation sounds like a continued back-and-forth exchange of exaltations about\
  \ the ring's artistry."
