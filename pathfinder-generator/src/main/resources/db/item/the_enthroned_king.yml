description: "Roiling blue smoke fills this small glass bottle, occasionally forming\
  \ an aged face that vanishes just as quickly. So long as the bottle is worn openly\
  \ on a creature's body, the Enthroned King 's inspiring presence grants its carrier\
  \ a +1 luck bonus on all ability checks, saving throws, and skill checks. The spirit\
  \ trapped within is utterly devoted to protecting dwarves, and especially the Sky\
  \ Citadel of Kraggodan. Three times per day, the Enthroned King may invest his wielder\
  \ with some of his own immortal life force, granting her 1d10+10 temporary hit points."
destruction: "The Enthroned King must prostrate himself before a powerful servant\
  \ of Malgrim, the dwarven guardian of the afterlife—a task that requires him to\
  \ once again have a body rather than his current form of only dust and breath."
