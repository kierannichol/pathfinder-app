description: "These travel-stained boots of stout brown leather enable the wearer\
  \ to traverse great distances without tiring. When making a forced march (Core Rulebook\
  \ 171), for each hour of marching beyond 8 hours, the wearer needs only to make\
  \ a Constitution check (DC 10, +1 per extra hour) instead of the normal check. Furthermore,\
  \ if the wearer fails the check, she only takes 1d4 points of nonlethal damage and\
  \ does not becomes fatigued the first time she takes nonlethal damage in this way."
