description: "Created ages before the construction of Windsong Abbey by the cult of\
  \ Groetus, doomsday keys are used by the cult to seal certain doors in their temples,\
  \ as well as the legendary Doomsday Doors themselves. See the adventure in this\
  \ volume for examples of the types of unique locks that doomsday keys can work with.\n\
  Up to three times per day as a standard action made by twisting the key in the air\
  \ (as if unlocking an invisible lock), a doomsday key causes up to four creatures\
  \ chosen by and within 20 feet of the user to become shaken for 1 minute (Will DC\
  \ 14 negates)—this is a mind-affecting effect. A doomsday key can also be used to\
  \ inflict bestow curse (Will DC 14 negates) once per day—this use requires a successful\
  \ touch attack. While worn about the neck (and thus taking up the neck item slot),\
  \ a doomsday key bestows a +4 resistance bonus on the wearer's saving throws made\
  \ against curse effects; this protection does not help against curses the wearer\
  \ may already be suffering from."
