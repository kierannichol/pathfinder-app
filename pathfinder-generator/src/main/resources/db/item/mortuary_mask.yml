description: "A mortuary mask covers the top half of the face, leavrng the mouth and\
  \ chin exposed. The design of this eerie mask evokes that of a human skull, although\
  \ some mortuary masks have more canine or even demonic features. Regardless of the\
  \ mask's appearance, once it is donned, a mortuary mask works to enhance the wearer's\
  \ presence, making him or her appear more horrific and frightening and granting\
  \ a resonant tone to the wearer's voice. These enhancements grant a +3 circumstance\
  \ bonus on all lntimidate checks made while the mask is worn. In addition to this\
  \ unnerving effect, a mortuary mask also grants constant deathwatch while it is\
  \ worn, allowing the wearer to see the auras of living and dead creatures within\
  \ 30 feet. The wearer loses the ability if he is blinded or cannot see (such as\
  \ might occur while in darkness). Furthermore, the mask guides the wearer's hand\
  \ against foes who are heavily wounded. When the wearer of a mortuary mask attacks\
  \ a creature that has 3 or fewer hit points remaining, the wearer gains a +2 insight\
  \ bonus on the attack roll."
