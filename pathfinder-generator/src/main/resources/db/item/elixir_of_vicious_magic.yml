description: "This pear-shaped flask contains a metallic-green liquid suffused with\
  \ small pulsing globules. This elixir fuses with the magical essence flowing through\
  \ the imbiber's veins, enhancing the potency of spells at the cost of his health.\
  \ For the next minute, any spells the imbiber casts that deal hit point damage deal\
  \ an additional amount of damage of the same type equal to the spell level to both\
  \ the target and the imbiber."
