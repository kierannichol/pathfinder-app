description: "This silvery ring looks like a halo. When worn by a tiefling it hovers\
  \ just above his head, though it still uses the head magic item slot. It helps to\
  \ calm the baser emotions and the dark whispers that plague tieflings, granting\
  \ the wearer a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against all spells with the\
  \ emotion descriptor. When worn by a tiefling of a good alignment, it provides spell\
  \ resistance 13 against spells with the evil descriptor and a +2 sacred bonus on\
  \ saving throws."
