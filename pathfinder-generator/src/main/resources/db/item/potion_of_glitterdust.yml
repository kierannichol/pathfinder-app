  \ causing creatures to become blinded and visibly outlining invisible things for\
  \ the duration of the spell. All within the area are covered by the dust, which\
  \ cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades. Each round at the end\
  \ of their turn blinded creatures may attempt new saving throws to end the blindness\
  \ effect."
