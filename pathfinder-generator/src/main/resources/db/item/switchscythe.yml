description: "This scythe has a spring-loaded blade that folds down into the weapon's\
  \ handle. Opening the scythe blade is a swift action, and closing it again is a\
  \ standard action. You can use Bluff or Sleight of Hand to treat a closed switchscythe\
  \ as a hidden weapon; the apparatus can be disguised with 1 minute of work, which\
  \ grants a +5 bonus on such checks. This disguise is ruined when the weapon is opened\
  \ and must be reapplied to hide the weapon again. Any effects that apply to a scythe\
  \ also apply to a switchscythe."
