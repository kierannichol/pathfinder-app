name: "Oil of Blend with Surroundings"
description: "This spell changes the appearance of the affected creature so that it\
  \ better blends in with its surroundings. As chosen by you, the affected creature\
  \ takes on the appearance of a statue, furniture, a tree, a bush, a rock, or another\
  \ object of similar size. As long as the target stays still, it gains a +20 bonus\
  \ on Stealth checks, and it can use Stealth even if it is being observed. The target's\
  \ armor blends in perfectly with the illusory shape, and the target's armor check\
  \ penalty on Stealth checks is negated for the duration of the spell. If the target\
  \ moves at all while this spell is in effect, the spell ends."
