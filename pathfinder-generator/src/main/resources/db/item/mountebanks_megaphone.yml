description: "This cone has openings at both ends and a large mouthpiece on the small\
  \ end, and is crafted from brass hoops and sheets of leather and painted garish\
  \ colors. Anyone holding the mountebank's megaphone in one hand can speak through\
  \ it to make his voice up to 10 times louder, allowing him to be understood across\
  \ a large crowd. If the megaphone's holder has the bardic performance class feature,\
  \ he can treat any space within a 30-foot cone in front of him as the point of origin\
  \ for any bardic performance that usually centers on the performer. Projecting a\
  \ bardic performance through the megaphone takes additional effort, costing double\
  \ the normal number of rounds. If the user moves from his current location, any\
  \ bardic performance he is projecting through the megaphone immediately ends, even\
  \ if his new position is still within range."
