description: "Shadowblood is among the most notorious of drugs—a fluid infused with\
  \ a shadow demon's essence. Anyone who drinks this substance must succeed at a DC\
  \ 20 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of cold damage and 1d4 points of Wisdom damage,\
  \ and become nauseated for 1d6 rounds. Thereafter, the target gains 1d10+5 temporary\
  \ hit points, cold resistance 5, and darkvision 60 feet. These effects persist for\
  \ 1 hour, during which demons take a –4 penalty on saving throws against the drinker's\
  \ spells and spell-like abilities of the shadow subschool.\nShadowblood is exceedingly\
  \ addictive and carries some significant disadvantages. Each time a creature takes\
  \ a dose of shadowblood, it must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or become addicted—\
  \ shadowblood addiction is a severe addiction (see page 236 of the Pathfinder RPG\
  \ GameMastery Guide). A creature under the influence of shadowblood or suffering\
  \ from shadowblood addiction takes a –4 penalty on all saving throws against possession\
  \ type effects made by demons, and can never gain the benefits of protection from\
  \ evil or similar spells against such effects."
