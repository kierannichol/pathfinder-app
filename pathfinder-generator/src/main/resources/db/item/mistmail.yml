description: "The fine links of this +1 chain shirt form a pattern of roiling clouds.\
  \ On command once per day, the wearer can transform it into thick fog that fills\
  \ his space and provides concealment (20% miss chance) for 3 minutes. This mist\
  \ moves with the character. Effects that disperse the mist or destroy it cause the\
  \ armor to reform into its solid shape on the character's body, as does speaking\
  \ the command word or entering a place where the fog-magic doesn't function (such\
  \ as underwater). If the character tries to don another suit of armor while the\
  \ mistmail is in fog form, it reforms at the character's feet."
