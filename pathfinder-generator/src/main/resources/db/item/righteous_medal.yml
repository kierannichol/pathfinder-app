description: "These ornate military medals are awarded to crusaders and adventurers\
  \ who excel and deserve commendation in the war against the Worldwound. A medal\
  \ must be affixed to a worn article of clothing to function, but doesn't have to\
  \ be worn visibly. Any number of righteous medals can be worn, but the effects of\
  \ multiple medals of a single type don't stack. A righteous medal functions only\
  \ if the wearer has legitimately achieved the feat for which she received the medal.\
  \ As a swift action, the wearer can gain a +2 sacred bonus to the medal's associated\
  \ ability score for 1 minute. In addition, each righteous medal grants a constant\
  \ sacred bonus on one type of roll, as detailed below.\nRighteous Medal of Agility:\
  \ This triangular iron medal shows a demonic face surrounded by three swords. It\
  \ is awarded to a hero who delivers a death blow to a demon in combat before that\
  \ demon gets a chance to act in the combat. This medal is associated with Dexterity\
  \ and grants a +1 sacred bonus on Initiative checks.\nRighteous Medal of Clarity:\
  \ This circular blue medal depicts a pair of feminine gray eyes surrounded by a\
  \ circular silver lightning bolt. It is awarded to a hero who recovers vital information\
  \ of great use against the Worldwound and delivers this intelligence to the crusaders.\
  \ This medal is associated with Intelligence and grants a +2 sacred bonus on saves\
  \ against insanity or confusion effects.\nRighteous Medal of Command: This circular\
  \ medal depicts a leering demon head before two crossed swords. It is awarded to\
  \ a hero who redeems one of the enemy and convinces the redeemed character to join\
  \ the crusade. This medal is associated with Charisma and grants a +2 sacred bonus\
  \ on saves against emotion-based effects (including fear effects).\nRighteous Medal\
  \ of Spirit: This rectangular medal depicts the symbol of Iomedae on a field of\
  \ red. It is awarded to a hero who becomes possessed or mentally controlled by a\
  \ demon but escapes from that control before he is forced to do evil. This medal\
  \ is associated with Wisdom and grants a +2 sacred bonus on saves against charm\
  \ and possession effects (including dominate effects).\nRighteous Medal of Valor:\
  \ This medal looks like a demonic skull, the top of which has been pierced by four\
  \ red-hilted swords. It is awarded to a hero who delivers a death blow to a demon\
  \ whose CR is at least 1 higher than the hero's character level. This medal is associated\
  \ with Strength and grants a +2 sacred bonus to CMD.\nRighteous Medal of Vigor:\
  \ This hexagonal medal depicts a white castle on a field of red with gold trim.\
  \ It is awarded to a hero who is reduced to negative hit points by a demon but survives\
  \ (or alternately, is restored to life) and rejoins the battle before that demon\
  \ is defeated. This medal is associated with Constitution and grants a +2 sacred\
  \ bonus on saves against death effects.\nA mythic character who wears all six righteous\
  \ medals gains one additional use of mythic power per day."
