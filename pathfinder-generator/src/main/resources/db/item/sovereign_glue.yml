description: "This pale amber substance is thick and viscous. Because of its particular\
  \ powers, it can be contained only in a flask whose inside has been coated with\
  \ 1 ounce of salve of slipperiness, and each time any of the bonding agent is poured\
  \ from the flask, a new application of the salve of slipperiness must be put in\
  \ the flask within 1 round to prevent the remaining glue from adhering to the side\
  \ of the container. A flask of sovereign glue, when found, holds anywhere from 1\
  \ to 7 ounces of the stuff (1d8–1, minimum 1), with the other ounce of the flask's\
  \ capacity taken up by the salve of slipperiness. One ounce of this adhesive covers\
  \ 1 square foot of surface, bonding virtually any two substances together in a permanent\
  \ union. The glue takes 1 round to set. If the objects are pulled apart (a move\
  \ action) before that time has elapsed, that application of the glue loses its stickiness\
  \ and is worthless. If the glue is allowed to set, then attempting to separate the\
  \ two bonded objects has no effect, except when universal solvent is applied to\
  \ the bond. Sovereign glue is dissolved by universal solvent.\nThe price and creation\
  \ cost given are per ounce."
