description: "Wayfinders of revelation show a more ornate design than ordinary wayfinders,\
  \ and are crafted of gold-accented silver. A wayfinder of revelation's light effect\
  \ is double the normal effect of a light spell, illuminating an area twice as large.\
  \ Once per day as a standard action, while a wayfinder of revelation is creating\
  \ light, you can fill this 40-foot radius of light with an invisibility purge effect\
  \ (as per the spell). This effect also makes it easier to notice secret doors and\
  \ hidden compartmentsâ€”characters who search for such hidden objects and portals\
  \ inside this area gain a +10 bonus on their Perception checks to do so. Once activated,\
  \ this effect remains active for 6 rounds."
