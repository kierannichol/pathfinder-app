description: "This +1 flaming scimitar has golden flames embossed along the blade,\
  \ which flicker and glow even when the sword's flames are extinguished. Three times\
  \ per day as a swift action, its wielder can transform the sword into a blade of\
  \ pure flame. In this form, the blade deals 1d8+9 points of fire damage (as the\
  \ flame blade spell).\nOnce per day, the sword's wielder can expend one use of mythic\
  \ power to transform the blade into a Large fire elemental for 10 minutes. When\
  \ the duration ends or the fire elemental is defeated, the blade reappears in its\
  \ owner's hands."
