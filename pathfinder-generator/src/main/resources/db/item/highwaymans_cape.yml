  \ when turned with its bright colors outward, granting a +5 competence bonus on\
  \ Bluff checks. Reversible as a move action, the dappled camouflage of its other\
  \ side grants a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks. Regardless of the cape's\
  \ current facing, the wearer can spend an immediate action at will to roll an Escape\
  \ Artist check against being grappled, bound, or restrained as if the cape targeted\
  \ her with liberating command (Ultimate Combat)"
