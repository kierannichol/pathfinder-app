description: "The warped clay sphere of this +1 fuse grenade (Ultimate Equipment 107)\
  \ is painted with a crimson bull's-eye symbol and its fuse is dyed red. An unerring\
  \ grenade can be lit as a move action and thrown like a splash weapon. An unerring\
  \ grenade veers toward its target, whether a creature or a grid intersection, negating\
  \ any miss chances that would otherwise apply, such as from concealment. The thrower\
  \ still has to aim at the right square or grid intersection. An unerring grenade\
  \ otherwise functions as a normal fuse grenade (Reflex DC 16 half)."
