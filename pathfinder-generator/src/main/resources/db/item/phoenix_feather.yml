description: "This vibrant red feather is surrounded by a faint, soothing golden glow\
  \ that makes it appear preternaturally shiny and pristine. As an immediate action,\
  \ the user can activate the phoenix feather to attempt a saving throw against a\
  \ spell or effect with the death descriptor, even if the spell or effect does not\
  \ normally allow a saving throw. If the spell or effect normally allows a saving\
  \ throw for reduced damage or a partial effect, the bearer suffers only the reduced\
  \ damage or partial effect on a failed saving throw, and completely negates all\
  \ damage and effects on a successful saving throw. If the spell or effect does not\
  \ normally allow a saving throw, calculate the DC of the saving throw this item\
  \ provides as if it did.\nAlternatively, when a single attack, spell, or effect\
  \ deals hit point damage to the user that would reduce her to negative hit points,\
  \ after the hit point damage is rolled but before it is applied to her, she can\
  \ activate the phoenix feather as a free action. If she does, she reduces the amount\
  \ of hit point damage she takes by up to 5d8 + 9 points. (She can never reduce the\
  \ amount of damage taken to less than 0.) A phoenix feather is usable once, after\
  \ which it immediately burns away in a fiery flash before being reduced to ash."
