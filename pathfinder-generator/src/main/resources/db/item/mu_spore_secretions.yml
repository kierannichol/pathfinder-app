description: "These secretions are only one of the many spores and fluids that the\
  \ mu spores of Orv produce, but this is one of the few that surface dwellers have\
  \ learned to safely use. This clear secretion can be added to any alchemical weapon,\
  \ including an alchemist's bombs, as a move action. When mixed in this way, the\
  \ affected alchemical weapon ignores half the hardness of any wooden objects it\
  \ strikes. Alternatively, against creatures primarily made of wood (such as treants\
  \ or wood golems), such weapons ignore the first 5 points of damage reduction the\
  \ creatures has."
