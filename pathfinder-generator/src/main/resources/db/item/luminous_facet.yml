description: "This glass cone is welded to a brass base and contains a faint crimsonand-\
  \ violet fire that burns in the shape of a blooming flower, but sheds no discernible\
  \ light.\nBy speaking the item's command word, a creature can ignite the flame within\
  \ a luminous facet, which then sheds light as a torch. Speaking the item's command\
  \ word again immediately quenches the flame back to its original dimness. A creature\
  \ need not be holding a luminous facet in order to activate or deactivate it in\
  \ this way, but it must be within 60 feet of the item. Multiple luminous facets\
  \ can be crafted to share the same command word, allowing a creature to ignite or\
  \ extinguish numerous facets within range with a single utterance.\nThe flat base\
  \ of a luminous facet makes it easy to attach to walls or ceilings using alchemical\
  \ cement or sovereign glue."
