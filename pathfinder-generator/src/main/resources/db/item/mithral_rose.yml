description: "This seemingly delicate silver rose is rigid and nearly unbreakable.\
  \ When wearing the rose openly on his chest, the wearer treats all of his natural\
  \ attacks, unarmed attacks, and weapon attacks as if they were made using silver\
  \ weapons. The wearer can expend one use of mythic power when making a melee attack\
  \ against an enemy that possesses DR/silver to negate that DR for a number of rounds\
  \ equal to the wearer's mythic tier."
