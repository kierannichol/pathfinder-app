description: "This plain cloak only has any effect when worn by a member of a half-human\
  \ race, such as a half-orc or half-elf. It alters the wearer's appearance similarly\
  \ to a hat of disguise, but only to the extent that it conceals or alters the wearer's\
  \ nonhuman physical traits so the creature appears fully human. Any feature that\
  \ is plausibly human remains. For example, a half-orc wearing the cloak loses his\
  \ green or gray skin color and pointed ears, has no visible tusks, and is otherwise\
  \ completely able to pass as a human version of his normal self. Likewise, a half-elf\
  \ wearing the cloak has round ears, humanlike eyes, and no other traits indicating\
  \ elven ancestry. The wearer has no control over the specific guise, and those familiar\
  \ with his normal appearance can recognize him in his human guise."
