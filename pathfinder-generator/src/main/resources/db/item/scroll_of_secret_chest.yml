name: "Scroll of Secret Chest"
description: "You hide a chest on the Ethereal Plane for as long as 60 days and can\
  \ retrieve it at will. The chest can contain up to 1 cubic foot of material per\
  \ caster level (regardless of the chest's actual size, which is about 3 feet by\
  \ 2 feet by 2 feet). If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75% chance\
  \ that the spell simply fails. Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by\
  \ concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to you."
