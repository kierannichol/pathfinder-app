description: "A horrid, slimy whip crafted from a severed aboleth's tentacle, the\
  \ slime tendril grants the wielder unpleasant transformative powers akin to those\
  \ of the aboleths. The wielder of the slime tendril can breathe water as well as\
  \ air, as if under a constant water breathingeffect.\nThe slime tendril functions\
  \ as a +3 quenching scorpion whip. Three times per day as an immediate action, when\
  \ the wielder damages a creature with the slime tendril, the wielder can force the\
  \ creature to attempt a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw. Victims who fail this save\
  \ are subjected to an aboleth's slime extraordinary ability. Use of the slime tendril\
  \ imparts a slow, terrible transformation upon the wielder. One day after the wielder\
  \ first uses the slime tendril to affect another creature with the slime ability,\
  \ the wielder's skin grows rubbery, increasing her natural armor bonus by 2. One\
  \ week later, the wielder gains the aquatic subtype and the amphibious special quality,\
  \ and she starts to experience strange dreams of cyclopean architecture in cavernous\
  \ ocean trenches and a strong desire to live in the open ocean. If the wielder subsequently\
  \ refrains from using the weapon's slime ability, these changes reverse after 1d4\
  \ months. Each time the wielder uses the weapon's slime ability during this time,\
  \ she must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or transform permanently into\
  \ a skum, using the statistics from the Bestiary in place of her own. This transformation\
  \ cannot be reversed while the wielder carries the slime tendril, and a wish or\
  \ a miracle is required to reverse it otherwise. A wielder transformed into a skum\
  \ by the slime tendril has a soul-piercing longing for the ocean and takes 1d4 Wisdom\
  \ drain each day she spends on dry land.\nAboleths within 10 miles of the slime\
  \ tendril automatically become aware of the weapon's distance and direction, and\
  \ they can use their dominate monster spell-like ability on the slime tendril's\
  \ wielder as if the wielder were in the ability's normal range."
destruction: "The slime tendril is destroyed if the aboleth from which it was originally\
  \ cut holds the weapon and is the target of a regenerate spell, restoring the aboleth's\
  \ limb and destroying the slime tendril."
