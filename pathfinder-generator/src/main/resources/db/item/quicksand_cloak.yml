description: "The exterior of the cloak is an extradimensional space filled with water\
  \ and sand. Each time a creature of the wearer's size or smaller attempts to grapple\
  \ the wearer, it must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or fail at the attempt and\
  \ be engulfed by quicksand (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 427). Every round it's\
  \ trapped in the extradimensional space, the trapped creature must make a Swim check\
  \ (DC 15) to climb out, landing prone adjacent to the wearer. Crawling out doesn't\
  \ provoke an attack of opportunity from the wearer, but does provoke from others.\
  \ A creature that fails its Swim check by 5 or more submerges and begins to drown.\
  \ A creature that succeeds at the initial save grapples the wearer normally, and\
  \ doesn't need to save again unless the wearer escapes and the creature tries to\
  \ grapple the wearer again.\nA quicksand cloak left on the ground behaves as a patch\
  \ of quicksand filling one 5-foot square, and swimming out works the same. Others\
  \ may use aid another to help a creature trapped in the cloak, as though the creature\
  \ were grappled.\nA quicksand cloak of any size can contain only one creature at\
  \ a time; a creature attempting to grapple the wearer while the cloak already contains\
  \ a body is not affected by the cloak."
