name: "Scroll of Sundering Shards"
description: "You channel power into a melee weapon. If the weapon's wielder destroys\
  \ an item with a successful sunder combat maneuver, she can release the extra power\
  \ in the weapon, shattering the sundered item into jagged shards that deal 1d6 points\
  \ of piercing and slashing damage to the creature that was wearing, carrying, or\
  \ wielding the now-shattered item. Any creature (other than the wielder of the weapon\
  \ targeted by this spell) adjacent to that creature must succeed at a Reflex saving\
  \ throw or take 1d6 points of piercing and slashing damage from flying shards. The\
  \ shards also count as whatever special materials the sundered item was made of\
  \ (for example, the shards from a shattered cold iron weapon are cold iron). Once\
  \ the weapon's extra power is unleashed, the spell is discharged."
