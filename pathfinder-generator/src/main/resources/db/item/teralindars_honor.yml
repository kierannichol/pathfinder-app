description: "This +2 aberration-bane bastard sword is made of magically hardened\
  \ bronze and has the special purpose of killing aberrations and creatures intrinsically\
  \ tied to Xhamen-Dor (including seeded undead and the dormant Star Seed). Upianshe's\
  \ spirit can sense such foes within 60 feet, her bane enchantment applies to them,\
  \ and against them her critical hit multiplier increases to Ã—3. Finally, she can\
  \ attempt Knowledge (dungeoneering) checks as though she had 5 ranks in the skill\
  \ (total +13 bonus)."
