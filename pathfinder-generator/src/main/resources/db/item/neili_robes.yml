description: "This black-and-white robe is specially crafted to help the wearer regulate\
  \ the flow of ki in his body, allowing for the generation of internal strength.\
  \ Once per round when the wearer spends a ki point, he gains a +1 natural armor\
  \ bonus to AC and a +1 enhancement bonus to Strength for 1 round. If the wearer\
  \ spends another ki point before the end of his next turn, the duration is extended\
  \ by 1 round and the natural armor and enhancement bonuses are increased by 1 (to\
  \ a maximum of +4). The bonuses to AC and Strength last for only 1 round following\
  \ the expenditure of the last ki point."
