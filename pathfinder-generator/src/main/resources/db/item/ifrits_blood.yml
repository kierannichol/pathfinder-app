description: "Ifrit alchemists claim to make this thick red oil from their own blood—\
  hence the morbid name—but this claim is almost certainly false. Ifrit's blood ignites\
  \ upon contact with air, but burns slowly and is unsuitable for use as a splash\
  \ weapon. A creature can apply a flask of ifrit's blood to a weapon as a standard\
  \ action, wreathing the weapon in vibrant red flames for 1 minute. The oil deals\
  \ 1 point of fire damage on each successful attack with the weapon and deals 1 point\
  \ of fire damage to the weapon itself, bypassing the weapon's hardness if any part\
  \ of it is made of wood. If the oil is applied to a creature's natural weapons or\
  \ unarmed strikes, the creature takes 1 point of fire damage each round (though\
  \ its fire immunity or resistance still applies)."
