description: "This tear-shaped crystal hangs from a delicate setting and chain, both\
  \ encrusted with black diamond dust. The pendant is forged from chips of the diadem\
  \ of Doloras, Queen of the Night of detachment, dispassion, and pain, who visited\
  \ the kyton demagogue Inkariax just before he built his realm on the Shadow Plane.\
  \ The Queen of the Night gifted these magical crystals to the demagogue as a sign\
  \ of her favor.\nAs a standard action, a creature who wears a pendant of the first\
  \ tears can touch the physical exterior of Inkariax's palace at area B16 and be\
  \ instantly transported into its antechamber. This functions as plane shift, with\
  \ White Death's Diadem treated as a demiplane and no chance that the wearer arrives\
  \ anywhere except for a random open space on the floor of the palace's antechamber\
  \ (area B18). The wearer can join hands with additional creatures for all to be\
  \ transported into the antechamber in this way, though a pendant can transport only\
  \ up to eight creatures at a time. Similarly, a wearer inside the antechamber can\
  \ touch its inner walls as a standard action to be transported to the closest location\
  \ on the far side of the antechamber's walls in area B16.\nIn addition to its teleportation\
  \ powers, a pendant of the first tears grants the wearer immunity to fear effects\
  \ and pain effects. The wearer casts spells and effects with these descriptors as\
  \ if her caster level were 2 higher. Additionally, the wearer can cast hold monster\
  \ and power word kill, each once per day."
destruction: "If a pendant of the first tears is placed around the neck of one of\
  \ Doloras's three living and unharmed solar angel brothers, the pendant crumbles\
  \ to ash as soon as the solar removes it."
