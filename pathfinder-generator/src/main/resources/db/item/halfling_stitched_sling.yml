description: "Technically not a unique kind of weapon, a stitched sling is a sling,\
  \ staff sling, or double sling whose cup is sewn closed around the ammunition, creating\
  \ a weak sort of light flail. The ammunition sewn into the sling is irrelevant to\
  \ the type and amount of damage it causes. A stitched sling cannot be used to fire\
  \ ammunition unless the thread or cord holding the cup closed is cut open (a full-round\
  \ action that provokes attacks of opportunity)."
