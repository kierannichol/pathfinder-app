description: "The pommel of this ornate +2 longsword is made to look like a coiled\
  \ golden dragon with six small diamond scales running down its back. When made,\
  \ this sword holds 6 hero points. The wielder can use these points at any time,\
  \ and they do not count against the wielder's maximum. As the hero points are used,\
  \ the small diamonds on the dragon's back turn into coal. After the last hero point\
  \ has been used, the hero's blade remains a +2 longsword."
