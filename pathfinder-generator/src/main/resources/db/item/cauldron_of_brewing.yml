description: "A cauldron of brewing looks like a fine cooking pot with four stout\
  \ legs. The cauldron is capable of heating any liquid placed in it to a precise\
  \ temperature (anywhere from just above room temperature to hot enough to boil salt\
  \ water) and maintaining it indefinitely while still remaining only slightly warm\
  \ to the touch on the outside. A cauldron of brewing provides a +5 competence bonus\
  \ on Craft (alchemy) skill checks."
