description: "This dreaded rod is a bane to magic items, for its touch drains an item\
  \ of all magical properties. The item touched must make a successful DC 23 Will\
  \ save to prevent the rod from draining it. If a creature is holding it at the time,\
  \ then the item can use the holder's Will save bonus in place of its own if the\
  \ holder's is better. In such cases, contact is made by making a melee touch attack\
  \ roll. Upon draining an item, the rod becomes brittle and cannot be used again.\
  \ Drained items are only restorable by a wish or miracle spell. If a sphere of annihilation\
  \ and a rod of cancellation negate each other, nothing can restore either of them."
