description: "It is said that the empyreal lord Ragathiel's divine soldiers wield\
  \ these golden +1 holy greatswords in their battles against fiends and other evil\
  \ creatures. Once per day upon successfully striking an evil-aligned creature with\
  \ a sword of vengeance, the wielder can cause the sword to emit a 20-foot-radius\
  \ burst of holy energy. This effect is identical to that of a holy smite spell centered\
  \ on the creature struck, and deals 4d8 points of damage to each evil creature in\
  \ the area (or 9d6 points of damage to evil outsiders) and causes each to become\
  \ blinded for 1 round. A successful DC 16 Will save halves the damage and negates\
  \ the blinded effect. Neutral creatures in the area only take half damage (reduced\
  \ to one-quarter on a successful save) and are not blinded."
