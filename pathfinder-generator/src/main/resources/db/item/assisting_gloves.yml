description: "The wearer of these simple gloves can speak a command word create a\
  \ glowing disembodied hand. As a swift action, the wearer can have the hand assist\
  \ him with a task as if using the aid another action. The hand uses the wearer's\
  \ base attack bonus or skill ranks when making the check to see if aid another is\
  \ successful (it does not gain the benefit of the wearer's ability scores or other\
  \ bonuses). The hand remains until it has attempted one action or until 1 minute\
  \ passes, whichever comes first, at which time the gloves become nonmagical."
