description: "This lustrous golden bell produces a deep and resonant ring which vibrates\
  \ in perfect harmony with the Material Plane and destructively interferes with otherworldly\
  \ beings. These vibrations reduce the damage reduction and spell resistance of all\
  \ extraplanar creatures within 30 feet by 5 (for example, changing DR 10/magic to\
  \ DR 5/magic). The bell has no clapper; to ring it, the bearer must attack it with\
  \ an unarmed strike (this counts as an attack, with no attack roll needed, and does\
  \ not damage the bell). The ringing lasts 1d6 rounds; stifling the ringing early\
  \ is a standard action. It can ring for a maximum of 10 rounds per day."
