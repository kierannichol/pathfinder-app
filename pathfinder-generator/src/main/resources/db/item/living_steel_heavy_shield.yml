description: "This nonmagical heavy steel shield is made out of living steel. It has\
  \ no enhancement bonus, but its material and construction can damage metal weapons\
  \ that strike it. Whenever the wielder of a metal weapon (other than one made of\
  \ adamantine) rolls a natural 1 on an attack against a creature wielding this shield,\
  \ the item must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or gain the broken condition. If the\
  \ weapon already has the broken condition, it is instead destroyed."
