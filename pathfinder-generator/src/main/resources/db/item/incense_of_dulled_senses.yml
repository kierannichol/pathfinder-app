description: "This gray incense smells of cold granite. When burned, the smoke from\
  \ the incense spreads to fill a space equal to ten 10-foot cubes. This smoke remains\
  \ stationary unless moved by wind. If inhaled by a creature with blindsense, scent,\
  \ or tremorsense, the creature must attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save. If it fails\
  \ the save, it does not benefit from its blindsense, tremorsense, or scent abilities\
  \ for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes the smoke from the incense dissipates and loses\
  \ all magical properties."
