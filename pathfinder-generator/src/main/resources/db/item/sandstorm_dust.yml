description: "This ornate sack made of dyed leather contains a mixture of swirling\
  \ atmospheric energies from the Plane of Air and gritty elemental dust from the\
  \ Plane of Earth. As a standard action, the owner can blow a handful of sandstorm\
  \ dust at a single creature of size Large or smaller within 10 feet. If the target\
  \ fails at a DC 19 Reflex save, the sandstorm dust catches on the creature and grows\
  \ to the size of a small sandstorm. At the beginning of the target's turn for the\
  \ next 1d6+1 rounds, the creature is swept violently upward, thrown back to the\
  \ ground, and then dropped in a random adjacent empty square, taking 1d6 points\
  \ of damage from the impact. While the target lands on its feet each time, this\
  \ does not prevent it from being dropped off a cliff or onto a dangerous patch of\
  \ terrain. The affected creature can attempt to arrest itself as a move action with\
  \ a successful DC 25 Acrobatics check or DC 19 Reflex save; success means that the\
  \ creature is not flung into the air that round. If the creature succeeds at two\
  \ consecutive Acrobatics checks or Reflex saves in this way, the sandstorm dissipates\
  \ and the effect ends.\nA newly created bag of sandstorm dust contains enough dust\
  \ for three uses."
