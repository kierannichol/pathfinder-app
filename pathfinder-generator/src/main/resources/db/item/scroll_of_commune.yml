name: "Scroll of Commune"
description: "You contact your deity--or agents thereof--and ask questions that can\
  \ be answered by a simple yes or no. (A cleric of no particular deity contacts a\
  \ philosophically allied deity.) You are allowed one such question per caster level.\
  \ The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity's knowledge. â€œUnclear\"\
  \ is a legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the Outer Planes are not necessarily\
  \ omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to\
  \ the deity's interests, a short phrase (five words or less) may be given as an\
  \ answer instead."
