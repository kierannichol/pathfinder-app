description: "This weapon looks like the barbed spine of a humanoid. A spine flail\
  \ functions as a +2 flail that deals slashing damage and has reach. Unlike most\
  \ weapons with reach, a spine flail can be used against adjacent foes. On a critical\
  \ hit from a spine flail, the victim must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save to resist\
  \ being permanently blinded by the blow.\nSpine flails are favored by powerful dullahans,\
  \ who harvest the spines from their first victims. The undead riders have a particular\
  \ affinity for their personal spine flails, and often maintain a supernatural control\
  \ over their weapons, causing them to appear or disappear at will."
