description: "One side of this reversible gray hooded cape is exquisitely embroidered\
  \ and richly decorated, while the other appears shabby and worn. On command, by\
  \ passing the edge of the cloak over her face, the wearer may remove a mundane disguise\
  \ (one applied with the Disguise skill) and store it in the cloak. This does not\
  \ change the cloak's appearance in any way. Once a disguise is stored in the cloak,\
  \ it can be reapplied to the wearer who placed it within the cloak on command, using\
  \ the original result of the Disguise check. The cloak can store up to three disguises\
  \ at once, and any wearer of the cloak can discard any number of disguises within\
  \ the cloak as a free action."
