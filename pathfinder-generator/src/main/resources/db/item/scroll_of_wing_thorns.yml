name: "Scroll of Wing Thorns"
description: "Your wings sprout poisonous thorns each the size of a dagger. You can\
  \ use these thorns like armor spikes. In addition, you can make two wing attacks\
  \ as primary natural weapons. If you are Small, the wings deal 1d3 points of bludgeoning\
  \ and piercing damage plus your Strength modifier (unless you also attack with a\
  \ weapon, in which case they are treated as a secondary natural weapon). A creature\
  \ damaged by your wing thorns experiences intense itching, gaining the sickened\
  \ condition while the spell lasts unless it succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw."
