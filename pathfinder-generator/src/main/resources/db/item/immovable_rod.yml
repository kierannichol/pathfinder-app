description: "This rod looks like a flat iron bar with a small button on one end.\
  \ When the button is pushed (a move action), the rod does not move from where it\
  \ is, even if staying in place defies gravity. Thus, the owner can lift or place\
  \ the rod wherever he wishes, push the button, and let go. Several immovable rods\
  \ can even make a ladder when used together (although only two are needed). An immovable\
  \ rod can support up to 8,000 pounds before falling to the ground. If a creature\
  \ pushes against an immovable rod, it must succeed at a DC 30 Strength check to\
  \ move the rod up to 10 feet in a single round."
