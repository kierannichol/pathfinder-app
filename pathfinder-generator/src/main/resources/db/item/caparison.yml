description: "A caparison is a sizable cloth covering laid over a mount or other four-legged\
  \ creature. It serves many of the same purposes a cloak does for a humanoid creature,\
  \ occupies the shoulder slot, and can be enchanted in the same manner. Caparisons\
  \ are sometimes made of precious materials or crafted with delicate artistryâ€”this\
  \ does not increase their practicality, but can significantly increase their price\
  \ as art objects."
