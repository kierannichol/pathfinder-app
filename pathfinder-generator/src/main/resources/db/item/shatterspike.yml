description: "This intimidating weapon appears to be a longsword with multiple hooks,\
  \ barbs, and serrations along the blade, excellent for catching and sundering a\
  \ foe's weapon. Wielders without the Improved Sunder feat use a shatterspike as\
  \ a +1 longsword only. Wielders with the Improved Sunder feat instead use shatterspike\
  \ as a + 4 longsword when attempting to sunder an opponent's weapon. Shatterspike\
  \ can damage weapons with an enhancement bonus of +4 or lower."
