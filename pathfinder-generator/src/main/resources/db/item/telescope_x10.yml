description: "This basic, semi-portable telescope allows the user to see greater detail\
  \ on very distant objects. Telescopes can be built to a variety of specifications,\
  \ but those most often used by adventuring stargazers are listed here. A telescope\
  \ grants the listed circumstance bonus on Perception checks to discern celestial\
  \ bodies and on Knowledge (geography) checks to learn about the planets when used\
  \ at night.\nA telescope can be used to look at either terrestrial or celestial\
  \ objects. Distance penalties on Perception checks for viewing objects through the\
  \ telescope are divided by the telescope's magnification. Assembling, disassembling,\
  \ or significantly moving a telescope takes 1 minute."
