description: "This framework consists of a small tripod, a spool of wire, and a series\
  \ of levels. As part of the action to set up the trap, the autosniper is attached\
  \ to any Small or Medium crossbow and its wire strung across one or two 5-foot squares\
  \ within 10 feet. Once set, the autosniper fires the attached crossbow automatically\
  \ at the first Tiny or larger creature that disturbs its tripwire. An autosniper\
  \ cannot reload the crossbow to which it is attached.\nThe general bulkiness of\
  \ an autosniper's framework imposes a â€“2 penalty on any attempts to use its attached\
  \ crossbow as a ranged weapon. An autosniper can be removed from a crossbow with\
  \ 1 minute of work.\nThis can be crafted with a DC 25 Craft (traps) check."
