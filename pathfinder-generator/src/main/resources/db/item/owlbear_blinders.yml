description: "Used in siege warfare, these blinders restrict the owlbear's vision\
  \ to directly where its head is pointing, helping to stop the owlbear from getting\
  \ distracted and allowing the rider to focus its attention. This gives the rider\
  \ a +2 equipment bonus to Ride checks made to control the owlbear, but gives the\
  \ owlbear a –2 penalty to Spot checks."
