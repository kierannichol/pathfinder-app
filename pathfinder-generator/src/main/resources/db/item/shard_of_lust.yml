description: "The Shard of Lust is made of a deep red djezet alloy. As long as the\
  \ Shard of Lust is carried, its owner can use suggestion as a spell-like ability\
  \ once per day, gains a +2 insight bonus on saves versus enchantment spells, and\
  \ gains a +4 insight bonus on Initiative checks.\nCurse: The owner becomes narcissistic,\
  \ and is sickened whenever he has not engaged in sexual relations with another creature\
  \ within the past 12 hours. While the owner wears any sort of armor or magic item\
  \ that occupies the body slot, he is staggered."
destruction: "A shard of the Sihedron cannot be destroyed individually. Only by recombining\
  \ them into the Sihedron and then using that artifact's method of destruction can\
  \ one destroy the shards."
