name: "Wand of Mad Monkeys"
description: "You summon a swarm of screeching, mischievous monkeys. The swarm understands\
  \ and obeys your commands and has the statistics of a monkey swarm. Creatures failing\
  \ a saving throw against the mad monkeys' distraction attack are deafened for 1\
  \ minute as well as nauseated. The monkeys attempt one disarm or steal combat maneuver\
  \ each turn as a free action against any creature that begins its turn in the swarm,\
  \ using your caster level plus your casting ability score bonus (Intelligence for\
  \ wizards; Wisdom for druids and oracles; Charisma for bards, sorcerers, and summoners)\
  \ for its CMB. Recovering an item from the monkeys requires a successful disarm\
  \ or steal attempt against that CMB + 10. An object stolen by the monkeys takes\
  \ swarm damage each round the swarm is in possession of the object."
