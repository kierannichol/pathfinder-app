name: "Oil of Light Lance"
description: "You create a glorious beam of brilliant radiance that acts as a +1 holy\
  \ lancesuitable for your size. You must have a free hand when casting the spell\
  \ and, once you call the lance into being, you cannot switch it to another hand\
  \ or put it down without prematurely ending the spell. As a standard action while\
  \ holding a light lance, you can choose not to make an attack and instead hold the\
  \ lance aloft as a beacon of light and truth, creating an area of bright light with\
  \ a radius of 90 feet. If you choose to do this for one or more additional rounds\
  \ the lance also casts a spear of brilliant light up into the sky that grows progressively\
  \ more visible as it continues to climb toward the heavens. Under cover of night\
  \ or other darkness, if nothing obstructs the beam, it becomes visible for an additional\
  \ 2 miles during each round in which you continue to aim your lance skyward (2 miles\
  \ in the second round, 4 miles in the third round, and so on)."
