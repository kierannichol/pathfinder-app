description: "This gray, greasy topical lotion strengthens and straightens the leg\
  \ muscles of bandy-legged hobgoblins. Applying loping ointment requires 1 full-round\
  \ action. A hobgoblin under the effects of loping ointment gains a 10-foot alchemical\
  \ bonus to his speed when using the charge, run, or withdraw action. This bonus\
  \ lasts for 10 minutes. Loping ointment is specifically created to enhance hobgoblin\
  \ physiology; other creatures gain no benefit from this ointment and find it unpleasantly\
  \ itchy. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
