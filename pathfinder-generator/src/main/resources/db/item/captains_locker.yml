description: "This iron-banded sea chest is 2-1/2 feet by 3 feet by 4 feet in size\
  \ and is decorated with chains and brass skulls. The chest has no lock, but any\
  \ standard lock can be easily attached to its hasp. The interior of a captain's\
  \ locker functions similarly to a type IV bag of holding, and can hold up to 2,500\
  \ pounds or a volume of 250 cubic feet. The chest's weight remains the same, regardless\
  \ of what it is holding. A captain's locker does not rot or take any other damage\
  \ from immersion in water and is watertight, even if opened underwater.\nWhen a\
  \ captain's locker is placed within the hold of a ship or some other enclosed cargo-carrying\
  \ vehicle (such as a freight wagon with a cargo box), the chest warps the dimensions\
  \ of the cargo hold so that the area's cargo capacity increases by 50% without changing\
  \ the weight of the vehicle. The cargo area remains attached to the vehicle, however,\
  \ so outside conditions that affect the vehicle can also affect the cargo hold.\
  \ If the captain's locker is removed from the cargo area while the hold contains\
  \ more cargo than it could contain on its own, any excess cargo is forcibly expelled\
  \ through hatches or other means of egress, dealing 3d6 points of damage to anyone\
  \ standing within 5 feet of the means of egress."
