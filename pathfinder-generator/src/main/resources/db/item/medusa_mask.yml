description: "This intricate mask is made of gold-plated iron. Writhing snake tails\
  \ radiate from a gemstone upon the brow, almost as if they were medusa-like hair.\
  \ The mask grants a +4 bonus on all saving throws against visual effects, including\
  \ gaze attacks and sight-based illusions. Once per day as a standard action, the\
  \ wearer can cause the central gemstone to glow with pale green light, at which\
  \ point she may target any one creature within 30 feet. The targeted creature must\
  \ succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be petrified for 1 minute, as if by flesh\
  \ to stone."
