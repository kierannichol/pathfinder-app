description: "Once per day as a standard action, the wearer of this collar can speak\
  \ a suggested course of action. Her words coalesce into a living whisper—a sinuous\
  \ creature with blue runes lining its back—that appears in a square adjacent to\
  \ her. The living whisper uses the statistics of a fiendish venomous snake (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Bestiary 255, 294), but has an Intelligence score of 3 and can communicate\
  \ telepathically with the gorget's wearer. Instead of being poisoned, any creature\
  \ bitten by the living whisper must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be affected\
  \ by a suggestion spell (CL 9th). This suggestion is determined when the living\
  \ whisper is summoned and affects all creatures bitten by it. Creatures that can\
  \ read Aklo can read the runes on the living whisper and know what suggestion is\
  \ carried by its bite. A living whisper lasts for 1 minute or until slain."
