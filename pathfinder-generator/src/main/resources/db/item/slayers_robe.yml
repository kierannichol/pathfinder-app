description: "This ragged, brown robe could be mistaken for a monk's cassock, but\
  \ the devotees who wear it are dedicated only to the art of killing. This robe grants\
  \ the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks and Sleight of Hand checks\
  \ to conceal a weapon, and a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. If worn by\
  \ a slayer, the resistance bonus on saving throws increases to match the slayer's\
  \ studied target bonus when he is facing a studied target.\nOn command, the robe's\
  \ wearer is able to turn into a brown mist (as the gaseous form spell) for up to\
  \ 5 minutes per day. This duration doesn't need to be continuous, but must be used\
  \ in 1-minute increments. While the wearer is in this form, the bonus on Stealth\
  \ checks increases to +10. The wearer can end this effect as a standard action."
