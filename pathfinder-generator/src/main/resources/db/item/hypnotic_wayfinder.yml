description: "This wayfinder has a mother-of-pearl casing with perfect swirls of pink\
  \ and green patterns covering the face of the device. It hangs on an 8-inch-long\
  \ silver fob chain that makes it twirl slightly when held aloft.\nIn addition to\
  \ the standard functions of a wayfinder (including the ability to create light),\
  \ a hypnotic wayfinder can be used once per day to mesmerize weak-minded creatures\
  \ that can see it. When dangled by its fob and swung gently in a pendulumlike motion,\
  \ the hypnotic wayfinder seems to change colors as light plays off its pearlescent\
  \ exterior. This replicates the effects of hypnotic pattern (Will DC 13 negates),\
  \ centered on the hypnotic wayfinder, but creates no visible light aside from the\
  \ illusory color-shifts on the wayfinder itself. The wayfinder's wielder is immune\
  \ to this effect, as are sightless creatures.\nWhile the effect is active, the wielder\
  \ must remain stationary or the effect immediately ends. Otherwise, the effect lasts\
  \ as long as the wielder swings the wayfinder at the end of its fob (a standard\
  \ action) and for 2 rounds thereafter."
