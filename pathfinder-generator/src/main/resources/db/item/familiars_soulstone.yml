description: "A familiar's soulstone looks like an unpolished, rough red gem the size\
  \ of a fist. The bearer can use the familiar's soulstone to perform an hour-long\
  \ ritual that binds the soul of his familiar, animal companion, or bonded mount\
  \ to the soulstone. Once this bond is established, the only way to sever it is to\
  \ destroy the gem.\nIf the bonded creature dies while on the same plane as its familiar's\
  \ soulstone, its soul is siphoned into the gem, where it's preserved for 24 hours.\
  \ Within this period, holding the gem to the body of the deceased bonded creature\
  \ for 1 full minute restores that creature to life, as raise dead. The gem is destroyed\
  \ in the process. A witch's familiar brought back to life using a familiar's soulstone\
  \ retains all of its stored spells. If the soul isn't extracted from the gem within\
  \ 24 hours, the gem crumbles to dust, automatically releasing the soul to the Great\
  \ Beyond.\nA creature can have only one familiar's soulstone bound to it at a time,\
  \ and a familiar's soulstone can be bound only to a single creature."
