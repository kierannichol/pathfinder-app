description: "An Abyssal runestone allows a spellcaster to cast lesser planar binding,\
  \ planar binding, or greater planar binding, provided the spellcaster has prepared\
  \ a spell of equal or greater level to expend during the casting; the planar binding\
  \ spell functions at a caster level equal to the spellcaster's, not to the Abyssal\
  \ runestone. Spontaneous spellcasters cannot use Abyssal runestones in this way.\n\
  If a chaotic evil outsider eats an Abyssal runestone, the runestone is destroyed\
  \ and the outsider permanently gains the advanced creature template. A creature\
  \ that already has this template, or is above CR 20 in power, gains no benefit from\
  \ eating an Abyssal runestone.\nAbyssal runestones may have several other uses as\
  \ components in rituals and powerful magic, particularly in quickening the effects\
  \ of afflictions associated with the Abyss—for example, the creation of a fast-acting,\
  \ highly contagious variant of the polymorph plague (see Pathfinder #135: Runeplague)\
  \ requires the expenditure of an Abyssal runestone."
destruction: "An Abyssal runestone is destroyed if it is eaten by a chaotic evil outsider\
  \ or used in one of the rare occult rituals that can be bolstered by its sacrifice."
