description: "Breaking open this magically enhanced spider egg sac (a standard action)\
  \ conjures a massive spider web in a square adjacent to the user. The web is 5 feet\
  \ thick and up to 20 feet wide and high. The spider web is nearly invisible; spotting\
  \ it requires a successful DC 20 Perception check in bright light. This DC increases\
  \ by 4 for every step below bright light in which the spider web is placed. This\
  \ effect otherwise acts as the web spell (DC 13). Alternatively, the user can enhance\
  \ a web created by another orbicular sac. Each additional sac increases the duration\
  \ of the web by 30 minutes and the Reflex and grapple DCs by 2 (maximum increase\
  \ of +10)."
