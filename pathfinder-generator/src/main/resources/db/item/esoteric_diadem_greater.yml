description: "The diamond-shaped gems in these metal headbands are typically one of\
  \ two colors, each corresponding to a different esoteric element: onyx (void) and\
  \ pink (wood); these elements are found on pages 6–9 of Pathfinder Player Companion:\
  \ Occult Origins. The diadem's gem grants the wearer greater control over its associated\
  \ element.\nWhile worn by a kineticist, this item increases the damage dealt by\
  \ the kineticist's simple and composite blasts that match the element of the inlaid\
  \ gem by 1d6 points (for a lesser esoteric diadem), 2d6 points (for an esoteric\
  \ diadem), or 3d6 points (for a greater esoteric diadem). If the blast is a physical\
  \ blast, the extra damage dice from the esoteric diadem increase to d8s instead\
  \ of d6s. These extra damage dice don't multiply on a critical hit, and they don't\
  \ apply to blasts with form infusions that don't apply the extra damage from elemental\
  \ overflow.\nOther esoteric diadem variants exist for other little-known kineticist\
  \ elements."
