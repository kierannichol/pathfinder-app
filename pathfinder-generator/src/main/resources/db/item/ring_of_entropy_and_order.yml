description: "This gold ring resembles tiny angel wings folded around a clear crystal.\
  \ Once per day, the wearer can target herself with a protection from chaos or protection\
  \ from law effect that lasts for 10 minutes. However, if the wearer uses the ring\
  \ of entropy and order to gain protection from chaos while on a plane with the mildly\
  \ chaos-aligned or strongly chaos-aligned trait, or to gain protection from law\
  \ while on a plane with the mildly law-aligned or strongly law-aligned trait, the\
  \ effect instead lasts for 1 hour. If the wearer fails a saving throw against a\
  \ charm or compulsion effect while on a plane with the mildly chaos-aligned, mildly\
  \ law-aligned, strongly chaos-aligned, or strongly law-aligned traits, she can activate\
  \ the effect as an immediate action."
