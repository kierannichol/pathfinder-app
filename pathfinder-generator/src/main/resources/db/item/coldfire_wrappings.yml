description: "When carefully wrapped around the body of a Medium-sized creature (a\
  \ process that takes 10 minutes), these magical linen wrappings protect the wearer\
  \ from fire and provide defense against physical attacks. As an immediate action,\
  \ the wearer can immolate herself in wispy blue flames that protect the wearer as\
  \ the chill shield version of fire shield and deal 1d6+10 points of cold damage\
  \ to attackers. This protection lasts for 10 rounds before the wrappings crumble\
  \ away into fine ash."
