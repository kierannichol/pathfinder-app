description: "This sight can be attached to a single direct-fire siege engine. When\
  \ this is done, the sight becomes part of the siege engine, but can be removed from\
  \ that siege engine with a full-round action. A character firing a siege engine\
  \ that has this sight attached can look through the scope to see through magical\
  \ and normal fog, mist, smoke, and similar obscurement, ignoring the miss chance\
  \ for these obstructions. In addition, a character using this scope can choose to\
  \ take a full-round action to either locate an invisible creature within line of\
  \ sight or make a single shot that ignores the invisibility of a creature that she\
  \ knows is in the area."
