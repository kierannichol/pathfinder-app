description: "An infecting spike is a large, corroded armor spike. When carefully\
  \ placed against a suit of armor without armor spikes as a fullround action, an\
  \ infecting spike attaches itself firmly to the armor, which instantly sprouts +2\
  \ armor spikes that immediately inflict the red ache disease on any creature damaged\
  \ by the spikes (Fortitude DC 15 negates; the onset period does not apply). Any\
  \ creature that successfully saves against the red ache can't be infected by the\
  \ armor spikes again for 24 hours. The armor's wearer is immune to red ache and\
  \ gains a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against other diseases.\nA suit of\
  \ armor with an infecting spike attached slowly degrades, its joints rusting and\
  \ seams tearing. Beginning 24 hours after the infecting spike is attached, the armor\
  \ takes 1d4 points of damage each day. This damage bypasses the armor's hardness,\
  \ and can be repaired or mended normally.\nRemoving an infecting spike requires\
  \ 1 minute of scraping and twisting before it comes free with a ragged tearing sound.\
  \ As soon as the infecting spike is removed, the armor gains the broken condition;\
  \ if it already had the broken condition, the armor is instead reduced to 0 hit\
  \ points."
