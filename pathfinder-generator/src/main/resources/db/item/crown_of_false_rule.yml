description: "This item appears to be a crown studded with gems, but its valuable\
  \ metals are only veneers and its gems are clever fakes. The wielder can alter the\
  \ crown's appearance at will to that of any crown or circlet she has seen before,\
  \ but only for as long as she wears the crown. In any form, the crown is detectable\
  \ as a valueless fake with a successful DC 30 Appraise check. The wearer of a crown\
  \ of false rule is considered the rightful political ruler of wherever she is for\
  \ the purposes of magical spells or effects; for example, the wearer can receive\
  \ the benefits of a magic throne, draw a sword that can be removed only by a king,\
  \ open a vault that unlocks at the duchess's touch, and so forth. This ability does\
  \ not function in areas without a monarch or similar ruler (such as in a democracy),\
  \ and it is not effective against discern location or the actions of deities or\
  \ similarly powerful beings. For the purposes of detect spells (and spells with\
  \ similar capabilities), a crown of false rule does not appear to radiate a magical\
  \ aura."
