description: "The blade of this +1 short sword appears to be nothing more than a shadow,\
  \ but is quite solid and as sharp as steel. Five times per day, the wielder can\
  \ as a move action create a featureless black \"mask\" of illusory cloth on the\
  \ face of a willing target he touches. This mask obscures the wearer's identity\
  \ and lasts for 10 minutes. Once per day, the wielder can activate the sword as\
  \ a swift action; 1 minute afterward, the sword completely erases the wielder's\
  \ memory of the previous minute (as if using modify memory)."
