description: "This 4-inch blade is attached via a hinge to a wooden handle with a\
  \ slot in the center, into which the blade can be folded. With a click of a switch,\
  \ a spring thrusts the blade outward, where it locks into place until it is reset.\
  \ Releasing the blade is a free action, and resetting it is a move action. The handle\
  \ must be in your hand for the blade to be released; placing it in your hand requires\
  \ the same type of action as drawing a weapon. A spring blade is easy to conceal:\
  \ an observer must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to notice the blade hidden\
  \ within the wooden handle, and you gain a +4 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to\
  \ conceal a spring blade on your body."
