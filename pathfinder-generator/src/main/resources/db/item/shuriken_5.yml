description: "A shuriken is a small piece of metal with sharpened edges, designed\
  \ for throwing. A shuriken can't be used as a melee weapon. Although they are thrown\
  \ weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them and\
  \ crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them, and of what happens\
  \ to them after they are thrown."
