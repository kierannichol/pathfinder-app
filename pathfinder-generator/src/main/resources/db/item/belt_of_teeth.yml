description: "The brass buckle on this stout leather belt is fashioned to resemble\
  \ three demonic faces. Once each round, this belt's buckle can animate, lashing\
  \ out at a creature that provokes an attack of opportunity within 5 feet. This attack\
  \ uses its wearer's base attack bonus and Strength modifier, with a +4 competence\
  \ bonus. It deals damage as a bite attack made by a creature of its wearer's size\
  \ (1d6 for a Medium wearer; see Table 3â€”1: Natural Attacks by Size, Bestiary 302)\
  \ plus the wearer's Strength modifier. This belt does not add to the normal number\
  \ of attacks the wearer can make in a round; it offers another way in which to make\
  \ attacks of opportunity."
