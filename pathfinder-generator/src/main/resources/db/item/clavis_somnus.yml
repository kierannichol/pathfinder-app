description: "The Clavis Somnus is a large, ornate, silver and mithral key. It is\
  \ very cold to the touch and always gives off a faint vapor of condensation. Its\
  \ construction and value satisfy the focus component of the breach the veil of dreams\
  \ occult ritual (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 209) and grants a +5 competence\
  \ bonus on the primary caster's skill checks to perform the ceremony.\nThe key also\
  \ grants its wielder a +4 bonus on saving throws to resist illusion effects, as\
  \ well as on Charisma checks made in the Dimension of Dreams. But the key imposes\
  \ a –2 penalty on saving throws against sleep effects, and its holder is considered\
  \ to have 2 fewer Hit Dice for the purpose of determining the number of Hit Dice\
  \ used in sleep effects and the number of creatures affected. The key's holder is\
  \ always counted first when determining which creatures are affected."
