name: "Scroll of Sift"
description: "You examine an area at range as if you were searching for fine details\
  \ with the Perception skill. Make a Perception check with a â€“5 penalty, modified\
  \ as normal for conditions. No penalty is applied for distance. Apply the result\
  \ against the DC for any hidden features, such as secret doors, traps, or hidden\
  \ treasure. You must be able to see the area you are attempting to search, and you\
  \ only find details that can be perceived with sight or touch. Sift detects only\
  \ objects and features, not actual creatures."
