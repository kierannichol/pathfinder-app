description: "This bear trap looks no different from any other ordinary bear trap\
  \ (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 76), but it has several additional magical\
  \ abilities. On command, an insidious bear trap snaps shut, opens to release a trapped\
  \ creature, or resets itself. The trap can also be set to ignore a creature that\
  \ speaks a password (designated by the person setting the trap), thus preventing\
  \ the trap from triggering when the creature enters the trap's location. In addition,\
  \ the person setting the trap can effortlessly insert and withdraw the spike designed\
  \ to secure the trap into the ground or even stone.\nOnce per day, an insidious\
  \ bear trap can be commanded to turn invisible for up to 5 hours or until triggered.\
  \ While invisible, the insidious bear trap is virtually impossible to spot or disable\
  \ (+40 to the DCs for Perception and Disable Device checks), though the person who\
  \ set the trap can still see it. The trap receives no bonus on its melee attack\
  \ roll. If a target of the trap has the trap sense class ability, it retains those\
  \ bonuses to avoid the trap's attack. Additionally, once per day, an insidious bear\
  \ trap can also be set to emit an audible alarm or mental ping, as per the alarm\
  \ spell, when it is triggered."
