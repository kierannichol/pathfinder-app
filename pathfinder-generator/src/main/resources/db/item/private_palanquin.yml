description: "This versatile wooden conveyance provides a safe refuge for its passengers,\
  \ free from the prying eyes of others. A private palanquin can be commanded to change\
  \ its appearance, including not only its decorations and appointments but also its\
  \ physical form, taking the shape of an enclosed litter, two-wheeled cart, fourwheeled\
  \ light or heavy wagon, carriage, or even a small cabin, though in all shapes it\
  \ retains the dimensions of a Large object occupying a 10-foot cube. When activated,\
  \ a private palanquin moves on its own, following its passengers' directions, and\
  \ has the following statistics: hp 150; hardness 8; Speed 40 ft.; AC 18 (â€“1 size,\
  \ +9 natural); Attack none; CMD 24; Fort +2, Ref +2, Will +2.\nOnce per day, a private\
  \ palanquin can be commanded to create a set of illusory draft animals or litter\
  \ bearers that last for 12 hours or until dismissed. These creatures look, sound,\
  \ feel, and smell just like real creatures of their type, and they appear to move\
  \ the private palanquin. Up to four Medium creatures (or a single Large creature)\
  \ can fit inside a private palanquin, and creatures inside it are protected from\
  \ observation, both mundane and magical, as if in a mage's private sanctum. The\
  \ door to a private palanquin is locked, as per arcane lock, but opens with a command\
  \ word. If the door is opened without speaking the command word, it triggers an\
  \ audible alarm."
