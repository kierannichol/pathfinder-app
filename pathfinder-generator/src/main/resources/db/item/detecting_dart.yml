description: "This tiny dart is made of iron and engraved with runes. The back half\
  \ of the dart has a colorful tuft of fletching that detaches when the dart is thrown\
  \ or fired through a blowgun, fluttering to the ground in the user's space. A successful\
  \ ranged touch attack with the front half of the dart deals 1 point of damage and\
  \ embeds the needle-like point into the target's flesh. The attack causes little\
  \ pain, and the target only notices the embedded dart with a successful DC 14 Perception\
  \ check. Removing the dart takes a standard action and deals 1 additional point\
  \ of damage.\nOnce separated, the back half of the dart detects where the front\
  \ half is as long as both pieces are within 1 mile of each other. Every hour, the\
  \ back half gives a distinct hum and its fletching flutters in the direction of\
  \ the front half for 1 minute. This effect continues for up to 24 hours or until\
  \ the dart is removed, at which point its magic fades forever.\nShould a creature\
  \ eat the flesh of a target with an embedded detecting dart, it has a 50% chance\
  \ of consuming the dart. Should the dart transfer from one creature to another in\
  \ this way, the dart's back half instead tracks the new creature."
