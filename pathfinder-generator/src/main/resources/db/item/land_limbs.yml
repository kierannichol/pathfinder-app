description: "These two sturdy walking staves are topped with padded cradles that\
  \ fit under the arm. Aquatic creatures with slow land speeds, such as merfolk or\
  \ tritons, use land limbs to improve their locomotion while out of the water. Using\
  \ land limbs increases your base land speed by 15 feet (to a maximum of 20 feet)\
  \ and requires two free hands. You can remain stationary and balance your weight\
  \ on land limbs to use your hands normally (such as to draw and hurl a javelin or\
  \ to open a door), but you cannot move with the land limbs again without freeing\
  \ your hands.\nIf your race provides immunity to trip attacks, you lose this immunity\
  \ while moving with or balancing on land limbs."
