description: "This elongated bull's horn curves sharply at the end, almost making\
  \ it seem more like an enormous smoking pipe than a tool for the hunt. Once each\
  \ day, a person with the hunter's bond (companions) class feature may blow the horn\
  \ as a standard action; this grants his full favored enemy bonus (instead of half)\
  \ against a single target to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him.\
  \ The effect lasts for 1 minute."
