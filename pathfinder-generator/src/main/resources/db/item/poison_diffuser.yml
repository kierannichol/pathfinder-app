description: "This compound comes in a tiny eyedropper. When you combine a dose of\
  \ poison diffuser with a dose of contact or ingested poison, the poison becomes\
  \ a gas, slowly diffusing into the surrounding air. The poison is treated as an\
  \ inhaled poison for 3 rounds, after which the poison and the poison diffuser are\
  \ both expended and become inert. Any creature that passes within 5 feet of a diffused\
  \ poison while it is active must save against the vaporous toxin.\nIf you are using\
  \ spontaneous alchemy, adding urea to the alchemical recipe delays a poison diffuser's\
  \ activation time. For every 20 doses of urea (worth a total of 10 gp) incorporated\
  \ into the alchemical creation process, the time from which the diffuser is added\
  \ to the poison to the time the poison begins spreading into the air increases by\
  \ 1 round."
