description: "The end of this +1 viridium long lash tail attachment is a shard of\
  \ toxic green rock. As with any viridium weapon, a successful hit with an irradiating\
  \ tail causes the target to contract leprosyâ€”and a critical hit can poison the target\
  \ with greenblood oil. However, unlike with most viridium weapons, the wielder of\
  \ an irradiating tail is magically immune to the weapon's toxic effects. The viridium\
  \ has been strengthened, so the weapon isn't fragile."
