description: "This small adamantine loop and handle is typically fitted with a fine\
  \ adamantine chain so that it can be worn as a necklace. A talisman of the sphere\
  \ is worse than useless to those unable to cast arcane spells. Characters who cannot\
  \ cast arcane spells take 5d6 points of damage merely from picking up and holding\
  \ a talisman of this sort. However, when held by an arcane spellcaster who is concentrating\
  \ on control of a sphere of annihilation, a talisman of the sphere doubles the character's\
  \ modifier on his control check (doubling both his Intelligence bonus and his character\
  \ level for this purpose).\nIf the wielder of a talisman establishes control, he\
  \ needs to check for maintaining control only every other round thereafter. If control\
  \ is not established, the sphere moves toward him. Note that while many spells and\
  \ effects of cancellation have no effect upon a sphere of annihilation, the talisman's\
  \ power of control can be suppressed or canceled."
destruction: "A talisman of the sphere can be destroyed only by throwing the item\
  \ into a sphere of annihilation."
