description: "This lavish necklace is crafted from gold and interwoven bands of silver.\
  \ The coils of precious metal end in a receptacle bearing a pristine opal gemstone.\
  \ The necklace does not radiate a magic aura unless viewed with true seeing or a\
  \ similarly powerful spell. If the wearer is slain, her soul is immediately moved\
  \ into the gemstone on the necklace, as per trap the soul.\nAt the time of her death\
  \ while wearing this necklace, the wearer whose soul is moved into its gemstone\
  \ must choose a period of time ranging from 1 to 14 days. (The period of time selected\
  \ can be more specific but must be measured in an increment no smaller than an hour;\
  \ for example, 3 days and 6 hours.) After the selected amount of time passes, the\
  \ gemstone shatters, releasing the dead wearer's soul. Her body then immediately\
  \ re-forms in a space within 60 feet of where the gem shattered, regardless of the\
  \ condition of her body at the time of her death, as per true resurrection.\nIf\
  \ the gem is destroyed prior to the elapsing of the specified time, the dead wearer's\
  \ body re-forms immediately. The individual whose soul is released from the necklace\
  \ can choose where her body re-forms at the time the gem shatters. Once the former\
  \ wearer is resurrected, the necklace turns to lead and becomes worthless."
