description: "This magnificent feather, plucked from the wing of a powerful erinyes\
  \ or angel, allows the wearer to call stronger outsiders to her service. The wearer\
  \ can use the feather to call 2 more HD worth of creatures when casting a planar\
  \ binding or planar ally spell (including lesser and greater versions) or when casting\
  \ gate. Alternatively, when casting one of these spells, the spellcaster can expend\
  \ this feather to summon a single outsider with up to 2 more Hit Dice than the spell\
  \ would normally allow. For example, he may summon a trumpet archon with planar\
  \ ally, or a pit fiend with greater planar binding. The wearer gains a +2 insight\
  \ bonus on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks to influence the\
  \ creature called. Once used, the feather crumbles to mundane dust."
