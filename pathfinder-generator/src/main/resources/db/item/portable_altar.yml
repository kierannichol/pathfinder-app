description: "A portable altar is typically made of wood and is ornately carved and\
  \ decorated with the iconography of a specific religion. The top of the altar lifts\
  \ up, and items such as candles, incense, and oil can be stored within. These altars\
  \ are modest, but give traveling priests a center from which to say their daily\
  \ prayers, perform minor rituals, or preach to an assembled crowd."
