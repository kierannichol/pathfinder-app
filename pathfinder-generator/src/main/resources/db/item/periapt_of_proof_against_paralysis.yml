description: "This pewter chain necklace is formed from alternating sizes of metal\
  \ links, creating a delicate but imposing look. Short enough to be a choker, it\
  \ is set in the middle with a brilliant jasper stone that is finely cut and shines\
  \ even when light is scarce. Whenever the wearer fails a saving throw against an\
  \ effect that results in paralysis, the periapt instead causes the wearer to be\
  \ fatigued for 1d4 rounds. If an effect would paralyze the wearer without a saving\
  \ throw, he is instead fatigued until he removes the condition. If the wearer fails\
  \ a saving throw against a paralyzing effect while fatigued, he becomes exhausted.\
  \ Characters with the exhausted condition gain no benefits from a periapt of proof\
  \ against paralysis."
