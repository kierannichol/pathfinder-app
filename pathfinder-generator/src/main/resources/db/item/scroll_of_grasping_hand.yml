name: "Scroll of Grasping Hand"
description: "This spell functions as interposing hand, except that it can also grapple\
  \ one opponent you select. The grasping hand gets one grapple attack per round.\
  \ This attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Its CMB and CMD for grapple\
  \ checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +10 bonus\
  \ for its Strength (31) score and a +1 bonus for being Large (its Dexterity is 10,\
  \ granting no bonus on the Combat Maneuver Defense). The hand holds but does not\
  \ harm creatures that it grapples. Directing the spell to a new target is a move\
  \ action. The grasping hand can instead be directed to bull rush a target, using\
  \ the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as\
  \ interposing hand does."
