description: "This iron rod has long metal flanges, like a mace, which widen as they\
  \ expand from the handle. The wielder can use the rod up to three times per day\
  \ to augment her casting of a conjuration (summoning) spell, causing all of her\
  \ summoned creatures to gain the giant simple template. The lesser rod can be used\
  \ with spells of 3rd level or lower, the standard rod can be used with spells of\
  \ 6th level or lower, and the greater rod can be used with spells of 9th level or\
  \ lower."
