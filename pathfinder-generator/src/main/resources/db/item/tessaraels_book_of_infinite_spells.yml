description: "This narrow volume is bound in green leather with silver inlay shaped\
  \ in the forms of letters from the elven alphabet. It gives off a moist, earthy\
  \ smell, like a forest after a light rain.\nUnlike a standard book of infinite spells,\
  \ Tessarael's book contains only spells of levels 0 through 4th, and only has 18\
  \ pages remaining. The nature of each page is determined by a d% roll, with results\
  \ of 01–60 designating an arcane spell and 61–100 indicating a divine spell. To\
  \ determine the level of the spell, roll another d% and consult the following table.\n"
