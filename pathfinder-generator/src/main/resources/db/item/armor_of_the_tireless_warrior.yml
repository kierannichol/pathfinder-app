description: "Crafted by shamans of the Yumogu tribe for their mightiest chieftains,\
  \ this undecorated +3 leather armor is made from strips of boiled horsehide. While\
  \ her enemies tire around her, the wearer of this armor can keep fighting. If the\
  \ wearer is a barbarian, the armor of the tireless warrior allows her to rage for\
  \ 2 additional rounds per day. Once per day on command, the wearer can cause her\
  \ enemies to become fatigued, as per the waves of fatigue spell. In addition, once\
  \ per day, the wearer can draw upon the armor's strength to banish her own weariness.\
  \ For 10 minutes, the wearer takes no penalties from the fatigued or exhausted conditions.\
  \ This effect is merely an illusion, however, and when it ends, the wearer takes\
  \ 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and the condition or conditions return."
