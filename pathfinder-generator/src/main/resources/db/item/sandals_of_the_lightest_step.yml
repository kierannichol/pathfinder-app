description: "These soft leather sandals have soles that consist of a layer of purple\
  \ velvet decorated with intricate gold stitching. When slipped onto the feet, they\
  \ feel as weightless as air. In any round when the wearer has already moved at least\
  \ 10 feet along the ground or another surface (not counting travel on a mount or\
  \ vehicle), these boots can be activated as a swift action to give the wearer the\
  \ ability to walk on air (as the air walk spell) until the end of the round. If\
  \ the wearer hasn't reached a solid surface by the end of the round, she immediately\
  \ falls back to the ground, taking any applicable falling damage. These sandals\
  \ can be used up to 5 times per day, but no more often than once per minute."
