description: "A pox burster is an alchemically preserved animal bladder or gourd that\
  \ has been filled with toxic, rotting materials. You can throw a pox burster as\
  \ a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment\
  \ of 10 feet. A direct hit forces a target to immediately make a DC 13 Fortitude\
  \ save or contract filth fever. Every space adjacent to the target square of the\
  \ pox burster is covered in disease-causing filth. For the next minute, any creature\
  \ that is injured while in one of these spaces must also make a DC 9 Fortitude save\
  \ or contract filth fever."
