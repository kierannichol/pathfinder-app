description: "This spiraling silver ring glows briefly when a living creature puts\
  \ it on. If its wearer of a ring of the faithful dead is slain by a creature with\
  \ the create spawn ability, the wearer does not rise as an undead creature, even\
  \ if the ring is later removed. If a corpse is wearing a ring of the faithful dead,\
  \ any attempts to create an undead creature from the corpse (such as via animate\
  \ dead) automatically fail, though simply removing the ring ends this protection."
