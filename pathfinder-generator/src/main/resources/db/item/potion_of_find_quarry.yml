name: "Potion of Find Quarry"
description: "You sense whether a well-known creature you can clearly visualize is\
  \ within a 20-mile radius of your current location, as well as the distance and\
  \ direction to the creature in relation to you. You also discern whether the creature\
  \ is moving, and its direction, speed, and mode of movement. The radius you can\
  \ sense increases by 5 miles for every two caster levels you have above 10th (to\
  \ a maximum of a 45-mile radius at 20th level). Anything that would prevent locate\
  \ creature from finding a creature also prevents find quarry from doing so."
