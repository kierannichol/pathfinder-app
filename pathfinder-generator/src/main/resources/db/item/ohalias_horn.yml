description: "The bell of this slightly curved horn resembles the head of a roaring\
  \ lioness. The horn functions in many ways like a horn of valhalla, but while held\
  \ in one hand, the wielder gains the benefits of deathwatch. Once per year when\
  \ the wielder sounds the horn, she can summon one sleipnir with a saddle for 1 hour\
  \ in place of summoning the barbarians. The sleipnir willingly serves as a mount\
  \ or combatant."
