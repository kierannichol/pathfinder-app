name: "Scroll of Leashed Shackles"
description: "You create shackles of force that attach to the target's limbs. You\
  \ designate an object or location within 30 feet of the target for the shackles\
  \ to anchor themselves to; this must be the ground, a wall, or a sturdy structure\
  \ for the anchoring to occur. The target is entangled, and cannot move more than\
  \ 30 feet from the anchor point of the spell. The shackle itself cannot be attacked\
  \ (though it can be dispelled), but if the object or area it is attached to is broken,\
  \ the target is free to move away (though it is still entangled)."
