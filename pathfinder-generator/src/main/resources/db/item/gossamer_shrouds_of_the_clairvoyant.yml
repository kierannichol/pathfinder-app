description: "This sky-blue suit of mistmail has the glamered armor special ability,\
  \ and can once per day create a dramatic spectacle of twinkling lights, as the rainbow\
  \ pattern spell. The armor is prone to dramatic soliloquies about its \"prophetic\
  \ visions\" and \"sight beyond the mystical veils\"; however, it lacks actual divinatory\
  \ powers."
