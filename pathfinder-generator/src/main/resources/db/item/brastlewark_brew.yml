description: "This magical alcoholic beverage was invented by brewers of Brastlewark\
  \ engaged in a contest to produce the most inventive heady ale. It is most often\
  \ drunk willingly, though some bartenders throughout the Inner Sea region serve\
  \ it to unsuspecting patrons as an expensive but ultimately harmless prank. The\
  \ drinker finds any joke unbearably funny for 1 minute. Any Perform (comedy) check\
  \ with a result of at least 10 + the drinker's Will save modifier attempted within\
  \ 30 feet causes the drinker to collapse in gales of laughter, unable to take any\
  \ action but attempt suppress the laughter as a full-round action (Will DC 15).\
  \ If the drinker succeeds at the save, that laughing fit ends, but this success\
  \ offers no protection against future jokes."
