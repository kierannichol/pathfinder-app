description: "This brass-colored +1 double-barreled pistol has a dark oaken grip and\
  \ ornate musical motifs etched into the entire surface. Three times per day, when\
  \ the wielder fires a loudshot pistol at a creature within 20 feet, she can command\
  \ the pistol to emit a sonic boom at the creature, permanently deafening it if it\
  \ fails a DC 13 Fortitude save. If the wielder fires both barrels of this pistol\
  \ in the same round she commands it to deafen a creature, the DC of the Fortitude\
  \ save increases to 15. If the wielder is a gunslinger with the pistolwhip deed,\
  \ she can also command a loudshot pistol to deafen the creature she is pistol-whipping.\
  \ This counts toward the total number of times per day she can use this ability\
  \ with the pistol."
