description: "Norgir's Ruin is an intelligent +2 dwarf bane warhammer. It has spent\
  \ the past several generations in the possession of the same enemies it was once\
  \ crafted to defeat. In that time, the weapon has gone somewhat insane, warped to\
  \ thirst for the death of non-duergar dwarves and eager to please the line of duergar\
  \ rulers of Tar Vermilon. Restoring it to its original purpose is possible only\
  \ by seeking out a living descendant of Vald Norgir and securing an atonement spell\
  \ from that dwarf to absolve the magic warhammer of its madness. Doing so re-aligns\
  \ its special purpose to oppose duergar, changes its alignment to lawful good, and\
  \ raises its Wisdom score up to 14."
