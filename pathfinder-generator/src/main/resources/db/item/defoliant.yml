description: "This milky fluid can be mixed with water to quickly kill light and medium\
  \ vegetation. One flask of defoliant kills light brush and small trees in 50 5-foot\
  \ squares. Light vegetation (anything but trees) dies within 1 hour and can be cleared\
  \ at a rate of 10 minutes per 5-foot square (representing uprooting dead plants\
  \ and breaking stumps into gravel-sized pieces), leaving barren ground. Medium vegetation\
  \ (anything but massive trees) dies in 2 hours and can be cleared at a rate of 1\
  \ hour per 5-foot square. Massive trees can usually survive a single dose of defoliant,\
  \ and using defoliant doesn't make clearing them any easier. Defoliant can be used\
  \ as a splash weapon against plant creatures. A direct hit with the undiluted fluid\
  \ deals 1d6 hit points of damage, 1 point of Strength damage, and 1 point of Constitution\
  \ damage (Fortitude DC 20 negates the Strength and Constitution damage); plant creatures\
  \ within 5 feet of the target take 1 hit point of damage."
