description: "A sashimono of comfort is a purple Tian silk banner, typically 3 feet\
  \ tall and 1 foot wide, decorated with three stylized orchid flowers. The banner\
  \ is attached to a lance, polearm, staff, or frame, which can be worn on the back\
  \ of a creature, carried by a mounted creature, flown from a wagon, or planted in\
  \ the ground. A sashimono of comfort keeps creatures comfortable in extreme weather\
  \ conditions. It has no effect when not mounted properly or when lying on the ground.\
  \ When worn or carried by a creature, the banner grants the effects of endure elements\
  \ to the bearer. When carried by a mounted creature, it grants both mount and rider\
  \ this benefit. If it is flown from a wagon, the wagon's driver, passengers, and\
  \ draft team all gain this benefit. If planted firmly in the ground, the banner\
  \ grants this benefit to all creatures within 30 feet. In addition, a caravan equipped\
  \ with a sashimono of comfort gains a +2 bonus on Security checks to resist the\
  \ effects of severe weather. These effects function at temperatures between –50°\
  \ and 140° F. If conditions are beyond these extremes, creatures using a sashimono\
  \ of comfort treat the ambient temperature as if it were 50° F warmer or cooler\
  \ respectively, thereby possibly allowing additional castings of endure elements\
  \ to work normally."
