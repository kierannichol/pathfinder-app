description: "This rod of blackened iron is inset with rubies and functions as a +1\
  \ cunning light mace. Unholy water poured over the rod is absorbed, giving the rod\
  \ 1 charge per vial. When the rod strikes a creature, the wielder can expend 1 charge\
  \ from the rod to spray the creature with burning blood from the weapon's head.\
  \ This burning blood deals 1d6 points of damage (half fire, half unholy).\nAlternatively,\
  \ the wielder can expend 5 charges at once to create a spray of burning blood in\
  \ a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the area take 5d4 points of damage (half fire, half\
  \ unholy; Reflex DC 17 half). The rod can hold at most 10 charges at any one time.\
  \ Charging the rod with unholy water is a standard action that provokes attacks\
  \ of opportunity."
