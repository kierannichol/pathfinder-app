description: "This belt is worked with images of horses stampeding across a barren,\
  \ windswept plain. The belt's wearer automatically succeeds at any check to guide\
  \ with the knees, stay in the saddle, fight with a combat-trained mount, control\
  \ a mount in battle, or make a fast mount or dismount, as long as the belt's wearer\
  \ is wearing medium, light, or no armor. Furthermore, the belt grants a +4 competence\
  \ bonus on all other Ride checks, including ones made while the wearer is in heavy\
  \ armor."
