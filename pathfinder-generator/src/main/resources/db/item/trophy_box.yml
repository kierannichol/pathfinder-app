description: "A trophy box is a 1-foot-wide clay box used to trap and release beasts\
  \ too dangerous to confront directly. As soon as the trophy box is placed and the\
  \ first command word is spoken, the trap is rigged to trigger whenever a Medium\
  \ or larger animal comes within 20 feet of the box. The target must succeed at a\
  \ DC 17 Will save or be drawn into an extradimensional space within the box, where\
  \ it is held in a state of suspended animation for up to 24 hours. A trophy box\
  \ can hold only one such victim at a time. The first command word can be used once\
  \ per day.\nIf the second command word is spoken, any animal trapped within the\
  \ trophy box appears adjacent to the box either immediately or when a Tiny or larger\
  \ creature (other than the user) comes within 20 feet (user's choice). A creature\
  \ within 20 feet that speaks the password (set when the box is first activated)\
  \ does not trigger the box. If the user is within 50 feet of the released animal,\
  \ she can control it for 1 minute after its release as the dominate animal spell.\
  \ Otherwise, the released animal attacks the nearest creature for 1 minute, after\
  \ which its normal instincts take over."
