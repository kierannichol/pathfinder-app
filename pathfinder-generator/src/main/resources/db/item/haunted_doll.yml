description: "When glimpsed out of the corner of the eye, the beatific expression\
  \ of this child's rag doll twists into a malignant grin. The doll feeds off of violent\
  \ emotion and anger. Each time anger flares or battle rages within 20 feet of the\
  \ doll, there is a 5% chance the malevolent spirit within the doll awakens, manifesting\
  \ as an advanced poltergeist (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 292, 211). When this happens,\
  \ the doll becomes incorporeal and floats into the air, the poltergeist's malevolent\
  \ spirit invisibly surrounding it. The poltergeist's site bond ability is tied to\
  \ the space it spawned in, and it immediately attacks those around it. When the\
  \ poltergeist is slain, the doll turns corporeal again and falls to the ground,\
  \ its spirit quelled for the time being. The spirit within the doll can be questioned\
  \ using the call spirit spell.\nOwning a haunted doll leads to troubled dreams for\
  \ the possessor, full of seemingly prophetic warnings of doom. Each night, there\
  \ is a 10% chance that the owner needs to attempt a DC 20 Will save. On a failure,\
  \ the owner gains no rest for the night and can't recover spells, pools, or other\
  \ daily abilities."
