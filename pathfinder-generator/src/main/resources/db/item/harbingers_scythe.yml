description: "This +2 scythe has a handle carved of bone and topped with a single\
  \ onyx gem. Once per day when the wielder of the weapon confirms a critical hit\
  \ against a foe, she can command the blade to release a wave of soul-stealing power.\
  \ All enemies within a 10-foot-radius burst of the wielder must succeed at a DC\
  \ 16 Will save or gain 1 temporary negative level. After 1 hour, these temporary\
  \ negative levels disappear automatically without requiring a saving throw. This\
  \ ability is not triggered by a critical hit against a helpless or unaware creature\
  \ or a creature that has a number of Hit Dice less than half the wielder's total\
  \ Hit Dice."
