description: "These weapons are treated sticks of wood, either left bare or covered\
  \ in elaborate decorative designs. Baston fighting sticks vary in length from 2\
  \ to 4 feet, with thicknesses varying between 1 to 3 inches. In most applications,\
  \ these weapons are similar to clubs or quarterstaffs, but in the hands of a trained\
  \ expert, they truly shine. A creature with the Combat Reflexes feat treats the\
  \ weapon as having the blocking and performance weapon special features (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Ultimate Equipment 22)."
