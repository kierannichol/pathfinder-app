description: "No matter how vigorous the attempt to clean it, this amulet is perpetually\
  \ bloodied. Once per day, if the wearer eats a pound of flesh from a creature of\
  \ its own race, the amulet grants the wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength\
  \ for 24 hours. If the wearer goes 24 hours without consuming such flesh, however,\
  \ this bonus to Strength ends and the wearer takes 2 points of Strength damage.\
  \ Every day the wearer doesn't eat such flesh, he takes 2 additional points of Strength\
  \ damage. This damage can be healed normally. Eating such flesh again temporarily\
  \ negates the Strength damage from this effect and restores the bonus to Strength,\
  \ but all damage that hasn't been healed returns if the amulet is removed or a cannibalistic\
  \ meal is missed. Removing the Ghoul Stone prevents further Strength damage, but\
  \ does not negate any previous damage. A creature reduced to 0 Strength by the amulet\
  \ dies and rises 24 hours later as a ghoul, or possibly a ghast (10% chance)."
