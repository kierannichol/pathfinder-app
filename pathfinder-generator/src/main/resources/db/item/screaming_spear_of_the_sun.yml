description: "This +4 wounding throwing longspear has a 2-foot-long iron spearhead\
  \ covered with over 30 cruel flesh barbs. On a critical hit, the barbs lodge in\
  \ the victim's flesh and can be removed only by tearing the blade free. Yanking\
  \ the blade free is a fullround action that requires a successful Strength check\
  \ with a DC equal to the attack roll that struck the critical hit, and deals 3d6\
  \ points of damage to the victim.\nIn the hands of a mythic creature, the spear\
  \ gains the returning special ability, and when thrown seemingly comes alive, screaming\
  \ wickedly as it flies. When it hits a creature, it radiates fear (as the spell)\
  \ in a 60-foot-radius burst surrounding the creature struck.\nEach use of mythic\
  \ power the wielder expends when throwing the spear increases the spear's throwing\
  \ range by 100 feet."
destruction: "A screaming spear of the sun disintegrates if thrown into the flaming\
  \ heart of a sun."
