description: "The horse bow functions like a composite longbow, but it is designed\
  \ to be used on horseback. A rider using a horse bow can make ranged attacks while\
  \ mounted; furthermore, she does not take a penalty to attack rolls when her mount\
  \ is taking a double move action, and she takes only a â€“4 penalty on attack rolls\
  \ when her mount is running. The price of this item is for a default horse bow;\
  \ each point of Strength bonus granted by the horse bow adds 150 gp to its cost."
