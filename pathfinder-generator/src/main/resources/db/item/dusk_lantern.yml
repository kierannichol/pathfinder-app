description: "This specialized bullseye lantern has a ruby lens that covers the original\
  \ lens, providing a deep crimson hue to the lantern's light, allowing for more stealth\
  \ when used in areas of darkness. This special lens can be set in place or removed\
  \ as a swift action. While the ruby lens is in place, the lantern only provides\
  \ dim light in a 60-foot cone. A dusk lantern's red light is imperceptible to creatures\
  \ relying on darkvision as their sole form of sight."
