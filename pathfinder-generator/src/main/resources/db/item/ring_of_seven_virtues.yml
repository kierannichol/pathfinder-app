description: "This bronze band is covered in geometric shapes and studded with tiny\
  \ pearls. The wearer of the ring gains a constant endure elements effect and a +5\
  \ competence bonus on Survival checks made in jungles. In Saventh-Yhi, the wearer\
  \ also enjoys the active benefits of one of that city's seven spears for as long\
  \ as she is in that spear's district. The wearer loses the benefits of a particular\
  \ spear if she leaves that spear's district, but gains new active benefits if she\
  \ enters a new spear's district. The ring's wearer can only gain the benefits of\
  \ a single spear at any one time."
