description: "Fine links spread from this gold bracelet to rings and finger-capping\
  \ claws. This ornament was once a vambrace of the genie, but its magic has been\
  \ warped and corrupted by daemon spirit trapped within.\nThe Handflower of Genocide\
  \ grants its wearer a +2 profane bonus to Strength and a +4 profane bonus on checks\
  \ to perform dirty trick and grapple combat maneuvers. The wearer can cast murderous\
  \ command at will by caressing a target with the Handflower (reducing the spell's\
  \ range to touch and requiring a melee touch attack). Once per day as a full-round\
  \ action, the wearer can concentrate to locate the nearest source of mass death\
  \ within 500 miles, the Handflower directs her unerringly toward the death as per\
  \ the find the path spell.\nIf the wearer touches a creature without casting murderous\
  \ command, the wearer must immediately succeed at a DC 18 Will save or be compelled\
  \ to strangle the creature touched. If the wearer fails, she must attempt a combat\
  \ maneuver check against the target's CMD, including any bonuses to grapple. If\
  \ successful, the target must immediately begin holding its breath, and every subsequent\
  \ successful combat maneuver check reduces the time remaining until it suffocates\
  \ by 1d6 rounds. The wearer can attempt a new Will save each round to stop strangling\
  \ her victim, but she takes a cumulative –1 penalty for each prior failed check."
destruction: "While wearing the Handflower of Genocide, a creature must foster a romance\
  \ between a protean and an inevitable, and have each kiss the bracelet to grant\
  \ its blessing."
