description: "This rugged backpack is identical to a handy haversack in most regards,\
  \ with numerous compartments for storing items. Any effort to identify it with a\
  \ Spellcraft check result ranging from 24 to 33 by someone unfamiliar with its special\
  \ properties reveals it to be a handy haversack. A result below 24 does not identify\
  \ any magic properties, while a result of 34 or higher reveals its additional secret\
  \ properties. It has two hidden compartments (Perception DC 35), each able to store\
  \ up to 1 cubic foot of material or 10 pounds in weight. In addition, the entire\
  \ item is reinforced with thin mithral fibers, giving it a hardness of 15 and 5\
  \ hit points. Each compartment has a concealed superior lock (Perception DC 35,\
  \ Disable Device DC 40) built in to prevent unauthorized access. When a compartment\
  \ is locked, an item can still be removed from it as a move action by a character\
  \ who has a key to the lock, like a normal handy haversack. The keys are not magical\
  \ and can be crafted (Craft DC 25) by a character able to disable the existing locks\
  \ and who has at least 5 ranks in Craft (locks). Each secure paypack is normally\
  \ created with two keys."
