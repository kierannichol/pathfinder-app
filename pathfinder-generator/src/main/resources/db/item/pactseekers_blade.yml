description: "This +2 cruel longsword features layers of cold iron and steel folded\
  \ over one another repeatedly. The blade counts as cold iron for the purpose of\
  \ overcoming a creature's damage reduction. Whenever a pactseeker's blade successfully\
  \ deals at least 1 point of damage (after damage reduction) to a target, the weapon\
  \ also deals damage equal to the weapon's enhancement bonus to each ally that shares\
  \ an ongoing spell (such as haste) with or is otherwise magically bound to the target\
  \ (such as other members of a hag coven). This damage disregards the range between\
  \ the weapon's target and such bound creatures, and the damage bypasses damage reduction."
