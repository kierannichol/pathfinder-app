description: "Three small metal rings adorn one side of this long, rectangular piece\
  \ of black fabric, which shimmers with magic. Once per day, if the banner is attached\
  \ to the mast of a ship or other water-faring vessel, a passenger on board who has\
  \ line of sight to the banner can say its command word and the name of a port of\
  \ her choice to transform the banner into one of that port for the next 24 hours,\
  \ complete with the correct colors and heraldry, as appropriate. When the banner\
  \ transforms, it also transforms all flags and labels identifying the ship or vessel,\
  \ including any on the ship's cargo if that cargo is labeled with a place of origin\
  \ or destination. If the banner is removed from the mast of the ship at any time\
  \ while it is obscuring its port of call, the banner and all identifying flags and\
  \ labels on the ship revert to their original state. Flags and labels affected in\
  \ this way all radiate a faint aura of transmutation magic, and if the magic affecting\
  \ one flag or label (or the banner of piracy itself) is suppressed, such as with\
  \ dispel magic, all of the banner's magic is suppressed. Creatures that interact\
  \ with banners, cargo, flags, or similar labels affected by this banner (such as\
  \ by examining them very closely or touching them) can see through the banner's\
  \ magic with a successful DC 14 Will saving throw."
