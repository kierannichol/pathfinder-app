description: "This fabric vest contains pockets full of cork, providing the wearer\
  \ additional buoyancy. Originally worn by fishers and sailors, it protects against\
  \ drowning. While wearing a cork vest, you take a â€“2 penalty on Dexterity and Swim\
  \ checks, but instead of going underwater after failing the check by 5 or more,\
  \ you go underwater only if you fail by 10 or more. Additionally, you gain a +4\
  \ bonus on Swim checks to avoid damage from fatigue. The cork vest can be worn under\
  \ armor."
