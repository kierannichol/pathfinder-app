description: "Approximately 15 feet tall and 15 feet square, this crude hut sits atop\
  \ a pair of gigantic chicken legs that, when not tucked beneath the structure at\
  \ rest, endlessly pick and scratch at the hut's surroundings. The life-like legs\
  \ aren't the only thing that make the hut remarkable, however. The small building's\
  \ only door opens into a room that can be significantly larger than what the structure\
  \ can naturally contain, for the hut possesses countless configurations of extradimensional\
  \ rooms that change depending on the hut's physical location. Nothing that transpires\
  \ outside the hut has any effect on those inside. The properties and abilities of\
  \ the Dancing Hut are divided into two categories: the defensive and the transportive.\n\
  Defensive: At its most basic level, the Dancing Hut is a unique CR 17 construct.\
  \ The statistics and abilities of this remarkable creation are detailed below. A\
  \ creature inside the hut can command the structure to move, attack, use its special\
  \ abilities, or immediately perform any other function it is capable of by employing\
  \ the Dancing Hut's unusual controls, which consist of a brown hen's egg inside\
  \ a simple, cracked clay bowl sitting upon a table inside the hut. Both the bowl\
  \ and egg can easily be removed or destroyed, but both reappear 1 hour later and\
  \ only function within the confines of the hut. Breaking the egg reveals the head\
  \ of live and very irate rooster that dies a long, squawking death—and disappears\
  \ an hour later when the controls reform. Any creature that makes a successful DC\
  \ 30 Use Magic Device check can use these innocuous controls to command the Dancing\
  \ Hut. Failing this check causes the hut to dance erratically, potentially trampling\
  \ creatures nearby, but has no effect on creatures inside the hut. A creature must\
  \ succeed at a new Use Magic Device check every round to directly control the hut's\
  \ actions. The hut can be assigned simple, standing commands to follow, such as\
  \ to attack any humanoid that approaches, to patrol an area, to head in a direction\
  \ for a set period, or to flee if damaged, but cannot be assigned commands that\
  \ require it to follow multipart instructions, recognize specific individuals, or\
  \ seek a specific place.\nTransportive: As a construct, the Dancing Hut can physically\
  \ move on its own, but it also possesses the ability to slip between planes and\
  \ even travel to other planets, carrying any inside the hut with it. This remarkable\
  \ ability is activated using the cauldron within the hut, which links the hut to\
  \ countless—if not infinite—locations across the planes. To use these transportive\
  \ abilities, a creature must stand before the hut's cauldron, place two ingredients\
  \ inside, and stir the ever-bubbling stew within—a process requiring a full-round\
  \ action, though finding the desired ingredients might take longer. The two ingredients\
  \ act as \"keys\" to a specific destination. Each destination the hut can travel\
  \ to has a specific combination, or \"recipe,\" of two keys, which appear to be\
  \ relatively normal items stored throughout the hut itself. Although the keys appear\
  \ to be absolutely mundane, only those specific items within the hut function as\
  \ keys. So while a red apple might be one key, it must be the red apple found inside\
  \ the Dancing Hut, not just any apple. Like the hut's controls, keys can easily\
  \ be destroyed or removed from the hut, but they reappear 1 hour later. In the Reign\
  \ of Winter Adventure Path, Queen Elvanna has deactivated the keys within the hut\
  \ to keep anyone from stealing the hut and taking it away from Golarion. Throughout\
  \ the campaign, the PCs seek out additional keys hidden by Baba Yaga that enable\
  \ them to control the hut. Since these additional keys were not present in the hut\
  \ when Elvanna deactivated them, once brought into the hut, these new keys function\
  \ exactly as would the keys normally found in the hut, in all cases. At no point\
  \ during the campaign do any of the deactivated keys function; if placed within\
  \ the hut's cauldron, they simply disappear and reappear, still deactivated, 1 hour\
  \ later. Until the PCs rescue Baba Yaga, who can reactivate the keys within the\
  \ hut, the only way to use the Dancing Hut's transportive abilities is with the\
  \ extra keys left behind by Baba Yaga.\nOnce the proper keys have been placed in\
  \ the cauldron, the Dancing Hut immediately appears at its new destination, as if\
  \ it had traveled there via plane shift or interplanetary teleport (Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Ultimate Magic 225). The hut always appears in the same location at a given destination—\
  the keys are tied to that specific location. Once at a destination, the Dancing\
  \ Hut can move (or be moved) normally to any other location on that world or plane.\
  \ Once the hut arrives at its new destination, the keys immediately disappear from\
  \ the cauldron, reforming elsewhere in the hut.\nEach time a new combination of\
  \ keys is used to transport the Dancing Hut to a new location, the interior layout\
  \ of the hut changes, as each location to which the hut can travel has its own corresponding\
  \ layout of the hut's interior. As the hut travels, these layouts can change dramatically,\
  \ though every layout contains one room with a cauldron and the hut's controls,\
  \ regardless of how many other rooms are present in that layout. Starting with Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path #68, each adventure in the Reign of Winter Adventure Path presents\
  \ a new layout of the hut, based on the physical location of the hut in that adventure.\n\
  When the Dancing Hut's layout changes, the other layouts still exist, but are inaccessible\
  \ from within the hut itself. Magic such as plane shift can still be used to visit\
  \ these otherwise inaccessible layouts, and Baba Yaga herself (as well as certain\
  \ other residents of the hut) can freely travel throughout all of the rooms of the\
  \ hut, regardless of the hut's physical location."
destruction: "If the cauldron inside the Dancing Hut is used to open a gate within\
  \ the cauldron itself, a rift in reality opens, destroying the hut's extradimensional\
  \ interior and sucking in the exterior frame — likely destroying whoever activated\
  \ the cauldron, and some posit much more than that. Only Baba Yaga knows the recipe\
  \ to open this self-destruct portal, one ingredient of which is her own left eye."
