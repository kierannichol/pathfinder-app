description: "This elixir forces the drinker to say nothing but the truth for 10 minutes\
  \ (Will DC 13 negates). She must answer any questions put to her in that time, but\
  \ with each question she can make a separate DC 13 Will save. If one of these secondary\
  \ saves is successful, she doesn't break free of the truth-compelling enchantment\
  \ but also doesn't have to answer that particular question (if she does answer,\
  \ she must tell the truth). No more than one question can be asked each round. This\
  \ is a mindaffecting compulsion enchantment."
