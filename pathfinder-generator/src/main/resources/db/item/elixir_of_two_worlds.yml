description: "When a drinker willingly imbibes this elixir underwater, the elixir\
  \ of two worlds transforms either a humanoid-shaped land-dwelling creature or a\
  \ merfolk-shaped sea-dwelling creature instantaneously. A land-dweller's legs transform\
  \ into a tail fin (granting him a land speed of 5 feet and swim speed of 40 feet)\
  \ and he gains the aquatic subtype, while a sea-dweller's tail fin transforms into\
  \ legs (granting him a land speed of 30 feet and no swim speed) and he loses the\
  \ aquatic subtype. Because the drinker must imbibe it underwater, he must use a\
  \ potion sponge or a potion sureseal bladder. Further, it's impossible to use alchemical\
  \ allocation with this elixir. Only miracle, wish, or similar magic, or another\
  \ elixir of two worlds, can reverse the elixir's effects."
