description: "This battered yet lovingly polished +1 breastplate is marked by three\
  \ chipped glass circles set over the heart, each of a different color. Three times\
  \ per day, the wearer may tap a circle to activate it, enveloping her in a shimmering\
  \ aura that protects her from harm. The wearer gains DR 10/â€” and is protected if\
  \ she were under the effects of a globe of invulnerability spell. The effect ends\
  \ as soon as the wearer makes an offensive action or casts an offensive spell, or\
  \ after 1 minute. In addition, whenever the wearer casts a cure spell or administers\
  \ a cure potion while under this effect, she may add one additional die to the total\
  \ amount of damage healed."
