description: "This silvery cape furls and ripples like a flag with every step its\
  \ owner takes. As a swift action, the wearer can order the cape to transform into\
  \ a faint sphere of force that surrounds him on all sides. The field grants the\
  \ wearer concealment (20% miss chance) against ranged attacks and lasts for 1 minute\
  \ or until the wearer is missed by a ranged attack due to the power of the cloak,\
  \ whichever comes first. When the field is used, all magic is lost from the cloak,\
  \ leaving only a mundane silvery garment."
