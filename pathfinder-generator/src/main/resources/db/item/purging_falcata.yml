description: "First constructed for use during Taldor's great purge of the Sarenite\
  \ Cult of the Dawnflower, this +2 falcata is inscribed with various religious slurs.\
  \ While purging falcatas are typically attuned against followers of the Dawnflower,\
  \ variants of this blade have been keyed to all variety of deities. The attuned\
  \ religion is chosen when the weapon is created, and can't be changed later.\nWhen\
  \ a purging falcata is used against members of the attuned religion, its enhancement\
  \ bonus is +4 instead of +2. It also deals an additional 2d6 points of damage to\
  \ followers of the designated religion. This additional damage is not multiplied\
  \ on a critical hit.\nIf the wielder of the purging falcata possesses the challenge\
  \ class feature, when issuing a challenge, he doesn't take the â€“2 penalty to Armor\
  \ Class against attacks made by followers of the deity attuned to the blade. If\
  \ the target of the challenge follows the faith to which the blade is attuned, the\
  \ wielder deals an additional 3d6 points of damage instead of the normal 2d6."
