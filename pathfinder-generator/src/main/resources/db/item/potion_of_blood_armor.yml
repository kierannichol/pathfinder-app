name: "Potion of Blood Armor"
description: "Your blood becomes as hard as iron upon contact with air. Each time\
  \ you take at least 5 points of piercing or slashing damage, your armor gains a\
  \ +1 enhancement bonus to your AC. An outfit of regular clothing counts as armor\
  \ that grants no AC bonus for the purpose of this spell. This enhancement bonus\
  \ stacks with itself, but not with an existing enhancement bonus, to a maximum enhancement\
  \ bonus of +5. This spell has no effect while underwater or in environments that\
  \ lack air."
