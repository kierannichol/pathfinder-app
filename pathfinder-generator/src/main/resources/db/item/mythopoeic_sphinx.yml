description: "Carved from sandstone, this small stone statuette depicts a female sphinx\
  \ and is a powerful tool for divinations. Once per week, the possessor can ask the\
  \ mythopoeic sphinx about an important person, place, or thing. The sphinx then\
  \ animates and relates legends about the subject in either Common, Draconic, or\
  \ Sphinx, as if with legend lore. In addition, a mythopoeic sphinx can be used as\
  \ a focus component that replaces the normal focus or material components for the\
  \ augury, divination, and legend lore spells. Lastly, the possessor of a mythopoeic\
  \ sphinx gains a +4 bonus on Diplomacy checks to influence sphinxes.\nThe possessor\
  \ of a mythopoeic sphinx can also use the figurine to call a gynosphinx to his presence\
  \ and bargain for her services as if using planar ally to call upon an outsider.\
  \ A mythopoeic sphinx permanently loses all of its magical abilities when used to\
  \ call a sphinx in this way, becoming a mundane stone statuette, regardless of whether\
  \ or not the called sphinx agrees to serve the possessor."
