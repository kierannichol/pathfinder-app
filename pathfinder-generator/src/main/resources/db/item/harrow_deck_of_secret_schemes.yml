description: "Members of Absalom's prominent houses sometimes employ this variant\
  \ harrow deck (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 293) to communicate\
  \ covertly with their fellow schemers. The deck includes the standard 54 cards plus\
  \ an additional six trump cards. The trumps cards can be removed from the deck,\
  \ which can then be used to perform normal harrowings.\nAs a standard action, the\
  \ user can hand a trump card from the deck to a willing creature. By performing\
  \ a variant harrowing that involves only the user and takes 10 minutes to complete,\
  \ the user can learn the name of the most recent spell or magic item used to divine\
  \ information about the trump card's recipient or learn the content of messages\
  \ sent concerning the recipient within 1 mile.\nOnce per day, the user can speak\
  \ a command word to reveal the information carried by the most recent such divination\
  \ or message, as well as an identifying feature of the caster or item user. The\
  \ caster or item user can negate this intrusion with a successful DC 16 Will saving\
  \ throw. (If the saving throw fails and the user later casts scrying or uses a similar\
  \ magical effect targeting the caster or item user, the user is treated as if he\
  \ had met the target.)\nThe recipient of the trump card can convey a simple message\
  \ of up to 25 words to the deck's user by concentrating while tearing up the card\
  \ as a standard action. The next variant harrowing performed as described above\
  \ reveals the message instead of its usual effect. Once all six trumps have been\
  \ destroyed, the deck loses its power. A trump card can be returned to the deck\
  \ instead of being used to convey a message."
