description: "This cloak is usually made of wool, although it can be made of leather.\
  \ A detect poison spell can reveal the presence of poison in the cloak's fabric.\
  \ The garment can be handled without harm, but as soon as it is actually donned,\
  \ the wearer takes 4d6 points of Constitution damage unless she succeeds on a DC\
  \ 28 Fortitude save.\nOnce donned, a poisonous cloak can be removed only with a\
  \ remove curse spell; doing this destroys the magical property of the cloak. If\
  \ a neutralize poison spell is then used, it is possible to revive a dead victim\
  \ with a raise dead or resurrection spell."
