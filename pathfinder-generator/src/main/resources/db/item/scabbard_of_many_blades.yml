description: "This scabbard can hold multiple melee weapons in an extradimensional\
  \ space, including weapons that would not normally fit in any kind of scabbard or\
  \ sheath. It can hold up to four two-handed weapons. Two one-handed or light melee\
  \ weapons can fit in each two-handed weapon slot, for a maximum capacity of eight\
  \ one-handed or light melee weapons. Only weapons designed to be used by creatures\
  \ the same size as the wearer or smaller can be kept in a scabbard of many blades.\
  \ The scabbard can't be used to store shields (even if they can be used to make\
  \ melee attacks), gauntlets, improvised weapons, or wands, but can store rods (which\
  \ are treated as one-handed weapons) and magic staves (which are treated as two-handed\
  \ weapons).\nWhen the wearer draws a weapon from the scabbard, if she does not lose\
  \ her grip on it (keeping it in her hands at all times), as a move action she can\
  \ have it switch places with another weapon in the scabbard. If the wearer has the\
  \ Quick Draw feat, she can do this as a swift action. If the wearer loses her grip\
  \ on a weapon drawn from the scabbard, that weapon can't switch places with another\
  \ weapon until it has been, sheathed in the scabbard of many blades and drawn again."
