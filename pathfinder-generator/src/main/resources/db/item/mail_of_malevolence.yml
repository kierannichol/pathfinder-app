description: "Mail of malevolence hangs in rags and tatters and acts as nonmagical\
  \ chainmail to wearers who lack at least a moderate evil aura (Core Rulebook 266).\
  \ When worn by a sufficiently evil character, it instead functions as +2 unrighteous\
  \ chainmail (see page 123). Mail of malevolence does not bestow a negative level\
  \ on good wearers.\nThe wearer of mail of malevolence gains SR 21, but only against\
  \ spells with the good descriptor. In addition, whenever the wearer channels negative\
  \ energy to harm living creatures, she heals a like amount of damage herself regardless\
  \ of whether she is living or undead."
