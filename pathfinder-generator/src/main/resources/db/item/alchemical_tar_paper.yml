description: "This 5-foot square of paper is covered in alchemical tar on both sides.\
  \ Removing its protective wax cover and applying the tar paper to a surface requires\
  \ a full-round action. Any creature that enters this space must succeed a DC 15\
  \ Reflex save or be glued to the floor, unable to move away. A victim can break\
  \ free with a successful DC 17 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage\
  \ to the tar paper with a slashing weapon. Once free, the creature moves (even if\
  \ flying) at half speed. Once stepped on, the tar turns brittle and falls away,\
  \ freeing trapped or hindered creatures, after 2d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds\
  \ at a DC 10 Perception check notices the tar paper in time to avoid stepping on\
  \ it. Alchemical tar paper cannot be reused.\nThis can be crafted with a DC 20 Craft\
  \ (traps) check."
