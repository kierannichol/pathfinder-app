description: "A wielder with a free hand can split this +1 dagger into two identical\
  \ +1 daggers as a swift action, or a free action if she has the Quick Draw feat.\
  \ The doubled daggers can't be split again. If either dagger is thrown while doubled,\
  \ the hurled dagger vanishes after resolving the attack and the remaining dagger\
  \ can be split again. If the wielder drops a doubled dagger or it otherwise leaves\
  \ her person, it vanishes. If both daggers leave the wielder's hands at the same\
  \ time, determine randomly which dagger vanishes.\nSpells or effects placed on a\
  \ dagger of doubling don't duplicate when the dagger is split. Any active effects\
  \ on a dagger end when it vanishes. Destroying one of the doubled daggers just causes\
  \ the duplicate to disappear, but any damage to a single dagger of doubling remains\
  \ on both daggers when it doubles."
