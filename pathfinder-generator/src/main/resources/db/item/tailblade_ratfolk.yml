description: "A tailblade is a small, sharp knife designed to be strapped to the tip\
  \ of a wielder's tail. It takes a full-round action to strap on or remove a tailblade.\
  \ The wearer can loosely attach the tailblade (without strapping it securely in\
  \ place) as a move action, but using a loosely attached tailblade gives the wielder\
  \ a â€“4 penalty on all attack rolls made with the weapon, and other creatures get\
  \ a +4 bonus on disarm combat maneuver checks to disarm the tailblade. A ratfolk\
  \ wielding a tailblade can make a tail attack, adding its Strength modifier to the\
  \ tailblade's damage. Ratfolk are considered proficient with such attacks and can\
  \ apply feats or effects appropriate to natural attacks to tail attacks made with\
  \ a tailblade. If used as part of a full attack action, attacks with a tailblade\
  \ are considered secondary attacks."
