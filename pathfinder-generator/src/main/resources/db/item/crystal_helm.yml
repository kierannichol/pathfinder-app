description: "This clear, spherical helm resembles a giant bowl the wearer inverts\
  \ over his head. Donning or removing the crystal helm requires a standard action,\
  \ as an invisible magical film stretches across the opening of the bowl. If a creature\
  \ dons a crystal helm on land, it immediately fills with salt water. If a creature\
  \ dons a crystal helm underwater, it immediately fills with air. So long as the\
  \ bearer can breathe water or air, respectively, the crystal helm allows the wearer\
  \ to breathe normally. The contents of a crystal helm constantly replenish and do\
  \ not leak out of the bowl. A creature that dons the crystal helm without knowing\
  \ its power may be in for a shock."
