name: "Scroll of World Wave"
description: "You cause any sort of natural terrain (including water, forest, desert,\
  \ tundra, and so on) to surge beneath your feet and safely propel you with devastating\
  \ force over great distances. This wave of terrain undulates as it passes over the\
  \ world, harmlessly lifting or stretching objects, creatures, and phenomena with\
  \ a connection to nature but tearing through and damaging anything else it encounters.\
  \ When you cast the spell you must choose the wave's type, either a tsunami or a\
  \ swell. If you choose a tsunami, you create a 30-foot-high tidal wave of earth\
  \ or water hurtling across the landscape that lasts for 1 round per level. If you\
  \ choose a swell, you create a more controlled and gentle 5-foot-high wave that\
  \ lasts for 1 hour per level. Regardless of its form or composition, the crest of\
  \ the wave extends 10 feet in front of and behind you, and 5 feet per level to both\
  \ your left and right. You can stand or sit on the crest of this wave without any\
  \ fear of falling off it and can even lie down and sleep (or take any other actions\
  \ you could take if standing on solid ground) as it travels. You can grant up to\
  \ one additional creature per level the ability to safely accompany you on this\
  \ wave."
