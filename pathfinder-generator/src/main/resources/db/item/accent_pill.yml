description: "This small, white pill has the consistency of a toughened almond. When\
  \ consumed on its own, an accent pill has no effect on the creature ingesting it.\
  \ To function, the pill must first be coated with the blood or saliva of a living\
  \ creature. Once coated, the pill turns from white to a dull brown. Consuming a\
  \ coated pill grants the consuming creature the exact tone and speech mannerisms\
  \ of the creature whose blood or saliva was used to coat the pill. When used as\
  \ part of a disguise, it grants the consumer a +15 bonus on Disguise checks to fool\
  \ a listener into thinking the speaker is the creature whose blood or saliva coated\
  \ the pill; as with vocal alteration, this bonus applies only to someone hearing\
  \ the voice without seeing the speaker. This effect lasts for 24 hours."
