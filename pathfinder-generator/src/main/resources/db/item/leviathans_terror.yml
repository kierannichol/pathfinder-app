description: "This +2 ominous harpoon is carved from a bleached whale bone and bound\
  \ with the spirit of an ancient beast that rumbles with a low, mournful call each\
  \ time the barbed tip strikes. Holding the weapon fills the wielder with the nerve\
  \ to face even the most imposing foes, granting her a +2 morale bonus on saving\
  \ throws against the frightful presence universal monster ability. She does not\
  \ take the usual â€“4 penalty to use the Intimidate skill on a target larger than\
  \ her as long as she carries the leviathan's terror on her person.\nThree times\
  \ per day, the wielder of a leviathan's terror can call on the spirit in the weapon\
  \ to enlarge her musculature, drain the color from her skin, and turn her exhalations\
  \ to rolling fog for a 1-minute period. During this time, once as a standard action,\
  \ she can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all enemies that are at least\
  \ one size category larger than her within a 30-foot radius. During this period,\
  \ the wielder also gains a +1 size bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD and\
  \ is treated as one size category larger for the purposes of determining the effects\
  \ of attacks and abilities that limit their use on larger creatures (such as tripping\
  \ creatures of a larger size category or for determining what creatures can be targeted\
  \ by the grab ability), although her actual size category does not change."
