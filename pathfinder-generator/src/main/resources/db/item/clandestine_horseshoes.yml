  \ for 1 round, the creature and its rider, if any, gain a +10 bonus on Stealth checks\
  \ for 1 round. In addition, once per day, the rider of a mount wearing clandestine\
  \ horseshoes can turn both herself and her mount invisible, as invisibility. All\
  \ four shoes must be worn by the same creature for the magic to be effective."
