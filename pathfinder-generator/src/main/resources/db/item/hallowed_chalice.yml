description: "Before it is used, this elegant drinking vessel must be filled with\
  \ water, wine, or another ceremonial liquid appropriate to the faith. Activating\
  \ the chalice charges the liquid with channeled energy; any member of the faith\
  \ who drinks the entire contents of the chalice (as if drinking a potion) recovers\
  \ hit points or takes damage as if the cleric had used her channel energy on him\
  \ (including all feats and abilities that affect the DC and damage). The liquid\
  \ in the chalice remains charged until consumed, spilled, or 24 hours pass; some\
  \ chalices include a cover to prevent spillage."
