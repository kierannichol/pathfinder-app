description: "These rings are forged in pairs, establishing a mental connection between\
  \ the two creatures wearing them, designating one as the master and the other as\
  \ the servant. The listed and cost are for both rings. Creatures wearing rings of\
  \ bondage can understand one another's speech. The wearer of the master ring gains\
  \ a +6 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks against the servant and is continuously\
  \ aware of the location and general condition of the wearer of the servant ring,\
  \ as the status spell.\nIn addition, once per day, the wearer of the master ring\
  \ of bondage can impose her will upon the wearer of the servant ring, compelling\
  \ the servant to perform or refrain from an action as if subjected to a lesser geas\
  \ (Will DC 16 negates). Alternatively, this effect can be executed as a contract\
  \ between the wearers: as long as the wearer of the master ring is a valid target\
  \ for lesser geas, she can accept a lesser geas dictated by the wearer of the servant\
  \ ring. In such an event, neither wearer is entitled to a saving throw and both\
  \ are compelled by the lesser geas to fulfill the terms of the agreement. If the\
  \ wearer of the servant ring is unwilling to agree to such a contract, she can always\
  \ select a lesser geas such as \"remove the lesser geas from me.\"\nAs long as a\
  \ lesser geas imposed by a ring of bondage remains in effect, neither ring can be\
  \ removed. If either ring is destroyed, the effects of the lesser geas remain in\
  \ place, but the surviving ring can't create a new lesser geas until the missing\
  \ ring is repaired or replaced. If a mutual lesser geas is accepted and one lesser\
  \ geas is ended, both lesser geas effects end simultaneously.\nA target can have\
  \ a ring of bondage forcibly placed on its finger, but only if that creature is\
  \ helpless."
