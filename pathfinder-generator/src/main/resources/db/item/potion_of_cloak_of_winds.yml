name: "Potion of Cloak of Winds"
description: "You shroud a creature in a whirling screen of strong, howling wind.\
  \ The subject is never checked or blown away by strong winds of windstorm or lesser\
  \ strength (whether natural or magically created), and ranged attack rolls against\
  \ the subject take a â€“4 penalty. Tiny or smaller creatures must succeed at a Fortitude\
  \ save to successfully touch or attack the subject in melee. Failure knocks the\
  \ attacker prone and pushes it 5 feet away from the subject per level of the caster.\
  \ This movement can pass through the squares of other creatures without affecting\
  \ them and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, but the creature takes 3d6 points\
  \ of nonlethal damage, plus 1d6 if the creature strikes a solid object that blocks\
  \ its movement."
