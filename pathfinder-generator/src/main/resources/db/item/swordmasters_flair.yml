description: "These garish tokens usually take the form of a colorful clothing accessories.\
  \ So long as a token is grasped in the user's off hand, she can spend 1 panache\
  \ point to gain the use of a specific ability associated with the token. Once per\
  \ day, the bearer can use the token to gain the full benefit of the token without\
  \ spending panache. Non-swashbucklers can use the tokens, but unless they have another\
  \ way of gaining panache, they can use the ability only once per day. A character\
  \ can benefit from only one token at a time; holding a second token provides no\
  \ additional benefit. There are four types of tokens, each offering a different\
  \ benefit.\nBlue Scarf: The user can spend 1 panache point as a swift action to\
  \ increase her melee reach with light or one-handed piercing weapons by 5 feet for\
  \ 1 minute.\nGreen Glove: The user can spend 1 panache point as a swift action to\
  \ ignore the effects of difficult terrain until the end of her next turn.\nRed Sash:\
  \ The user can spend 1 panache point as an immediate action to attempt a combat\
  \ maneuver check to trip a creature that has charged and ended its charge in a space\
  \ within the user's melee reach. This combat maneuver does not provoke an attack\
  \ of opportunity, it's attempted before the attack at the end of the charge, and\
  \ the sash's user gains a +2 bonus on the check. If the check is successful, the\
  \ attacker can't make an attack at the end of its charge.\nWhite Lace Kerchief:\
  \ The user can spend 1 panache point as a swift action to pinpoint an unseen, adjacent\
  \ enemy and gains the benefits of the Blind Fight feat for 1 round."
