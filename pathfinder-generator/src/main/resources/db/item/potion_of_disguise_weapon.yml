name: "Potion of Disguise Weapon"
description: "You make one manufactured weapon look like a different manufactured\
  \ weapon of the same size and relative encumbrance (light, one-handed, or two-handed).\
  \ For example, you could make a Small greatsword look like a Small quarterstaff,\
  \ a Medium club, or a Large dagger. Even the appearance of an improvised weapon\
  \ is possible. The extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or\
  \ obscure a minor feature or make the item look like it is composed of different\
  \ materials (stone, wood, adamantine, and so on). The spell does not provide any\
  \ of the abilities of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile or\
  \ audible properties of the item or how it is wielded. A creature that interacts\
  \ with the glamer may attempt a Will save to recognize it as an illusion."
