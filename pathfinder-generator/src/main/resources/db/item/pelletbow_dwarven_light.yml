description: "The dwarven pelletbow is a crossbowlike weapon that is loaded with and\
  \ fires sling bullets rather than bolts. A dwarven heavy pelletbow takes the same\
  \ amount of time and effort to load as a light crossbow (normally a move action),\
  \ and a dwarven light pelletbow can be reloaded as a free action (allowing characters\
  \ to attack with it multiple times in a round). Normally a pelletbow takes two hands\
  \ to operate, but you can shoot (but not load) a pelletbow with one hand by taking\
  \ a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot one pelletbow with each hand, but\
  \ you take a penalty on attack rolls for attacking with two weapons (treating the\
  \ heavy pelletbow as a one-handed weapon and the light pelletbow as a light weapon).\n\
  Feats and special abilities that don't involve proficiency (that don't depend on\
  \ dealing piercing damage or firing bolts) that apply to a heavy crossbow also apply\
  \ to a dwarven heavy pelletbow, and those that apply to a light crossbow also apply\
  \ to a dwarven light pelletbow."
