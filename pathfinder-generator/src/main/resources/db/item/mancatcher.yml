description: "This polearm consists of two curved metal bands that close around a\
  \ target when you attack, allowing you to bind an opponent. A mancatcher is built\
  \ to capture a creature of a particular size category (such as Small or Medium)\
  \ and doesn't work on creatures of the wrong size. Make a touch attack to hit an\
  \ opponent and a combat maneuver check to grapple him (without the â€“4 penalty for\
  \ not having two hands free); success means you and the target are grappled. Once\
  \ the target is grappled, you can perform a move or damage grapple action against\
  \ him. The mancatcher has hardness 10 and 5 hit points; breaking it requires a DC\
  \ 26 Strength check. If you drop the mancatcher, the target can free himself as\
  \ a standard action."
