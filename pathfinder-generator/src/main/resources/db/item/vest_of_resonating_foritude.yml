description: "This magical cloth vest is made from rich green cloth that is typically\
  \ a blend of silk and cotton. It has a high collar that is stitched with gold thread\
  \ forming elaborate, overlapping geometric patterns. This vest reduces the potency\
  \ of poisons that affect the wearer. As a swift action when the wearer is exposed\
  \ to a poison, she can tap the vest, expending 1 charge, to gain a +2 bonus on her\
  \ next Fortitude saving throw against the poison. Additionally, if the wearer is\
  \ affected with a poison that requires two saves to cure, she can tap the vest a\
  \ second time, expending another charge, to use her next successful saving throw\
  \ result as the result for the second save as well. The vest contains 5 charges\
  \ that recharge daily."
