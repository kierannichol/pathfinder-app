description: "As a move action, the wielder may dip these two sharp, 4-inchlong pins\
  \ into their paired vial to coat them in the viscous blueblack liquid within. This\
  \ coating lasts 1 minute before dissipating. On a successful unarmed attack against\
  \ a creature while both coated pins are held between the wielder's knuckles, the\
  \ liquid flows under the skin of one of the target's limbs (wielder's choice; two\
  \ limbs on a critical hit). The target must then attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save.\
  \ On a failed save, an affected limb becomes withered and useless, anything held\
  \ in the limb drops to the ground, and the victim cannot move the limb for 5 minutes.\
  \ If an affected limb contributes to one of the creature's modes of movement (such\
  \ as a leg), the creature's movement is halved.\nA creature may be affected by multiple\
  \ instances of deadlimb pins. Generally, a creature with both legs affected by deadlimb\
  \ pins can only crawl to move, and a creature with both arms affected is unable\
  \ to attack (unless they can make attacks with other body parts, of course). The\
  \ exact consequences of applying multiple doses of deadlimb pins to creatures with\
  \ inhuman anatomies or unusual limbs are left to the GM's discretion.\nIn order\
  \ to function, deadlimb pins must be used with the vial of liquid they were constructed\
  \ with and vice-versa. One set of deadlimb pins and their adjoining vial can be\
  \ used 50 times before its magic is depleted."
