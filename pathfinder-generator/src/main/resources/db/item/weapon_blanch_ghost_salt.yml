description: "This gritty alchemical powder is made from exotic minerals mixed with\
  \ an infusion crafted from the ectoplasmic remains of destroyed incorporeal undead.\
  \ When rubbed onto a weapon that is then placed over a hot flame for a full round,\
  \ ghost salt melts and forms a temporary coating on the weapon. The blanching gives\
  \ the weapon the ability to do full damage to incorporeal creatures, even if the\
  \ weapon itself is nonmagical. An application of ghost salt remains effective until\
  \ the weapon makes a successful attack. Each dose of weapon blanch can coat one\
  \ weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. Only one kind of weapon blanch can be\
  \ on a weapon at one time (see the Advanced Player's Guide for other forms of weapon\
  \ blanch)."
