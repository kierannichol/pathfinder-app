description: "This metal glove lets you deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage\
  \ with unarmed strikes. A strike with a gauntlet is otherwise considered an unarmed\
  \ attack. The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. Medium and heavy\
  \ armors (except breastplates) come with gauntlets. Your opponent cannot use a disarm\
  \ action to disarm you of gauntlets."
