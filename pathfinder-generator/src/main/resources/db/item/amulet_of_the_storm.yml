description: "Carved from a single piece of reddish coral, this small amulet is shaped\
  \ into a swirling, counterclockwise spiral centered behind a leaf. The design and\
  \ creation of these amulets is credited to the original Storm Kindlers, and they\
  \ are rarely found outside of Garund.\nWhen worn, the amulet provides energy resistance\
  \ 5 against cold and electricity. If the wearer worships Gozreh, the energy resistances\
  \ both increase to 10. The wearer automatically identifies spells with the air,\
  \ electricity, or water descriptor that are cast in her presence, as if she had\
  \ succeeded at a Spellcraft check to do so.\nOnce per day as an immediate action,\
  \ the wearer of an amulet of the storm can attempt to counterspell any spell containing\
  \ the air, electricity, or water descriptor as if the wearer were casting dispel\
  \ magic. If this counterspell attempt is successful, it redirects the magical energy\
  \ back at the caster in the form of bolts of lightning, dealing 1d6 points of electricity\
  \ damage per level of the spell that was countered to the spell's original caster.\
  \ A successful DC 18 Reflex save halves this damage."
