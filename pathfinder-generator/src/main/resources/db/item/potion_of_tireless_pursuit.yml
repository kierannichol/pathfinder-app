description: "You harden your body against the stresses of long travel. You halve\
  \ the damage caused by hustling and forced marching (see Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook171).\
  \ In addition, for the duration of the spell you ignore any fatigue caused by such\
  \ travel. Once the spell ends, if you still have any nonlethal damage caused by\
  \ the hustling or forced march, you become fatigued, or exhausted if already fatigued."
