description: "This circular stone amulet is engraved with a fine, spiraling line that\
  \ winds inward toward the center, creating the impression of a powerful vortex.\
  \ The amulet surrounds the wearer with a reactive field that counters the negative\
  \ effects of natural or magically controlled winds. The wearer treats all such effects\
  \ as though she is under the infuence of freedom of movement."
