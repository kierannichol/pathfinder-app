description: "Used by the drow smiths of house Caldrana, these worked black leather\
  \ gloves are stitched with red symbols dedicated to Flauros, the demon lord of fire\
  \ and volcanoes. Whenever the wearer makes a melee touch attack, she deals 1d6 points\
  \ of fire damage. If the wearer wields a weapon or makes an attack with an unarmed\
  \ strike, that attack gains the flaming weapon special ability.\nWhen demonic smith's\
  \ gloves are used during the construction of armor or weapons, they grant their\
  \ wearer a +4 competence bonus on the relevant Craft checks. If the wearer rolls\
  \ a natural 1 while benefiting from this bonus, she draws the ire of Flauros, causing\
  \ the gloves to become nonmagical until the wearer crafts at least five masterwork\
  \ items and then destroys them in the name of the demon lord."
