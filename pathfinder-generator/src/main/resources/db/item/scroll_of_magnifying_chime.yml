name: "Scroll of Magnifying Chime"
description: "You cause the touched object to vibrate and release sonic energy once\
  \ per round as a loud, dangerous chime. The sound grows in strength as time passes.\
  \ On your turn in the round after you cast the spell, the chime deals 1d6 points\
  \ of sonic damage to all creatures and objects within 5 feet of the target. Each\
  \ round after that, the damage increases by 1d6 and reaches 5 feet farther in all\
  \ directions. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage for that round only."
