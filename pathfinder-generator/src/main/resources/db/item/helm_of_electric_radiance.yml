description: "The helm of electric radiance is similar to a helm of brilliance, except\
  \ its spells focus on electricity rather than fire. Other aspects of the helm, such\
  \ as detecting and damaging undead, remain unchanged. The helm has 10 sapphires\
  \ that can be used for chain lightning, 20 pieces of amber that can be used for\
  \ lightning bolt, 30 pieces of petrified wood that can be used for shocking sphere\
  \ (as flaming sphere but dealing electricity damage), and 40 opals that can be used\
  \ for daylight. In addition, the wearer gains resistance to electricity 30 and his\
  \ weapons become shocking weapons instead of flaming weapons."
