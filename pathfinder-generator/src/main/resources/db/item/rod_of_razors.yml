description: "This ornate, adamantine rod appears to be a cross between a halberd\
  \ and a strange scepter of alien design. Despite its rigid appearance, the rod is\
  \ surprisingly flexible and can extend in combatâ€”the weapon functions as a +3 keen\
  \ adamantine halberd that has reach but can still function normally against adjacent\
  \ foes. As a full-round action up to five times per day, the rod can be used to\
  \ fire razors. Treat these as +3 keen adamantine arrows fired from a longbow (any\
  \ feats possessed by the user that function with longbows work with these flechettes)."
