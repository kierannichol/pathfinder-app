description: "A warding box is a powerful magical container built to obscure and confound\
  \ any attempt to locate objects kept inside. The box can hold one object no larger\
  \ than 8 inches by 8 inches by 3 inches (or up to 25 pounds) in each of its three\
  \ compartments at any one time. The box's lid and additional compartments are sealed,\
  \ but the box can be opened or closed as a full-round action. While the lid is closed,\
  \ the warding box and all objects inside it are protected from all divination spells.\
  \ In this state, no divination spell save for those employed by the gods can detect\
  \ the warding box or its contents."
destruction: "A warding box can be destroyed by placing a portable hole inside it,\
  \ closing the lid, and then placing the box inside a second portable hole. This\
  \ second portable hole must be closed, and then a wish must be used to switch the\
  \ two portable holes. Doing so destroys both portable holes and the warding box\
  \ along with them."
