description: "This nearly perfect pearl replica of a hand is attached to a gold chain\
  \ and can be worn as an amulet. Once per day, the wearer can animate the hand as\
  \ an immediate action. The hand attempts to grapple an adjacent foe of Medium size\
  \ or smaller, using the wearer's CMB. If it succeeds, the hand deals 1d4 non-lethal\
  \ damage every round it maintains a grapple. If the grapple attempt fails or the\
  \ victim escapes the grapple, the hand ceases its activity. If any creature within\
  \ reach of the amulet (including the wearer) attempts to steal anything, the hand\
  \ activates and attempts to choke the creature. If the amulet is not currently worn,\
  \ it uses the victim's own CMB and Strength to determine the attack bonus and damage."
