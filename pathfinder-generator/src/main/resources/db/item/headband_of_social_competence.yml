description: "This simple yet elegant silver headband mentally warns the wearer before\
  \ she commits a social misstep, which includes any action that would increase the\
  \ DCs of Diplomacy checks to alter the attitudes of those around her or worsen the\
  \ attitude of a person that the wearer considers very important. This effect functions\
  \ similarly to that of a phylactery of faithfulness, except no contemplation is\
  \ required; the headband simply alerts the wearer of the consequences before she\
  \ can perform the action."
