description: "Studded with shards of inert soul gems, this bridle imbues its wearer\
  \ with a fraction of the power of the Pale Horse, the Horseman of Death's steed.\
  \ Once per day as an immediate action, the rider of a creature wearing this item\
  \ can activate it as part of the mount's movement. It becomes incorporeal during\
  \ its movement, though it must stop in an unoccupied space. Any object the creature\
  \ passes through during its incorporeal movement begins to crumble, having its hit\
  \ points reduced by half (ignoring hardness). Any living creatures' spaces the mount\
  \ passes through during its incorporeal movement feel the cold wind of death and\
  \ must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or take a -4 penalty to its Strength, Dexterity,\
  \ and Constitution scores that lasts for 1 minute."
