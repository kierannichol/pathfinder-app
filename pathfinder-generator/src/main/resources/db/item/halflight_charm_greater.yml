description: "While regular halflight charms are temporarily issued to anyone traversing\
  \ the Halflight Path under Duskwarden guidance, greater halflight charms are given\
  \ to those who have saved a Duskwarden's life or performed a great service for the\
  \ organization. They thus carry great social cachet with the Duskwardens, who consider\
  \ selling or purchasing one to be a grave insult.\nA greater halflight charm is\
  \ a dark blue crystal amulet embossed with a golden arch and suspended from a black\
  \ cord. When worn, it grants the wearer darkvision 60 feet. It also grants a +2\
  \ bonus on all initiative checks made while in underground areas. In addition, once\
  \ per year, the wearer can call on the amulet to summon the specific Duskwarden\
  \ on whom the charm was imprinted at its creation, who is instantly teleported to\
  \ an adjacent square along with his standard adventuring gear, provided the wearer\
  \ is on the same plane. The Duskwarden is not bound to the caster's will in any\
  \ way."
