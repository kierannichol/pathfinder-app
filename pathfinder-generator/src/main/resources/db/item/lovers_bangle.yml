description: "This thick copper bracelet bears rows of lightly engraved hearts. Once\
  \ per week, when the bracelet is worn and touched to another worn lover's bangle,\
  \ the two become attuned and remain attuned until one of the bangles is removed\
  \ or attuned to a different lover's bangle, or until a bangle's wearer is reduced\
  \ below 0 hit points, is slain, or travels to a different plane. The wearer of the\
  \ attuned lover's bangle immediately knows that the attunement has ended, but doesn't\
  \ receive any indication about the event that broke the attunement."
