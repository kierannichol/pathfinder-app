description: "A handful of pellets, along with 1 dose of black powder, is commonly\
  \ used as ammunition for one-handed and twohanded firearms with the scatter weapon\
  \ quality, though rocks or other small bits of hard material can be used in the\
  \ pellets' place. Using anything other than pellets or alchemical cartridges when\
  \ firing off a cone attack with a scatter weapon increases the weapon's misfire\
  \ range by 1 (though this increase can be removed by switching back to standard\
  \ ammunition). Thirty handfuls of pellets weigh half a pound."
