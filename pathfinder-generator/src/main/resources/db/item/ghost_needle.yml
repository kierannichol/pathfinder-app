description: "This bone needle must be inserted into living flesh (a standard action)\
  \ to function, dealing the creature 1d4 points of damage and causing it to appear\
  \ ghostly and translucent for up to 30 minutes, as if using ghostly disguise. If\
  \ the creature negates all the damage (such as with damage reduction), this also\
  \ negates the ghostly disguise effect, as the needle fails to penetrate his flesh.\n\
  In addition, as a swift action, a creature with an embedded ghost needle can choose\
  \ to become partially incorporeal until the beginning of its next turn. During this\
  \ time, the creature can enter or pass through solid objects as though it had the\
  \ incorporeal special ability, natural weapons or unarmed strikes it uses are treated\
  \ as if they had the ghost touch weapon special ability, and any spell the creature\
  \ casts is treated as if it had applied the Ectoplasmic Spell metamagic feat to\
  \ it. The creature takes 1d4 points of damage each round it spends in this quasi-incorporeal\
  \ state, and each round spent in this state expends 10 minutes of the ghost needle's\
  \ duration. If there are fewer than 10 minutes of duration remaining, it can't choose\
  \ to remain incorporeal. A ghost needle crumbles to dust after use."
