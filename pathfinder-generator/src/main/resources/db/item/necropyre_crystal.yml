description: "This shining violet crystal is as large as a grapefruit. In its depths\
  \ swirl spectral shapes and glimpses of a strange landscape. When activated it grows\
  \ as bright as a daylight spell, but this light is not harmful to any creature,\
  \ even undead or those sensitive to light. Corrupted by proximity to a thousand\
  \ murders and tempered in the fires of a dragon's belly, the necropyre crystal is\
  \ no longer the benign item it was before the destruction of talamir. The earth\
  \ itself has rejected the corrupted crystal, and the crystal's powers do not function\
  \ while you or it are in contact with the ground.\nAny creature you kill while bearing\
  \ the crystal has its soul absorbed into the crystal (preventing anyone from raising\
  \ them from the dead), granting you powers while you carry it. After 10 kills, you\
  \ gain fast healing 10. After 30, you gain spell resistance 30. After 60, you gain\
  \ damage reduction 15/—. After 100, you gain a +5 profane bonus to all saving throws\
  \ and a unique negative energy power related to your other abilities (a fighter's\
  \ melee attacks may gain the unholy property, a dragon's breath weapon may become\
  \ infused with negative energy, and so on). These kills are attuned to you; another\
  \ person carrying the crystal gains no benefit unless they have slain the appropriate\
  \ number of people while bearing it. It is possible for different people to have\
  \ different levels of power from the crystal depending on how many they have killed\
  \ while holding it.\nThe crystal tends to spontaneously create necropyre creatures\
  \ from the tortured souls within it and sometimes reabsorbs these creatures into\
  \ itself if they are nearby. The necropyres never harm you, nor are they under your\
  \ command.\nThe crystal bestows one negative level on any non-evil creature touching\
  \ or carrying it. The negative level remains as long as the crystal is touched,\
  \ held, or carried, and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative\
  \ level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way\
  \ (including restoration spells) while you possess the crystal. The crystal is semi-sentient\
  \ and hungry for souls. Over time it corrupts you, turning you chaotic evil and\
  \ eventually forcing you to murder others to sate the crystal's craving for life\
  \ energy (friends, family, and innocents are the crystal's favorite targets).\n\
  Destroying the crystal requires physical or magical force (hardness 8, hp 100).\
  \ when the crystal is destroyed, all the spirits trapped within it (as well as any\
  \ necropyre creatures created by it) are freed and escape to their reward in the\
  \ afterlife (after the crystal's destruction, these victims can be raised from the\
  \ dead normally)."
