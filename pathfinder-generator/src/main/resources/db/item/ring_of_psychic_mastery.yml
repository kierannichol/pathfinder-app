description: "The large sapphire that adorns this platinum ring darkens in hue as\
  \ its wearer depletes her psychic spellcasting potential. The gem turns black when\
  \ the wearer's daily spells are exhausted or if the wearer has no ability to cast\
  \ psychic spells. A ring of psychic mastery grants the caster 1 additional psychic\
  \ spell per day for each spell level from 1st to 4th that she is capable of casting."
