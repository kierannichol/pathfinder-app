description: "This roughly hewn wooden haft is lashed with gut and rope to a hefty\
  \ boulder. This +1 heavy flail ignores the hardness of any object with hardness\
  \ less than 20. As a swift action, however, the wielder can suppress this property\
  \ until the beginning of his next turn, allowing the head to phase through earth\
  \ and stone. This allows the wielder to ignore cover or partial cover (but not total\
  \ cover) provided by objects or structures made of earth or stone; however, while\
  \ suppressed, an earthenflail cannot harm objects made of these materials. Cover\
  \ provided by other sources is unaffected."
