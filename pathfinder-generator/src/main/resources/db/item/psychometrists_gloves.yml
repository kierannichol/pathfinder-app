  \ attuned to increase the tactile sensitivity of the wearer's hands. To provide\

  \ skill checks requiring the use of the hands take a â€“2 penalty as long as the gloves\
  \ remain on. After this 8-hour period, the user can remove the gloves to gain a\
  \ +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks for the psychometry occult skill unlock.\
  \ This benefit fades after 1 hour."
