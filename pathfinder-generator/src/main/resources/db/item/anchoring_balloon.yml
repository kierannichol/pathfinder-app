description: "An anchoring balloon is a single-use alchemical device designed to provide\
  \ a standing platform on a gaseous planet. When a cord is pulled as a standard action,\
  \ an alchemical reaction fills the balloon with hydrogen gas almost instantly. Twenty-foot-long\
  \ ropes attach the balloon to a lightweight, collapsible 10-foot-square steel basket\
  \ with 5-foot-high sides. The inflated balloon is a Gargantuan object. Although\
  \ it moves with the wind horizontally, the basket maintains its initial altitude\
  \ to within a few feet so long as its load is less than 2,000 pounds (divided by\
  \ the planet's gravity multiplier). Beyond that weight limit, the balloon may sink\
  \ or the basket may break (at the GM's discretion). The balloon remains inflated\
  \ for 24 hours before its seals fail."
