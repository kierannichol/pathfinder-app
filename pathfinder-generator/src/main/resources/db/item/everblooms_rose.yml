description: "Often created by evangelistic clerics of Milani, an Everbloom's rose\
  \ is a +1 morningstar. Once per day, the wielder of an Everbloom's rose can cast\
  \ remove fear on a creature touched by the weapon. If the subject succeeds at a\
  \ saving throw against a fear effect while under effects of this spell, the subject\
  \ gains a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against the source of the fear\
  \ effect for 1 round. If the subject is immune to fear effects, she gains no bonuses\
  \ from this effect."
