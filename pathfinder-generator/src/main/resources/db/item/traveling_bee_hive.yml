description: "These straw baskets provide a portable home for bees. They are dome\
  \ shaped, with a hole in the top that a smaller woven basket covers as a cap. This\
  \ hole allows for the harvesting of small amounts of honey without destroying the\
  \ entire hive. Believing that certain bees provide for a superior crop yield, some\
  \ farmers pay beekeepers to travel to their farms with the bees.\nDestroying a traveling\
  \ bee hive causes the bees to swarm, creating a 5-foot-radius cloud. A creature\
  \ is blinded and for as long as it remains in the cloud, and must succeed at a DC\
  \ 12 Fortitude saving throw or become sickened for 1 minute. The sickened condition\
  \ is a poison effect."
