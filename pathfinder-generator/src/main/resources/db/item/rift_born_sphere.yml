description: "This sphere acts as a normal sphere of annihilation in all respects,\
  \ save that any use of a gate spell to destroy it results in an automatic planar\
  \ rift to a plane of the GM's choosing. The sphere remains behind at its original\
  \ location, intact and unaffected."
destruction: "A rift-born sphere can only be destroyed by using a rod of cancellation\
  \ or fusion with another, normal sphere (which destroys both spheres in a 180-foot\
  \ blast dealing 5d6 x 10 points of damage)."
