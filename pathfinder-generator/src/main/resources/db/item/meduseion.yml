description: "Dried, lacquered, and stuffed with fragrant herbs, this mummified medusa\
  \ head still contains a measure of the power the medusa possessed in life. While\
  \ held, a meduseion radiates an unseen aura that causes all living creatures within\
  \ 100 feet to take a â€“2 penalty on saving throws to resist poison or petrification\
  \ effects. Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder of a meduseion\
  \ can cause the eyes of the head to shoot forth a petrifying ray as a ranged touch\
  \ attack with a maximum range of 100 feet. Creatures struck must succeed a DC 19\
  \ Fortitude save or be permanently transformed into stone."
