description: "This silver nail is finely engraved with hundreds of tiny runes that\
  \ flash faintly blue under the light of the moon. The nail can be used to trap evil\
  \ outsiders and incorporeal undead creatures to prevent their escape. To use a silver\
  \ nail, the bearer must take a full-round action and succeed at a touch attack against\
  \ a creature.\nWhen used against a helpless or pinned evil outsider, the bearer\
  \ can prevent that creature from escaping as per dimensional anchor.\nThe bearer\
  \ can instead trap an incorporeal undead creature. If he succeeds at a touch attack,\
  \ the nail prevents the incorporeal undead creature from moving into walls or other\
  \ solid objects.\nThe effects of the silver nail last 1 minute, during which the\
  \ nail remains inside the creature. When this duration ends, the nail falls out\
  \ and is forever rendered powerless. If used against a creature that is neither\
  \ an outsider nor an incorporeal undead creature, the silver nail has no effect,\
  \ but is still expended."
