description: "This alchemical gel comes in a large vial with a brush built into the\
  \ stopper. It's used to coat the surface of objects, protecting them from a specific\
  \ type of energy damage. Though elemental proofing is not harmful to the objects\
  \ it coats, it acts as a contact poison to living creatures. Touching elemental\
  \ proofing directly causes 1d4 points of damage and 1d4 rounds of sickness (a DC\
  \ 14 Fortitude save negates the latter effect). Creatures immune to poison are likewise\
  \ immune to the effects of contacting elemental proofing but gain no benefits from\
  \ its application. When applied to weapons or armor, elemental proofing confers\
  \ resistances to the coated object, but none to the wearer.\nEach vial of elemental\
  \ proofing contains enough gel to coat one Large object, or two Medium or smaller\
  \ objects. Once the applied gel dries, it absorbs 10 points of the specified type\
  \ of elemental damage each round. Elemental proofing wears off after 24 hours, and\
  \ multiple applications of the gel do not stack. There are four different types\
  \ of elemental proofing: acid proofing provides acid resistance 10, flame proofing\
  \ provides fire resistance 10, frost proofing provides cold resistance 10, and lightning\
  \ proofing provides electricity resistance 10."
