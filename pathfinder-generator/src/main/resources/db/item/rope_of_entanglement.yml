description: "A rope of entanglement looks just like any other hempen rope about 30\
  \ feet long. Upon command, the rope lashes forward 20 feet or upward 10 feet to\
  \ entangle a victim. An entangled creature can break free with a DC 20 Strength\
  \ check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check.\nA rope of entanglement has AC 22, 12 hit\
  \ points, hardness 10, and damage reduction 5/slashing. The rope repairs damage\
  \ to itself at a rate of 1 point per 5 minutes, but if a rope of entanglement is\
  \ severed (all 12 hit points lost to damage), it is destroyed."
