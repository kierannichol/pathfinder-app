description: "Originating in ancient Minkai, the typical jade burial suit consists\
  \ of several hundred jade plaques joined with gold wire, carefully inscribed with\
  \ prayers to Tsukiyo, the Tian-Min god of the moon, spirits, and preservation. Jade\
  \ is believed to have preservative properties, and many ancient Tian royals were\
  \ buried in jade suits.\nBy disassembling and inverting the plaques and replacing\
  \ Tsukiyo's name with that of his brother Fumeiyoshi, god of graves, one clever\
  \ ru-shi learned how to give the impression of death instead of life. A character\
  \ wearing a suit of inverted jade gains a +3 profane bonus on saving throws against\
  \ disease, mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep, and stunning. The wearer has the\
  \ aura of an undead for the purposes of divination spells and effects, and unintelligent\
  \ undead perceive the wearer as a fellow undead. The wearer, however, becomes vulnerable\
  \ to effects that target or deal additional damage to undead (such as searing light).\
  \ A suit of inverted jade otherwise functions as +3 stone lamellar."
