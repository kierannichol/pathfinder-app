description: "This bookmark alters the book that holds it so that it appears to be\
  \ another book entirely, even upon a thorough reading. The apparent book is determined\
  \ when the bookmark is crafted, and is usually an especially boring or commonplace\
  \ book such as a legal or religious text. The bookmark also protects itself and\
  \ the book with nondetection."
