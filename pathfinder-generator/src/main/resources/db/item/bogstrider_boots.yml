description: "These soft leather boots smell strongly of marsh gas, and leave faint\
  \ wet prints behind even when they're dry. Despite these aesthetic flaws, bogstrider\
  \ boots are of great use in areas of swampy terrain. They provide the wearer the\
  \ ability to move without penalty in squares of shallow or deep bog (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Core Rulebook 427), and the DCs of Acrobatics checks attempted by the boots'\
  \ wearer are unchanged in squares of shallow bog. In addition, three times per day\
  \ when the wearer takes a charge or withdraw action, she can increase her speed\
  \ by 60 feet for 1 round."
