description: "Individually, the component pieces of the Champion of the Gilded Host\
  \ have the same strong magic aura as the intact construct, but possess no noteworthy\
  \ abilities of their own. Any piece with a joint may flex occasionally, but without\
  \ any purpose or significant force. When the pieces are brought within 100 feet\
  \ of one another, they reassemble themselves to create a golden colossus. Long-forgotten\
  \ command words keyed to each piece are able to shrink it to a fraction of its full\
  \ size."
