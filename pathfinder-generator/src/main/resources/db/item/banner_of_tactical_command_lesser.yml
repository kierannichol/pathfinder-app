description: "This brightly colored banner measures 2 feet by 4 feet in size, and\
  \ is mounted on an 8-foot-long pole of spiraled gold and ivory. When the commander\
  \ of an army engaged in mass combat displays this banner, the army under her command\
  \ is treated as knowing one additional tactic. The granted tactic must be selected\
  \ at the time of the banner's creation and cannot be changed. The army must be able\
  \ to see the banner in a given phase of mass combat to receive the bonus; a banner\
  \ is considered obscured in conditions of darkness, fog, and sandstorms. If the\
  \ commander is killed or captured, the banner ceases to function, even if it remains\
  \ visible in the commander's absence. A commander may have a number of banners in\
  \ effect equal to her Charisma modifier; if more banners are displayed than her\
  \ Charisma modifier allows, roll randomly each round to determine which banners'\
  \ abilities are suppressed.\nBanner of Tactical Command, Lesser: This functions\
  \ as a banner of tactical command but can only affect armies of size Large or smaller."
