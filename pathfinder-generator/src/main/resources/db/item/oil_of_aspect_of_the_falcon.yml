description: "You take on an aspect of a falcon. Your eyes become wide and raptor-like,\
  \ and you grow feathers on the sides of your head. You gain a +3 competence bonus\
  \ on Perception checks, a +1 competence bonus on ranged attacks, and the critical\
  \ multiplier for your bows and crossbows becomes 19–20/×3. This effect does not\
  \ stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon, such as\
  \ the Improved Critical feat or a keenweapon."
