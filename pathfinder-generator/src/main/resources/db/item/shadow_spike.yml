description: "This +2/+2 cruel quarterstaff is made of polished ebony, and features\
  \ a blackened metal spike on its bottom end. As a standard action, the wielder can\
  \ drive the spike into the ground on either the Material Plane or the Shadow Plane,\
  \ creating a rift merging those two planes. This rift is 30 feet in diameter, lasts\
  \ for 1 minute, and can be created once per day. If the creature that drives the\
  \ shadow spike into the ground expends one use of mythic power when doing so, the\
  \ effect lasts until the shadow spike is pulled out of the ground (which takes a\
  \ standard action).\nThe rift's area acts as the deeper darkness spell. Spells with\
  \ the darkness or shadow descriptors cast within the rift have +1 caster level,\
  \ and are affected as if cast with the Extend Spell feat. As a standard action,\
  \ any mythic creature within the area can expend three uses of mythic power to plane\
  \ shift to the Shadow Plane (if on the Material Plane) or to the Material Plane\
  \ (if on the Shadow Plane). If a mythic creature plane shifts while holding the\
  \ shadow spike, the weapon teleports with that creature, ending the effect."
