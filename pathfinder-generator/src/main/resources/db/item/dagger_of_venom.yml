description: "This black +1 dagger has a serrated edge. It allows the wielder to use\
  \ a poison effect (as the spell, save DC 14) upon a creature struck by the blade\
  \ once per day. The wielder can decide to use the power after he has struck. Doing\
  \ so is a free action, but the poison effect must be invoked in the same round that\
  \ the dagger strikes."
