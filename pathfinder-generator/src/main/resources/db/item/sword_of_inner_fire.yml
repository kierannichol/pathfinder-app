description: "This +1 flaming burst brilliant energy longsword has a burnished copper\
  \ hilt and burns with blue and white flame. In the hands of a mythic wielder, the\
  \ sword's fire damage bypasses fire resistance and fire immunity. As a swift action,\
  \ the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to enable the sword of inner fire\
  \ to damage nonliving creatures (such as constructs and undead) for 1 round, though\
  \ the sword still can't damage inanimate objects.\nA wielder of at least 3rd tier\
  \ can absorb the sword of inner fire into her body as a swift action, and call it\
  \ back to hand with another swift action. While the sword is stored in this way,\
  \ her eyes burn with orange flame and she gains a +5 deflection bonus to AC and\
  \ a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws."
