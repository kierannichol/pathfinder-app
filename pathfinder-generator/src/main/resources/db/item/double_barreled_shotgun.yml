description: "This twin-barreled shotgun can be shot one barrel at a time, or both\
  \ together as one attack. A double shot that fires bullets is inaccurate, and takes\
  \ a â€“4 penalty on both attacks. A double shot that fires bullets targets only a\
  \ single creature and increases the damage of each barrel to 2d6 points (Small)\
  \ or 2d8 points (Medium) for a total of 4d6 or 4d8 points of damage. A doublebarreled\
  \ shotgun uses metal cartridges (loaded with either a bullet or pellets) as ammunition.\
  \ This is an advanced firearm."
