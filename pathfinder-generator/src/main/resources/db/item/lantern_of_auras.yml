description: "A lantern of auras is a bullseye lantern made of cold iron with a series\
  \ of lenses and colored glass filters that can be flipped down in front of its main\
  \ aperture. The lantern functions as a bullseye lantern but needs no oil to shed\
  \ its light. If its command word is spoken, it begins to reveal magic auras as the\
  \ detect magic spell. It will reveal all auras detect magic reveals over the normal\
  \ duration of 3 rounds, as long as its light is held on the same area for this duration.\
  \ Anyone who takes a full-round action to observe the revealed auras during each\
  \ of these rounds can attempt a Knowledge (arcana) skill check to determine the\
  \ school of any magic aura revealed, or a Spellcraft check to identify the properties\
  \ of a magic item within the area.\nRoughly 45% of these lanterns have the command\
  \ word etched on the bottom of the lantern. Casting identify on a lantern of auras\
  \ reveals the command word."
