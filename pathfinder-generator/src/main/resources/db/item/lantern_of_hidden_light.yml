description: "A lantern of hidden light can be an invaluable tool for one who wishes\
  \ to see in darkened areas without being revealed to those accustomed to the darkness.\
  \ This magical lantern can be activated with a touch to one of its crystal panes,\
  \ and functions as a hooded lantern, save that this light (and what it illuminates)\
  \ is visible only to the character who holds the lantern in one hand. To other observers,\
  \ the lantern always appears unlit, and does not appear to be shedding any light\
  \ at all."
