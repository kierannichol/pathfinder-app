name: "Potion of Howling Agony"
description: "You send wracking pains through the targets' bodies. Because of the\
  \ pain, affected creatures take a –2 penalty to AC, attacks, melee damage rolls,\
  \ and Reflex saving throws, and must succeed at a concentration check (DC equal\
  \ to the DC of this spell) to cast spells. However, if an affected creature spends\
  \ a move action screaming as loudly as possible, it can act without any other penalties\
  \ for the remainder of its turn. “Screaming,\" for the purposes of this spell, includes\
  \ any vocalization of pain or its telepathic equivalent; creatures that cannot scream\
  \ (such as creatures without the natural ability to communicate or vocalize) suffer\
  \ the full effect of the spell."
