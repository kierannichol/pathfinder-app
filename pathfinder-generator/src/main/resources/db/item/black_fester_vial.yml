description: "This black paste is often applied on orc weapons before going on raids\
  \ to stymie an enemy's healing magic. Like a poison, black fester stays on a weapon\
  \ until the first time it strikes an opponent. It remains in the target's body for\
  \ 1 hour. A creature exposed to black fester resists magical healing; a creature\
  \ trying to magically heal the target must make a DC 10 caster level check to restore\
  \ any hit points to the target."
