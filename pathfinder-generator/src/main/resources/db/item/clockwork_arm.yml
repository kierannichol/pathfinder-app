description: "The claw can be attached in place of the missing arm of any Medium humanoid\
  \ to function as a replacement arm. This requires an hour-long installation surgery\
  \ that must be performed by a character with 8 ranks in both Craft (clockwork) and\
  \ Heal. The recipient must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save for the arm to properly\
  \ attach, and takes 2 points of Constitution damage from the surgery in any case.\
  \ If the arm is properly attached, the recipient can lift up to 1-1/2 his maximum\
  \ load over his head, and gains a claw attack as a secondary attack that deals 1d6\
  \ points of damage (if nothing is held in that arm)."
