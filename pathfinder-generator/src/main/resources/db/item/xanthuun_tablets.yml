description: "These striated greenstone tablets are marked with ancient writing in\
  \ the Cyclops language and astronomical symbols dating from the cyclopes' ancient\
  \ empire. One of the tablets emphasizes the course of the sun, another the course\
  \ of the moon, and the third the dark spaces between the stars. A corroded iron\
  \ ring running though a hole bored through each of the three tablets keeps them\
  \ connected together.\nAnyone who speaks Cyclops can read these carvings, allowing\
  \ the tablets to act as a library of lore about astrology. A character who spends\
  \ 1d4 hours examining these inscriptions can attempt a Knowledge check on a topic\
  \ related to astrology, divination, or the Dark Tapestry. If trained, the character\
  \ gains a +2 circumstance bonus on the check; If not, the character can still attempt\
  \ a check with a DC greater than 10.\nA reader who spends 24 hours (which need not\
  \ be consecutive) studying one of the tablets can attempt DC 20 Linguistics and\
  \ Knowledge (arcana) checks to discover deep truths implied by the abstruse markings,\
  \ and becomes attuned to that tablet. Each tablet can have only one creature attuned\
  \ to it at a time, but a single creature can be attuned to multiple tablets simultaneously.\
  \ Being attuned to a tablet grants the reader mystic abilities, even if it's not\
  \ in the creature's possession.\nA creature attuned to the sun tablet gains glimpses\
  \ of the skeins of fate. Once per day before rolling a d20, it can roll three times\
  \ and take the highest result.\nA creature attuned to the moon tablet is unnaturally\
  \ calm, and can choose to automatically succeed at a concentration check. If the\
  \ attuned creature is a lycanthrope, it can't be forced to involuntarily assume\
  \ its animal or hybrid form. A creature attuned to the darkness tablet can view\
  \ others through the blackness of space. Once per night, it can look at the night\
  \ sky to view another creature as the scrying spell (Will DC 21 negates). The magical\
  \ sensor from this effect bores though the alien Dark Tapestry, so any creature\
  \ that notices the sensor must immediately succeed at a DC 18 Will save or be confused\
  \ (as the confusion spell) for 1 round."
