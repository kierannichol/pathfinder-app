description: "The link between you and your animal companion becomes stronger. As\
  \ long as you are within line of sight of your animal companion, you can telepathically\
  \ communicate with it as if you two shared a language. Also, as long as you are\
  \ within line of sight of the animal companion, you can push your animal companion\
  \ a swift action instead of a move action, and you do not need to succeed at Handle\
  \ Animal checks to handle your animal companion. Such checks automatically succeed."
