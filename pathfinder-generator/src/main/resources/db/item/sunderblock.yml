description: "This lumpy, lardlike, alchemical substance is designed to protect armor\
  \ and weapons from dents and cracks that commonly develop in close-combat equipment.\
  \ When liberally applied to armor or weapons, the material provides a greasy surface\
  \ that blunts impacts, causes blades to slide aside, and strengthens the gear it\
  \ is applied to. A single container holds enough sunderblock to coat a single weapon\
  \ or suit of armor as a full-round action. The effects aren't pronounced enough\
  \ to increase the Armor Class bonus of a suit of armor, but the hardness of armors\
  \ and weapons coated with sunderblock increases by 5. This bonus lasts for 12 hours,\
  \ at which point the greasy substance dries and flakes away."
