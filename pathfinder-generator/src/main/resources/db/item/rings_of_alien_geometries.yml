description: "A short silver chain joins these two crystal rings together. When worn\
  \ on two adjacent fingers of the same hand, the two rings occupy a single ring slot.\
  \ Once per day as a standard action, the wearer of a pair of rings of alien geometries\
  \ can create two shimmering portals, each 5 feet in diameter and surrounded by a\
  \ 4-inch-thick ring of force. Only one side of each portal functions as a gateway;\
  \ the other side is blocked (as if by a wall of force). Each portal must be oriented\
  \ vertically and be within 30 feet of the wearer at the time of creation. Medium\
  \ or smaller creatures can move through either portal as easily as moving to an\
  \ adjacent square, stepping out of the other portal. Large creatures can squeeze\
  \ through but can't end movement halfway through a portal. Any creature farther\
  \ than 5 feet away from a portal has no line of sight or line of effect through\
  \ it to the other portal, but a creature adjacent to one of the portals can attack\
  \ through it as though the square directly in front of the other portal were adjacent\
  \ to the creature.\nBoth of the portals vanish after 10 rounds. Destroying a portal\
  \ is possible only with spells or attacks that can destroy a wall of force. Destroying\
  \ one portal causes the other portal to immediately collapse."
