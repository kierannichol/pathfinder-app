description: "These bullets are actually made from a porous stone or heavy wood that\
  \ absorbs liquids and shatters on impact. Spongestones are often used to deliver\
  \ poison or burning oil. A flask of oil completely saturates 10 spongestones. When\
  \ ignited (a free action if fire is available), a burning, oil-soaked spongestone\
  \ deals +1d2 fire damage and can ignite combustible materials (such as a thatched\
  \ roof). Allowing a spongestone to burn in a sling's cup for more than 1d3 rounds\
  \ gives the sling the broken condition."
