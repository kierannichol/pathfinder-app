description: "With a monocle of flawlessness placed over her eye, an artist or artisan\
  \ is able to achieve consistent excellence, as its faceted lenses magnify and reveal\
  \ imperfections that she can correct. The wearer of a monocle of flawlessness gains\
  \ a +5 competence bonus on checks with any Craft skill in which she is trained.\
  \ The wearer can also create masterwork components in half the normal amount of\
  \ time (when crafting an item, only the time to craft the masterwork component of\
  \ the item is halved). The monocle's wearer also gains a +5 competence bonus on\
  \ Linguistics checks to spot forgeries and Perception checks to see through disguises.\
  \ The monocle further grants its wearer a +2 competence bonus on saving throws to\
  \ disbelieve illusions, due to her sublime attention to detail."
