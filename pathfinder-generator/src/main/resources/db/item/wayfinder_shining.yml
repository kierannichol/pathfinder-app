description: "A shining wayfinder appears as a polished silver compass. In addition\
  \ to the usual functions of a wayfinder (including the ability to create light)\
  \ a shining wayfinder can be used to cast detect evil â€“ when so used, its needle\
  \ points not to the north but rather to the nearest source of evil within 60 feet.\
  \ Once per day, a shining wayfinder can be used to cast protection from evil upon\
  \ the wayfinder's bearer. A shining wayfinder functions only for a creature that\
  \ is good-aligned. When held by an evil creature, the shining wayfinder's needle\
  \ spins in a frantic circle. When held by any creature that is both nonevil and\
  \ nongood, the needle does not point to anything in particular (not even to the\
  \ north)."
