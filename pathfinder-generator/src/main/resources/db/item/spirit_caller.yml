description: "The spirit caller is a +1 ghost touch mere club carved of nephrite jade.\
  \ Incorporeal undead and ghosts struck by the spirit caller must succeed at a DC\
  \ 16 Will save or be drawn inside the mere and are trapped within it. When holding\
  \ a spirit inside, the spirit caller glows from within with the brightness of a\
  \ candle and functions as a +2 ghost touch undead bane mere club. The mere consumes\
  \ the energy of the spirit inside in 1 hour, destroying it, and can hold but a single\
  \ spirit at a time. The wielder can release a trapped spirit as a standard action.\
  \ Ghosts consumed by a spirit caller still rejuvenate as normal."
