description: "This crystal appears to be a long, rough prism. Upon utterance of a\
  \ command word, though, the gem's facets suddenly grow highly polished as the crystal\
  \ emits bright light of one of three sorts.\nOne command word causes the gem to\
  \ shed light as a hooded lantern. This use of the gem does not expend any charges,\
  \ and it continues to emit light until this command word is spoken a second time\
  \ to extinguish the illumination.\nAnother command word causes the gem of brightness\
  \ to send out a bright ray 1 foot in diameter and 50 feet long. This strikes as\
  \ a ranged touch attack, and any creature struck by this beam is blinded for 1d4\
  \ rounds unless it makes a DC 14 Fortitude save. This use of the gem expends 1 charge.\n\
  The third command word causes the gem to flare in a blinding flash of light that\
  \ fills a 30-foot cone. Although this glare lasts but a moment, any creature within\
  \ the cone must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. This use\
  \ expends 5 charges.\nA newly created gem of brightness has 50 charges. When all\
  \ its charges are expended, the gem becomes nonmagical and its facets grow cloudy\
  \ with a fine network of cracks."
