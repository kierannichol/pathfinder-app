description: "An alchemist with an alchemy crafting kit is assumed to have all the\
  \ material components needed for his extracts, mutagens, and bombs, except for those\
  \ components that have a specific cost. An alchemy crafting kit provides no bonuses\
  \ on Craft (alchemy) checks. (This item was called an \"alchemist's kit\" in the\
  \ Advanced Player's Guide, and was renamed to avoid confusion with this book's pre-selected\
  \ set of adventuring gear called an \"alchemist's kit.\")"
