description: "This mummified house cat—dried, filled with sand, and bound in linen\
  \ wrappings— appears to be nothing more than a family pet buried alongside its deceased\
  \ master. Far more than a mere pet, however, a mummified guardian protects and preserves\
  \ the corpse it is interred with and acts as a guardian against grave robbers and\
  \ looters, potentially driving such trespassers toward more dangerous defenders\
  \ or traps. When placed inside a sarcophagus or coffin alongside a dead body and\
  \ activated, a mummified guardian also infuses the corpse with positive energy,\
  \ preventing the body from being turned into an undead creature, as sanctify corpse.\n\
  In addition, the mummified guardian also creates a magical ward around the sarcophagus\
  \ containing it. If the sarcophagus is opened after the mummified guardian is placed\
  \ inside, any creature with 5 Hit Dice or fewer within 20 feet of the open sarcophagus\
  \ is overcome by a feeling of dread and must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be\
  \ frightened for 3 rounds. On a successful save, a creature is instead shaken for\
  \ 1 round. This ability functions only once. Once triggered, the mummified guardian\
  \ retains only its sanctify corpse ability (this reduces the price of the mummified\
  \ guardian to 3,000 gp).\nIf the sarcophagus containing the mummified guardian is\
  \ placed in an area or room with multiple paths of egress, the owner may designate\
  \ one general direction an affected target must take if it flees, as long as the\
  \ chosen direction does not require the target to move any closer to the mummified\
  \ guardian. After moving in the designated direction for 1 round, the target behaves\
  \ as normal for the frightened condition for the remainder of the effect's duration.\n\
  A mummified guardian must be placed inside a sarcophagus, coffin, or other enclosed\
  \ container with a dead body to function. Although cats are most common, mummified\
  \ guardians can be created from the mummified remains of other small animals as\
  \ well."
