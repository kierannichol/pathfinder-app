description: "Merlokrep's crown is as old as his tribe, and the burnished bronze heirloom\
  \ has passed from king to king for centuries. The blood rite mumbled by Jekkajak\
  \ might or might not exist, but even without this ceremony the crown invests its\
  \ wearer with power. Wearing the crown grants a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma\
  \ and a +2 natural armor bonus. You are immune to the frightful presence ability\
  \ of all dragons. If you are a sorcerer you cast spells at +1 caster level."
