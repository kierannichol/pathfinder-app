  \ can be used to block an incoming melee attack. When used in this way, the buckler's\
  \ enhancement bonus increases by +2 against that attack. The buckler's user must\
  \ decide to use this ability before the attack roll is made. When the shield's user\
  \ blocks a melee attack in this way, it cannot use its arrow deflection special\
  \ ability for 1 round."
