description: "A chest of keeping is a large container capable of holding up to 1,000\
  \ pounds of contents, with a volume limit of 150 cubic feet. While the chest's lid\
  \ is closed, the contents are preserved so that they resist the passage of time\
  \ and do not decay. Living creatures placed inside the chest have no need to eat\
  \ or drink, but they age normally. The chest is airtight when the lid is closed,\
  \ with enough air to last a living creature for up to 10 minutes before it suffocates.\
  \ Once the lid is closed, a chest of keeping can be folded up, compacting down to\
  \ the size of a typical loaf of bread. When the chest is compressed in this way,\
  \ its contents do not add to the chest's standard weight of 10 pounds, as they are\
  \ shunted into an extradimensional space for storage. Folding or unfolding a chest\
  \ of keeping is a full-round action, and a chest of keeping cannot be opened when\
  \ it is folded."
