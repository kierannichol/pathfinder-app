description: "Alchemical compounds in this square of jagged, metallic fibers store\
  \ and transfer electricity into clothing when rubbed against the fabric for 1 minute.\
  \ When you are grappled within the next 10 minutes while wearing this electrically\
  \ charged clothing, as well as light armor or no armor, the electricity discharges.\
  \ This deals 1 point of nonlethal electricity damage to the grappling creature,\
  \ and if it takes damage from the effect, it must succeed at a DC 20 combat maneuver\
  \ check to grapple or immediately release you. The DC increases to 22 against a\
  \ creature with the grab ability. A single square of static wool can be used five\
  \ times before expending its alchemical compounds."
