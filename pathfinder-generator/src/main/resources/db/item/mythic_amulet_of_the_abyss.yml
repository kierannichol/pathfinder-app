description: "A mythic amulet of the Abyss bears the rune of a single demon lord on\
  \ its face, indicating the lord to which the amulet is attuned. At its basest, a\
  \ mythic amulet of the Abyss functions as an unholy symbol to this demon lord as\
  \ well as a phylactery of faithfulness.\nA mythic amulet of the Abyss grants its\
  \ wearer all three of the demon lord's boons, regardless of the wearer's actual\
  \ level. It grants all of the first boon's spell-like abilities at will. The amulet\
  \ found in this adventure is associated with Baphomet, and as such it grants the\
  \ following boons (see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lords of Chaos, Book of the\
  \ Damned, Vol. 2 for details on other demon lords' boons):"
destruction: "A mythic amulet of the Abyss can be destroyed as a swift action by the\
  \ demon lord to which it is attuned, up to a range of 120 feet."
