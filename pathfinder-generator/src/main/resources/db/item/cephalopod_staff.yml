description: "This dark mahogany staff is carved in the shape of a squid's tentacle\
  \ and smells strongly of seawater. When grasped, the staff animates, writhing momentarily\
  \ until it regains its rigid, wooden form. As a swift action, the wielder can transform\
  \ the staff into a long, flexible weapon that functions as a masterwork whip. The\
  \ staff reverts to its normal form at the beginning of the wielder's next turn.\n\
  The staff allows the use of the following spells."
