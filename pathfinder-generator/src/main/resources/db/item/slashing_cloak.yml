description: "This thick burgundy cloak is trimmed with mithral plates and cut to\
  \ fit handsomely over heavy armor. As a fullround action, the wearer can spin in\
  \ his space, damaging each creature within 5 feet. This attack uses the wearer's\
  \ highest base attack bonus against each creature, and deals 2d6 damage on a hit.\
  \ The wearer is considered proficient with this attack. Furthermore, the cloak can\
  \ be magically enhanced like a melee weapon, adding the cost of the melee weapon\
  \ property to the cloak's cost."
