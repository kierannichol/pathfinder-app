description: "These elegant, dark purple robes are usually decorated with gold stitching\
  \ suggesting a particular sorcerer bloodline, though some might indicate a family\
  \ tree. When a sorcerer dons a robe of arcane heritage, the stitching pulls itself\
  \ apart and reweaves to match her particular sorcerer bloodline. The wearer treats\
  \ her sorcerer level as 4 higher than normal for the purpose of determining what\
  \ bloodline powers she can use and their effects."
