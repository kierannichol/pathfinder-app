description: "Sleek dull gray stripes line the sides of this +1 mithral chain shirt,\
  \ slightly marring the otherwise shining metal. When worn, the wearer's clothing\
  \ and hair dance about as though caught in a faint breeze, no matter the prevailing\
  \ weather conditions.\nThree times per day as a standard action, the wearer can\
  \ momentarily transform into a surge of living wind, moving up to 60 feet in a straight\
  \ line. This line need not be horizontal; the effect can be used to traverse hazards\
  \ or reach elevated platforms. All creatures in the line between the wearer's starting\
  \ point and destination are blasted by the squall. The wearer attempts a trip combat\
  \ maneuver against every creature in the area, with a +5 circumstance bonus on those\
  \ checks. Failed trip attempts do not stop the wearer's movement, and these maneuvers\
  \ and movement do not provoke any attacks of opportunity. Any flying creature in\
  \ the area must succeed at a DC 15 Fly check or fall 20 feet, taking appropriate\
  \ damage and falling prone if it reaches a solid surface.\nCreatures more than one\
  \ size category larger than the wearer are not affected by a wearer taking advantage\
  \ of a suit of windstrider mail's living wind effect, but they do not inhibit the\
  \ wearer's movement. If the wearer's path is blocked by an object, such as a door,\
  \ she may continue moving forward with a successful Strength check to break the\
  \ obstacle as a free action. If this check fails, her movement is halted and she\
  \ takes damage as if she had fallen the distance that she traveled. If the wearer's\
  \ movement does not end on a surface that can support her weight, she falls to the\
  \ ground upon transforming back."
