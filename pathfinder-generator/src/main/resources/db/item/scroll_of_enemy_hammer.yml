name: "Scroll of Enemy Hammer"
description: "You grab a creature with telekinesis and use it to batter nearby opponents\
  \ or objects. You must target a specific creature when casting this spell and once\
  \ you select that creature you cannot switch to another. Each round, as a standard\
  \ action, you can attempt to hurl the target at any creature or object within 30\
  \ feet of it. You must make an attack roll whenever you use the target as a weapon.\
  \ The attack bonus for this attack is equal to your caster level plus either your\
  \ Intelligence or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher). If you successfully hit\
  \ the new target with the creature both it and the creature take damage based on\
  \ the creature's size."
