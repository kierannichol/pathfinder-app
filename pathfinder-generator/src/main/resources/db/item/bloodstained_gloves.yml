description: "The original color of these supple, calfskin gloves is obfuscated by\
  \ layers of brown bloodstains that persist through any amount of cleaning. If the\
  \ gloves are soaked in the blood of a recently killed creature, the wearer gains\
  \ a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against creatures of the same\
  \ type (or subtype for humanoids or outsiders, per the ranger's favored enemy class\
  \ feature) for 1 hour. If the gloves are worn by a slayer, the bonus on damage rolls\
  \ is equal the slayer's studied target bonus. Creatures that lack blood, such as\
  \ skeletons, golems, or clockwork creatures, cannot activate the gloves' ability."
