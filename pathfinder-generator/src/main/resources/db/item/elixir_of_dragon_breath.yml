description: "This gurgling, luminescent elixir comes in several different varieties,\
  \ each keyed to a particular type of metallic or chromatic dragon. A creature that\
  \ drinks the elixir can, as a standard action, breathe out a single blast of energy\
  \ similar to a dragon's breath weapon, dealing 7d6 points of energy damage. Creatures\
  \ in the area may attempt a DC 16 Reflex save for half damage. The magic of the\
  \ elixir ends after one use of the breath weapon or after 1 hour has passed, whichever\
  \ comes first. The type of energy produced and the shape of the blast are determined\
  \ by the elixir's associated dragon type:\nBlack or copper dragon: 30-foot line\
  \ of acid.\nBlue or bronze dragon: 30-foot line of electricity.\nBrass dragon: 30-foot\
  \ line of fire.\nGreen dragon: 15-foot cone of acid.\nGold or red dragon: 15-foot\
  \ cone of fire.\nSilver or white dragon: 15-foot cone of cold."
