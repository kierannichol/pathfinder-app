description: "When the wearer first sees an illusion effect with the figment subschool\
  \ with a visual element, and that figment allows a saving throw, she can immediately\
  \ make any allowed saving throw to realize the image is illusory instead of waiting\
  \ to interact with it. This has no effect on illusions of other subschools or on\
  \ illusions that do not normally allow a saving throw. If the wearer fails to disbelieve\
  \ the illusion and later interacts with it in such a way as to qualify normally\
  \ for a saving throw to disbelieve, she gains a +4 competence bonus on this saving\
  \ throw."
