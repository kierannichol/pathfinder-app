description: "Cast in the image of the sun and often ornamented with an open eye,\
  \ this amulet defends the wearer against the need for sleep. The wearer of this\
  \ amulet does not need to sleep, but must remain at ease for the normal amount of\
  \ time to regain spells and other abilities that require rest (although the wearer\
  \ could perform light activity, such as reading or keeping watch). Once the wearer\
  \ has used the power of this amulet for a total of seven nights, the amulet loses\
  \ its power for one day and the wearer is exhausted for this duration. If the wearer\
  \ removes the amulet for any reason after having used its ability, she becomes exhausted\
  \ for four hours for every night of sleep skipped."
