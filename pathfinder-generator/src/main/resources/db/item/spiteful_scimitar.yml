description: "This +2 cruel furyborn scimitar was created accidentally by Treerazer\
  \ when the demon lord plunged the glaistig Hephloma's scimitar through her own chest.\
  \ Images of shriveled vines and wilted flowers decorate its blade. Three times per\
  \ day as an immediate action after dealing damage to a creature, the wielder can\
  \ cause the blighted plant life depicted on the blade to animate, embedding thorny\
  \ vines in the creature's wounds. The creeping, twisting vines cause the creature\
  \ to become entangled for 1d4 rounds, and it is nauseated by the pain while the\
  \ entangled condition persists. A successful DC 22 Fortitude saving throw negates\
  \ the nauseated condition."
