description: "Nightmare tears are a toxic alchemical solution that, when applied to\
  \ the eyes, allows the individual to see past certain supernatural effects, as the\
  \ spell true seeing. These include reality-warping effects such as those caused\
  \ by the Plateau of Leng and spells or supernatural powers that create phantasms\
  \ such as weird, nightmare, and phantasmal killer. The effect of the tears lasts\
  \ for 1 hour.\nNightmare tears have horrific side effects—users suffer both temporary\
  \ blindness and insanity. Immediately after applying the tears, the user goes blind\
  \ for 1d4 rounds and looses 1d4 points of Wisdom until the tears wear off. However,\
  \ if the user fails a DC 11 Will save, both effects become permanent."
