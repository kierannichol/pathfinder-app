description: "Set in a burnished copper pendant, the colors of this black opal shift\
  \ with the wearer's mood. While the wearer is dazed, nauseated, paralyzed, or stunned\
  \ because of a mind-affecting effect, at the start of his turn he can take 2 points\
  \ of ability damage to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma to still take a standard\
  \ action that turn (in place of the move action in the case of nauseated). He can\
  \ make this choice even if otherwise prevented from taking actions. If affected\
  \ by multiple such conditions, the wearer must take the ability damage for each\
  \ in order to take his standard action. Ability damage caused by the jewel can't\
  \ be prevented or reduced, and it must be healed naturally. In addition, the indomitable\
  \ jewel renders the wearer immune to sleep caused by mind-affecting effects."
