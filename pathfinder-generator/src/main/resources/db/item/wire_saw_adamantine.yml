description: "This flexible saw consists of an abrasive wire hooked to two metal rings.\
  \ By feeding the wire around a deadbolt or small door bar, you can use the rings\
  \ to quietly saw through the obstruction. The saw takes 10 minutes to cut through\
  \ a 2-inch piece of wood or a 1-inch iron bar. A wire saw can cut through items\
  \ with hardness 10 or less. After five uses, the abrasive wire is worn smooth and\
  \ must be replaced (costing 25 gp).\nAdamantine Wire Saw: This works twice as fast\
  \ as a normal saw when cutting materials with hardness 10 or less, or at normal\
  \ speed when cutting materials with hardness 11–20. Replacing an adamantine wire\
  \ saw's wire costs 145 gp."
