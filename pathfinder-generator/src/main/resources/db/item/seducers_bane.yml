description: "This slender silver bracelet is worked in an intertwined design of three\
  \ flowers. A DC 20 Knowledge (nature) check identifies the flowers as acacia, apocynum,\
  \ and bilberry, symbolizing concealment, treachery, and falsehood.\nThe bracelet\
  \ grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks, and a +5 resistance\
  \ bonus on Will saves against enchantment effects. If the wearer makes a successful\
  \ Will save against an enchantment, the caster of that spell incorrectly senses\
  \ the effect has succeeded. Additionally, the bracelet's wearer knows an enchantment\
  \ targeted him and the enchantment's source. Seducer's bane creates an aura on its\
  \ wearer, visible to detect magic, matching the failed enchantment spell or effect,\
  \ and lasting as long as the intended enchantment's duration. However, if the bracelet's\
  \ wearer attacks the caster or its allies, or otherwise acts in a way that's contradictory\
  \ to the failed spell's effect, the caster of that spell immediately realizes the\
  \ enchantment was ineffective."
