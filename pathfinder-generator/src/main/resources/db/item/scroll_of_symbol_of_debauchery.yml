name: "Scroll of Symbol of Debauchery"
description: "You conjure a sizable symbol into being, a rune suggestive of bloated\
  \ bodies, flung food, and flowing wine. This spell functions as symbol of death,\
  \ except that all creatures within 60 feet of the symbol of debaucheryare instead\
  \ filled with lust for the nearest conscious creature. This effect lasts for 1 round\
  \ per caster level, even after creatures leave the symbol's area of effect. Affected\
  \ creatures are compelled to rush to the nearest creature in order to caress and\
  \ kiss it, and may take no other actions. Each creature receives a single Will save\
  \ when the symbol of debaucheryis triggered to negate the effect. If no other creatures\
  \ are visible, an affected creature may act normally."
