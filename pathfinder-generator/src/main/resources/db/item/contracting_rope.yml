description: "This 50-foot length of silk rope is treated with alchemical reagents\
  \ that give it a distinctly dusty odor. When any part of the rope is touched to\
  \ an open flame, it suddenly contracts to one-fifth its original length, pulling\
  \ any creature or object attached to one side to within 10 feet of the other; if\
  \ multiple creatures are moved into the same square, they fall prone in randomly\
  \ determined adjacent squares. Because of the sudden jerk, a creature holding a\
  \ contracting rope must succeed at a DC 10 Climb check to avoid dropping it as it\
  \ contracts (unless it is knotted around the creature's waist, clamped in a locked\
  \ gauntlet, or otherwise firmly attached to the creature). The rope fails to contract\
  \ if it would pull more than 1,000 pounds horizontally or lift more than 250 pounds\
  \ vertically. Once activated, the rope slowly unravels to its normal length over\
  \ the course of 24 hours and can't be activated again until such time has passed."
