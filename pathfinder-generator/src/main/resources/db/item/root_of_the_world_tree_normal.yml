  \ trees growing across planar boundaries. When thrown in the air as part of casting\
  \ a conjuration (summoning) spell, it grants the creatures summoned the advanced\
  \ simple template. If the caster also expends one use of mythic power, the summoned\
  \ creatures gain DR 5/epic, or DR 10/epic if they have at least 11 HD. Lesser root\
  \ affects conjuration (summoning) spells up to 3rd level, normal root conjuration\
  \ (summoning) spells up to 6th level, and greater root any conjuration (summoning)\
