description: "Each of these leather gloves has a large, ragged hole in the palm. Upon\
  \ donning the gloves, the wearer is nauseated with pain for 1 round as the skin\
  \ on his palms rips open, revealing terrible gashes that each sprout fangs, lips,\
  \ and a tongue. While the wearer's hands are empty, he can breathe, eat, drink,\
  \ and speak through the mouths on his hands (though this doesn't allow him to drink\
  \ more potions in a round, speak with more than one voice at a time, or otherwise\
  \ take more actions than normal). The wearer retains the use of his hands; the mouths\
  \ remain shut while the wearer is holding items in his hands.\nThe wearer receives\
  \ a +2 enhancement bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple a foe with his hands.\
  \ If he begins his turn grappling with his hands, the wearer can make a free bite\
  \ attack with one of the mouths on his hands. The bite is treated as a natural weapon\
  \ and deals an amount of damage equal to 1d4 + his Strength modifier for a Medium\
  \ wearer (1d3 + his Strength modifier if he's Small)."
