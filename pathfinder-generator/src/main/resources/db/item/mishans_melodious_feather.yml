description: "This white sea-bird feather is millennia old and coated with a thin,\
  \ resinous substance that has rendered the feather as rigid as steel. When the feather\
  \ is rubbed or struck, its barbs jangle against each other, emitting a curious polytonal\
  \ hum like that of several tuning forks. The feather is firmly affixed to a jeweled\
  \ turban pin.\nThe shaft of the feather is covered with tiny Kelish script. If read—\
  a difficult task without magnification due to the miniscule writing—the text reveals\
  \ the history of the lands of Qadira before and during the establishment of the\
  \ Keleshite satrapy at the end of the Age of Destiny. This acts as a library on\
  \ the history of Qadira. A character with access to the feather can attempt Knowledge\
  \ (history) checks about Qadira that have a DC higher than 10, even if untrained\
  \ in the skill. Characters trained in Knowledge (history) can attempt a second check\
  \ after studying the feather for an hour if they fail a Knowledge (history) check\
  \ on such subjects."
