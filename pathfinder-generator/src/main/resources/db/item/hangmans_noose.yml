description: "This +1 whip is made from a hemp rope that once served as the noose\
  \ in a gallows. The countless executions committed with the rope have left an indelible\
  \ mark on the weapon.\nAs a standard action, the wielder of a hangman's noose can\
  \ attempt a combat maneuver check to wrap the whip around a creature's neck. If\
  \ she succeeds, the victim can't move outside of the whip's reach. As a standard\
  \ action, the wielder can attempt a reposition combat maneuver check to move the\
  \ victim within the whip's reach or to pull the whip tighter, strangling the victim\
  \ (see the rules for suffocation on page 445 of the Core Rulebook). Once the target\
  \ is being strangled, the wielder can attempt a combat maneuver check as a standard\
  \ action to squeeze the air out of the victim's lungs. This reduces the amount of\
  \ time the victim can hold his breath by 1d6+1 rounds.\nA victim can escape the\
  \ noose with a successful Escape Artist check (DC = the wielder's CMD), or by severing\
  \ the noose with an attack or a successful sunder combat maneuver check. The noose\
  \ has AC 18, hardness 2, and 12 hp. If severed, the noose can still be used as a\
  \ +1 whip and repairs itself after 1 hour."
