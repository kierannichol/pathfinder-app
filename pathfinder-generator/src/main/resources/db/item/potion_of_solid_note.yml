name: "Potion of Solid Note"
description: "You give temporary physical form to a single musical note and can hang\
  \ it, suspended, wherever you wish within range, allowing you to use it as hook,\
  \ pulley, door blocker, or anything else your imagination desires. The exact appearance\
  \ of the solid notedepends on your melody. You can make it spiked or smooth, simple\
  \ or convoluted, and with any color pattern you wish, however, it always has a size\
  \ approximately equal to that of your outstretched hand. Once created, the solid\
  \ noteresists all attempts to move it but instantly disappears if enough force or\
  \ weight is brought to bear against it. The note has an effective Strength equal\
  \ to 10 + your caster level. It cannot hold more weight than the equivalent of a\
  \ heavy load for its Strength without disappearing. Any creature that wins an opposed\
  \ Strength check against the note (by pushing open a door which the note is holding\
  \ shut for example) also causes it to disappear. The note can never deal actual\
  \ harm to a creature and disappears if successfully attacked (AC 10 + your Charisma\
  \ modifier) or overcome with a combat maneuver such as bull rush (CMD 2 + your base\
  \ attack bonus + your Charisma modifier). Any creature obstructed by the solid notesimply\
  \ fails to budge it and loses that action for the round."
