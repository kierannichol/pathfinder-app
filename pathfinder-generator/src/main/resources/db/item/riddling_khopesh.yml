description: "This +1 khopesh has a handle in the shape of an elongated sphinx, with\
  \ the sphinx's serene face as the pommel of the sword. Once per day, the wielder\
  \ can attempt to answer a series of riddles posed telepathically by the khopesh\
  \ over 10 minutes. At the end of that time, if the wielder succeeds at a DC 15 Intelligence\
  \ check (the wielder can't take 10 or 20 on this check), the sword's enhancement\
  \ bonus increases by 1 for the next 24 hours as long as it is wielded by the creature\
  \ who correctly answered its riddles. If the result of the Intelligence check is\
  \ 20 or more, the wielder can also add the flaming, ghost touch, or keen special\
  \ weapon ability to the weapon for 24 hours."
