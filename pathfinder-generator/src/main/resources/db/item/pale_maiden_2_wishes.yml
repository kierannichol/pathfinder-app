description: "This +3 longsword is a variant luck blade (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment\
  \ 157). It grants its wielder a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. Once per day,\
  \ its possessor can reroll one d20 roll that he just made, before the results of\
  \ the original roll are revealed. He must take the results of the reroll, even if\
  \ they are worse. This reroll power is an extraordinary ability. Finally, Pale Maiden\
  \ can hold up to three wishes, as a luck blade. When the last wish is used, Pale\
  \ Maiden remains a +3 longsword, still grants the +1 luck bonus on saving throws,\
  \ and still grants the daily use of its reroll power."
