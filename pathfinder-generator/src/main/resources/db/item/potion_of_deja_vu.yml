name: "Potion of Deja Vu"
description: "You reach into the target's mind and put its thought processes into\
  \ a temporary loop. Whatever full-round, standard, or move actions the creature\
  \ takes on its first turn after you cast this spell, it must repeat on the turn\
  \ after that. The creature must take the same type of actions in the same order\
  \ (for example, making a full attack, casting a specific spell, withdrawing, attempting\
  \ a bull rush combat maneuver, or activating a magic item) and must act against\
  \ the same target or targets, but doesn't have to make exactly the same choices\
  \ (such as using Power Attack when attacking, moving exactly 15 feet, or choosing\
  \ â€œdrop\" for the command spell). If the circumstances would prevent the target\
  \ from repeating an action, such as if the target of its attack is dead or the target\
  \ cannot cast the same spell again, the target instead becomes confused until the\
  \ spell ends. A creature currently affected by deja vu can't be targeted with another\
  \ deja vu spell. A creature affected by deja vu can't delay, and if it readies an\
  \ action on its first turn, it must ready the same action on its second turn."
