description: "A dire flail consists of two spheres of spiked iron dangling from chains\
  \ at opposite ends of a long haft. This weapon excels at short but powerful strikes,\
  \ and is typically swung in a constant churning motion. The wielder of a dire flail\
  \ must have great strength, both to use the weapon effectively and to keep from\
  \ tiring out."
