description: "People who lose hands, arms, legs, or feet in combat sometimes replace\
  \ them with prosthetics: realistic simulations of their missing limbs. Usually carved\
  \ of wood and painted to match the wearer's skin tone, these items have limited\
  \ functionality, allowing a legless person to walk at half speed, or enabling an\
  \ armless person to hold a shield in a fixed position, but little more. Clever individuals\
  \ have been known to create small compartments in their prosthetics, just large\
  \ enough to hold very small objects. A prosthetic hand or foot can hold an item\
  \ with negligible weight, while a prosthetic limb can hold up to 1 or 2 pounds."
