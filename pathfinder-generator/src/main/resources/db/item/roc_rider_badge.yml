description: "This giant-sized silver brooch is fashioned in the shape of a roc's\
  \ head inscribed inside a circle. A roc rider badge automatically neutralizes the\
  \ energy field around Ironcloud Keep (see page 20) in a 200-foot-radius sphere around\
  \ the wearer, allowing the wearer and his mount (if any) to freely move through\
  \ the field. In addition, the wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on Handle Animal\
  \ and Ride checks dealing with aerial mounts. A roc rider badge also allows its\
  \ wearer to improve the initial attitude of birds of all kinds, as if the wearer\
  \ had the wild empathy ranger class feature. If the wearer already has the wild\
  \ empathy class feature, the roc rider badge grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus\
  \ on wild empathy checks against birds. A roc rider badge occupies the neck slot\
  \ on Large or Huge creatures, but a Medium creature can wear the badge as a pectoral\
  \ in the chest slot."
