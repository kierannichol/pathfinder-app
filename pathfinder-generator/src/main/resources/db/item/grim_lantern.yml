description: "This macabre lantern is composed of a humanoid skull dangling from a\
  \ short length of chain. A small fragment of soulstuff is trapped inside, burning\
  \ slowly in a heatless flame. Its flickering light shines from the skull's eye sockets,\
  \ casting light as a bullseye lantern. On command, the lantern can consume its soulstuff\
  \ in a sudden blast of heat, as burning hands. Doing so extinguishes the lantern.\
  \ Whenever a living creature with at least 1 HD is slain within 30 feet of an empty\
  \ grim lantern, the lantern absorbs a fragment of that creature's soul, restoring\
  \ its glow."
