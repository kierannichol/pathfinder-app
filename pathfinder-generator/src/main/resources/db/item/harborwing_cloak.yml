description: "This white-hooded cloak is trimmed with seagull feathers. The cloak\
  \ billows in the slightest breeze, and when the hood is drawn over the wearer's\
  \ head, the cloak repels rainwater and seaspray, keeping the wearer dry. Harborwing\
  \ cloaks were made by Varisian mystery cultists (and put to less-sacred uses by\
  \ Sczarni bandits) for centuries before Magnimar's founding, though they are used\
  \ more widely today. Many who worship Ylimancha, empyreal lord of coastal waters,\
  \ fisherfolk, and flying creatures, wear these cloaks.\nThree times per day, whenever\
  \ the wearer of this cloak falls more than 5 feet, she can spend an immediate action\
  \ to gain the benefits of feather fall. In addition, once per day, the wearer can\
  \ command the cloak as a standard action to become a sheet of rippling, flowing\
  \ water, causing attacks against her to take a 20% miss chance. While the cloak\
  \ is in this liquid-like state, the wearer can use the Stealth skill to hide in\
  \ rainy conditions (or similar areas, such as the spray of a waterfall) even if\
  \ she is being observed, and she gains a +5 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks\
  \ in such conditions. This effect lasts for 3 minutes, and the duration need not\
  \ be used all at once, but it must be used in 1-minute increments."
