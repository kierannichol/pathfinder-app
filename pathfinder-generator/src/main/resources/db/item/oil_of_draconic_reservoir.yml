name: "Oil of Draconic Reservoir"
description: "Draconic reservoirfunctions as protection from energy, absorbing 6 points\
  \ of one type of energy damage per caster level (acid, cold, electricity, or fire,\
  \ maximum 60 points). Each round, as a swift action, the subject can release 1d6\
  \ points of the absorbed energy and apply it to any melee attack, as if using an\
  \ acidic, flaming, frost, or shockweapon. The first creature the subject strikes\
  \ with this attack takes the energy damage in addition to any other consequences\
  \ of the attack. Releasing energy in this way does not â€œfree up\" space to absorb\
  \ still more energy; the maximum amount of energy the spell can absorb remains fixed.\
  \ The subject cannot release more energy than he currently has absorbed. Once the\
  \ subject has absorbed all the energy allowed by the spell, he takes damage as normal\
  \ from that energy type. Once the energy has been released, the spell is discharged."
