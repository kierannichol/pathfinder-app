name: "Potion of Hide Campsite"
description: "You make the area around a campsite appear to be a thicket of untouched\
  \ and forbidding foliage, or some other unwelcoming feature matching the surrounding\
  \ terrain. Creatures outside the area cannot sense any activity going on inside\
  \ the area--they cannot smell campfires or cooking food, they cannot hear conversation,\
  \ loud noises, or spells being cast, and they cannot even feel heat or a rush of\
  \ wind coming from the area. Those inside the area can see out normally. Once a\
  \ creature steps into the area of the spell, it can see everything in and around\
  \ the area normally."
