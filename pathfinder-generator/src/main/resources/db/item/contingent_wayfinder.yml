description: "This wayfinder is constructed of delicate ivory. Its face constantly\
  \ reshapes to form a relief of its bearer, and is capable of changing as quickly\
  \ as two creatures can pass the wayfinder back and forth. The socket in which an\
  \ ioun stone could normally be placed is instead filled with a permanently fixed\
  \ gem that functions as a ring of minor spell storing. After wielding this wayfinder\
  \ for 24 hours, its wielder can designate a series of conditions upon which the\
  \ wayfinder will cast the highest-level spell stored in the gem with the wearer\
  \ as the spell's target, as though it were using the contingency spell. For example,\
  \ the wielder of a contingent wayfinder could place a cure moderate wounds spell\
  \ in the wayfinder's gem, then specify that if she ever falls unconscious because\
  \ of lethal damage, the spell must be cast on her.\nOnce used in such a manner,\
  \ the wayfinder requires 1 month to recharge its contingency effect, though a new\
  \ spell can be cast into the enclosed gem at any time during this period. If the\
  \ conditions of the contingency effect are not met within 1 week of when they were\
  \ assigned, the user can change the conditions, though the spell stored in the gem\
  \ can't be changed until it has been cast."
