description: "This belt looks like nothing more than iron chains connecting large\
  \ pieces of slate. It grants its wearer a +5 inherent bonus to combat maneuver defense\
  \ against bull rush, drag, grapple, overrun, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers\
  \ and a +5 inherent bonus on saving throws against any effect that attempts to move\
  \ the wearer with physical force or energy. Furthermore, if the wearer is a mythic\
  \ creature and targeted by an effect that would teleport her, she can choose whether\
  \ or not she wishes to be teleported.\nAs a standard action, the wearer can expend\
  \ one use of mythic power to create a 30-foot-radius aura that affects all enemy\
  \ creatures within it as though they were subject to a dimensional anchor spell.\
  \ This aura lasts for a number of rounds equal to the wearer's mythic tier."
