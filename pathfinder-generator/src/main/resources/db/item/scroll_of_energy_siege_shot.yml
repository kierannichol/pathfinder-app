name: "Scroll of Energy Siege Shot"
description: "This spell transforms any ammunition fired by the target ranged siege\
  \ engine into ammunition made of pure energy. When casting the spell, the caster\
  \ picks a one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic,\
  \ or force. The ammunition within the siege weapon now deals that type of energy\
  \ damage on a hit, though the amount of damage dealt by the ammunition does not\
  \ change, nor does it change any of the other effects of the ammunition. Unlike\
  \ other forms of energy damage, this energy damage does full damage to objects.\
  \ Based on the type of energy the caster chose while casting, the ammunition also\
  \ gains one of the following effects."
