description: "This shimmering metallic belt is composed of dozens of looped silver\
  \ cords tied together in elaborate braids and knots. As a standard action, the wearer\
  \ can touch his animal companion to attach an invisible, incorporeal cord to it\
  \ that, if it can be seen by anyone, appears to be superficially tied to the silver\
  \ soul cord. This forms a deeper bond between the wearer and the animal companion.\
  \ It can be attached to only one animal companion at a time. If the animal companion\
  \ is killed or the link is broken while the cord is attached in this manner (though\
  \ very few things can destroy the incorporeal cord), the wearer and the animal companion\
  \ each gain a negative level and the silver soul cord cannot be reattached to any\
  \ creature for 24 hours. The cord can extend for a length of up to 1 mile, but if\
  \ the attached animal companion moves farther away from the wearer than this, the\
  \ cord automatically detaches and the bond ends, though it is not considered to\
  \ be broken and therefore does impart any negative levels. The wearer can remove\
  \ the cord as a standard action. While the silver cord is attached, the wearer gains\
  \ an empathic link with an animal companion as if it were a familiar (per the wizard\
  \ arcane bond class feature). Additionally, as a standard action, the wearer can\
  \ sacrifice his own hit points to heal the animal companion through this bond. The\
  \ creature regains 1 hit point for every 1 hit point the wearer sacrifices. The\
  \ wearer can sacrifice a maximum number of hit points per turn equal to his Hit\
  \ Dice, and can't sacrifice hit points if doing so would reduce him to 0 hit points\
  \ or fewer."
