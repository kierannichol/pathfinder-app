description: "The front of this +2 heavy wooden shield has several small holes that\
  \ resemble the gun ports on a naval ship. There are seven such holes in total on\
  \ the front of shield, each varying in size, with an equal number of thin hemp strings\
  \ on the reverse side. As a standard action, the wielder of the broadside bulwark\
  \ can pull one of the strings, causing a small red bead to fly out from the associated\
  \ gun port. This bead travels 30 feet forward and detonates as a fireball spell\
  \ (Reflex DC 14 half), leaving the wielder outside the blast radius unless it contacts\
  \ something before reaching 30 feet. After a string is pulled, its associated gun\
  \ port is permanently closes and can no longer be used.\nThe gun ports are different\
  \ sizes, and include three small ports that deal 3d6 points of fire damage, three\
  \ larger ports that deal 6d6 points of fire damage, and one massive port in the\
  \ center of the shield that deals 9d6 points of fire damage.\nOnce all the gun ports\
  \ have been fired, the shield takes on a blackened, charred look and grants the\
  \ wielder fire resistance 5."
