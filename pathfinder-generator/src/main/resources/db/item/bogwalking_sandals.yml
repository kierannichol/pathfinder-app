description: "These sandals have blackwood soles and leather straps that wrap around\
  \ the wearer's feet. The sandals are waterproof and are thus popular among individuals\
  \ who tread the harsh locales of the swamps and wastelands beyond Cassomir properâ€”\
  especially those who are in such environments for long periods of time without access\
  \ to the comforts of a skilled cobbler. The sandals' design also allows the wearer\
  \ to move through shallow bogs normally and to treat deep bogs as if they were shallow\
  \ bogs (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 427). The sandals do not affect the penalty\
  \ on Acrobatics checks while in bogs, and creatures wearing the sandals cannot gain\
  \ cover from deep bogs."
