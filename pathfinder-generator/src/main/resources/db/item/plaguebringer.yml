description: "A twisted blend of artifact, disease, and malign intellect, the Plaguebringer\
  \ isn't so much found as contracted. Once it infects a host, Plaguebringer renders\
  \ him immune to the effects of any lesser disease. Despite this immunity, the host\
  \ can still spread disease; indeed, his body becomes an incubator for the countless\
  \ ailments of the mortal world. When exposed to a disease, the host automatically\
  \ fails any saving throw to avoid contracting it, but suffers no ill effects. The\
  \ host indefinitely remains an asymptomatic carrier for any diseases caught.\nPlaguebringer\
  \ also grants the following abilities:"
destruction: "To be destroyed, Plaguebringer must first be forced or tricked into\
  \ the body of an angel. The angel must then willingly sacrifice itself by dying\
  \ at the heart of a star."
