description: "This heavy leather bag bulges only slightly but upon closer inspection\
  \ appears to be chocked full of knives, gears, picks, shovels, and arrows. Once\
  \ per day as a full-round action, the bearer can command the sack to create any\
  \ mechanical trap of CR 4 or less (Core Rulebook 420â€“422), which appears at a designated\
  \ spot within 50 feet. The bearer must make a Craft (traps) check with a DC equal\
  \ to the normal DC for creating the trap . If successful, the trap instantly merges\
  \ with the chosen area, exactly as if someone had actually built the trap in that\
  \ spot. If the check fails, no trap appears. The sack can alter earth, stone, and\
  \ wood to accommodate the trap without altering nearby terrain (including doors,\
  \ pits, and so on)."
