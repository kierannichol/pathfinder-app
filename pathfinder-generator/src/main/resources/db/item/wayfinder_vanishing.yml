description: "Vanishing wayfinders are crafted of ivory chased with gold and silver.\
  \ In addition to the usual functions of a wayfinder (including the ability to create\
  \ light), the bearer of a vanishing wayfinder can press a hidden catch as a standard\
  \ action to become invisible (as the spell invisibility) for as long as she concentrates,\
  \ up to a maximum duration of 5 minutes per day. These minutes need not be consecutive,\
  \ but each activation uses 1 minute of duration, even if the user becomes visible\
  \ by making an attack or by some other means before that minute is up."
