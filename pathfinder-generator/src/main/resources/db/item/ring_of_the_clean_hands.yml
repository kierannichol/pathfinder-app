description: "This delicate ring of forged bronze is formed into the shape of two\
  \ hands, which do not quite touch as they meet at the top of the wearer's finger.\
  \ A ring of the clean hands grants use of telekinesis as a standard action and has\
  \ 10 charges. These charges return at the start of the next day.\nThe ring's charges\
  \ can be expended to create the following effects:\nCombat maneuver: This effect\
  \ costs 3 charges for each round it is active, but otherwise functions as described\
  \ by the spell telekinesis. The force created by this effect has a +9 base attack\
  \ bonus, and is considered to have Strength 20 and Dexterity 20.\nForce lash: This\
  \ effect costs 3 charges, striking out as if with an invisible whip. One target\
  \ within 60 feet must make a DC 17 Will save or be struck for 4d6 points of nonlethal\
  \ damage. This attack does not affect targets with a +3 or higher natural armor\
  \ bonus, or a +1 or higher armor bonus.\nSustained force: This effect costs 1 charge\
  \ for each round it is active, but otherwise functions as described by the spell\
  \ telekinesis, making it capable of lifting 225 lbs.\nViolent thrust: This effect\
  \ costs 5 charges, but otherwise functions as described by the spell telekinesis,\
  \ allowing you to throw up to 9 creatures or objects up to 90 feet, with a total\
  \ weight of 225 lbs. The attack roll has a +9 modifier. The Will save is DC 17."
