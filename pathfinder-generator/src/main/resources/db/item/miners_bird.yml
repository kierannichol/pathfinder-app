description: "A miner's bird is a Diminutive, semi-trained animal (typically a canary\
  \ or other delicate songbird) in a portable cage. The enclosure is most often made\
  \ of wood or metal. The bird within has 1 hit point, a Constitution score of 3,\
  \ and a Fortitude save bonus of â€“2 (otherwise, its statistics are identical to a\
  \ thrush). When the bird fails its first saving throw against a poison-based effect,\
  \ it emits a loud chirping, audible within 60 feet."
