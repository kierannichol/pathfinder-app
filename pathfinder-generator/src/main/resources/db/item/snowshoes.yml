description: "These high-tension nets of rope or sinew in wooden frames are lashed\
  \ to the feet to spread your weight across the snow, making you much less likely\
  \ to break through the crust and rendering walking much easier. Snowshoes reduce\
  \ the penalty for walking through heavy snow by 50%; for example, if moving through\
  \ snow normally costs you 2 squares of movement (1 square plus a 1 square penalty)\
  \ per square traveled, snowshoes reduce this cost to 1.5 squares per square traveled.\
  \ Snowshoes may supplement another outfit."
