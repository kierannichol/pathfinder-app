description: "This is a hand-sized replica of a wasp's nest, crafted out of paper.\
  \ It is extremely fragile and comes in a snug rigid case. If the nest is placed\
  \ on the floor or ground, each time a creature passes through that square there\
  \ is a 50% chance that it kicks or steps on the nest, triggering it. The nest may\
  \ instead be thrown (range increment 10 feet), triggering when it strikes a hard\
  \ surface or a creature. When triggered, the nest creates a wasp swarm that attacks\
  \ the nearest creature and follows it until it is dead, the swarm is killed, or\
  \ the swarm is unable to reach the target, at which point the swarm attacks the\
  \ next nearest creature. If the swarm can't find any targets, it waits in place\
  \ until another creature appears. The swarm dissipates 9 minutes after being released."
