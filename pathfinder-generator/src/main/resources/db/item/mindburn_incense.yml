description: "The scent of this light brown incense carries a distinct tang of peppermint\
  \ oil. Once the incense is lit in a censer or appropriate container, its smoke permeates\
  \ a 20-foot-by-20-foot area to a height of 10 feet. Living creatures within the\
  \ area that breathe the incense fumes for more than 1 minute gain a +1 morale bonus\
  \ on saves against pain effects, while taking a –1 penalty on saves against mind-affecting\
  \ effects. This effect lasts for as long as the creature remains within the area\
  \ of the incense, and for an additional minute after leaving. The incense burns\
  \ for 1 hour before dissipating, unless dispersed before then by wind."
