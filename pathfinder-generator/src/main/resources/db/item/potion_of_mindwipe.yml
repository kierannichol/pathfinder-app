description: "You erase a portion of the target's mind and experiences, inflicting\
  \ 2 temporary negative levels on the target for 1 day per caster level. If the target\
  \ is a spellcaster who must choose and prepare spells in advance, each negative\
  \ level imposed by mindwipe also causes the target to lose one prepared spell from\
  \ her highest level of spells known for each of her spellcasting classes for which\
  \ she must prepare spells. These lost spells are no longer considered known by the\
  \ target until the corresponding negative levels are removed."
