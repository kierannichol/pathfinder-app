description: "Runes spiral and skitter across these leather bracers, which are adorned\
  \ with small spikes. Twice per day, as a swift action after making a successful\
  \ attack against a creature, the wearer can say the command word to steal all morale\
  \ bonuses from which the creature is benefiting (this includes morale bonuses on\
  \ attack rolls, on checks, to AC, or to any other statistics). These bonuses affect\
  \ the wearer instead of the creature for 9 rounds. After this duration, if the morale\
  \ bonuses' durations haven't elapsed, the bonuses cease affecting the wearer and\
  \ resume affecting the original creature as normal. If the wearer attempts to activate\
  \ this effect against a creature not benefiting from any morale bonuses, a daily\
  \ use of the item is wasted."
