description: "These 10 ebony, pearl, and ivory tiles, when arranged in a spiral pattern\
  \ on the ground, provide you with the effects of a guidance spell once per day.\
  \ The spell's effect lasts until discharged.\nIf your patron is Pharasma, you can\
  \ toss the spiral tiles upon the ground once per day as a standard action and interpret\
  \ the patterns they lie in as if you had cast augury. If Pharasma is not your patron\
  \ and you attempt to use spiral tiles in this manner, the result is either random\
  \ or purposefully misleading."
