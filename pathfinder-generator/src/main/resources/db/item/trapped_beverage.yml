description: "This brightly labeled bottle or waterskin could appear to contain any\
  \ number of different beverages, from absinthe to wine. However, it's actually a\
  \ magical trap, and when the bottle is opened, a spider swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary\
  \ 258) pours out. The swarm stays in the area for 3 rounds, then disappears. Detecting\
  \ that the bottle is trapped requires a successful DC 25 Perception check made by\
  \ a character with the trapfinding ability, and disabling it requires a successful\
  \ DC 25 Disable Device check. After being triggered, the trapped beverage remains\
  \ a mundane bottle or wineskin."
