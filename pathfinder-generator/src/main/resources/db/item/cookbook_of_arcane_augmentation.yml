description: "This book is bound in dyed goatskin, and its coarse, thick pages are\
  \ stained in a variety of colors and covered in wavering script; rough sketches;\
  \ and diagrams of various plants, mystic symbols, and animal parts. A crude wooden\
  \ spoon serves a bookmark. A cookbook of arcane augmentation contains recipes that\
  \ allow an arcane spellcaster who prepares spells to augment her spells with specific\
  \ metamagic effects through ritual preparation. A cookbook of arcane augmentation\
  \ contains recipes for Ectoplasmic Spell, Persistent Spell, Rime Spell, and Sickening\
  \ Spell, and can be used to augment spells of 6th level or lower.\nOnce per day,\
  \ the spellcaster can augment a spell by following a recipe as part of her normal\
  \ spell preparation. To prepare an augmented spell, the spellcaster must succeed\
  \ at a Craft (alchemy) check (DC 15 + spell level) while mixing the recipe's ingredients\
  \ in a cauldron. (The cost of these ingredients is negligible, and they are assumed\
  \ to be readily available in a spell component pouch.) If the check succeeds, the\
  \ spell is augmented with the recipe's metamagic feat. This doesn't change the spell\
  \ slot of the augmented spell. On a failed check, that spell can't be augmented\
  \ that day, but the caster can attempt to augment another spell.\nA spellcaster\
  \ can prepare only a single augmented spell each time she prepares spells, and apply\
  \ only one augmentation from the cookbook to any given spell, but can combine an\
  \ augmentation with metamagic feats she possesses. In this case, only the feats\
  \ possessed by the caster adjust the spell slot of the spell being cast. The book\
  \ doesn't confer the associated metamagic feat on the owner, only the ability to\
  \ use the given feat when spells are prepared."
