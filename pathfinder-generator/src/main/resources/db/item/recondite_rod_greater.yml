description: "This odd, 2-foot-long rod appears to be made out of solidified ectoplasm\
  \ shot through with energy that pulses brightly at regular intervals, almost like\
  \ a heartbeat. Three times per day, this rod allows its wielder to cast a psychic\
  \ spell that could be undercast (such as ego whip or mind thrust) at 1 level higher,\
  \ even if the wielder doesn't know the higher-level spell or can't cast spells of\
  \ that level. The spell uses the same spell slot and save DC as that of the lower-level\
  \ spell, but creates the effects of the higher-level spell. For example, the wielder\
  \ could use this rod to cast mind thrust I, with the effect of mind thrust II. This\
  \ rod can't be used to cast the highest-level spell of a particular group. The wielder\
  \ must the able to cast the lower-level spell to use this rod. Using this rod is\
  \ part of the action of casting the modified spell. A lesser recondite rod can be\
  \ used with spells of 3rd level or lower. A recondite rod can be used with spells\
  \ of 6th level or lower. A greater recondite rod can be used with spells of 8th\
  \ level or lower."
