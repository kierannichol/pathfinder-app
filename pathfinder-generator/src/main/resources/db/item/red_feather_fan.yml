description: "This fan is made of copper fashioned into a dozen small feathers mounted\
  \ on a ring-shaped bone handle. Once per day, the bearer can hold it and speak a\
  \ command word to counterspell a darkness effect (as if using daylight) or counterspell\
  \ a light effect (as if using deeper darkness). If activated in an area of overlapping\
  \ light and darkness effects, the fan randomly counterspells one of them, leaving\
  \ the other intact."
