description: "The Eye of Abenatrex appears as a crystalline eyeball almost too large\
  \ to be held in one hand. Gouges mar its surface and a golden triangle is embedded\
  \ deep in the black iris—the symbol of the Saoc Brethren of the lost nation of Lirgen.\n\
  The city of Oagon was home to a cadre of wealthy merchants and astrologers who were\
  \ the unknowing minions of the blue dragon Abenatrex. By sending false prophecies\
  \ into their dreams, she directed the development of trade between Lirgen and its\
  \ neighbors. Proud of her achievements, Abenatrex made the fatal error of revealing\
  \ herself to her underlings, expecting respect. What she actually received was a\
  \ pretense of fealty from subjects who turned the tables on her and stole what they\
  \ perceived as their gold from under her nose. Through powerful magic, the Lirgeni\
  \ took her entire hoard to fill their already overflowing coffers. For a while,\
  \ Abenatrex remained oblivious to the immense slight, but inevitably, one of the\
  \ wizards made a mistake and their ruse was revealed. Driven mad with rage and confusion,\
  \ Abenatrex clawed out her own unbelieving eyes and frenziedly collapsed her lair\
  \ around her.\nFrom out of the rubble, one of her eyes was recovered, and over the\
  \ decades since Lirgen's fall, the Eye of Abenatrex has been sought by kings and\
  \ dragons alike.\nEffects: The Eye of Abenatrex can be held in the hand or mounted\
  \ atop a staff. The bearer of the eye is immune to the effects of the illusory hoard\
  \ spell and can cast dispel magic three times per day using his character level\
  \ as the effect's caster level. If mounted on a staff, the eye also automatically\
  \ casts dispel magic (CL 13th), targeting any illusions it interacts with. Also,\
  \ any sorcerer of the draconic bloodline who wields the eye adds all spells on pages\
  \ 28–29 to her spells known."
