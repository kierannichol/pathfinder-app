description: "This small, round paper packet is filled with a sparkling propellant\
  \ and pierced with several irregular holes, which causes it to dance and spin as\
  \ the firework burns. One round after you light a jumping jenny, it fills its square\
  \ with sparks, dealing 1 point of fire damage to creatures in that square and dazzling\
  \ them for 1d2 rounds (Reflex DC 12 negates). Each round for 1d4 rounds after detonation,\
  \ the jumping jenny moves into a random adjacent square."
