description: "This silvery rod is spoon-sized and utterly featureless. A creature\
  \ holding a rod of delumination can extinguish any ability, item, or spell effect\
  \ that is acting as a light source simply by pointing one end of the rod at the\
  \ light and uttering a command word. Sources of magical light receive a DC 15 Will\
  \ saving throw to negate this effect and have a Will save bonus equal to half their\
  \ caster level; if the original caster of the effect is still within the spell's\
  \ range, the spell can use its caster's Will save bonus instead. If a light source\
  \ succeeds at its saving throw against a rod of delumination, the same rod cannot\
  \ affect it again for 24 hours. No other properties of an affected creature, item,\
  \ or spell are altered other than its ability to shed light; a torch continues to\
  \ burn, a lantern continues to consume oil, and so on.\nThe bearer can, if she chooses,\
  \ utter a second command word to reignite any light source the rod has previously\
  \ extinguished, provided that the light source's normal duration hasn't expired."
