description: "This page is covered in densely-worded arcane or divine magical runes.\
  \ It contains the knowledge of a single arcane or divine spell (chosen by the creator\
  \ when the item is crafted). If the bearer is a spontaneous spellcaster and has\
  \ that spell on her class spell list, she may use her spell slots to cast that spell\
  \ as if it were one of her spells known. A page of spell knowledge is priced based\
  \ on the spell's cleric or sorcerer/wizard spell level, unless the spell doesn't\
  \ appear on either of those spell lists, in which case it is based on the highest\
  \ spell level as it appears on any other spell list. For example, a spell that is\
  \ on the 4th-level inquisitor list and the 2nd-level paladin list is priced as a\
  \ 4th-level spell."
