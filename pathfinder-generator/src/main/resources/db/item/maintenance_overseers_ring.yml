description: "This tarnished signet is marked as belonging to a specific city no smaller\
  \ than a large town, though it functions in any settlement of at least that size.\
  \ After spending 5 days in a settlement with the maintenance overseer's ring equipped,\
  \ its wearer learns a great deal about the schematics of any sewers, tunnels, basements,\
  \ and passages beneath the settlement. This knowledge is not necessarily absolute,\
  \ but allows the wearer to act as though trained in Knowledge (dungeoneering) when\
  \ answering questions about the settlement's underground with a +5 bonus on all\
  \ such checks.\nA maintenance overseer's ring also grants the wearer an automatic\
  \ Perception check to notice secret doors within 10 feet in any area beneath street\
  \ level of a city to which the ring is attuned. A wearer who already receives a\
  \ Perception check to perceive a secret door (such as a dwarf using stonecunning)\
  \ rolls her Perception check twice and takes the better result."
