description: "Five faceted sapphires decorate this ornate headband. The headband protects\
  \ the wearer from effects that would damage his mental capacity. After wearing the\
  \ headband for 24 hours, the wearer gains five temporary ability points. These points\
  \ do not add to the wearer's ability scores and do not grant a bonus to any roll.\
  \ Any damage or drain to a mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma)\
  \ taken by the wearer is subtracted from these points first. Damage or drain in\
  \ excess of the wearer's temporary ability points is applied to his current ability\
  \ scores as normal. The wearer immediately loses all temporary ability points upon\
  \ removing the headband.\nIn addition, the headband grants the wearer a +2 enhancement\
  \ bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Treat this as a temporary ability\
  \ bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is worn. It also grants skill ranks\
  \ as a headband of vast intelligence +2.\nTemporary ability points that are lost\
  \ to ability damage return after 24 hours. Ability points lost to ability drain\
  \ are lost permanently."
