description: "A formula book has 100 pages of parchment, and each alchemical extract\
  \ formula takes up one page per extract level. A newly purchased formula book contains\
  \ no extract formulas. An alchemist character begins play with a formula book containing\
  \ the extract formulae he knows (Advanced Player's Guide 32). This is the alchemist\
  \ equivalent of a spellbook for wizards (a spellbook and a formula book are essentially\
  \ the same item)."
