description: "Once per day as a standard action, the bearer of this +1 thundering\
  \ naginata (Ultimate Combat 133) can strike the blade against the ground, causing\
  \ it to ring with a deafening clangor that functions as the shout spell.\nStolen\
  \ by Munasukaru years ago, the thundering blade is the ancestral weapon of the Sugimatu\
  \ family, one of the five imperial families of Minkai. The thundering blade is imbued\
  \ with royal honor, and bestows one permanent negative level on any creature without\
  \ honor that attempts to wield it (such as oni, traitors, kinslayers, and the like).\
  \ The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when\
  \ the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any\
  \ way (including by restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded.\nA naginata\
  \ is a two-handed martial melee weapon that deals 1d8 points of slashing damage\
  \ and has a critical modifier of Ã—4. A naginata is a reach weapon. A naginata costs\
  \ 35 gp and weighs 9 lbs."
