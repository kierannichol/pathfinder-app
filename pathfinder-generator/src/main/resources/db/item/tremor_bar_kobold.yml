description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis mithral crowbar can coax stone to shift\
  \ aside with alarming ease. Five times per day, when a kobold wielder pries at a\
  \ section of stone and speaks a command word, the touched rock reshapes as if with\
  \ stone shape.\nAdditionally, once per day a kobold wielder can throw the crowbar\
  \ like a thrown splash weapon at a spot of earth, metal, or stone to unleash an\
  \ earthquake on the spot where the crowbar lands."
