description: "These small black feathers appear to have been stripped off an arrow\
  \ and crafted into a token. By braiding a shadow fletching into her hair, a character\
  \ can imbue herself with the magic of the Shadow Plane. Three times per day by touching\
  \ the fletching as a swift action in an area of dim light or darkness, the wearer\
  \ can enshroud her next ranged attack in shadowy extraplanar energy. As long as\
  \ the wearer makes this attack before the end of her turn, the target of the attack\
  \ is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC as if the attacker were invisible. This doesn't\
  \ affect creatures with low-light vision, darkvision, or any ability that allows\
  \ them to see invisible creatures."
