description: "This sturdy leather coat is reinforced with metal plates sewn into the\
  \ lining. An armored coat is more cumbersome than light armor but less effective\
  \ than most medium armors. The advantage of it is that a person can don it or remove\
  \ it as a move action (there is no \"don hastily\" option for an armored coat).\
  \ If worn over other armor, use the better AC bonus and worse value in all other\
  \ categories; an armored coat has no effect if worn with heavy armor. The only magic\
  \ effects that apply are those of armor, clothing, or items worn on top."
