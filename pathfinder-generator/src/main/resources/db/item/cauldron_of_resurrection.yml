description: "The mouth of this heavy, dark iron cauldron is shaped like a monstrous\
  \ maw and is large enough to accommodate a single Medium creature. When the cauldron\
  \ is filled with pure water and certain rare and sacred herbs, and a deceased creature\
  \ is placed inside it, the cauldron can restore the creature to life as if with\
  \ a raise dead or resurrection spell. The spell effect depends on the components\
  \ used: raise dead costs 5,000 gp worth of materials, while resurrection costs 10,000\
  \ gp worth of materials. The cauldron is usable once per day."
