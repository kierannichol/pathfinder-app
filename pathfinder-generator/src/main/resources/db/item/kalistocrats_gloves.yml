description: "Wealthy Kalistocrats wear these elegant, full-length white gloves. Twice\
  \ per day as a move action, the wearer of these gloves can repel an unwanted creature\
  \ for 1 minute or until the wearer touches another creature, whichever comes first.\
  \ Any creature attempting to attack or touch the wearer during this time must succeed\
  \ at a DC 11 Will save to do so (as the sanctuary spell).\nOnce per day, the wearer\
  \ can summon a surge of invisible force to knock back a single target within 40\
  \ feet. The wearer attempts a combat maneuver check to bull rush one creature or\
  \ object with a +5 bonus. This bull rush combat maneuver doesn't provoke an attack\
  \ of opportunity."
