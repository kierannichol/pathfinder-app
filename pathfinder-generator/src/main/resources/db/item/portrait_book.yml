description: "This 100-page book contains face drawings of male and female dwarves,\
  \ elves, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, halflings, and humans. By selecting an appropriate\
  \ drawing and adding hair, a beard, or other small features such as moles or scars,\
  \ even a poor artist can quickly create a reasonable likeness of a specific personâ€”\
  for example, an inquisitor making wanted posters of a half-elven witch."
