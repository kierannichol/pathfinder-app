description: "These gloves are made of goatskin reinforced with heavy iron strips.\
  \ They provide a sure, strengthened grip on large or awkwardly shaped items. When\
  \ the wearer wields an improvised melee weapon or inappropriately sized weapon,\
  \ reduce the penalty for doing so by 2 (minimum 0). The gloves don't change the\
  \ number of hands required to wield such a weapon."
