description: "This set of +2 studded leather glows eerily in darkness. Tinted using\
  \ rare dyes from the lost town of Mosswater in the River Kingdoms, this leather\
  \ suit gives its wearer a ghostly appearance in areas of dim light or darker. While\
  \ in such areas, the wearer gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks to pretend\
  \ to be undead.\nOn command, the armor makes its wearer ethereal (as the ethereal\
  \ jaunt spell). The effect is dismissible. The armor can be used in this manner\
  \ for a total of up to 10 rounds per day. This duration doesn't need to be continuous,\
  \ but must be used in 1-round increments."
