name: "Scroll of Loathsome Veil"
description: "This spell creates a transparent veil of shifting, multicolored strands\
  \ of light that form into endlessly varied and alien patterns. One side of the veil,\
  \ chosen by you at the time of casting, is harmless. The other side twists and turns\
  \ into impossible shapes, affecting any creature with 60 feet who views the veil.\
  \ The veil affects a maximum of 24 Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with the fewest\
  \ HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to\
  \ the spell are affected first. The effect is according to the creature's HD."
