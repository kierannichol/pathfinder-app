description: "This is a freestanding rack with several hooks for holding decoratively\
  \ arranged hunting trophies. A creature with the Grisly Ornament feat (see page\
  \ 24) can hang one ornament from a display stand, causing it to emanate a fear effect\
  \ that affects all creatures of that creature's specific variety within 30 feet\
  \ (DC 15 Will negates). This imposes a –1 penalty (–2 if the trophy creature's CR\
  \ was 8 or higher) to the same statistic the ornament would otherwise enhance, but\
  \ the ornament lasts for only 24 hours before decaying. Setting up a stand is a\
  \ full-round action, while hanging an ornament from one is a move action."
