  \ a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A hand crossbow fires standard\
  \ crossbow bolts, like those used by light and heavy crossbows.\nYou can shoot,\
  \ but not load, a hand crossbow with one hand at no penalty. You can shoot a hand\
  \ crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking\
  \ with two light weapons."
