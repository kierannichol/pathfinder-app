description: "This eyewear consists of two thick, gold-rimmed glass lenses encased\
  \ in a leather band. When worn over the eyes, a pair of discerning goggles allows\
  \ you to determine creatures' alignments with a single look. Good creatures appear\
  \ to faintly glow blue and evil creatures to faintly glow red. Neutral-aligned creatures\
  \ appear normal, as do creatures under the effect of an undetectable alignment spell\
  \ or similar effect. These goggles function only during times when you normally\
  \ would possess sight; for example, they do not work in darkness unless you possess\
  \ darkvision."
