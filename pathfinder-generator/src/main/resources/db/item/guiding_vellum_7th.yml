description: "Fashioned from soft yet still quite durable lambskin, this piece of\
  \ parchment gives a faithful divine spellcaster of a specific religion a hint about\
  \ what spell may be useful for that day. Each day, when the owner prepares spells\
  \ in the presence of the guiding vellum, the name of one specific divine spell which\
  \ the owner already has the ability to cast appears on its surface. This represents\
  \ a spell which should prove useful for the tasks in the next 24 hours. Each guiding\
  \ vellum is associated with one level of divine spells and only shows a spell of\
  \ that level. For example, if a cleric caster has a 3rd-level vellum and the GM\
  \ expects the character to face invisible opponents later that day, the vellum shows\
  \ the name \"invisibility purge\" (a 3rdlevel cleric spell); if the opponents are\
  \ using poison and the cleric has a 2nd-level vellum, it would show the name \"\
  delay poison.\"\nA caster can only use one vellum of a particular spell level each\
  \ day (using two 1st-level vellums gives the same result), but using vellums of\
  \ different spell levels works normally. Each vellum works only once per day. A\
  \ guiding vellum normally does not work for a character not of the item's specific\
  \ religion; some religions add additional magic so a vellum used by a hostile or\
  \ rival faith provides misleading spell suggestions."
