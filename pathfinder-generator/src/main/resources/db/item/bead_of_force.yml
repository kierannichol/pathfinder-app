description: "This small black sphere appears to be a lusterless pearl. A bead of\
  \ force can be thrown up to 60 feet with no range penalties. Upon sharp impact,\
  \ the bead explodes, sending forth a burst that deals 5d6 points of force damage\
  \ to all creatures within a 10-foot radius.\nOnce thrown, a bead of force functions\
  \ like a resilient sphere spell (Reflex DC 16 negates) with a radius of 10 feet\
  \ and a duration of 10 minutes. A globe of shimmering force encloses the targeted\
  \ creature, provided the latter is small enough to fit within the diameter of the\
  \ sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere is\
  \ not subject to damage of any sort except from a rod of cancellation, a rod of\
  \ negation, disintegrate, or a targeted dispel magic spell. These effects destroy\
  \ the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside\
  \ or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The subject may struggle, but\
  \ the globe cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles\
  \ of those within. The explosion completely consumes the bead, making this a one-use\
  \ item."
