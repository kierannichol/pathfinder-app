name: "Scroll of Riding Possession"
description: "You stealthily project your soul into the host's body as an observer,\
  \ with limited ability to influence the target. This functions as possession, except\
  \ the host is still in full control of its body and is unaware you are possessing\
  \ it. You can't communicate with the host directly, but you can cast mind-affecting\
  \ spells or riding possession on the host as long as you can cast these spells as\
  \ purely mental actions. Even if the spell you cast would normally affect more than\
  \ one target or an area, it can affect only the host. If the host succeeds at a\
  \ saving throw against a spell that you cast in this way, it immediately becomes\
  \ aware that it is possessed, and if it was already aware, it receives another saving\
  \ throw against riding possession. Protection from evil and similar effects don't\
  \ expel you from the host, but they do prevent you from casting further spells from\
  \ within your host until their durations expire."
