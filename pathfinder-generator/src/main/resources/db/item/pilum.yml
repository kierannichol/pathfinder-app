description: "The tip of this heavy javelin is designed to break off and embed itself\
  \ into a shield once it hits. Like ammunition, a thrown pilum that hits its target\
  \ is destroyed. If you hit a shieldbearing opponent with a pilum, he loses the AC\
  \ bonuses from that shield until he takes a standard action to pry the remnants\
  \ of the pilum from his shield."
