description: "A popular export from the Forest of Oils—a field of massive oil bubbles\
  \ on the Elemental Plane of Water—aquemir is a transparent substance extracted from\
  \ the skins of autonomous oil orbs and refined into a useful alchemical reagent.\
  \ As a standard action, aquemir can be mixed with an alchemical remedy, extract,\
  \ or potion to delay the start of its effects by 2 minutes when it is imbibed. Administering\
  \ a potion or extract that's properly infused with aquemir requires 1 dose of aquemir\
  \ per spell level to function in this way, whereas an alchemical remedy only requires\
  \ 1 dose. If not enough aquemir is mixed with a potion or extract, the potion or\
  \ extract's effects are not delayed at all. A creature can internally store only\
  \ one substance that uses aquemir; further attempts waste all imbibed substances\
  \ (and immediately render inert all potions, extracts, alchemical remedies, and\
  \ so on) and cause the creature to become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. Crafting this\
  \ item requires a successful DC 30 Craft (alchemy) check."
