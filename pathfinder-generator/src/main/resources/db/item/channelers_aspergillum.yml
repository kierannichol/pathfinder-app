description: "This +1 battle aspergillum has additional powers when filled with holy\
  \ water or unholy water (filling it requires a move action). By swinging a filled\
  \ channeler's aspergillum in an arc, the wielder affects up to nine creatures in\
  \ a 30-foot cone as with mass cure light wounds (if the aspergillum is filled with\
  \ holy water) or mass inflict light wounds (if the aspergillum is filled with unholy\
  \ water). This action expends the holy or unholy water within.\nIf the wielder has\
  \ the channel energy ability, she can also use a channeler's aspergillum to increase\
  \ her effective cleric level by 2 for the purpose of channeling energy. Each time\
  \ the wielder uses the channeler's aspergillum in this way, the holy water (for\
  \ channeled positive energy) or unholy water (for channeled negative energy) stored\
  \ in the aspergillum is expended.\nRegardless of which of these ways the channeler's\
  \ aspergillum is used, it can only be filled with holy or unholy water up to three\
  \ times per day. A channeler's aspergillum can hold only one flask's worth of holy\
  \ or unholy water at a time."
