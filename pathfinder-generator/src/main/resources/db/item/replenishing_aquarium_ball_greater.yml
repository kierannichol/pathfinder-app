description: "Replenishing aquarium balls act as standard aquarium balls (see page\
  \ 20), but are endowed with magical effects beneficial to the creature held within.\
  \ The power of the magic depends on the kind of replenishing aquarium ball.\nLesser:\
  \ The ball continually refreshes itself with clean water, allowing a creature within\
  \ to live as long as it has food.\nStandard: The ball continually refreshes itself\
  \ with clean water and fresh food.\nGreater: The ball continually refreshes itself\
  \ with clean water and fresh food. In addition, a greater replenishing aquarium\
  \ ball is magically enhanced so that the glass is as hard as stone (hardness 8,\
  \ 15 hp) without increasing its weight."
