description: "The Kalistocracy maintains harsh strictures against physical contact\
  \ with other creatures, but in the thick of battle or by the winds of fate, sometimes\
  \ contact cannot be avoided. To alleviate the soul taint associated with such contact,\
  \ the wealthiest Kalistocrats employ magically imbued bathing additives to remove\
  \ the uncleanliness of outside contact. A single bounteous bath suffusion can be\
  \ used to fill a bath with enough water for a single Medium or Large creature. A\
  \ living creature that spends 20 minutes in such a treated bath receives the benefits\
  \ of both neutralize poison (only the option to neutralize poison affecting the\
  \ suffusion's user) and remove disease. The bathing creature also gains a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus on saving throws against diseases and poisons for the next 24 hours."
