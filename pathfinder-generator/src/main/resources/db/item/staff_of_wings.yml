description: "Angels crafted the first staff of wings to assist their mortal allies\
  \ during a fiendish invasion onto the Material Plane. Copies have since been made\
  \ by secular crafters. A staff of wings is made of light birch and topped with a\
  \ carved pair of angelic wings made out of precious stone. This staff produces flight\
  \ effects, and the wielder gains translucent, illusory wings upon casting them.\
  \ Depending on the alignment and chosen patron of the creator, these wings may appear\
  \ draconic, feathery, or prismatic, or may have other celestial features. The staff\
  \ allows the use of the following spells:"
