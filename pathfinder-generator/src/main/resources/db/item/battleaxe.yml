description: "The handle of this axe is long enough that you can wield it one-handed\
  \ or two-handed. The head may have one blade or two, with blade shapes ranging from\
  \ half-moons to squared edges like narrower versions of woodcutting axes. The wooden\
  \ haft may be protected and strengthened with metal bands called langets."
