description: "One side of this 8-foot-long scarf is reinforced with chain links and\
  \ metal plates. While not enough to provide a benefit to Armor Class, these versatile\
  \ scarves can be used like a length of chain to climb short distances or bind an\
  \ enemy. A reinforced scarf has hardness 10 and 4 hit points. It can be burst with\
  \ a DC 24 Strength check."
