description: "Weathered carvings of constellations, suns, and planets cover the surface\
  \ of this ancient, melon-sized stone sphere.\nThis polished granite orb has more\
  \ hidden layers than any other documented lorestone. Its cosmological layer emphasizes\
  \ the moon over the sun and stars. Deeper layers present biologies of forest animals,\
  \ maps of secret tunnels beneath the Verduran Forest, lore of lycanthropes and other\
  \ shapechangers, and rituals designed to force a creature's inner beast to the surface.\
  \ A harmonized possessor (DC 40) can use moonstruck (DC 16) at will. The stone is\
  \ currently held by Brackett, Venture-Captain of the Pathfinder Lodge in Almas,\
  \ but the Pathfinder Society has not yet unlocked the stone's deepest knowledge."
