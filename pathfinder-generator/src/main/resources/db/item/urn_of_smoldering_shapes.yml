description: "This stone urn is decorated with carvings of vaguely humanoid creatures,\
  \ and contains ash and chunks of coal. While the lid is removed, faint weeping and\
  \ cries of anguish echo from within the urn.\nAs a standard action, a creature holding\
  \ the urn can grab some ash from the urn and toss it at an unoccupied space within\
  \ 30 feet. The ash scatters in the air, but the particles quickly ignite, grow into\
  \ smoldering embers, and gain momentum, coalescing in the target space as a vaguely\
  \ humanoid shape. The urn produces 7 doses of ash per day. Throwing a pinch of ash\
  \ uses 1 dose and creates a Small shape (AC 6, 10 hp) that is reminiscent of a cluster\
  \ of cowering human children. The Small shape doesn't provide cover, but the square\
  \ counts as difficult terrain. Throwing a small handful of ash uses 2 doses and\
  \ creates a Medium shape (AC 5, 15 hp) that resembles a cluster of crestfallen adult\
  \ humans. The Medium shape provides cover and prevents passage through the square.\
  \ Throwing a large handful of ash uses 4 doses and creates a Large shape (AC 4,\
  \ 25 hp) that resembles a sobbing angel. The Large shape provides cover and prevents\
  \ passage through a 10-foot-square area.\nIf the smoldering shape is reduced to\
  \ 0 hit points or fewer, it explodes, dealing fire damage in a 10-foot-radius spread\
  \ depending on the size: 2d6 points for Small, 4d6 points for Medium, or 8d6 points\
  \ for Large. Any creature in the area that succeeds at a DC 16 Reflex save takes\
  \ half the normal damage. For 1 round, the area of the explosion is filled with\
  \ dark, acrid smoke (as per obscuring mist). The smoldering shapes are immune to\
  \ fire and cold, but if a smoldering shape would be dealt any amount of cold damage,\
  \ the shape becomes inert and can no longer explode."
