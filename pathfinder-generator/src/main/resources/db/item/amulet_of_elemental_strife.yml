description: "This amulet shines brightly when brought within 60 feet of an outsider\
  \ with the elemental subtype, shedding light as a torch. The amulet glows a different\
  \ color depending on the subtype of the elemental or elementals present (white for\
  \ air, yellow for earth, red for fire, and blue for water). If more than one subtype\
  \ is present, the gem flickers back and forth between the appropriate colors.\n\
  The wearer gains resistance 5 against a single energy type determined by the subtype\
  \ of the closest elemental present (air grants electricity resistance, earth grants\
  \ acid resistance, fire grants fire resistance, and water grants cold resistance).\
  \ If the closest elemental possesses multiple subtypes, the wearer may choose which\
  \ type of resistance she gains. This energy resistance only applies against attacks\
  \ from elementals. The amulet also allows any attacks made by the wearer to bypass\
  \ the damage reduction of such creatures."
