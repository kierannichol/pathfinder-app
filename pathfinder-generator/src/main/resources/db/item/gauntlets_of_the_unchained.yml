description: "Said to have first been forged centuries ago by a human master blacksmith\
  \ who escaped from drow slavers in Sekamina, these shimmering silver gauntlets remind\
  \ the wearer that she is always shackled to the deeds of her past, but remains unfettered\
  \ with the promise of a freer future. The wearer of a pair of gauntlets of the unchained\
  \ may only wield weapons two-handedâ€”the magical chain that binds the gauntlets makes\
  \ it effectively impossible to wield or hold more than one item at a time.\nBy tapping\
  \ the gauntlets' manacles together as a swift action, the wearer can cause damage\
  \ dealt by her wielded weapon to become lawful-aligned and thus overcome the corresponding\
  \ damage reduction. This effect lasts for up to 7 rounds per day. This duration\
  \ need not be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-round increments. By breaking\
  \ the magical chain that connects the gauntlets as a standard action, the wearer\
  \ can cause her wielded weapon to gain the anarchic weapon special ability for 7\
  \ minutes. Once broken, the chain between the gauntlets is shattered forever, and\
  \ the gauntlets become nonmagical."
