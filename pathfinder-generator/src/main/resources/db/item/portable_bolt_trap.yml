description: "This specialized heavy crossbow is hooked to a trip line that can be\
  \ strung across any opening up to 10 feet wide, much like that of a bell tripwire\
  \ trap (see above). When the line is tripped, the crossbow fires its bolt toward\
  \ the space where the line was tripped. The crossbow must have line of effect to\
  \ the target space for the trap to work. Placing a portable bolt trap requires 10\
  \ minutes of effort to properly calibrate the shot and conceal the line and crossbow.\
  \ The trap can be placed in as little as 1 minute, but doing so imposes a â€“4 penalty\
  \ on the crossbow's attack roll, and the DC of the Perception check to notice the\
  \ trap is reduced by 4. The trap has the following statistics."
