  \ teeth. The wielder gains a +4 competence bonus on Profession (sailor) and Swim\
  \ checks as long as it is held in hand. Once per day, the wielder can utter a command\
  \ word to create one of the following effects: vortex (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's\
  \ Guide 254) or control weather.\nIf the wielder uses a polymorph or supernatural\
  \ effect to take the shape of a creature with a natural bite attack, the trident\
  \ of the storm captain vanishes and the wielder's bite attack gains a +4 enhancement\
  \ bonus until the shapechanging effect ends and the trident reappears. The wielder\
  \ cannot use the trident's other abilities while shapechanged."
