description: "When Vildeis reached for a tool to permanently put an end to her sight\
  \ so she no longer had to bear witness to the evils of the multiverse, her hand\
  \ fell upon Cicatrix. Although even she doesn't know who or what placed the black\
  \ blade within her grasp, in the ages since it put out its mistress's eyes, the\
  \ blade has rarely left Vildeis's hand. Cicatrix is a +5 holy returning vicious\
  \ dagger that counts as both cold iron and silver. Any time Cicatrix deals damage,\
  \ the creature struck must attempt a DC 25 Will save. If it fails, the wielder instantly\
  \ knows that creature's alignment and can listen to its surface thoughts, as detect\
  \ thoughts. If the wielder chooses, she can then force the creature to attempt a\
  \ DC 25 Will save; if the creature fails its saving throw, the wielder may blind\
  \ the target (as blindness/deafness) or inscribe a martyr's mark upon the target.\
  \ Inscribing a martyr's mark means the wielder takes the damage from the attack\
  \ instead of the target; the martyr's mark is triggered like a mark of justice,\
  \ but activates a geas/quest of the wielder's choosing instead of bestow curse.\
  \ A martyr's mark can be removed as if it were a mark of justice."
destruction: "Cicatrix is destroyed if an evil outsider of CR 20 or higher uses the\
  \ blade to sacrifice itself to save a good outsider's life."
