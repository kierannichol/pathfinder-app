description: "The head of this +1 warhammer is made from magically treated stone that\
  \ is as hard as metal. A shatterstone hammer deals double damage against unattended\
  \ earthen and stone objects, and gains the benefit of being a bane weapon when used\
  \ against creatures of the earth subtype and constructs made of clay or stone. Once\
  \ per day on a successful attack made with the hammer, the wielder can cause the\
  \ target to be slowed (as the slow spell). A DC 14 Will save negates this effect."
