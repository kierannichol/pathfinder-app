description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis cast-iron brand glows hot with a command\
  \ word, although the heat does not affect objects. It can be used to strike a creature\
  \ with a touch attack. If it hits, it violently marks the victim as per greater\
  \ brand (DC 16), except that the brand glows in reaction to the visible master's\
  \ brand rather than to holy symbols. Once the brand has struck a target, it cools\
  \ and cannot be used again that day.\nIf the wielder of the brand is a hobgoblin,\
  \ once per day he can speak a second command word to issue a command (DC 13), as\
  \ per the spell, to anyone marked by the brand."
