description: "This bright +1 starknife is engraved with a beautiful moth icon. When\
  \ wielded, it leaves a trail of harmless starry motes that shed light as a candle\
  \ in any squares the wielder occupies or moves through. These motes last for 1 round\
  \ before fading away. Once per day, the wielder can speak a command word to use\
  \ jump (with a +20 bonus), but this effect immediately ends if the wielder loses\
  \ its grasp on the weapon. Additionally, once per day the wielder can use it to\
  \ fire a blast of motes, with the same effect as color spray."
