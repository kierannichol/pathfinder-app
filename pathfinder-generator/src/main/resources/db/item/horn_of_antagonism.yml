description: "Carved from the bone of some giant beast, this large horn emits an eerie,\
  \ heart-lurching moan when sounded. A creature with the favored enemy class feature\
  \ may blow the horn as a standard action to daze one type of favored enemy within\
  \ 90 feet for 1d4 rounds (DC 13 Will save negates). Creatures suffer a penalty on\
  \ this save equal to the ranger's favored enemy bonus against that type of creature.\
  \ This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect; creatures that cannot hear the horn are\
  \ immune to its magic. The horn's magic works once per day."
