description: "A salt lamp appears as nothing more than a fist-sized chunk of pink,\
  \ white, or green quartz-like rock. In reality, the \"rock\" is compressed salt\
  \ mined from areas infused with strange magical radiations. When you speak the command\
  \ word, the salt lamp lights up with a glow equivalent to a torch. The salt lamp\
  \ becomes warm, though never uncomfortably hot, to the touch. The salt lamp glows\
  \ for 1d4+1 hours before its light fades out and it becomes ordinary salt.\nAt any\
  \ time while the salt lamp glows, you can hurl it at the floor, causing it to explode\
  \ into a cloud of glimmering salt crystals that form a 10-foot radius cloud. The\
  \ cloud continues to shed light as a torch, as well as visibly outlining invisible\
  \ objects within the cloud. Shining salt particles cover anyone within the area\
  \ and adhere and glow for the remainder of the lamp's duration. The salt particles\
  \ cannot be removed by normal means, but they can be dispelled. Any creature within\
  \ the cloud, or covered with the salt particles, takes a â€“40 penalty on Hide checks."
