description: "This heavy whip features Pharasmin imagery on its silver handle. The\
  \ Lady's spiral is a +1 ghost touch undead-bane whip that deals lethal damage to\
  \ undead creatures regardless of their armor bonus or natural armor bonus.\nIn addition,\
  \ the handle of a Lady's spiral can be wielded as a +1 silver stake. This stake\
  \ has the same statistics and properties as a wooden stake, except it is made of\
  \ silver and thus overcomes DR/silver. Though it's effectively two weapons in one,\
  \ a Lady's spiral is not a double weapon and cannot be wielded as one."
