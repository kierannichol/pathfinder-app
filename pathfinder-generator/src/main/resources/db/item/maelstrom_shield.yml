description: "The device of this +1 bashing heavy steel shield features a magical\
  \ image of the trackless seas, complete with rolling waves and crashing whitecaps.\
  \ When used to make a shield bash attack, the shield's wielder can make a trip attack\
  \ as a free action against the same target without provoking an attack of opportunity\
  \ from the creature being tripped. On command, the wielder can make the shield produce\
  \ a gallon of fresh drinkable water. Once per day on command, the wielder can use\
  \ the maelstrom shield to emit a stream of water as the hydraulic push spell."
