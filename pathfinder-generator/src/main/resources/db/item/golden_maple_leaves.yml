description: "These potent additives can only be culled from a rare maple tree known\
  \ to grow exclusively in urban areas. These small, elaborately twisting trees are\
  \ extremely slow to grow and mature—the leaves reach maturity only once every 3\
  \ years—and they are almost always grown and cultivated by half-elves. Additionally,\
  \ half-elves are keenly aware of the effort put into the leaves' growth and normally\
  \ only sell the products of their labors to others of their kind. When the golden\
  \ maple's delicate, five-pointed leaves finally take on their namesake's color,\
  \ they can be cut, dried, and then ground into a fine powder, a process that requires\
  \ a DC 15 Knowledge (nature) or Profession (herbalist) check. When used in conjunction\
  \ with the Craft (alchemy) skill to create special substances and items like alchemical\
  \ grease or tanglefoot bags, golden maple leaves reduce the Craft DC by 5 and add\
  \ +1 to the DC of any save required by the alchemical item. A single dose of golden\
  \ maple leaf powder is sufficient to augment the crafting of three alchemical items."
