description: "This tarnished ring looks like a fiery halo set ablaze in evil-looking\
  \ fire. The flames are harmless and shed light as an everburning torch; the wearer\
  \ can suppress or activate these flames as a swift action. A hellfire halo functions\
  \ as a headband of mental superiority +2 that grants ranks in Intimidate. If the\
  \ flames of the halo are burning, the wearer becomes immune to the effects of an\
  \ archon's aura of menace and ignores the protective aura of any angel he attacks.\
  \ In addition, up to three times per day as he strikes any creature under the effects\
  \ of a holy aura, the wearer can attempt to dispel that effect as if casting a quickened\
  \ dispel magic (CL 16th). The first time each day that the wearer is attacked by\
  \ a creature using smite good, that smite effect immediately ends and is wasted,\
  \ and the creature making the attack must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be staggered\
  \ for 1d4 rounds."
destruction: "A hellfire halo can be destroyed by immersing it in holy water and then\
  \ casting dispel evil on it."
