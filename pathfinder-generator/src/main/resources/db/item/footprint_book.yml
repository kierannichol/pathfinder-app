description: "This 50-page tome contains accurate drawings of common animal, humanoid,\
  \ and monster tracks, as well as notes on stride length, tread depth, and similarly\
  \ useful information. The book gives you a +2 circumstance bonus to identify a creature\
  \ by its tracks, though the use of shoes makes identifying many humanoids difficult\
  \ or impossible. Though the book can't help you identify unique individuals, it\
  \ can help you tell an ogre's footprint from a troll's footprint, or an elf's track\
  \ from an orc's. Books sold in different areas may have different footprints, depending\
  \ on what creatures are common to that location."
