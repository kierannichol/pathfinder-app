description: "This thick, intricate lens piece is covered in alchemical wiring. A\
  \ small aperture on the side of the lens connects to a mundane glass vial, such\
  \ as a vial used for potions. When slid onto the viewer's end of a telescope, a\
  \ harvesting lens allows the telescope's user to harness the power of starlight\
  \ or the void as she chooses.\nWhen a vial is fitted to the lens and the telescope\
  \ is aimed at a distant star in the night sky, the vial slowly fills with collected\
  \ starlight. After 8 hours, the vial is filled with silvery liquid cosmic light.\
  \ One filled and removed, the vial of starlight sheds light for 8 hours, as if it\
  \ were affected by light. During this time, the vial can be thrown as a splash weapon\
  \ with a range increment of 10 feet. On a direct hit, the vial shatters in a blinding\
  \ flash of light, affecting the target as a blinding ray (Fortitude DC 13 negates).\
  \ If the vial misses, it breaks with no effect. Either way, a new empty vial must\
  \ be attached to the harvesting lens to use it again.\nAlternatively, a harvesting\
  \ lens attached to a telescope can be pointed toward an empty, dark space between\
  \ the stars. After 8 hours, the vial becomes full of thick, inky dark matter. For\
  \ 8 hours after the vial of dark matter is filled and removed, an inky black haze\
  \ surrounds any creature holding it, as the protective penumbra spell. A vial of\
  \ dark matter can also be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10\
  \ feet. Upon striking any solid body or surface, the vial breaks and releases a\
  \ 10-footradius emanation of magical darkness that lasts for 3 minutes. This effect\
  \ otherwise acts as darkness.\nOnly vials that have been filled for 8 hours produce\
  \ the above effects. Partially filled vials do not work.\nOnly one magical lens\
  \ (such as this or a lens of starlight) can be attached to a telescope at a time."
