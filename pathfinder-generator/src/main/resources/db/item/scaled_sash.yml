description: "Glittering with every movement, this sash is associated with a specific\
  \ type of chromatic dragon. Three times per day, the wearer may convert all the\
  \ damage dealt by a single attack with a melee, ranged, or natural weapon into the\
  \ matching dragon's breath weapon damage type. The amount of damage dealt remains\
  \ unaffected. The sash may be used after the attack's results are known, but must\
  \ be declared before damage has been rolled. Attacks dealing any type of energy\
  \ damage cannot be converted in this manner unless the energy type of the original\
  \ damage is the same as that granted by the scaled sash. If the original attack\
  \ would be affected by damage reduction, the converted damage is reduced as if it\
  \ did not bypass the damage reduction, even if the target has no special defenses\
  \ against the converted energy type.\nFor example, an archer wearing a black scaled\
  \ sash makes a successful attack against a target with his longbow. Before rolling\
  \ damage on the hit, he opts to use his sash to convert the damage dealt to acid\
  \ damage. Damage is rolled normally, but deals acid damage instead of piercing damage.\
  \ This includes damage dealt from additional effects such as sneak attack, favored\
  \ enemy, and the bane special weapon property."
