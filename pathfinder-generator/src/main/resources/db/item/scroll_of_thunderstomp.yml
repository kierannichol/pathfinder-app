name: "Scroll of Thunderstomp"
description: "You stomp your foot or strike your weapon against the ground or floor,\
  \ creating a ripple of power that you can use to trip a creature. Attempt the combat\
  \ maneuver check to trip the target, but instead of your base attack bonus you can\
  \ use your caster level, and instead of your Strength modifier you can use your\
  \ spellcasting ability score modifier (Intelligence for magi and wizards; Wisdom\
  \ for druids and rangers; Charisma for bloodragers and sorcerers). This does not\
  \ provoke an attack of opportunity. This spell has no effect if you cannot reach\
  \ the ground or floor, or if your target is not in contact with the ground or floor."
