description: "This long, wooden case contains a complicated framework of brass armatures,\
  \ balance weights, a foldable mat, and purplehued lenses of various shapes and sizes.\
  \ When assembled, the case becomes a small bed over which looms a complicated, slowly\
  \ revolving array of lenses that filter sunlight onto the mat below. Only usable\
  \ on bright, sunny days, the solarium has enough room for one Medium or two Small\
  \ creatures to recline beneath its lens array and bask in the healing rays of the\
  \ filtered natural light. The solarium can be used in conjunction with the long-term\
  \ care use of the Heal skill. Subjects who bask in the filtered light for an 8-hour\
  \ rest period recover 1 additional hit point per level or 1 additional ability score\
  \ point if their caregivers succeed at the required Heal check."
