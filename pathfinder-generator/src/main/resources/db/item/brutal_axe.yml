description: "The haft of this +1 adamantine greataxe is carved from the limb of a\
  \ treant slain by fire. While wielding this axe, a creature is considered to have\
  \ the Improved Sunder feat. It also deals an additional 1d12 points of damage when\
  \ used to sunder. If the wielder already has Improved Sunder, the axe grants Greater\
  \ Sunder; and if the wielder already has Greater Sunder, it instead provides a further\
  \ +2 bonus on sunder combat maneuver checks.\nAs an immediate action after making\
  \ a successful attack with the axe, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power\
  \ to make a combat maneuver check to sunder a single item being used by the creature\
  \ he just successfully attacked. This sunder attempt deals double damage and uses\
  \ the wielder's full base attack bonus. If the item is destroyed by this sunder\
  \ attempt, no excess damage is applied to the item's wielder or other items."
