description: "Once per day as a standard action, the holder of this ordinary-looking\
  \ leather-bound book can erase the writing contained within it. However, the holder\
  \ cannot erase any writing that required a material component cost, such as a symbol\
  \ spell or a sepia snake sigil, with this standard action. An erasing book can be\
  \ used as a spellbook or a formula bookâ€”spells written in the book have a material\
  \ component cost and are immune to the book's erasing effect. Erasing the book also\
  \ removes smudges, stains, and minor water damage, but it doesn't recover text lost\
  \ to serious damage."
