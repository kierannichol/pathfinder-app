name: "Oil of Deeper Darkness"
description: "This spell functions as darkness, except that objects radiate darkness\
  \ in a 60-foot radius and the light level is lowered by two steps. Bright light\
  \ becomes dim light and normal light becomes darkness. Areas of dim light and darkness\
  \ become supernaturally dark. This functions like darkness, but even creatures with\
  \ darkvision cannot see within the spell's confines."
