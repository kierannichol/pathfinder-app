description: "Forged from adamantine and silver, this heavy lock's shank is large\
  \ enough to wrap around a humanoid ankle, magically resizing itself to fit any wearer.\
  \ When the lock is placed on a creature, it immediately suppresses all magical polymorph\
  \ effects or supernatural shapechanging effects (such as a lycanthrope's change\
  \ shape ability) affecting the wearer, returning her to her true form. The lock\
  \ of formbinding does not negate these effects, and creatures return to their altered\
  \ form if the lock is removed before the effect's duration expires. Creatures targeted\
  \ by a polymorph effect while wearing a lock of formbinding are affected for only\
  \ a single round before the lock returns them to their true form. A creature wearing\
  \ a lock of formbinding can likewise change its own shape, but it must succeed at\
  \ a DC 16 Will saving throw at the end of each round or revert to its true form;\
  \ the lock resizes to accommodate whatever new forms its wearer might temporarily\
  \ assume.\nAttaching the lock of formbinding is a full-round action that provokes\
  \ an attack of opportunity. Unwilling creatures must be unconscious, pinned, or\
  \ helpless before the lock can be attached. The lock has hardness 20 and 20 hit\
  \ points, and without the key, it can be removed only with a successful DC 30 Strength\
  \ check, a DC 37 Escape Artist check, or DC 30 Disable Device check."
