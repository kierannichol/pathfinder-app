description: "This cloak appears to be made of leather until the wearer enters salt\
  \ water. At that time, the cloak of the manta ray adheres to the individual, and\
  \ he appears nearly identical to a manta ray (as the beast shape II spell, except\
  \ that it allows only manta ray form). He gains a +3 natural armor bonus, the ability\
  \ to breathe underwater, and a swim speed of 60 feet, like a real manta ray.\nThe\
  \ cloak also allows the wearer to attack with a sting ray's tail spine, dealing\
  \ 1d6 points of damage. This attack can be used in addition to any other attack\
  \ the character has, using his highest melee attack bonus. The wearer can release\
  \ his arms from the cloak without sacrificing underwater movement if so desired."
