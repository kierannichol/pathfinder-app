description: "You create an unmoving, opaque sphere of force of any color you desire\
  \ around yourself. Half the sphere projects above the ground, and the lower hemisphere\
  \ passes through the ground. As many as nine other Medium creatures can fit into\
  \ the field with you; they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming\
  \ it. However, if you remove yourself from the hut, the spell ends."
