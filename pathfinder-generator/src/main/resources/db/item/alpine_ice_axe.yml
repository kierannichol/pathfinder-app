description: "This sturdy tool has a wooden haft topped with a curved pick head backed\
  \ with a sharp adze blade at one end and capped with an iron spike on the other.\
  \ When used as a climbing aid, an alpine ice axe grants a +2 circumstance bonus\
  \ on Climb checks to scale rock or ice walls. In addition, an alpine ice axe negates\
  \ any Climb DC modifiers for climbing a slippery surface. Three times per day as\
  \ a standard action, the wielder can strike an area of ice or snow with the ice\
  \ axe to instantly create a series of sturdy handholds in the ice covering a distance\
  \ of up to 40 feet. An ice wall with these handholds has a Climb DC of 15.\nAn alpine\
  \ ice axe is a tool, not a weapon, but it may be used as an improvised weapon with\
  \ the usual â€“4 penalty on attack rolls made with it. An alpine ice axe wielded as\
  \ a weapon functions either as a +1 light pick when striking with the pick spike\
  \ or as a +1 hand axe when striking with the adze blade. The ice axe uses the standard\
  \ threat range and critical modifier for those weapons. An alpine ice axe deals\
  \ double damage against inanimate ice or snow, and if used as a weapon against a\
  \ creature made mostly of ice (such as an ice elemental or ice golem), an alpine\
  \ ice axe bypasses that creature's damage reduction."
