description: "No record of where Kamaria found this potent artifact exists, although\
  \ many believe she discovered it while exploring a remote corner of the nightmare\
  \ realm of Leng. The Gem of Dreams can be used once per month to absorb the dreaming\
  \ mind of any sleeping creature it is in contact with—this ability must be activated\
  \ as a full-round action. The sleeping creature can resist this doom by making a\
  \ DC 20 Will save—with a success, he is afflicted by a nightmare spell (CL 20th)\
  \ but is otherwise unharmed. If he fails the save, his dreaming mind is stolen,\
  \ warped, and then siphoned back into his body in the space of an hour. If the victim\
  \ is awakened before this process completes, his body twists and transforms into\
  \ a creature known as a dream eater (see above), at which point only wish or miracle\
  \ (or the destruction of the Gem of Dreams) can restore him to his true form. At\
  \ the point the transformation occurs, the creature that activated the gem's power\
  \ ceases to age for a month. By using the gem every month (and creating more and\
  \ more dream eaters), a person can effectively become immortal in this manner. While\
  \ this is technically nothing more than a beneficial side effect, it is this power\
  \ that has generated the majority of the gem's legendary fame."
destruction: "The gem must absorb the dreams of a slumbering Spawn of Rovagug, whereupon\
  \ it shatters into dust and releases a particularly powerful animate dream (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Bestiary 2 29); the power of this animate dream is left to you, but it should\
  \ be advanced in Hit Dice to a point where its CR is equal to 3 points above the\
  \ party's average level. Needless to say, the animate dream immediately attacks—\
  if not slain, it reforms as a new Gem of Dreams after 24 hours."
