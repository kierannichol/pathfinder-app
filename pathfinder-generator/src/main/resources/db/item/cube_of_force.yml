description: "This device is just under an inch across and can be made of ivory, bone,\
  \ or any hard mineral. Typically, each of the cube's faces are polished smooth,\
  \ but sometimes they are etched with runes. The device enables its possessor to\
  \ put up a special cube made up of 6 individual wall of force spells, 10 feet on\
  \ a side around her person. This cubic screen moves with the character and is impervious\
  \ to the attack forms mentioned on the table below. The cube has 36 charges when\
  \ fully chargedâ€”charges used are automatically renewed each day. The possessor presses\
  \ one face of the cube to activate a particular type of screen or to deactivate\
  \ the device. Each effect costs a certain number of charges to maintain for every\
  \ minute (or portion of a minute) it is in operation. Also, when an effect is active,\
  \ the possessor's speed is limited to the maximum value given on the following table.\n\
  When the cube of force is active, attacks dealing more than 30 points of damage\
  \ to a wall drain 1 charge for every 10 points of damage beyond 30 that they deal.\
  \ The charge cost to maintain each of the cube's six walls is summarized below."
