description: "Legend tells that the first suits of empyreal armor were forged from\
  \ the battered, cast-off breastplates worn by solars in battle. These suits were\
  \ gifted to powerful mortal heroes and have since changed hands many times.\nEmpyreal\
  \ armor is made of steel forged so that it reflects a golden sheen in the sunlight.\
  \ This armor functions as a suit of +3 moderate fortification full plate. In addition,\
  \ three times per day, its wearer can activate a fire shield (warm shield only)\
  \ that lasts for 13 rounds. Any creature attacking the wearer with its body or a\
  \ handheld weapon while the fire shield effect is active deals normal damage but\
  \ takes 1d6+13 points of damage in return. Half this damage is fire damage, but\
  \ the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject\
  \ to energy resistance."
