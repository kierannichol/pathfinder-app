description: "This ornately etched censer has a small hidden compartment under the\
  \ heat source that can hold 1 dose of poison. When in use, the censer's heat source\
  \ indirectly heats the poison, causing it to mix with the burning incense and allow\
  \ the poison to permeate the air, filling a 20-foot radius centered on the censer.\
  \ The poison's type changes to inhaled, and it is effective for 5 minutes before\
  \ it is entirely burned off."
