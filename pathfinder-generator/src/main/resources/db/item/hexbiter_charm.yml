description: "This walrus-shaped charm is typically carved from ivory or bone. When\
  \ targeted by a witch's hex or an effect with the curse descriptor, the wearer can\
  \ activate this charm as an immediate action to gain a +3 resistance bonus on the\
  \ saving throw to resist the curse effect. If the wearer is affected by the curse\
  \ effect, he gains a +2 bonus on any subsequent saving throws to resist the effect\
  \ for up to 1 week, and he gains a +3 bonus on any caster level checks he attempts\
  \ to remove the effect (such as with remove curse) during this time.\nThis charm\
  \ can only be used once, after which the charm's magic is gone forever. A charm\
  \ occupies the wearer's shoulders or neck slot, though it can share that slot with\
  \ one other magic item (as a cloak pin or token hanging from a necklace, for example).\
  \ A character can never wear more than one charm at a time."
