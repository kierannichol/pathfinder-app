  \ and detailed rites specific to that faith. The cheap variety is a small, light\
  \ book with no illustrations, printed or written on thin paper, and with a cover\
  \ made of canvas or thin leather. A typical holy text for an experienced adventuring\
  \ priest is durable, with a leather cover, chapter illustrations, quality paper;\
  \ it costs 25 gp and weighs 2 pounds. The most expensive versions have detailed\
  \ illustrations, gilded initials and border decorations, covers made of fine leather,\
  \ wood, or even metal, and are often oversized and difficult to carry around."
