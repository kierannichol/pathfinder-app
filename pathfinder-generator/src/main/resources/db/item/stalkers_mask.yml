description: "Preserved sections harvested from several different human faces cover\
  \ this mask. When worn, the mask desaturates the wearer's color, making him appear\
  \ shadowy and granting a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks. Once per day as\
  \ a full-round action, the wearer can cause the mask's features to take on the appearance\
  \ of any creature of the wearer's basic size and shape within 60 feet that he observes,\
  \ allowing the wearer to adopt that creature's appearance for 1 hour. This grants\
  \ him a +10 bonus on Disguise checks made to appear as the creature. The mask also\
  \ grants the wearer a +1 bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls made against\
  \ the creature he is disguised as, as the mask builds upon the wearer's rage and\
  \ jealousy of the target's appearance."
