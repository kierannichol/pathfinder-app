  \ one or more bodies in a solar system in relation to the system's star with marks\
  \ or spheres on moving gears or arms. Anyone consulting an orrery gains a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus on Knowledge (geography) checks involving bodies it models and on Survival\
  \ checks to navigate the void of space. An orrery can be used in combination with\
  \ a sextant on a clear night to determine the time on any of the stellar bodies\
  \ it models. Any orrery can be used as a focus component for the augury spell in\
  \ place of that spell's normal focus.\nOrreries come in many shapes and sizes and\
  \ with a variety of functions in mind."
