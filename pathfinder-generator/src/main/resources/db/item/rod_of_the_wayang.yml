description: "This rod is lacquered jet black, covered with bright white runes, and\
  \ capped with crown of jagged smoky quartz. When the rod's wielder casts a spell\
  \ of the shadow subschool, she increases the DC of that spell's saving throw by\
  \ 1. Furthermore, once per day on command, wielder can treat positive and negative\
  \ energy effects as if she were an undead creature, taking damage from positive\
  \ energy and healing damage from negative energy. This ability lasts for 1 minute\
  \ unless dismissed as a free action."
