description: "A talisman of pure faith looks like a set of six of black and red hexagons\
  \ nested within each other. When worn about the neck, a talisman of pure faith physically\
  \ transforms into a holy symbol that matches the faith of the wearer, unless that\
  \ information is blocked via a magical effect. It can be utilized as a divine focus,\
  \ and doesn't take up a neck slot when worn in this manner. If worn by someone who\
  \ doesn't worship a single deity, it remains in its hexagonal shape and cannot be\
  \ used as a divine focus. As long as it is carried or worn, a talisman of pure faith\
  \ functions as a phylactery of faithfulness. In addition, while it is worn, the\
  \ talisman grants a +4 bonus on all concentration checks to cast spells impeded\
  \ by planar traits."
