description: "This +3 Large returning warhammer deals 2d6 points of damage on a successful\
  \ hit. In the hands of a wielder who wears a belt of giant strength and knows the\
  \ weapon is a hammer of thunderbolts (not just the +3 warhammer it appears to be),\
  \ it becomes a +5 Large giant-bane returning thundering warhammer with the following\
  \ two properties.\nFirst, when the bearer makes a successful thrown attack with\
  \ the hammer, the hammer emits a powerful clap of thunder, causing all creatures\
  \ within 90 feet to be stunned for 1 round (Fortitude DC 15 negates); the wielder\
  \ is not immune to this effect. Second, the hammer's range increment increases to\
  \ 30 feet."
destruction: "A hammer of thunderbolts is destroyed if heated in a fire giant's forge\
  \ and quenched in the blood of a good-aligned humanoid, which causes the iron of\
  \ the hammer to become so brittle it shatters the next time it is used to strike.\
  \ Only bathing it in a fire giant's blood can reverse the hammer's brittleness;\
  \ once the hammer is shattered, though, not even this can repair it. If it is bathed\
  \ in the blood of a fire giant king or queen, it temporarily gains two additional\
  \ powers for the next 9 days: the bearer gains resistance 30 against fire and sonic\
  \ damage, and gains immunity to the stunning effect of the hammer's clap of thunder."
