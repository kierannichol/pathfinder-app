description: "Prayers and engravings of celestial beings cover these golden bracers.\
  \ A paladin can expend one or more of her uses of smite evil into these bracers\
  \ as a standard action to call forth agathions, angels, or archons to aid her. This\
  \ acts as a summon monster spell of a spell level equal to the number of smite evil\
  \ uses the paladin expends. Outsiders summoned with the bracers must be from the\
  \ list detailed in the summon monster spell or from the expanded summon monster\
  \ list on pages 28â€“29."
