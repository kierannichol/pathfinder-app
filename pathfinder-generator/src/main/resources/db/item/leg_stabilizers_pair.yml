description: "These devices strap onto a character's legs in order to allow for easier\
  \ movement in low- or high-gravity environments. A character wearing leg stabilizers\
  \ can move and attempt Acrobatics checks in gravity between ×1 and ×3 as if in gravity\
  \ ×1. A character wearing them in gravity stronger than ×1/3 but weaker than ×1\
  \ gains a +10-foot circumstance bonus to his land speed. This device has no effect\
  \ on other actions. Attaching or removing leg stabilizers is a full-round action."
