name: "Scroll of Form of the Dragon III"
description: "This spell functions as form of the dragon II save that it also allows\
  \ you to take the form of a Huge chromatic or metallic dragon. You gain the following\
  \ abilities: a +10 size bonus to Strength, a +8 size bonus to Constitution, a +8\
  \ natural armor bonus, fly 120 feet (poor), blindsense 60 feet, darkvision 120 feet,\
  \ a breath weapon, DR 10/magic, frightful presence (DC equal to the DC for this\
  \ spell), and immunity to one element (of the same type form of the dragon I grants\
  \ resistance to). You also gain one bite (2d8), two claws (2d6), two wing attacks\
  \ (1d8), and one tail slap attack (2d6). You can use the breath weapon as often\
  \ as you like, but you must wait 1d4 rounds between uses. All breath weapons deal\
  \ 12d8 points of damage and allow a Reflex save for half damage. Line breath weapons\
  \ increase to 100-foot lines and cones increase to 50-foot cones."
