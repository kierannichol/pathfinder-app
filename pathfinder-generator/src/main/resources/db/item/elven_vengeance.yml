description: "This set of +2 elven chain grants its wearer a +4 resistance bonus on\
  \ saving throws against spells, spell-like abilities, and other effects created\
  \ by worshipers and minions of a specific demon lord, chosen when the armor is created.\
  \ Against such foes, the armor's enhancement bonus increases to +4. The first suit\
  \ of this armor was created quite recently by Perelir for her close friend Malindil\
  \ as part of the ranger's vengeful crusade against Abraxas; since then, many other\
  \ suits focused against other powerful demons (particularly the nascent demon lord\
  \ Treerazer) have been crafted."
