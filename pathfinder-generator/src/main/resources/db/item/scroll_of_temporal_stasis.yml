name: "Scroll of Temporal Stasis"
description: "You must succeed on a melee touch attack. You place the subject into\
  \ a state of suspended animation. For the creature, time ceases to flow, and its\
  \ condition becomes fixed. The creature does not grow older. Its body functions\
  \ virtually cease, and no force or effect can harm it. This state persists until\
  \ the magic is removed (such as by a successful dispel magic spell or a freedom\
  \ spell)."
