description: "This vicious-looking +2 battleaxe grants its wielder the Great Cleave\
  \ feat. But when using this feat, the wielder makes an additional attack against\
  \ a random adjacent creature instead of choosing which creature to attack. When\
  \ determining which creature is attacked, the wielder always counts himself as a\
  \ possible target, even if he is not adjacent to the target. The wielder of a biting\
  \ battleaxe must always uses it as his primary weapon and must use Great Cleave\
  \ at every opportunity until subject to a remove curse spell or similar effect."
