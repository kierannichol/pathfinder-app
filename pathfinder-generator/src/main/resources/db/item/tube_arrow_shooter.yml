description: "This weapon consists of a small metal tube hidden within a sleeve; the\
  \ tube holds a short, spring-loaded bamboo shaft. You gain a +2 bonus on Sleight\
  \ of Hand checks made to conceal a tube arrow shooter on your body. Releasing the\
  \ fastener allows the spring to force the arrow out. Once a shaft is fired, the\
  \ tube must be reloaded before it can be used again. Reloading a tube is a full-round\
  \ action, or a standard action if the wielder has the Rapid Reload feat."
