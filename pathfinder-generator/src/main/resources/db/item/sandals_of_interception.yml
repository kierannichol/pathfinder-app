description: "These simple wooden sandals allow their wearer to step in the way of\
  \ danger to protect her allies. Three times per day as an immediate action, the\
  \ wearer can take a 5-foot step to move into the path of a ranged attack and treat\
  \ herself as the target of the ranged attack that passes through her square for\
  \ the purposes of Deflect Arrows, Snatch Arrows, Missile Shield, and other feats\
  \ and abilities that allow her to deflect ranged attacks. If she lacks a feat or\
  \ ability that would allow her to deflect the ranged attack, the wearer is instead\
  \ simply struck by the attack regardless of the attack roll's result or her AC.\
  \ The wearer can't take a 5-foot step during the turn after using this ability."
