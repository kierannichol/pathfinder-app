description: "Three times per day, the wielder of this +1 pounder tail attachment\
  \ can force any creature it strikes to increase in size by one size category (Fort\
  \ DC 11 negates) for 3 rounds. An enlarged creature takes a –2 penalty to Dexterity\
  \ (to a minimum of 1), a –1 penalty on attack rolls, and –1 penalty to AC because\
  \ of its increased size, as the spell enlarge person. However, an enlarged creature\
  \ doesn't gain the usual size bonus to Strength.\nIf a creature fails its saving\
  \ throw but can't enlarge any more because of the environment, it begins squeezing\
  \ (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 193). A creature stops growing if growing larger\
  \ would make it so large that it would be unable to squeeze."
