description: "Zul is a +1 human bane trident that has been passed down from chieftain\
  \ to chieftain in Krelloort's tribe for generations. Zul's three-pronged head is\
  \ crafted of magically strengthened seashells, and its haft is composed of rough,\
  \ twisted coral that deals 1 point of damage each time it is grasped, unless the\
  \ wielder has a natural armor bonus or is wearing gauntlets.\nAs an immediate action\
  \ after a successful melee attack with the trident, Zul's wielder can transmute\
  \ the substance of the target creature into rigid coral. This attack deals 1d4 points\
  \ of Dexterity damage and slows the target (as the spell) for 1 round as its flesh\
  \ calcifies. A DC 16 Fortitude save negates the slow effect but not the ability\
  \ damage. A target reduced to 0 Dexterity is permanently petrified, transformed\
  \ into inert, mindless coral. Break enchantment or restoration reverses all of the\
  \ effects of this calcification. This ability can be used up to 7 times per day."
