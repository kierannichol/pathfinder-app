description: "Each of these special tapers is dedicated to one of the nine alignments.\
  \ Simply burning the candle generates a favorable aura for the individual if the\
  \ candle's alignment matches that of the character. Characters of the same alignment\
  \ as the burning candle add a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and\
  \ skill checks while within 30 feet of the flame.\nA cleric whose alignment matches\
  \ the candle's operates as if two levels higher for purposes of determining spells\
  \ per day if he burns the candle during or just prior to his spell preparation time.\
  \ He can even cast spells normally unavailable to him as if he were of that higher\
  \ level, but only so long as the candle continues to burn. Except in special cases\
  \ (see below), a candle burns for 4 hours. It is possible to extinguish the candle\
  \ simply by blowing it out, so users often place it in a lantern to protect it from\
  \ drafts and the like. Doing this doesn't interfere with its magical properties.\n\
  In addition, burning a candle also allows the owner to cast a gate spell, the respondent\
  \ being of the same alignment as the candle, but the taper is immediately consumed\
  \ in the process."
