description: "At its most basic level, the Lens of Galundari functions as the focal\
  \ point for an inward-facing magic circle spell of the user's choice. The magic\
  \ circle varies in radius, but can hold one outsider called into its space by the\
  \ spell planar binding, regardless of its size. While the lens improves the effectiveness\
  \ of the spell planar binding, it does not actually cast the spell, requiring some\
  \ outside agency to cast the spell while employing the lens as an additional focus\
  \ component. The target of the planar binding receives its normal Will save to resist,\
  \ but once it appears within the lens's magic circle, it cannot escape—the lens\
  \ prevents the outsider from using its spell resistance or Charisma to escape, and\
  \ locks it in place as per the spell dimensional anchor. Once trapped within the\
  \ lens's magic circle, an outsider is trapped indefinitely, until it agrees to the\
  \ user's demands or a sentient creature touches the prison with intent to free the\
  \ outsider—doing so releases the outsider immediately. Even rolls of 1 on Charisma\
  \ checks to coerce the outsider into service do not free the outsider.\nWhile the\
  \ lens does not grant the user a bonus on Charisma checks made to influence creatures\
  \ trapped within its prison, it does grant the user an additional use for the outsider:\
  \ The outsider can be bound within the lens, transforming the artifact into an arcane\
  \ engine of sorts. The user must compel the outsider to submit to this service,\
  \ as described by the spell planar binding. The outsider receives a +10 bonus on\
  \ the opposed Charisma check made to resist entering into service. This bonus is\
  \ reduced by 1 for every week the outsider remains bound (minimum 0). The lens can\
  \ only hold one outsider at a time, and it cannot employ its magic circle effect\
  \ while an outsider is trapped within.\nIf an outsider agrees to be bound into the\
  \ lens, it becomes trapped inside the lens and cannot free itself. While bearing\
  \ the lens, the wielder can employ any of the outsider's spell-like abilities. How\
  \ often the wielder can use these spell-like abilities is limited by the outsider's\
  \ Hit Dice and the frequency with which the imprisoned outsider can normally use\
  \ its spell-like abilities. The outsider's Hit Dice become a pool of soul points\
  \ the wielder has access to, with each Hit Die equating to 1 soul point. The lens's\
  \ bearer can employ the imprisoned outsider's spell-like abilities by spending a\
  \ number of soul points equal to the spell-like ability's spell level. If the lens\
  \ no longer has enough soul points to pay for a spell-like ability's use, the ability\
  \ cannot be used. If the imprisoned outsider can only use a spell-like ability a\
  \ certain number of times in an amount of time, the wielder cannot employ that spell-like\
  \ ability more than that number of times in the amount of time specified, even if\
  \ the lens has enough soul points to pay for the ability's use. The lens's total\
  \ number of soul points replenishes every day.\nThe outsider within the lens can\
  \ be freed by spending 1 soul point. The released outsider is exhausted, but is\
  \ not controlled by the lens's bearer. The outsider within the lens can also communicate\
  \ telepathically with a creature touching the artifact, though it exerts no control\
  \ over the bearer."
destruction: "The Lens of Galundari can only be destroyed if a deity is freed from\
  \ within. Although theoretically possible, it is unclear if a deity can be bound\
  \ into the lens by normal means, but such a being's release would be so explosive\
  \ as to shatter the lens."
