description: "Felhart is a +2 bane longbow crafted from the fiercely carved horns\
  \ of at least two venerable stags and strung with a cord laced with silver. The\
  \ designated foe that its bane effect functions against varies, being determined\
  \ by the creature a wielder hates the most when the bow is first picked up (as decided\
  \ upon by the GM). This bane effect remains the same for a wielder, regardless of\
  \ how many times he's used the bow. Thus, for one user it might be a +2 bane vs.\
  \ humanoids (humans) longbow, while for another it might be a +2 bane vs. dragons\
  \ longbow. A wielder can do nothing to change the bow's bane effect.\nIn addition,\
  \ once per week, felhart's wielder can summon a reliable steed as per the spell\
  \ mount. This creature takes the form of a lean, swift white elk that, despite its\
  \ almost ghostly appearance, possesses the same statistics as a horse. This creature\
  \ allows felhart's wielder to ride it, and serves loyally for up to 5 hours, vanishing\
  \ at the end of this time. The mount will not allow any creature beside felhart's\
  \ wielder to ride it unless the weapon's bearer succeeds at a DC 16 Handle Animal\
  \ check. Even if this check succeeds, the mount only allows another rider to ride\
  \ along with the weapon bearer. The elk never allows a strange rider to ride it\
  \ alone."
