description: "Excavated within the Shackles among the temples of its lost Ghol-Gan\
  \ culture, these stone disks display whorls of symbols in the dead language of that\
  \ dead kingdom, centered about a sphere of black volcanic glass. Each disk acts\
  \ as a word of recall spell when the command word is spoken; each disk is keyed\
  \ to a specific island in the territory once controlled by the people of Ghol-Gan.\
  \ The disk functions once per day, and its destination cannot be changed.\nMost\
  \ of these are in the hands of Shackles pirate lords."
