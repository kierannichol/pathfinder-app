description: "Each end of this unassuming, 8-inch leather cord is adorned by a polished\
  \ silver bead. A wand around which a holdout wand wrap has been wound and tied (a\
  \ standard action) can be commanded to change its shape and appearance to assume\
  \ the form of another object of a similar size and shape (such as a feather, a folded\
  \ fan, or a spoon). The wand retains all its properties (including its weight) when\
  \ so disguised but does not radiate magic. Only true seeing or similar magic reveals\
  \ the true nature of a wand disguised by a holdout wand wrap. Whenever the disguised\
  \ wand is activated, the holdout wand wrap's effects are suppressed for 1 minute."
