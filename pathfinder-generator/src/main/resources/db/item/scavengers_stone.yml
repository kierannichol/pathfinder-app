description: "This jagged, egg-shaped stone emits a faint red glow when not in direct\
  \ sunlight. By rubbing a scavenger's stone against a damaged (but not destroyed)\
  \ construct or object as a full-round action, you repair 1d6 points of damage to\
  \ the object or construct. If this brings a broken object's hit points above half\
  \ its maximum hit points, it loses the broken condition. As a standard action, you\
  \ can smash a scavenger's stone against a destroyed object or damaged construct.\
  \ Doing so immediately repairs the object to full functionality or heals a damaged\
  \ construct of 10d6 points of damage. Destroyed magic items can be repaired in this\
  \ manner if their caster level is no higher than 3rd—more powerful destroyed magical\
  \ items cannot be repaired by a scavenger's stone. A newly-created scavenger's stone\
  \ has 50 charges—smashing a stone against an object uses up 10 charges."
