description: "This shining, jewel-like scale is usually worn on the forehead between\
  \ the eyebrows, though a creature can affix the scale to any part of her body by\
  \ pressing it to her skin and speaking its command word. Once affixed, the scale\
  \ causes the creature to take on the attributes of a particular type of naga, chosen\
  \ when the scale was created. Her skin becomes scaly, her eyes slitted and reptilian,\
  \ her tongue forked, and her neck lengthens and distends until it resembles a cobra's\
  \ hood. The creature gains a +4 bonus to her natural armor, darkvision 60 feet,\
  \ and a poisonous bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage (1d3 for a Small creature)Bite—\
  injury; save Fort DC 19; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect varies by the scale's\

  \ made to resist any form of mind reading and a +2 bonus against charm effects.\

  \ to 30 feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment.\

  \ to charm a single creature within 30 feet, as the spell charm person (Will DC\
