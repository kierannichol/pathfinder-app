description: "This rough, fist-sized stone contains an inner cavity lined with crystals\
  \ that have been infused with positive energy. When hurled at a hard surface up\
  \ to 60 feet away, an effulgent geode explodes in a 20-foot-radius burst. Living\
  \ creatures within the burst regain 1d8+9 hit points, while undead creatures within\
  \ the burst take 1d8+9 points of damage (Fortitude DC 17 half). An effulgent geode\
  \ worn or carried by a creature that fails a saving throw against an effect that\
  \ deals negative energy damage must save successfully against the negative energy\
  \ effect or it immediately explodes."
