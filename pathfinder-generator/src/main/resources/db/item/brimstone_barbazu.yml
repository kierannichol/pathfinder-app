description: "Shaped in the form of a leering bearded devil clutching a glaive, this\
  \ dusty yellowish figurine stands just under a foot tall. When broken or shattered,\
  \ a brimstone barbazu steadily heats up over the course of 1 round, belching thick\
  \ sulfuric smoke before bursting into flames. At the start of the following round,\
  \ a bearded devil (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 73) appears in the square where the figurine\
  \ was broken. This summoned devil is under the command of the creature that broke\
  \ the figurine, as per summon monster. The devil disappears when slain or after\
  \ 20 rounds. Once used, a brimstone barbazu is destroyed."
