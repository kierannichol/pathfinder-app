description: "Strapped to the hands, these spiked climbing claws grant a +2 competence\
  \ bonus on Climb checks and Acrobatics checks made when using both hands to aid\
  \ in movement, and allow the wearer to ignore the normal penalties on those skills\
  \ for slippery or icy surfaces. In addition, up to 3 times per day, the wearer can\
  \ activate the claws as a swift action to gain the benefits of spider climb for\
  \ 1 round. The wearer cannot hold anything else in her hands while using claws of\
  \ the ice bear. If used as a weapon, claws of the ice bear function as spiked gauntlets."
