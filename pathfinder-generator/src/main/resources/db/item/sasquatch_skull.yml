description: "Divination reveals this large humanoid skull to be that of a gorilla\
  \ or giant, although it is actually an accursed sasquatch skull. The item seems\
  \ to grant its bearer a +5 bonus on Stealth checks in wooded areas.If an individual\
  \ takes possession of the sasquatch skull for more than 24 hours, it quickly begins\
  \ to stink. The smell is undetectable by the skull's bearer, but companions and\
  \ creatures within 30 feet find the pungent smell extremely noticeable. The smell\
  \ imposes a â€“2 penalty on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks made by\
  \ the skull's owner. In addition, aggressive wild animals always target the skull's\
  \ owner first during combat. The skull need not be on the owner's person for the\
  \ curse to manifest, so long as ownership has not been transferred through sale,\
  \ gift, or theft."
