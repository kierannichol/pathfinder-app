description: "This piece of sooty coal has a tiny bit of flint embedded in it. The\
  \ bearer of a jumping cinder can, as a standard action, order it to burst into flames\
  \ and bounce around in random directions. Each round, the jumping cinder leaps into\
  \ a randomly selected adjacent square. If a creature is in the square into which\
  \ the jumping cinder lands, that creature takes 1d6 points of fire damage if it\
  \ fails a DC 12 Reflex save. After 1 minute, the jumping cinder burns out, leaving\
  \ behind a puff of smoke and a tiny smear of ash. Some goblin tribes use jumping\
  \ cinders to randomly select volunteers for undesirable duties from a large crowd\
  \ of goblinsâ€”anyone who takes fire damage from the jumping cinder but is not killed\
  \ by the fire has to do the undesirable task."
