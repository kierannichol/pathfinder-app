description: "This thick leather collar is studded with onyx gems and fastened with\
  \ a simple metal clasp. Spell-sharing collars come in a variety of sizes and can\
  \ be secured around the neck of any creature capable of wearing and using a neck-slot\
  \ item. They are usually sold in sets.\nA creature with the share spells ability\
  \ (such as an animal companion or familiar) wearing a spell-sharing collar can benefit\
  \ from that ability with any other creature wearing such a collar that is attuned\
  \ to its own collar, rather than gaining the benefit only with its bonded master.\
  \ Attuning two or more spell-sharing collars takes 10 minutes, during which time\
  \ the collars must be touching one another. A spell-sharing collar can have as many\
  \ as three other spell-sharing collars attuned to it at once. The granted ability\
  \ otherwise functions as a familiar's share spells ability."
