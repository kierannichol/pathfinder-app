description: "These black leather fingerless gloves are shot through with strands\
  \ of giant spider webbing. They allow their wearer to steal the special abilities\
  \ of an opponent's weapon and augment the wearer's unarmed strikes with the abilities\
  \ instead.\nOnce per day, the wearer can activate the gloves by succeeding at an\
  \ unarmed disarm combat maneuver against an opponent's magic weapon. Instead of\
  \ disarming the weapon, the wearer can negate the weapon's special abilities (bane,\
  \ flaming, and so on) for 1d4 rounds and apply these abilities to her own unarmed\
  \ strikes (the weapon's enhancement bonus is unaffected). Any weapon special abilities\
  \ that couldn't be applied to unarmed strikes (such as returning or vorpal) are\
  \ still suspended on the weapon but are not applied to the wearer's unarmed attacks.\n\
  If the wearer's unarmed strikes already have magical weapon special abilities (such\
  \ as from an amulet of mighty fists), the enhancement bonus and special ability\
  \ bonus equivalents on the wearer's unarmed strikes can't total more than +10; stolen\
  \ special abilities are discarded at random until the total is +10 or less (discarded\
  \ abilities are still suspended in the opponent's weapon for the normal duration)."
