  \ alignment ability. Once per day, the item can alter an inquisitor's judgment ability;\
  \ by spending one use of her judgment ability, she can allow her spells of 3rd level\
  \ and lower to have full effect against incorporeal creatures, as though using the\
  \ Ectoplasmic Spell feat. This lasts until the combat ends."
