description: "These five oblong, wooden planks range in length from 5 inches to about\
  \ 1 foot, and weigh 1 pound each. None is carved thicker than a finger, and their\
  \ sides taper to form dull blades. Each is delicately carved with intricate, symmetrical\
  \ designs of seemingly primitive origin. A long cord bound to the plank through\
  \ a hole at the top of the blade allows the bearer to whirl the blade about in a\
  \ circle, causing it to emit a low, growling tone with a strange warble that can\
  \ be heard many miles away.\nIn the hands of a mythic creature, whirling bullroarers\
  \ can induce powerful sonic waves that trigger profound emotional reactions in anyone\
  \ they touch. A mythic creature can attempt to spin up to two bullroarers at a time,\
  \ provided he has a free hand for each. Spinning more than two bullroarers creates\
  \ a cacophony that causes their effects to cancel each other out. The penetrating\
  \ sonic waves don't need to be audible to be effective, however they can't affect\
  \ creatures immune to mindaffecting effects.\nThe bullroarers affect mythic opponents\
  \ within a radius of 60 feet plus 10 additional feet per the tier wielder possesses,\
  \ and non-mythic creatures within double that range. The effect remains for as long\
  \ as the artifact's owner swings the bullroarer, up to a maximum number of rounds\
  \ equal to his mythic tier. The individual blades and their powers are listed below.\n\
  Blade of Courage: All allies within the area of effect are treated as if affected\
  \ by of a blessing of courage and life spell.\nBlade of Castigation: All opponents\
  \ within the area fall to their knees as if affected by a castigate spell.\nBlade\
  \ of Despair: All opponents within the area of effect that hear the sound become\
  \ saddened as if affected by a crushing despair spell.\nBlade of Fear: All opponents\
  \ within the area of effect that hear the sound become frightened as if affected\
  \ by a fear spell.\nBlade of Rage: All opponents within the area of effect that\
  \ hear the sound become enraged as if affected by a rage spell."
destruction: "The bullroarers simultaneously shatter if all five are swung at the\
  \ same time while their bearer stands within the eye of a massive hurricane."
