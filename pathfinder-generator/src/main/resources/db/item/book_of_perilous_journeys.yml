description: "This leather-bound book looks like a journal partially ruined by moisture.\
  \ The pages that are still legible detail three violent events that apparently took\
  \ place while the writer was traveling through an unknown land. There are several\
  \ varieties of the book, each describing a perilous journey through a different\
  \ terrain type corresponding to the encounter tables on page 324 of the Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Bestiary.\nReading any of the three accounts triggers the curse, after which\
  \ the reader is compelled to protect the book at all costs and secretly read the\
  \ other two accounts over the next 2 days. Each day the owner reads one of the accounts,\
  \ monsters of a type appropriate to the book's terrain attack during the night.\
  \ Determine the specific monsters by rolling on the appropriate encounter tables.\
  \ If the prevailing weather is vastly different from typical weather in the climate\
  \ described in the journal, a sudden change in weather usually heralds the arrival\
  \ of the monsters (as per control weather).\nOnce the three attacks are over, the\
  \ book mysteriously vanishes, lifting the curse. The book reappears later, however,\
  \ at a random location."
