description: "This wood and iron weapon resembles a light crossbow with a very short\
  \ prod. The prod itself is non-functional, but provides the water scorpion with\
  \ excellent balance. The water scorpion functions as a +1 weapon that magically\
  \ produces a stream of holy water with a range of 30 feet each time it is fired.\
  \ The stream strikes its opponent as a ranged touch attack that deals 2d4+1 points\
  \ of damage to undead and evil outsiders. To other creatures it is harmless. Only\
  \ one stream might be fired each round, but there are rumors of water scorpions\
  \ of speed created from the original.\nAnyone proficient with crossbows may use\
  \ a water scorpion without penalty."
