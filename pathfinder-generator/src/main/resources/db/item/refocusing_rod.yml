description: "Once per day, a refocusing rod allows an occultist to t ransfer mental\
  \ focus using the shift focus class feature without losing any points of focus.\
  \ He can move focus from one implement into the rod, and then from the rod into\
  \ another implement, by spending twice as long as it normally takes him to shift\
  \ focus (because he's making two transfers). The occultist must transfer the focus\
  \ from the rod within 10 minutes or the focus is lost.\nIf an occultist chooses\
  \ a refocusing rod as one of his implements for the day, he can instead use this\
  \ ability to transfer focus into the rod and leave it there or transfer focus he\
  \ already stored in the rod into another implement. In either of these cases, no\
  \ points of focus are lost in the transfer and it takes the normal amount of time\
  \ to shift focus instead of twice as long. If the refocusing rod is not one of the\
  \ occultist's implements for the day, mental focus stored in it can't be used for\
  \ any purpose except transference to another implement.\nAny mental focus transferred\
  \ into the rod still belongs to the occultist who transferred it. The rod can't\
  \ be used to transfer mental focus between two users."
