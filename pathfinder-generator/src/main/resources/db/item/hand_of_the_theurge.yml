description: "This large crystal, sized and shaped like a loosely clenched human fist,\
  \ perfectly accepts any wand. As a standard action, the hand can be loosed to activate\
  \ a wand on its own at any target within range. Any such activation costs 3 charges\
  \ from the wand. The hand can activate the wand for up to 4 rounds and then drops.\
  \ It is considered attended by you for all effects that target items, and it exists\
  \ within your space. The hand of the theurge accompanies you everywhere, whether\
  \ you move by physical or magical means. If you have an unoccupied hand, you can\
  \ grasp it while it is activating on its own as a free action; when so retrieved,\
  \ the hand can't animate again for 4 rounds."
