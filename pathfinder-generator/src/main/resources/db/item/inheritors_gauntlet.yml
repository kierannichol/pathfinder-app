description: "This metal gauntlet is the sort appropriate for wearing with chainmail,\
  \ though versions suited for leather or full plate exist. Affixed to the wrist is\
  \ a white cloth with a longsword embroidered in gold thread. Once per day, the wearer\
  \ can speak a command word to give a weapon the wearer holds in that hand (or the\
  \ gauntlet itself) a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls for 1 minute.\
  \ An Inheritor's gauntlet uses up the wearer's entire hands slot; the wearer can\
  \ not use another item (even another Inheritor's gauntlet) that also uses the hands\
  \ slot, though a matching nonmagical gauntlet is often worn on the other hand.\n\
  If Iomedae is the wearer's patron, the gauntlet lets the wearer use any sword he\
  \ holds in that hand as a holy symbol. Once per day, the wearer can speak a command\
  \ word and give any sword he holds the powers of an evil outsider-bane weapon for\
  \ 1 minute; this effect ends if the wearer drops the sword or removes the gauntlet.\
  \ If the wearer uses a finger to draw Iomedae's symbol on any solid surface, the\
  \ symbol glows as brightly as a candle for 1 hour or until the wearer draws the\
  \ symbol elsewhere (whichever comes first)."
