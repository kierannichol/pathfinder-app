description: "This large bundle of ropes, pulleys, netting, and latches can be assembled\
  \ to form two different traps: one to drop a net from above, and another to snag\
  \ trespassers from below and hoist them into the air. Either configuration requires\
  \ an overhead structure such as a ceiling, a crossbeam, or a sturdy tree branch\
  \ to support the trap's mechanisms and counterweights. Net rigging has an effective\
  \ Strength score of 19 for the purpose of determining how much weight it can lift.\n\
  This can be crafted with a DC 25 Craft (traps) check."
