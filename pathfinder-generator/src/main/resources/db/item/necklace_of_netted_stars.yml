description: "This marvelous mithral necklace forms a broad, draping lacework of threadlike\
  \ chains set with a multitude of tiny jewels. Seven of these jewels are larger than\
  \ the rest. While wearing a necklace of netted stars, the wearer can create dancing\
  \ lights at will and wandering star motes (see Advanced Player's Guide) once per\
  \ day. In addition, each of the seven jewels of the necklace can recall a previously\
  \ cast 1st-level or 0-level spell, as a pearl of power.\nOnce per day, the wearer\
  \ may use the necklace to catch a spell targeted at him, as if readying an action\
  \ to counterspell using dispel magic, with a bonus on the check equal to 12 + the\
  \ number of jewels not yet used to recall spells that day. If all jewels have been\
  \ used, this ability cannot be used that day. The level of the spell to be countered\
  \ must be less than or equal to the number of unused jewels. If the counterspell\
  \ succeeds, the spell is negated and the wearer can use its magical energy to recall\
  \ a previously cast spell of the same level or lower as an immediate action. Whether\
  \ or not the attempt succeeds, this action exhausts the power of all of the necklace's\
  \ jewels for that day."
