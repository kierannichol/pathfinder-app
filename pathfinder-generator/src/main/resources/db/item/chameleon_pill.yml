description: "This pill causes the imbiber's skin to shift colors and patterns to\
  \ match whatever is behind her. As long as a significant portion of her skin is\
  \ exposed (her head and forearms, for example), the imbiber gains a +4 circumstance\
  \ bonus on Stealth checks for 4 hours. This bonus doesn't stack with that granted\
  \ by invisibility, vanish, or similar magical effects. Crafting a chameleon pill\
  \ requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check."
