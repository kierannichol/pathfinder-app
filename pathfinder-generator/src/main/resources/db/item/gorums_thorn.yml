description: "This forge-blackened +1 keen greatsword is festooned with religious\
  \ iconography depicting glorious images of the Lord in Iron. If Gorum is the wielder's\
  \ patron, Gorum's Thorn gains an additional ability: when the wielder confirms a\
  \ critical hit against any creature with the giant subtype, he can attempt to trip\
  \ that target as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity and ignoring\
  \ any size restrictions related to the target. If the trip attempt fails by 10 or\
  \ more, the wielder is not knocked prone."
