description: "These supple silk gloves are skintight. As a standard action, the wearer\
  \ can deliver a complex secret message to a single target that can see the wearer\
  \ as if she had succeeded at a DC 20 Bluff check. This message is conveyed in a\
  \ series of rapid, complicated hand gestures that the target automatically understands.\
  \ Creatures that see the wearer send a message can attempt a DC 20 Sense Motive\
  \ check to notice that the wearer is delivering a secret message and decipher it."
