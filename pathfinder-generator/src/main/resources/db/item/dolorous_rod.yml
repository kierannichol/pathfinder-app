description: "On command, this rod beats with a slow, steady pulse, sending a deep,\
  \ almost inaudible thrum through the air. At the start of each successive round\
  \ of holding the rod, its bearer takes 1d10 points of damage that can't be reduced\
  \ in any way, and must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or gain a permanent negative\
  \ level. While the rod is held, creatures within 120 feet take a â€“2 penalty on attack\
  \ rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls. This\
  \ is a mind-affecting emotion effect. While held by a mythic creature, the rod prevents\
  \ all creatures of an equal or lower mythic tier within its radius from expending\
  \ mythic power. Mythic abilities that don't require expending uses of mythic power\
  \ are unaffected."
