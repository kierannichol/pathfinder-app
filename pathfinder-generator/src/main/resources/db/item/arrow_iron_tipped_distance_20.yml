description: "Used tactically for long-range attacks on troops, these arrows are fitted\
  \ with heavy iron heads. While these heads help them travel great distances, they\
  \ make the arrows less effective at dealing damage. Iron-tipped distance arrows\
  \ increase their bow's range increment by 10 feet but take a â€“1 penalty on damage\
  \ dealt per range increment (minimum 1 point of damage). They are sold in leather\
  \ quivers in quantities of 20."
