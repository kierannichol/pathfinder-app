description: "Once the command word is spoken, this steel disc burrows 3 inches into\
  \ the ground. To find it, a character with the trapfinding ability must succeed\
  \ at a DC 25 Perception check. Planting the mine is a full-round action that provokes\
  \ attacks of opportunity.\nOnce the mine is set, any creature that steps into its\
  \ square must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or the mine levitates the creature 5\
  \ inches above the ground. A levitated creature can attack but not move, is denied\
  \ its Dexterity bonus to AC, and takes a â€“4 penalty to CMD against bull rush, drag,\
  \ and reposition combat maneuvers. Flying creatures are immune. The creature can\
  \ attempt a new save each round to end the effect. The effect ends after 5 rounds,\
  \ with a successful DC 25 Disable Device check, or with a successful saving throw.\
  \ The land mine is destroyed when the effect ends."
