description: "This blown-glass vial has a chain for attaching it to the handle of\
  \ a weapon. When filled with the wearer's blood, it gains powerful magic. Filling\
  \ the reservoir takes a full minute, deals 4 points of Constitution damage (which\
  \ can be healed normally), and imbues the reservoir with 4 charges. Charging the\
  \ reservoir changes the blood to magical fluid, which does not clot or decay with\
  \ time.\nThe wearer can speak the first command word to draw 1 or more charges from\
  \ the reservoir, curing 1 point of physical ability score damage per charge used.\n\
  The wearer can speak the second command word to imbue herself with a great burst\
  \ of physical prowess, depleting all remaining charges and gaining an inherent bonus\
  \ to one physical ability score equal to twice the number of charges used. This\
  \ bonus lasts until the end of the wearer's next turn.\nThe bearer can only use\
  \ the reservoir if it is held in hand or attached to a held or wielded weapon. A\
  \ bearer can safely carry only one charged reservoir at a time; any others spontaneously\
  \ drain their charges in 1d10 rounds, leaving only the highestcharged reservoir\
  \ intact. A reservoir has no effect if not charged with the wearer's blood, and\
  \ cannot be charged by bloodless creatures or those that cannot take Constitution\
  \ damage."
