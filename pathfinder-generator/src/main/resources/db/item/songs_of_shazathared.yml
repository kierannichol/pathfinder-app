description: "Nearly 50 ancient tales and songs have been collected on this long scroll.\
  \ Contrasting with the obvious antiquity of the papyrus, the illuminated images\
  \ are vivid and the writing is clear (though occasionally difficult to decipher\
  \ due to elaborate embellishments), as the inks used were infused with unguent of\
  \ timelessness.\nThis folio is the most complete extant collection of poems by the\
  \ legendary marid bard Shazathared. Most of the poems recount the binding of Rovagug\
  \ by the gods and the fates of his terrible spawn, but several pieces, told from\
  \ the point of view of a genie princess, speak of defending the princess's home\
  \ and allies against bandit-kings, tempests, and evil magic. A bard with access\
  \ to a complete copy of these poems can learn the defensive songs in the folio as\
  \ the masterpiece presented below by paying the normal masterpiece cost (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Ultimate Magic 21)."
