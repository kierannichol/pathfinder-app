description: "These paired firearms—a +1 flaming dragon pistol and a +1 frost dragon\
  \ pistol—are ornately inscribed and carefully carved to resemble fire and ice drakes\
  \ as a tribute to an infamous pair of quarreling drake siblings (though the names\
  \ of the drakes have been lost to time).\nAs a swift action, the guns of the twin\
  \ drakes can be joined together to function as a double-barreled weapon. As a standard\
  \ action, the joined weapons can be fired at the same time; in this case they must\
  \ be fired at the same target, and each shot uses a separate attack roll and takes\
  \ a –4 penalty. When fired this way, the first shot deals 1d4 additional points\
  \ of fire damage and the second deals 1d4 additional points of cold damage; this\
  \ damage is instead of the extra damage normally granted by the flaming and frost\
  \ weapon special abilities."
