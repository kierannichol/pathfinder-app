description: "This enhanced form of padded armor has internal layers specifically\
  \ designed to trap arrows, bolts, darts, shuriken, thrown daggers, and other small\
  \ ranged piercing weapons. When these kinds of weapons strike you, they tend to\
  \ become snagged in these layers and fail to harm you. Wearing quilted cloth armor\
  \ gives you DR 3/â€” against attacks of this kind. The special layers of the armor\
  \ have no effect on other kinds of weapons."
