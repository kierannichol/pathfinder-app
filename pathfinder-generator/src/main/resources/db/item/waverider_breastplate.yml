description: "This flat, gray +1 breastplate is embossed with the iron fin symbol\
  \ of the Wave Riders (Absalom's sea cavalry), and is enchanted to make it lighter\
  \ in water. The armor imposes no armor check penalty on Swim checks, but still contributes\
  \ to the wearer's encumbrance and applies all other armor check penalties as normal.\
  \ Once per day, the wearer can speak a command word even if submerged to cause the\
  \ armor—and the wearer if the armor is worn—to float as per the buoyancy spell (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Advanced Class Guide 177)."
