description: "This specialized bolas can be used to perform ranged trip combat maneuvers\
  \ against creatures far larger than the wielder. It consists of a pair of metal\
  \ weights connected by a silk rope 20 feet long. Because of the great size and weight\
  \ of the bolas, you need both hands to swing it around your head, and considerable\
  \ time to get the weights up to speed. Making a ranged attack with it is a full-round\
  \ action. You can use a dire bolas to trip a creature whose size is up to three\
  \ size categories larger than yours."
