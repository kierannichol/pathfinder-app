description: "Runechill hatchets are sized for Large creatures, but resizes so it\
  \ can be wielded by Medium creatures as battleaxes or Small creatures as greataxes.\
  \ Their blades are jagged and carved with Thassilonian runes, and the weapons always\
  \ feel cold to the touch. A runechill hatchet otherwise functions as a +1 battleaxe,\
  \ but once per day as a free action, its wielder can cause the runes on the blade\
  \ to flare up with flickering cold blue light. For the next 5 rounds, the axe deals\
  \ an additional +1d6 points of negative energy damage on a hit. Any creature that\
  \ takes any amount of this additional negative energy damage must also succeed at\
  \ a DC 12 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage. An undead creature\
  \ struck by a runechill hatchet does not gain this negative energy as healing, but\
  \ instead must make a DC 12 Will saving throw or flee as if panicked for 1d4+5 rounds."
