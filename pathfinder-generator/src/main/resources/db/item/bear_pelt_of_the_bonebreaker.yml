description: "This large bearskin cloak is almost too big for a human to wear comfortably.\
  \ The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate checks. Once per day, the\
  \ wearer can use bless; using this ability causes the hair on the cloak to bristle\
  \ menacingly.\nIf the stone giant deity Urazra is the wearer's patron, the wearer\
  \ can use beast shape II once per day to transform into a black or brown bear for\
  \ up to 7 minutes. Some champions of Urazra claim to have more powerful pelts that\
  \ allow them to take the form of polar bears or even dire bears."
