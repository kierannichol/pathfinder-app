description: "While normally functioning as a standard well of many worlds, this well\
  \ possesses a command word that supersedes its normal placement-based destination,\
  \ and it instead opens up onto a single location designated by its maker during\
  \ the well's creation (often the creator's home or a private, warded demiplane).\
  \ Those finding the well are not immediately aware of this command word unless a\
  \ spell more powerful than a simple identify spell is used, and the well's secret\
  \ destination, whatever it might be, may or may not still be occupied."
