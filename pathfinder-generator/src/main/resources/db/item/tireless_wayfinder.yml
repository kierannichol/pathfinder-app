description: "Tireless wayfinders have burnished copper cases and silver inner workings.\
  \ In addition to the usual functions of a wayfinder (including the ability to create\
  \ light), the bearer of a tireless wayfinder halves the Strength and Dexterity penalties\
  \ for being fatigued or exhausted, and gains a +2 resistance bonus on all saving\
  \ throws made against effects that cause fatigue or exhaustion. The tireless wayfinder\
  \ must be in a creature's possession for 1 full week before these benefits apply,\
  \ and they are lost if it leaves the creature's possession for more than 1 hour."
