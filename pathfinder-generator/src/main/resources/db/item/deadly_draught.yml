description: "This vial has a narrow, pinched spout and is sealed with gray wax. Casting\
  \ a targeted spell (up to 3rd level) into the vial activates it and causes it to\
  \ glow a soft red. A creature can then break the spout (destroying the vial) and\
  \ imbibe the liquid therein as a standard action. Doing so infuses the drinker's\
  \ blood with the spell cast on the vial, but the spell does not affect the drinker\
  \ (the spell instead acts as though it had been affected by contingency). The next\
  \ time a creature feeds on the drinker's blood, the infused spell immediately targets\
  \ the attacking creature; if the spell allows a saving throw, the creature takes\
  \ a –2 penalty on the save. The infused spell fades after it is triggered or 24\
  \ hours have passed, whichever comes first."
