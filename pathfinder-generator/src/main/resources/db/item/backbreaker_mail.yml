description: "This +2 spiked splint mail is fashioned from hacked-off chunks of tanned\
  \ hide and held together by humanoid spines. Used by orcs of the Broken Spine clan\
  \ in Belkzen, these sets of armor are seen as a status symbol, and are adorned with\
  \ trophies from slain foes, such as wayfinders. This armor grants its wearer the\
  \ constrict ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 298), dealing an amount of damage equal\
  \ to 1d6 + the wearer's Strength modifier.\nThe vertebrae of the spines adorning\
  \ the backbreaker mail are sharpened, acting as +1 human bane armor spikes."
