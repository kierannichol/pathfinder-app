description: "The life lantern appears as a large ankh made of gold with a polished\
  \ sphere of sapphire fitted into its center. Held in one hand by a living bearer,\
  \ the life lantern glows with a radiance equal to that of a sunrod. If the carrier\
  \ is undead, the life lantern instead sheds an area of magical darkness akin to\
  \ that exuded by a darkness spell.\nThe light or darkness exuded by a life lantern\
  \ enhances certain elements of necromancy. In an area of light generated by a living\
  \ carrier of a life lantern, dying creatures gain a +4 bonus on all Constitution\
  \ checks to stabilize. More significantly, a body brought back to life via raise\
  \ dead, resurrection, or any similar effect does not gain any negative levels upon\
  \ being brought back, as long as the body is restored while it is illuminated by\
  \ the life lantern's light. Once per year, the life lantern may be used by a living\
  \ creature to cast resurrection on a creature by touching the life lantern to a\
  \ portion of the dead creature's body.\nWhen the life lantern sheds darkness in\
  \ the hand of an undead creature, all undead creatures in that area of darkness\
  \ gain fast healing 5. Once per week, the life lantern may be used by an undead\
  \ creature to cast create greater undead.\nThe life lantern also functions as a\
  \ holy or unholy symbol for a spellcaster who worships a deity who grants access\
  \ to the domains of Death or Healing, and the spellcaster need not actually have\
  \ those domains to use the lantern in this way."
destruction: "If the life lantern is buried in a coffin along with a living creature,\
  \ it crumbles to dust when the creature dies."
