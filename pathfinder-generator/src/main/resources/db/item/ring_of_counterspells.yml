description: "Upon first examination, this ring seems to be a ring of spell storing.\
  \ However, while it allows a single spell of 1st through 6th level to be cast into\
  \ it, that spell cannot be cast out of the ring again. Instead, should that spell\
  \ ever be cast upon the wearer, the spell is immediately countered, as a counterspell\
  \ action, requiring no action (or even knowledge) on the wearer's part. Once so\
  \ used, the spell cast within the ring is gone. A new spell (or the same one as\
  \ before) may be placed into it again."
