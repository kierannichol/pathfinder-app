description: "Favored by assassins, this magical vial allows the application of poisons\
  \ at a range of up to 30 feet. The poison must be supplied, and must be a contact\
  \ or ingested poison. The user adds the poison to the vial and then shakes it in\
  \ the direction of the item or creature she wishes to affect, making a ranged touch\
  \ attack (a poison vial of distance provides a +4 circumstance bonus on this roll).\
  \ If the attack is successful, the poison is successfully delivered to the object\
  \ or creature intended."
