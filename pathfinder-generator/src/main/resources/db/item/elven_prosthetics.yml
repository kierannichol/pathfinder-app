description: "The canny half-elf sometimes needs a little something extra to look\
  \ like a full elf. Ear extensions make somewhat elongated half-elf ears look like\
  \ sharp elf ears, and colored lenses make a half-elf's human-like eyes look like\
  \ elven eyes. These accessories give a half-elf a +6 circumstance bonus on Disguise\
  \ checks to resemble an elf and can be used only by a half-elf."
