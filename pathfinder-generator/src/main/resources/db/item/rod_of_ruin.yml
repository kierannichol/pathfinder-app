description: "This magical item appears to be an old and decaying scepter, with empty\
  \ sockets for gemstones and rusted iron bands holding its rotting wooden shaft together.\
  \ Three times per day on command, when the wielder touches the rod to a nonmagical,\
  \ inanimate object, that object decays, cracks, and withers. The object, which can\
  \ be no larger than a door or must take up no more than a 5-foot-by-5-foot area,\
  \ gains the broken condition."
