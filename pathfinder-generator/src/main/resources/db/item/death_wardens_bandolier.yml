description: "This black leather bandolier is adorned with three brass bells of various\
  \ sizes and shapes. Each bell can be rung to produce its own effect, or all can\
  \ be rung at once to create a death ward. The death warden's bandolier can be used\
  \ three times per day. A mythic creature can expend one use mythic power to use\
  \ the bandolier without expending one of the item's daily uses.\nUndead Ward Bell:\
  \ This long, thin bell produces a high-pitched, piercing ring. When it is rung as\
  \ a standard action, it creates a 30-foot-burst aura that keeps out undead creatures.\
  \ An undead creature can't enter the aura unless it succeeds at a DC 16 Will save.\
  \ Undead within the aura take a â€“2 penalty on all attack rolls, combat maneuver\
  \ checks, skill checks, and ability checks. The aura lasts for 5 rounds, but can\
  \ be extended to 1 minute by expending one use of mythic power.\nChanneling Bell:\
  \ This large, bulbous bell creates a rich, reverberating tone. When it's rung as\
  \ part of the action to channel positive energy to harm undead, it can take the\
  \ place of the holy symbol needed for channeling. When it's used in such a manner,\
  \ undead creatures within the area take an additional 2 points of damage per each\
  \ die of the channelled energy. The undead take this extra damage even if they succeed\
  \ at their Will saving throws.\nDirge Bell: The final, largest bell is cone-shaped.\
  \ It creates a deep, bass chime. When rung, this bell creates an aura in a 30-foot-radius\
  \ burst that causes incorporeal undead within it to become semi-physical for a period\
  \ of time. While within the aura, undead take half damage from nonmagical attacks\
  \ and full damage from magical attacks. The aura last for 5 rounds, but can be extended\
  \ to 1 minute by expending one use of mythic power.\nAll Bells At Once: When all\
  \ the bells are rung at once, the wearer and all of her allies within 30 feet are\
  \ protected as if they were subject to a death ward spell (CL 11th). By expending\
  \ one use of mythic power, the wearer can increase the duration of this effect to\
  \ 24 hours."
