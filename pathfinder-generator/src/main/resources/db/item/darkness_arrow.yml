description: "This +1 arrow is as black as the darkest night and is fletched with\
  \ sleek raven feathers. If the arrow strikes a foe, magical darkness infuses the\
  \ creature's sight. The creature counts the light level as darkness for 1 round,\
  \ regardless of the actual light level, and if the creature has darkvision, it must\
  \ succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude saving throw or lose its darkvision for 1 round."
