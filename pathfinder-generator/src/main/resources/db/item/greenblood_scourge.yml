description: "Originally made from the winding intestines of a scrag, the first version\
  \ of this +2 corrosive whip was crafted by a blood-bard who fought in Green Blood\
  \ on a Black Rock. After the blood-bard's stunning victory, these weapons have gained\
  \ popularity across the Sodden Lands and Shackles. Unless damaged by fire, a greenblood\
  \ scourge regenerates hit points at a rate of 1 hit point per minute.\nIn performance\
  \ combat (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 153), the wielder of a greenblood scourge\
  \ can spend a victory point as a swift action to give the weapon the corrosive burst\
  \ special ability. Also, the wielder no longer needs to attempt a performance combat\
  \ check when using the withdraw action during performance combat, as the weapon's\
  \ blasts of acid prevent the enemy from approaching."
