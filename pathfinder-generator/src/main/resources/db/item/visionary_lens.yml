description: "This ornate mirror measures 4 feet in diameter, framed in gold and embellished\
  \ with silver. The frame depicts dozens of stylized eyes from fey creatures that\
  \ alternately open and close in wakefulness or slumber. During the day, these eyes\
  \ influence the mirror's surface to act as a crystal ball with telepathy. At night,\
  \ the eyes can cast scrying (looking into the dreams of subjects) and nightmare\
  \ instead. Lastly, during the twilight hours between day and night, the eyes can\
  \ be commanded to bestow one of the following effects upon any single person gazing\
  \ into the mirror:"
destruction: "The visionary lens shatters if exposed to a wail of the banshee cast\
  \ by someone wearing a medallion of thought projection."
