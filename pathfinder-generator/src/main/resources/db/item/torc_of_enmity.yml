description: "This large neck ring is made of twisted bronze, capped at each end with\
  \ tiny skulls facing each other. Each torc of enmity is attuned to a designated\
  \ creature type (or subtype) as the bane weapon special ability (Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Core Rulebook 469) and focuses the wearer's hatred toward creatures of that type.\
  \ Each time the wearer of a torc of enmity confirms a critical hit against a creature\
  \ of the type to which the torc is attuned, she gains a cumulative +1 morale bonus\
  \ on attack rolls against that creature type (maximum +4 bonus) and 1d8 temporary\
  \ hit points (maximum 20 temporary hit points) for 5 rounds.\nAlternatively, if\
  \ the wearer is an inquisitor or has the bane class feature, she can instead choose\
  \ to gain 1 additional round of her bane class ability. If the wearer has the rage\
  \ class feature, she can instead regain one use of a rage power that has been exhausted\
  \ (a power that is available either once per rage or once per day). The wearer can\
  \ gain only one benefit per round from the torc, even if she confirms multiple critical\
  \ hits in a single round. These benefits must be used within 1 hour of their accrual;\
  \ if not used by that time, they are lost as the wearer's hatred subsides."
