description: "You change a specially prepared quarterstaff into a Huge treant-like\
  \ creature, about 24 feet tall. When you plant the end of the staff in the ground\
  \ and speak a special command to conclude the casting of the spell, your staff turns\
  \ into a creature that looks and fights just like a treant. The staff-treant defends\
  \ you and obeys any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it\
  \ cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. If the staff-treant is reduced\
  \ to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise,\
  \ the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires (or when\
  \ the spell is dismissed), and it can be used as the focus for another casting of\
  \ the spell. The staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any\
  \ wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared."
