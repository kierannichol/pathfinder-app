name: "Scroll of Mirage Arcana"
description: "This spell functions like hallucinatory terrain, except that it enables\
  \ you to make any area appear to be something other than it is. The illusion includes\
  \ audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements. Unlike hallucinatory terrain,\
  \ the spell can alter the appearance of structures (or add them where none are present).\
  \ Still, it can't disguise, conceal, or add creatures (though creatures within the\
  \ area might hide themselves within the illusion just as they can hide themselves\
  \ within a real location)."
