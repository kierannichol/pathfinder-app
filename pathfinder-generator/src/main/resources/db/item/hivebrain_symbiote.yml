description: "This red maggot constantly writhes and distends, snapping a small pair\
  \ of pincers. A combination of hellwasp and worm, the hivebrain symbiote grants\
  \ an echo of a hive mind when attached to an intelligent creature. When placed on\
  \ the back of a host's neck as a standard action, the hivebrain symbiote attaches\
  \ painlessly and immediately boosts the host's mental faculties. While having a\
  \ hivebrain symbiote attached, as an immediate action the host can reroll a concentration\
  \ check or an Intelligence-based check. The host must take the second roll, even\
  \ if it is worse. An attached hivebrain symbiote continues to function for a number\
  \ of hours equal to the host's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 hour) before falling\
  \ off and dying. A hivebrain symbiote dies immediately if removed before this time\
  \ elapses."
