description: "This item is indistinguishable from a normal broom. It is identical\
  \ to a broom of flying by all tests short of attempted use.\nIf a creature attempts\
  \ to fly using the broom, the broom does a loop-the-loop with its hopeful rider,\
  \ dumping him on his head from 1d4+5 feet off the ground (no falling damage, since\
  \ the fall is less than 10 feet). The broom then attacks the victim, swatting his\
  \ face with the straw or twig end and beating him with the handle end. The broom\
  \ gets two attacks per round with each end (two swats with the straw and two with\
  \ the handle, for a total of four attacks per round). It attacks with a +5 bonus\
  \ on each attack roll. The straw end causes a victim to be blinded for 1 round when\
  \ it hits. The handle deals 1d6 points of damage when it hits. The broom has AC\
  \ 13, CMD 17, 18 hit points, and hardness 4."
