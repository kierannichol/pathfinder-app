  \ damage as though it were one size category larger (1d3 for a Small whip, 1d4 for\
  \ a Medium whip, and so on). In addition, on command a frostkiss whip deals lethal\
  \ damage instead of nonlethal damage, and it can deal damage even against creatures\
  \ with armor bonuses greater than +1 or natural armor bonuses higher than +3."
