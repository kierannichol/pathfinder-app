description: "This book is bound in thick, rough rawhide. Several cloth ribbons are\
  \ attached to the spine and used as bookmarks, each with a yellowed tooth tied to\
  \ the loose end. Two silver plates are bound to the spine, each depicting the stylized\
  \ face of a different beast. The spells and stories recorded throughout the book\
  \ are each written in a different handwriting, ranging from neat block script to\
  \ wild looping letters that are difficult to read at first glance."
