description: "This grisly bag is worn by a member of a coven and binds its sisters\
  \ together even across vast distances. The coven charm can be charged by placing\
  \ a sizable chunk of flesh—at least the size of a finger, toe, or tongue—from a\
  \ member of the coven into the bag as a full-round action. Removing an appropriate\
  \ offering from her own body deals 1d6 points of damage to the respective coven\
  \ member, as well as a permanent negative level that cannot be regained until the\
  \ charge in the bag is expended. Each body part placed within the bag generates\
  \ 1 charge, and a coven charm can hold up to 3 charges.\nAs a full-round action,\
  \ the coven charm's wearer can spend charges from the bag to cast a spell that normally\
  \ requires the presence or her entire coven to cast. Expending 1 charge allows the\
  \ wearer to cast a spell of up to 4th level. Expending 2 charges allows the wearer\
  \ to cast a spell of up to 6th level. Expending 3 charges allows the wearer to cast\
  \ a spell of up to 8th level. These spells must be selected from those bonus spells\
  \ normally available to her collected coven.\nIf any member of the coven is slain,\
  \ the bag loses all remaining charges. Once a coven charm is drained of all charges,\
  \ it cannot be refilled for 24 hours, and it must be completely drained of all charges\
  \ before it can be refilled."
