description: "These linen bandages have the same color and softness as the feathers\
  \ of a dove, but their antiseptic smell suggests a less natural origin. Any creature\
  \ wrapped in these bandages recovers from wounds and ability damage each day as\
  \ if receiving complete bed rest, regardless of activity (Core Rulebook 191). A\
  \ creature actually receiving long-term care (from the Heal skill) or complete bed\
  \ rest while wearing the bandages gains a +4 bonus to its effective level or Hit\
  \ Dice when determining how many hit points it recovers each day. The bandages are\
  \ destroyed once removed or when the wearer recovers all hit points and ability\
  \ damage, whichever comes first."
