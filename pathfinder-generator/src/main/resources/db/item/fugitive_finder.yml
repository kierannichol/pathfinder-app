description: "This +1 human-bane light crossbow has a gold-colored metal lath and\
  \ a keyhole-shaped slot for the bolt to rest in. The wielder gains a +10-foot enhancement\
  \ bonus to his base speed. The church of Abadar typically commissions fugitive finders\
  \ to aid officials in chasing down and capturing escaped criminals, but Abadarans\
  \ also craft variants that have the merciful special ability instead of human-bane,\
  \ giving the wielder a better opportunity to capture a fleeing target alive."
