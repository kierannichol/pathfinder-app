description: "This alchemically infused wax is spread over exposed skin to protect\
  \ it from chapping, cold, dry winds, heat, and the loss of moisture. Applying it\
  \ takes 5 minutes; once applied, it reduces any nonlethal damage taken from cold\
  \ or hot environments by 1 point for 6 hours. Crafting blain bane requires a successful\
  \ DC 19 Craft (alchemy) check."
