description: "A bone house is a variant form of instant fortress most often employed\
  \ by elite agents of Nidal and influential members of Zon-Kuthon's faith. These\
  \ grim statuettes appear as skull-topped fortresses the size of a clenched fist.\
  \ When activated by speaking a command word, a bone house grows to form a tower\
  \ 20 feet square and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a crenellated\
  \ battlement on top. The bone walls extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to\
  \ the spot and preventing it from being tipped over. The fortress has a small door\
  \ that opens only at the command of the owner of the fortress—even knock spells\
  \ can't open the door.\nThe bone walls are magically enhanced to be as hard as stone,\
  \ and have 100 hit points and hardness 10. A bone house can be repaired by casting\
  \ inflict spells on the walls, with every 10 points of negative energy repairing\
  \ 1 point of damage. A bone house springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing\
  \ the device's owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his command. People\
  \ and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the\
  \ fortress's sudden growth. Anyone caught in the area takes 10d6 points of damage\
  \ (DC 19 Reflex save for half damage). The interior of a bone house is under the\
  \ constant effects of a desecrate spell and is considered an altar to Zon-Kuthon\
  \ for the purposes of determining the desecrate modifiers.\nOnce a bone house is\
  \ expanded into tower size, its owner can create up to four mummies per month from\
  \ the drifts of bone ash and detritus that litter the inner rooms. Creating a mummy\
  \ in this manner takes 10 minutes, and the owner must be inside of the bone house\
  \ the entire time. Due to the desecrate effect, mummies created inside gain +2 hit\
  \ points per Hit Die. These undead guard the contents of the bone house without\
  \ needing to be commanded. If the owner wishes to command these mummies to perform\
  \ other tasks, he must use other means to do so. No more than four mummies may be\
  \ active at one time.\nA bone house is deactivated by speaking a command word (different\
  \ from the one used to activate it). It cannot be deactivated unless it is empty."
destruction: "A bone house has hit points and hardness and can be destroyed largely\
  \ by mundane means. However, to fully destroy a bone house, its final hit point\
  \ must be taken by a positive energy effect, requiring a cure spell or similar effect\
  \ to be cast on the nearly ruined structure."
