description: "Harvested from the cytillesh fungus commonly found in the Darklands,\
  \ these small vials emit a bright blue glow, and are commonly used in intertribal\
  \ kobold disputes. When broken, a cytillesh stun vial releases a f lash of blue\
  \ light consisting of bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light in a 20-foot\
  \ radius. All creatures within the f lash area must make a Will save (DC 20). Creatures\
  \ that fail are stunned for 1d2 rounds if they're in the area of bright light, or\
  \ are confused for 1 round if in the area of dim light. Crafting this item requires\
  \ a successful DC 30 Craft (alchemy) check."
