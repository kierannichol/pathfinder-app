description: "Anyone who reads the entire hundred pages of blood-scripted text bound\
  \ within the Bone Grimoire (a task that requires 1 week of study and a successful\
  \ DC 25 Linguistics check by someone who can read Thassilonian) gains a +2 inherent\
  \ bonus to Intelligence as well as a permanent +4 insight bonus on Knowledge (arcana)\
  \ and Spellcraft checks associated with necromancy. In addition, the pages contain\
  \ information identical to that contained in a flesh golem manual—these pages restore\
  \ themselves and can be used once per year.\nA character who reads the Bone Grimoire\
  \ becomes somewhat separated from the living. His flesh takes on a pallid cast,\
  \ and he is now affected by positive and negative energy as if he were undead. If\
  \ the reader previously had the ability to channel positive energy, he now channels\
  \ negative energy. A miracle or wish can remove the effects of the Bone Grimoire,\
  \ both beneficial and otherwise."
destruction: "If the Bone Grimoire is subjected to the runewaking ritual, it is destroyed."
