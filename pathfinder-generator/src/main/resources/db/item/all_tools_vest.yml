description: "This well-made leather vest bears numerous shiny metal buttons, which\
  \ stud a number of bulging pockets. Once per day, as a standard action, the wearer\
  \ can speak the vest's command word and order it to bring forth all the standard\
  \ tools required to make checks for any one Craft skill. These tools appear in the\
  \ countless pockets of the vest or, if too heavy, on the floor, on a nearby shelf,\
  \ on a workbench, or in a toolbox or cupboard that appears nearby. Once summoned,\
  \ they remain for 24 hours or until another creature touches them, whichever comes\
  \ first."
