description: "This heavy cloth is dyed to match a single terrain type (chosen from\
  \ the ranger's list of favored terrains). This canvas can be stretched over an area\
  \ to obfuscate it from creatures wandering by. Creatures unaware of the setup must\
  \ succeed at a DC 14 Perception check to realize the covered area is actually a\
  \ canvas sheet. A camouflaged canvas is not waterproof, but it can be treated with\
  \ oil, resin, or wax to make it water resistant.\nPrice and weight are for 1 square\
  \ yard of canvas."
