name: "Scroll of Keen Edge"
description: "This spell makes a weapon magically keen, improving its ability to deal\
  \ telling blows. This transmutation doubles the threat range of the weapon. A threat\
  \ range of 20 becomes 19–20, a threat range of 19–20 becomes 17–20, and a threat\
  \ range of 18–20 becomes 15–20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing\
  \ weapons. If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the keen edge on a particular projectile\
  \ ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target. Treat\
  \ shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell."
