description: "This swan-feather quill helps its wielder verify signatures. The wielder\
  \ can store a signature in the quill by pressing the quill into the signature and\
  \ speaking a command word. She can then tap the quill's tip on another signature\
  \ to check if it was written by the same individual. The quill verifies the authenticity\
  \ of the signature as if it had attained a total result of 20 on a Linguistics check.\
  \ If the signature detects as legitimate (including skilled forgeries whose DC to\
  \ detect them is greater than 20), the quill glows blue. A quill of verification\
  \ can validate a signature up to 3 times per day. The wielder can switch the stored\
  \ signature any number of times between uses of the verification ability."
