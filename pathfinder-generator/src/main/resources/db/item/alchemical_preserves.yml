description: "Each small tin of this specially treated jam contains just enough of\
  \ the gooey stuff to provide a halfling with a single serving of revitalizing nourishment.\
  \ While any creature can eat these preserves as a standard action, it only affects\
  \ halflings in a beneficial way. Halflings who eat the preserves recover from fatigue.\
  \ Non-halflings who eat alchemical preserves become sickened for 1 round."
