description: "Made with dragon's gall, which is harvested from a recently deceased\
  \ dragon's liver, Dahak's fire is a volatile alchemical reagent. Though inherently\
  \ inert, the substance ignites when it comes into contact with fast-moving air,\
  \ which makes it ideal for application to blades or arrows. When applied to a weapon\
  \ or piece of ammunition as a standard action, the weapon deals an extra 2d6 points\
  \ of fire damage on the next successful hit.\nThe Dragoncrafting feat and a successful\
  \ DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check are required to convert 1 vial of dragon's gall into\
  \ 1 application of Dahak's fire."
