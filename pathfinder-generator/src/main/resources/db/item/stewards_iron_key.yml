description: "This simple iron key looks like something a castellan or majordomo would\
  \ carry on her key ring. When held in hand, the bearer can use open/close at will.\
  \ Once per day the bearer can speak a command word to use either arcane lock or\
  \ knock. Though Alseta's church may use more elaborate keys for important ceremonies,\
  \ the goddess's humble nature means most magical keys crafted by her followers are\
  \ nondescript items such as this one."
