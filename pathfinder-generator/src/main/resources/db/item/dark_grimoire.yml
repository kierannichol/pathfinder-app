description: "This heavy grimoire is bound in leather and has wicked-looking metal\
  \ clasps. The dark grimoire is a substantial text, nearly 1,000 pages long. Its\
  \ pages contain some good spells and some evil spells, though most aren't tied to\
  \ any alignment. It also contains an account of many of the beings of the Elder\
  \ Mythos and spells intended for summoning them.\nThe very act of reading the text\
  \ is dangerous. Every hour a reader studies the book, there is a 2% chance that\
  \ the reader encounters something too much for mortal minds to absorb and goes insane\
  \ (as per insanity). A successful DC 25 Will save negates the insanity, but each\
  \ time a creature succeeds at this save, the DC of the next Will save against insanity\
  \ from the dark grimoire increases by 5, and these increases stack. Unlike normal\
  \ for the insanity spell, only a wish or miracle can reverse the insanity inflicted\
  \ by the dark grimoire.\nUsing the dark grimoire to cast spells requires no spellcasting\
  \ ability—merely time. Casting any spell requires studying the book for a number\
  \ of hours equal to the spell's level (or 30 minutes for a 0-level spell). Any spell\
  \ that normally involves a costly material component instead requires sacrificing\
  \ humanoid creatures. Any spell that normally requires a costly focus instead requires\
  \ a focus built from the remains of sacrificed humanoid creatures. In both cases,\
  \ 1 Hit Die worth of sacrifices are required for each 25 gp that the component or\
  \ focus normally costs.\nSummoning an entity of the Elder Mythos requires studying\
  \ the book for a number of hours equal to double the creature's CR and making a\
  \ number of humanoid sacrifices equal to double the creature's Hit Dice. If an attempt\
  \ to summon a Great Old One is made in this manner, there is only a 25% chance that\
  \ it appears. If the Great Old One appears, there is an equal chance that it attacks,\
  \ ignores, or communicates with the creature that summoned it."
destruction: "The dark grimoire can be destroyed by burning it. However, many copies\
  \ exist, and destroying the artifact merely transfers its powers to a random copy\
  \ of the book. Destroying the dark grimoire permanently thus requires finding and\
  \ destroying all copies in existence."
