description: "Designed to meet the dual needs of the Chelish elite—glamour and subtlety—\
  the cloak of flash and shadow is a magic reversible cloak. When worn one way, the\
  \ cloak shimmers with heavy gold and silver embroidery against richly colored silk,\
  \ and grants you a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma.\nWhen worn inside-out, the\
  \ matte-black lining seems to absorb light, cloaking you in shadow and giving you\
  \ a +2 competence bonus on Stealth checks. In this configuration you can cast blur\
  \ three times per day.\nReversing the cloak's position is a standard action and\
  \ requires at least one free hand."
