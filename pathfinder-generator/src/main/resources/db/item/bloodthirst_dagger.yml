description: "The blade of this +2 wounding dagger is brightly polished. Even when\
  \ drenched in a victim's blood, it appears clean and dry moments later, as though\
  \ it has been newly cleaned.\nA bloodthirst dagger rewards its wielder most when\
  \ used relentlessly against a single target. When attacking a creature that is still\
  \ bleeding from the bloodthirst dagger's wounding property, the dagger deals an\
  \ additional +1 point of damage against the target for each bleeding wound the creature\
  \ possesses (maximum +10). Whenever the wielder of bloodthirst confirms a critical\
  \ hit with the weapon, she can choose to deal 1d6 points of additional damage for\
  \ each still-bleeding wound the target possesses (maximum +5d6 damage). This additional\
  \ damage is not multiplied by the critical hit, but is in addition to the damage\
  \ normally added for bleeding wounds. Dealing this damage immediately heals all\
  \ bleeding wounds possessed by the wielder."
