description: "This leather-bound book is inscribed with runes relating to outsiders\
  \ and conjuration magic. It enhances spells that summon monsters. The user may apply\
  \ the Extend Spell feat to these spells as they are cast. This does not change the\
  \ spell slot of the altered spell. The book counts as a metamagic rod for the purpose\
  \ of combining multiple metamagic effects on a spell. A normal book of extended\
  \ summoning can be used with spells of 6th level or lower, while a lesser book can\
  \ be used with spells of 3rd level or lower, and a greater book can be used with\
  \ spells of 9th level or lower. Each book is keyed to a particular alignment (equal\
  \ chances of chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) and only works when used to summon\
  \ a creature with that alignment. Once the book is used, it crumbles into cold ash\
  \ and is destroyed."
