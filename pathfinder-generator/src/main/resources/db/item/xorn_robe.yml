description: "This brown and gray robe is always dirty, and the chest and the back\
  \ of each shoulder is decorated with a gem-like eye pattern. The wearer gains a\
  \ +5 bonus on Perception checks, and can use earth glide to pass through up to 20\
  \ feet of natural or worked stone per day. The distance traveled with earth glide\
  \ does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 5-foot increments. The\
  \ wearer is able to safely chew, swallow, digest, and derive nutrition from gems,\
  \ precious metals, and metallic ore, with 100 gp worth of these materials sustaining\
  \ him for 1 full day. If the wearer removes the robe after such a meal, he is sickened\
  \ until 24 hours have passed since the last meal of this kind. Wearing the robe\
  \ again immediately negates this penalty."
