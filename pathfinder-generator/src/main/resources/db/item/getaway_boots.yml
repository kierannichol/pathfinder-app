description: "These rather nondescript boots can, once per day, be attuned to a location\
  \ their wearer is standing upon. Once the boots are attuned to a location, once\
  \ per day as a full-round action, the wearer, along with anything she is wearing\
  \ or carrying, teleports back to the attuned location as the getaway spell, except\
  \ that no allies are teleported when the boots are activated even if they were in\
  \ the area when the boots were attuned to their location. Once the boots are attuned\
  \ to a location, they continue to be attuned to the same location until they are\
  \ attuned to a new location."
