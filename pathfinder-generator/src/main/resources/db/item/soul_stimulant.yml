description: "This soothing elixir was created to counter the energy-draining effects\
  \ of vampires, wights, and similar horrible creatures. If you have a negative level\
  \ (whether temporary or permanent), you can drink a dose of soul stimulant, negating\
  \ the negative level's penalty for 12 hours. You can only benefit from 1 dose of\
  \ soul stimulant at a time, though you can continue to take a dose every 12 hours\
  \ to stave off the negative level's effects."
