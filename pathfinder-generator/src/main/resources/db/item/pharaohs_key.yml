description: "The Pharaoh's Key is a strange-looking device, possibly of Shory origin,\
  \ about 1 foot in diameter. The device's primary use is as an activation item to\
  \ trigger the firing of the Slave Trenches, yet it also grants protection against\
  \ elemental creatures as long as it is carried in one hand. The bearer gains a +5\
  \ deflection bonus to AC and a +5 resistance bonus on all saving throws against\
  \ attacks made by creatures with the elemental subtype. In addition, while the Pharaoh's\
  \ Key is held in one hand, the bearer's attacks ignore any damage reduction possessed\
  \ by a creature with the elemental subtype."
destruction: "To destroy the Pharaoh's Key, it must be fed to a mythic elemental who\
  \ must then be slain by disintegrate."
