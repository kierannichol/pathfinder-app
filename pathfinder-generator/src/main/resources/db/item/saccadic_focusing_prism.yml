description: "When this large, clear prism is held between the user and a text, it\
  \ allows the user to read that text quickly and still obtain a complete understanding.\
  \ The time needed to read any nonmagical text with a saccadic focusing prism is\
  \ reduced to one-tenth the time the user would normally require. The time required\
  \ to gain a benefit from any magical text (such as a tome of clear thought or a\
  \ manual of war) is halved. This has no impact on the time required to learn spells\
  \ or extracts from written sources."
