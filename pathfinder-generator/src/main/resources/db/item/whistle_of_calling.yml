description: "This whistle emits a loud, shrill note. Once per day when the user blows\
  \ this whistle his mount or animal companion is instantly teleported to a safe space\
  \ of the user's choice that's within 30 feet of him. The creature must be within\
  \ 1 mile, and any effect that bars or hampers teleportation also impedes this effect.\
  \ The whistle is useless unless attuned to a specific mount or animal companion;\
  \ attuning the whistle is a special ritual that takes 10 minutes. The whistle can\
  \ be attuned to a new mount or animal companion at will."
