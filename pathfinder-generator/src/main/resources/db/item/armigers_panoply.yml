description: "An armiger's panoply is a magic item set made up of one pair of bracers\
  \ and a large leather sack. The bracers are normally forearm guards made in the\
  \ style of masterwork padded or quilted cloth armor. They are often made of silk\
  \ or highquality linen, though they can also be crafted of leather or even chain\
  \ links. A command word is normally inscribed on the inside of one of the bracers.\
  \ The sack can be used to store a single suit of armor, including a shield. The\
  \ armor retains its normal weight when stored. If items other than a suit of armor\
  \ and a shield are put in the sack, they immediately fall through.\nThree times\
  \ per day, the wearer of the bracers can speak the panoply's command word to have\
  \ the suit of armor and shield stored in the sack teleport onto the wearer. The\
  \ sack must be within 500 feet of the wearer of the bracers in order to function.\
  \ If the wearer is already in a suit of armor, it is teleported into the sack at\
  \ the same time the new armor is teleported onto the user's body. As long as the\
  \ armor to be worn is the same size as the user, it fits perfectly and doesn't interfere\
  \ with anything else worn or hindering the user, including any grapple or tight\
  \ space the wearer might be trapped in."
