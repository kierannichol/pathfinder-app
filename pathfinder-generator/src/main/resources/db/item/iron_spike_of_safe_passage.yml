description: "When hammered into place this 9-inch iron spike creates an illusion\
  \ up to 15 feet high and in a 15-foot diameter centered on the spike. The illusion\
  \ can be of one of the following: a small hillock of appropriate composition for\
  \ the terrain, a pile of mundane crates or barrels, a mound of rubble, or a small\
  \ structure (such as a cabin or canvas enclosure). The exact size and specific parameters\
  \ (such the composition of timber) are chosen when the spike is placed. Interacting\
  \ with the illusion grants a Will save (DC 12) to disbelieve it.\nHammering the\
  \ spike into place or removing it is a full-round action. The spike can be used\
  \ any number of times and its effects last until removed."
