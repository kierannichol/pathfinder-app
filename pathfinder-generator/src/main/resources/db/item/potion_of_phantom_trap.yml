name: "Potion of Phantom Trap"
description: "This spell makes a lock or other small mechanism seem to be trapped\
  \ to anyone who can detect traps. You place the spell upon any small mechanism or\
  \ device, such as a lock, hinge, hasp, cork, cap, or ratchet. Any character able\
  \ to detect traps, or who uses any spell or device enabling trap detection, is certain\
  \ a real trap exists. Of course, the effect is illusory and nothing happens if the\
  \ trap is â€œsprung\"; its primary purpose is to frighten away thieves or make them\
  \ waste precious time."
