description: "A spike hilt can be added to any one-handed or two-handed sword or hafted\
  \ weapon, which conceals a dagger within the larger weapon. An observer who succeeds\
  \ at a DC 20 Perception check while carefully examining the larger weapon notices\
  \ the spike hilt. Drawing a dagger from the spike hilt is a swift action. This dagger\
  \ can be made masterwork or turned into a magic weapon at the normal cost."
