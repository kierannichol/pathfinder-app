description: "Created by suspending the spores of a shrieker mushroom in a thick mixture\
  \ of wheat paste and vermiculite, this thick sludge comes in a soundproof, stone\
  \ container. Shrieking paste creates an obnoxious piercing noise when exposed to\
  \ even minute amounts of movement or light. This makes applying the paste a very\
  \ noisy endeavor at best. However, once the paste is applied and left alone for\
  \ several rounds, it once again becomes silent. Thereafter, any light source or\
  \ movement within 10 feet of the paste causes it to shriek for 1d3 rounds. A single\
  \ container contains enough shrieking paste to coat 1 square foot of a surface.\
  \ If left undisturbed for several weeks in a dank, lightless setting, shrieking\
  \ paste might eventually grow into a colony of shrieker mushrooms (Core Rulebook\
  \ 416)."
