description: "When casting this spell, you create an illusory double that takes the\
  \ same space of you. That double makes it look like you are standing still, even\
  \ when you are not. While under the effects of this spell, you do not provoke attacks\
  \ of opportunity when you cast a spell, make a ranged attack with a thrown weapon,\
  \ or move out of your first square during a move action. It does not hide ranged\
  \ attacks made with any type of projectile weapon."
