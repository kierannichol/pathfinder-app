description: "The Kitharodian pen is an ink pen that produces its own ink and never\
  \ needs to be refilled. The user or last person to touch the pen can speak a command\
  \ word to cause it to begin taking dictation, recording all words audible from its\
  \ square. The pen has a Perception modifier of +0 and can write in all languages\
  \ but does not translate or enable its user to read what it has written. If held\
  \ in hand, the user can relax while the pen writes, seeming to be taking the dictation,\
  \ but the pen ceases to move of its own accord as long as the user intentionally\
  \ attempts to control its movements. The pen writes as quickly as the words are\
  \ spoken, but if multiple creatures speak over each other, each speaker must attempt\
  \ a Charisma check each round and the pen transcribes only the words of the speaker\
  \ with the highest result. A different command word causes the pen to cease writing.\
  \ The pen transcribes for up to 1 hour per day in 10-minute increments."
