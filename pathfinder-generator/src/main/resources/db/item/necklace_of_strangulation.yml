description: "A necklace of strangulation appears to be a wondrous piece of magical\
  \ jewelry. When placed on the neck, the necklace immediately tightens, dealing 6\
  \ points of damage per round. It cannot be removed by any means short of a limited\
  \ wish, wish, or miracle, and remains clasped around the victim's throat even after\
  \ his death. Only when he has decayed to a dry skeleton (after approximately 1 month)\
  \ does the necklace loosen, ready for another victim."
