description: "Iridescent whorls and runes in a flowing eldritch script adorn this\
  \ golden circlet. The circlet functions as a ring of spell knowledge, allowing a\
  \ spontaneous caster to learn and store an additional arcane spell. However, once\
  \ the circlet has been worn for 1d6 days, the wearer must succeed at a DC 16 Will\
  \ save each day when meditating to renew her spell slots. Failure indicates that\
  \ she loses knowledge of a random spell, whose level cannot exceed the maximum level\
  \ of the circlet of spell-eating. Knowledge of this spell is lost until the circlet\
  \ is removed, returning at a rate of one spell per day, beginning with the lowest-level\
  \ spell forgotten.\nSo long as the circlet of spell-eating has caused its wearer\
  \ to forget at least one spell, its creator can cast the first spell lost to the\
  \ item once per day as a spell-like ability."
