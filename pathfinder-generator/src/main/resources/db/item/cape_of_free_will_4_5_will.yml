description: "The wearer of this brightly colored patchwork cape gains a bonus on\
  \ all saving throws, as with a cloak of resistance, but the resistance bonus on\
  \ Will saves is one greater. Furthermore, if the wearer fails a Will saving throw,\
  \ he can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to reroll that saving\
  \ throw. If the wearer fails the saving throw on the reroll, he can't use this ability\
  \ again for 24 hours."
