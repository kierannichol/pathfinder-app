description: "The Drakesbane Horn is a 4-foot-long spiraling horn cut from the skull\
  \ of a primordial drake. Its surface is carved with an intricate pattern of interlocking\
  \ knots inlaid with silver and copper. When sounded, the horn can drive off or attract\
  \ dragons of all varieties. Lesser dragons such as drakes typically flee in terror\
  \ from the sound of the Drakesbane Horn, while more powerful dragons are compelled\
  \ to seek out the horn. Creatures must be able to hear the horn to be affected by\
  \ it.\nThe Drakesbane Horn affects dragons based on their CR, as detailed below.\n\
  Creatures of the dragon type of CR 5 or less within 400 feet must succeed at a DC\
  \ 13 Will save or be affected as if by scare (no HD limit).\nCreatures of the dragon\
  \ type of CR 6 to CR 10 within 400 feet must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be\
  \ affected as if by sympathy.\nAdult or older true dragons and creatures of the\
  \ dragon type of CR 11 or greater are immune to the horn's effects, though they\
  \ are likely to seek out the horn and attack its bearer.\nIf the character playing\
  \ the horn has the bardic performance class feature or the raging song class feature\
  \ and succeeds at a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check, dragons of CR 5 or less\
  \ are instead affected by fear (Will DC 16), while dragons of CR 6 to CR 10 affected\
  \ by the horn's sympathy effect must succeed at an additional Will save (DC 10 +\
  \ 1/2 the character's level + the character's Charisma modifier) or also be fascinated\
  \ for as long as the character continues to play the horn.\nA creature that successfully\
  \ saves against the horn's effects is immune to further blasts for the next 24 hours.\
  \ Note that the Drakesbane Horn does not grant the character playing it any ability\
  \ to communicate with or otherwise control creatures affected by the horn."
destruction: "The Drakesbane Horn is destroyed if it is soaked in the blood of an\
  \ ancient dragon and then played by a stone giant elder."
