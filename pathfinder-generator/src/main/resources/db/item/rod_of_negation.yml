description: "This device negates the spell or spell-like function or functions of\
  \ magic items. The wielder points the rod at the magic item, and a pale gray beam\
  \ shoots forth to touch the target device, attacking as a ray (a ranged touch attack).\
  \ The ray functions as a greater dispel magic spell, except it only affects magic\
  \ items. To negate instantaneous effects from an item, the rod's wielder needs to\
  \ have a readied action. The dispel check uses the rod's caster level (15th). The\
  \ target item gets no saving throw, although the rod can't negate artifacts (even\
  \ minor artifacts). A rod of negation can function three times per day."
