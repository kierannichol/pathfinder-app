description: "Alchemically treated to enhance their natural heat-generating properties,\
  \ these round or ovoid stones of volcanic glass provide enough heat to keep chambers\
  \ warm in the coldest winter. One heatstone keeps a 20-foot-square area comfortably\
  \ warm even in extreme cold (below –20° F), or a 40-foot-square area in severe cold\
  \ (between 0° F and –20° F). A single heatstone is activated by striking it against\
  \ any hard surface, after which point it continues to provide heat for 24 hours.\
  \ An active heatstone does not give off enough heat to cook food or cause damage."
