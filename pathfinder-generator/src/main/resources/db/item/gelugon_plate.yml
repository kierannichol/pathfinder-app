description: "This iridescent +3 Hellknight plate is cold to the touch, and the fiendish\
  \ features that swirl across the plates shed gouts of cold mist. The wearer of this\
  \ armor gains cold resistance 10. Any creature that ends its movement within 5 feet\
  \ of the wearer must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw or be staggered for\
  \ 1 round, numbed by the cold emitted by the armor. A creature that succeeds at\
  \ its saving throw is immune to the effects of that gelugon plate for 24 hours.\
  \ The wearer of a suit of gelugon plate can suppress or reactivate this effect as\
  \ a standard action.\nA Hellknight (or Hellknight signifer with heavy armor proficiency)\
  \ wearing this armor can cast wall of ice three times per day."
