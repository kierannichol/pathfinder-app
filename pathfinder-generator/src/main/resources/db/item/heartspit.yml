description: "Fitted with a menacingly cruel 2-foot-long barbed iron head, this Large\
  \ +1 giant-bane longspear can skewer an opponent, lodging beneath the flesh and\
  \ holding fast. On a confirmed critical hit with the spear, Heartspit's wielder\
  \ can attempt a combat maneuver check to grapple the target as a free action. This\
  \ grapple attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the target if that\
  \ creature is not threatening the wielder. While grappling a creature with Heartspit,\
  \ the wielder can move or damage the target with the spear only on the wielder's\
  \ turn. The wielder is still considered grappled, though he does not have to be\
  \ adjacent to the target to continue the grapple. If the wielder ends the grapple\
  \ or the target successfully breaks the grapple, the target takes 4d6 points of\
  \ slashing damage as the spear's barbed head is ripped free."
