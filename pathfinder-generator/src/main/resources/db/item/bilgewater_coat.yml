description: "This +1 putrid padded armor is made up of colorful silks, complete with\
  \ a ruffled collar that is accented with a brass button. Whenever a creature that\
  \ is adjacent to the wearer confirms a critical hit against her, slimy bilgewater\
  \ gushes from inside the coat onto the ground, landing in the attacking creature's\
  \ space. Each creature touching the ground in this space when this effect activates\
  \ must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex saving throw or fall prone. For the next 5 minutes,\
  \ the bilgewater replicates the effects of grease in that square, and any creatures\
  \ that move through it, including the wearer of the coat, must attempt Acrobatics\
  \ checks as the grease spell requires."
