description: "One end of this 6-foot-long pole supports a wide metal hoop covered\
  \ by a thin mesh net. You can use this to sift objects from material capable of\
  \ passing through the net, such as sand or water. You can also use a butterfly net\
  \ to capture Fine or Diminutive creatures as if it were a net (weapon), though you\
  \ don't need to re-fold the butterfly net if you miss, and you use the handle of\
  \ the butterfly net like you would the rope of a net weapon."
