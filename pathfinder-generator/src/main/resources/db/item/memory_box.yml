description: "This 3-inch cubic puzzle box is coated in dark lacquer and elegantly\
  \ decorated with gold leaf, mother-of-pearl, and precious stones. Opening the box\
  \ requires 1 minute and a successful DC 22 Intelligence check, which can be attempted\
  \ only once per day. The box opens into a nondimensional space, like a bag of holding,\
  \ that can contain up to 2 cubic feet or 20 pounds of material. Even when the box\
  \ is filled, its weight remains negligible.\nA memory box can store more than just\
  \ material. Once per day, if the user speaks a command word when the box is open,\
  \ she can recount one piece of knowledge she possesses to remove that knowledge\
  \ from her mind, as repress memory, and store it in the box. If the user speaks\
  \ a command word when the box is closed and then opens it within 1 minute, she can\
  \ mentally review any of her memories that are stored in the box and permanently\
  \ erase or instantly restore any she wishes. Memories stored in the box can't be\
  \ restored by other means. Once she closes the box, the user retains the knowledge\
  \ that the box contains stored memories, but no details regarding which. A creature\
  \ that has one or more memories stored in the box gains a +12 circumstance bonus\
  \ on the Intelligence check required to reopen it.\nThe user can't review stored\
  \ memories that belong to someone else. Memories that are erased from the box can\
  \ be restored to their owner only by break enchantment, psychic surgery, limited\
  \ wish, miracle, or wish. A memory box can contain up to 12 memories at a time.\
  \ Storing a new memory when the box is already at its full capacity causes the oldest\
  \ memory to be erased, regardless of whose memory it is."
