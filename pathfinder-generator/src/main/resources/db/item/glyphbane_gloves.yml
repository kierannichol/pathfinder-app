description: "These dark-brown, leather gloves are etched over their entire surface\
  \ with arcane insignia. The wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Disable Device\
  \ checks made to disable magical traps. Once per day, if the wearer's check to disarm\
  \ a glyph, rune, or similar writing-based magical trap exceeds the DC by 10 or more,\
  \ she may change the trigger condition of the trap instead of disabling it. The\
  \ new trigger condition must be one allowed by the magical trap; for example, a\
  \ glyph of warding cannot be set according to class, HD, or level, even when manipulated\
  \ by the gloves."
