description: "This magical full-body suit completely protects the wearer from temperature\
  \ extremes (as if by endure elements) and pressure dangers of hard vacuum and all\
  \ worlds in the system (save the sun), though it only carries enough air for 3 days\
  \ before it must be recharged in breathable atmosphere (such as that inside a ship).\
  \ If the suit's seal is broken—such as the helmet being removed to eat or drink—\
  all the air escapes in 2d6 rounds. A suit with a broken seal confers only the benefits\
  \ of endure elements. The suit automatically repairs small holes, but if it is struck\
  \ by a critical hit from a piercing or slashing weapon, the wearer of the pressure\
  \ suit must succeed at a Reflex save (DC equal to the opponent's confirmation roll)\
  \ or the seal breaks. A suit with a broken seal can be repaired with a DC 18 Craft\
  \ (armor) check or a make whole spell. The suit does not compensate for changes\
  \ in gravity. Wearing a pressure suit imposes a –1 armor check penalty; this penalty\
  \ stacks with those provided by other equipment (such as armor). Since it takes\
  \ up both the body and helm slots, armor can be worn over a pressure suit, but robes\
  \ and helms cannot."
