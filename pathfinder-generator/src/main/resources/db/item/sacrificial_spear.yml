description: "An ashen shaft with a steel blade, this finely crafted masterwork shortspear\
  \ holds a removable shard of carnelian at its base. By crushing the gem as a move\
  \ action, the spear explodes as per the spell fireball. This detonation is centered\
  \ on the spear and deals 5d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 20-foot-radius\
  \ spread. The spear's bearer or allies are not immune to this damage (unless they\
  \ have immunity to fire from another source) and the weapon is destroyed.\nA sacrificial\
  \ spear can be detonated at a range by spending a full-round action to throw the\
  \ spear and crush the gem. If the attack roll hits the target, the fireball is centered\
  \ on the target, otherwise refer to the thrown weapons chart to determine where\
  \ the spear lands. Each spear has a specific shard attuned to it at the time of\
  \ its creation, which can be removed or reaffixed to its spear as a standard action."
