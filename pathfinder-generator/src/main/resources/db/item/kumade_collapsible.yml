description: "This weapon acts as a kumade, but the handle consists of bamboo sections\
  \ held together by a taut rope running through the center. Releasing the rope is\
  \ a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity and causes the weapon to\
  \ collapse into a bundle that fits into a backpack. Reassembling the collapsible\
  \ kumade requires a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity."
