description: "This stone functions as normal, but the number of temporary hit points\
  \ gained from the azure briolette ioun stone cannot exceed the user's Charisma bonus\
  \ (minimum 0).\nResonance: This stone allows the user to pick up on psychic resonance\
  \ from corpses. So long as the user has carried the ioun stone continuously for\
  \ at least 24 hours, the first three corpses touched by the user each day babble\
  \ residual psychic impressions into the bearer's mind. This functions as the grave\
  \ words spell, except that only the user can hear the corpse speak."
