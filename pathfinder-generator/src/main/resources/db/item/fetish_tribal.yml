description: "Tribal fetishes vary from tribe to tribe, but are generally small, carved\
  \ wooden or stone religious symbols, luck tokens, or curious naturally occurring\
  \ objects specially carved to resemble something of significance (such as an acorn\
  \ with a wolf fangs, a dried mushroom with skull-shaped blotches, or a stone with\
  \ a lizard carved on it). A goblin divine spellcaster can use a tribal fetish as\
  \ a divine focus for spellcasting."
