description: "This +1/+1 meteor hammer is always made of ferrous metals, and has weighted\
  \ spheres on either end of its sturdy dark chain. A wielder can use the magic within\
  \ a polarity hammer to attract or repel metal objects. In meteor mode, a wielder\
  \ gains a +2 bonus on all drag and reposition combat maneuvers against any opponent\
  \ wearing metal armor, carrying a metal shield, or made of metal (like an iron golem).\
  \ In addition, if the wielder makes a successful trip attempt against such an opponent,\
  \ she can push her enemy 5 feet away rather than pulling it forward.\nIn fortress\
  \ mode, the wielder can use a move action to pick up any unattended metal object\
  \ within her reach and deposit the item in any other square within her reach. Items\
  \ so affected cannot exceed the size of a one-handed weapon equal to the wielder's\
  \ size category. In this mode, the +1 shield bonus to Armor Class normally granted\
  \ from wielding a meteor hammer increases to +3, but only against opponents wearing\
  \ metal armor, carrying metal shields, or made of metal (as above)."
