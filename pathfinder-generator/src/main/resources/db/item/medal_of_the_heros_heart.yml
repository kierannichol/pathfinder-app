description: "The medal of the hero's heart is an honorary pendant frequently bestowed\
  \ upon noble crusaders and warriors of goodly churches. The church of Iomedae frequently\
  \ award these medals to heroes on the front lines of the Worldwound. Though it may\
  \ take a variety of appearances depending on its crafter and the champion it is\
  \ awarded to, a medal of the hero's heart nearly always features some depiction\
  \ of a human heart. The wearer of a medal of the hero's heart gains a +4 sacred\
  \ bonus on saving throws to remove temporary negative levels.\nAlternatively, the\
  \ wearer of the medal of the hero's heart can expend the medal's magic as an immediate\
  \ action to avoid gaining 1 permanent negative level. Doing so causes the medal\
  \ to shatter, destroying it."
