description: "Upon drinking this elixir, a character permanently transforms their\
  \ biology to take on a different set of sexual characteristics of their choice.\
  \ While the imbiber's physiology changes dramatically and their features adjust\
  \ slightly to take on the new qualities, the imbiber is still recognizable as the\
  \ same person. The character has only minor control over the specific details of\
  \ this new appearance, and the elixir grants no benefit on Disguise skill checks\
  \ or similar checks.\nThis elixir's magic functions instantaneously and can't be\
  \ dispelled, though drinking a second elixir of sex shift either reverts the character\
  \ back to a former form or allows them to adopt alternate sexual characteristics,\
  \ as they choose. The elixir has no effect on characters who are pregnant or are\
  \ of races with no sexual differentiation. Most races have a wide spectrum of sexual\
  \ differentiation, some common, others more rare. Therefore, most creatures can\
  \ decide how this elixir transforms them. An unwilling imbiber can choose not to\
  \ change at all."
