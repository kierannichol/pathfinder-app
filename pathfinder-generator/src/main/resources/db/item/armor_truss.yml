description: "This collection of flexible strips of wood, durable shims, and thin\
  \ cords allows you to prop open the buckles, padding, and plates of armor for easy\
  \ entry. If you take at least 15 minutes preparing an empty suit of armor with an\
  \ armor truss, you are considered to have help in putting on the armor and can don\
  \ the armor in the time it usually takes to don the armor hastily without worsening\
  \ armor check penalties or decreasing armor bonuses."
