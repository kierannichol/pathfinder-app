description: "This finely cut and polished stone is indistinguishable from an ordinary\
  \ jewel in appearance. When it is gazed through, a gem of seeing enables the user\
  \ to see as though she were affected by the true seeing spell. A gem of seeing can\
  \ be used for as many as 30 minutes a day, in increments of 5 minutes. These increments\
  \ do not need to be consecutive."
