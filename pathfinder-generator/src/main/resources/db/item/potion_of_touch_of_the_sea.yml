name: "Potion of Touch of the Sea"
description: "You cause webs to grow between the target's fingers and its feet to\
  \ transform into flippers, granting a swim speed of 30 feet along with the standard\
  \ +8 bonus on Swim checks and the ability to take 10 even if distracted or endangered.\
  \ You can also use the run action while swimming, provided you swim in a straight\
  \ line. This transformation causes any boots or gloves the target is wearing to\
  \ meld into its form (although magic items with a continuous effect continue to\
  \ function). This spell does not grant the target any ability to breathe water."
