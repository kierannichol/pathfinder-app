description: "When the necromancer Osmyrd Glavis was lynched in southern Taldor, his\
  \ final utterance of hatred infused the very rope that was cutting into his flesh,\
  \ resulting in the first noose of terminal embrace. Since then, many others have\
  \ duplicated the magic item, yet the original remains lostâ€”though some say it still\
  \ hangs about the neck of its undead master.\nWhen a noose of terminal embrace is\
  \ placed around the neck, it immediately activates, tightening and dealing 2d4 points\
  \ of damage at that moment. Removing the noose thereafter requires a full-round\
  \ action and a successful DC 18 Strength check (with failure resulting in an additional\
  \ 2d4 points of damage).\nWhile the noose is worn, its frayed end dangles a foot\
  \ or so from the neck, but once per day if the wearer of the noose is successfully\
  \ grappled by a Large or smaller creature, the wearer may will the noose's length\
  \ to extend and lash out at the attacker. This allows the wearer to immediately\
  \ attempt a grapple check against the attacker; if successful, he establishes the\
  \ grapple on the attacker rather than the other way around, and the attacker's attempt\
  \ automatically fails (although the attacker may attempt to grapple the wearer in\
  \ the future)."
