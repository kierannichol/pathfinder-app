  \ which represents one of the fundamental elements in the color, shape, and quality\
  \ of the light that passes through it. The lantern shines light as per the light\
  \ spell, and as long as the bearer carries it the lantern protects her from heat\
  \ and cold as per endure elements. (The bearer can turn the lantern's light off\
  \ or on as a standard action.)\nIn addition, while carrying the lantern, the bearer\
  \ gains a +2 competence bonus on Spellcraft checks to identify spells with the air,\
  \ earth, fire, or water descriptor and a +2 competence bonus on Knowledge (planes)\
  \ checks to identify creatures that are native to the Elemental Planes.\nThe greater\
  \ version of this item also allows the bearer to use certain spell-like abilities.\
  \ As a standard action, the bearer of a greater lantern of the four elements can\
  \ press one of the lantern's four panels to produce an effect: levitate for the\
  \ air panel, resist energy (fire only) for the fire panel, air bubble for the water\
  \ panel, and spider climb for the earth panel. Each panel can grant its effect only\
  \ once per day."
