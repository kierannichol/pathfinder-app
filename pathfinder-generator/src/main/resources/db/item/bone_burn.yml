description: "This flask of volatile chemicals contains traces of graveyard dirt and\
  \ a few drops of blood from a righteous creature. You can throw a bone burn flask\
  \ as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Against non-undead creatures,\
  \ a bone burn flask functions as a normal flask of acid. Against undead creatures,\
  \ the bone burn flask deals double damage. On the round following a direct hit,\
  \ a skeletal undead damaged by a bone burn flask takes 1d6 additional points of\
  \ damage (Reflex DC 15 negates). Crafting this item requires a successful DC 20\
  \ Craft (alchemy) check."
