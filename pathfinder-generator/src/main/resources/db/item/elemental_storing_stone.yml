description: "This small stone appears to be a normal river rock shot through with\
  \ veins of white marble. At the beginning of each day, an elemental storing stone\
  \ activates and can begin storing elemental energy. If the wielder of the stone\
  \ takes 10 or more points of a single type of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity,\
  \ fire, or sonic), the stone becomes charged with that energy. A charged elemental\
  \ storing stone can be used to launch a single ray attack of the energy type stored\
  \ within. The ray is a ranged touch attack with a range of 60 feet that deals 2d6\
  \ points of damage on a successful hit. An elemental storing stone may be used once\
  \ per day. If the stone is charged and not used by the beginning of the next day,\
  \ the charge is wasted and the stone must be charged again to function."
