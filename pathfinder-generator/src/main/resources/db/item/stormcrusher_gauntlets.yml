description: "These speckled metal gauntlets provide a noticeable prickling sensation\
  \ when donned. Three times per day when the wearer would take electricity damage,\
  \ she can attempt a Strength check as an immediate action to catch the electricity\
  \ and crush it into harmless sparks that deal no damage (DC = 10 + 1 per 10 points\
  \ of damage).\nIf the wearer possesses mythic tiers (see Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures),\
  \ she can also expend one use of her mythic power to reshape the crushed lightning\
  \ into a variety of forms: blasts of electric force, blinding showers of sparks,\
  \ or even lassos. This allows the wearer to perform a bull rush, dirty trick, grapple,\
  \ reposition, or trip combat maneuver on her next turn against any opponent within\
  \ range (10 feet per mythic tier she possesses). If the wearer succeeds at this\
  \ combat maneuver check, her opponent also takes an amount of electricity damage\
  \ equal to the wearer's combat maneuver check result (up to a maximum of the original\
  \ electricity effect's damage). Creatures immune to electricity damage are immune\
  \ to this ability. If the wearer expends the mythic power but doesn't attempt to\
  \ use the crushed lightning by her next turn, the energy surges out, dealing the\
  \ original effect's electricity damage to the wearer with no save granted."
