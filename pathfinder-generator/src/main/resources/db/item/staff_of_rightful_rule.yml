description: "This staff is a single piece of mithral carved with lines and small\
  \ dots and encrusted with blue and violet gemstones at either end. The runes marking\
  \ it are a mixture of Auran and Infernal terms, intertwined. The staff delivers\
  \ a shocking grasp (CL 15th) to any creature other than the staff's owner that holds\
  \ it, and no chaotic creature can become its owner. Asserting ownership requires\
  \ a successful DC 20 Use Magic Device or Charisma check made while holding the staff.\
  \ Once a creature becomes the staff's owner, it remains so until another creature\
  \ asserts ownership.\nA staff of rightful rule has 10 charges when it is created.\
  \ In addition to the normal method of recharging staves, spent charges from a staff\
  \ of rightful rule can be restored by casting dictum into the staff. Each casting\
  \ restores 1 charge, but the staff may never hold more than 10 charges at any one\
  \ time. The staff allows use of the following spells:"
destruction: "A staff of rightful rule may be destroyed by a word of chaos targeted\
  \ at the staff. The caster of the spell must succeed at a DC 30 caster level check\
  \ to destroy the staff. If the caster fails this check, the staff deals 10d6 points\
  \ of damage to him."
