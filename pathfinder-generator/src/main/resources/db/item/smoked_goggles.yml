description: "These spectacles have lenses made of smoked glass that help protect\
  \ against creatures with gaze attacks. You are always treated as averting your gaze\
  \ when dealing with gaze attacks, and you gain a +8 circumstance bonus on saving\
  \ throws against visual-based attacks (any attack that a blind creature would be\
  \ immune to). You take a –4 penalty on Perception checks while wearing the goggles,\
  \ and all opponents are treated as having concealment (20% miss chance)."
