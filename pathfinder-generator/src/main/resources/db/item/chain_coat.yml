description: "This relatively simple armor consists of heavy chains that wrap around\
  \ your body and limbs. While it weighs more and provides less protection than other\
  \ medium armors, it is also less of a hindrance. In addition, if you are wielding\
  \ a spiked chain, you can affix it to one hand. This functions as a locked gauntlet,\
  \ and if you are proficient with spiked chains, you can treat the spiked chain as\
  \ a one-handed weapon while it is attached. You can affix a spiked chain to each\
  \ hand this way, but you can't wear locked gauntlets while wearing a chain coat,\
  \ and you can't attach any weapon to a chain coat except spiked chains."
