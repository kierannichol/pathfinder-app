description: "These sheer and silky robes, many of which are made of spider silk,\
  \ are of the finest quality. On command, a living garment can make a number of subtle\
  \ adjustments to itself, including coloring, fit, and basic design, accommodating\
  \ and accentuating whatever mood the wearer wishes to convey. It always remains\
  \ clean, and automatically repairs damage to itself at a rate of 1 hit point per\
  \ round (hardness 0, 4 hit points). It also grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus\
  \ on Diplomacy checks."
