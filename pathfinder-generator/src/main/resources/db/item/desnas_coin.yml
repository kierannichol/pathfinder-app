description: "This standard gold coin typically has two blank faces, but its owner\
  \ can cause the holy symbol of Desna—a butterfly with the sun, the moon, and stars\
  \ on its wings—to appear on either face at will. This proves especially useful when\
  \ performing coin flips, as the owner of a Desna's coin can essentially guarantee\
  \ that the result will end up in her favor.\nAs one would expect of an item associated\
  \ with the goddess of luck, a Desna's coin confers on its owner an uncanny ability\
  \ to fortuitously avoid sudden threats. As a result, its bearer gains a +2 luck\
  \ bonus on Reflex saving throws."
