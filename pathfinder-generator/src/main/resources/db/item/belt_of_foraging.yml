description: "This belt allows its wearer to easily forage while in the wilderness.\
  \ As long as the wearer of this belt has at least 1 rank in Survival, she need not\
  \ make a check to get along in the wild; she always succeeds at that Survival check\
  \ as long as she moves at half her overland speed. She can still choose to make\
  \ that check to provide food and water for one other creature for every 2 points\
  \ by which her result exceeds DC 10. Furthermore, she can instead make a DC 20 Survival\
  \ check to get along in the wild while moving at full speed instead of half speed.\
  \ While doing so, she can provide food and water for one other creature for every\
  \ 2 points by which his check result exceeds 20."
