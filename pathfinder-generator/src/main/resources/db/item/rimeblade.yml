description: "This +1 frost scimitar has been forged from a single piece of razor-sharp,\
  \ super-hardened ice. A rimeblade automatically resizes itself to match the size\
  \ of its wielder, and if a rimeblade is damaged, the wielder can cause the blade\
  \ to melt away and reform with full hit points as a full-round action. This ability\
  \ cannot be used if the weapon is destroyed.\nOnce per day on command, the wielder\
  \ can transform a rimeblade into a beam of ice-cold flame called rimefire. The weapon\
  \ is still wielded as scimitar, and attacks with the blade-like beam are melee touch\
  \ attacks that deal 1d8+3 points of cold damage (regardless of the wielder's size).\
  \ Because the beam is immaterial, the wielder's Strength modifier doesn't apply\
  \ to damage. In addition, a creature that takes cold damage from the rimefire beam\
  \ is covered in clinging frost and is entangled for 1 round. The rimefire beam lasts\
  \ for 1 minute, after which the weapon returns to its normal form.\nIn addition,\
  \ once per day as a swift action before an attack, a rimeblade's wielder can cause\
  \ the blade to glow with a pale blue radiance. On a successful attack, the rimeblade\
  \ deals an additional 4d6 points of cold damage and causes the target to be staggered\
  \ for 1 round. If the attack is a critical hit, the target is staggered for 1 minute\
  \ instead. This effect ends after a single attack, regardless of whether the attack\
  \ is successful or not."
