description: "A planar keystone is a small cube etched with runes. Each planar keystone\
  \ is attuned to a specific site on a particular plane—this site must be determined\
  \ when the planar keystone is created and cannot be changed at a later date. Anyone\
  \ examining the etched patterns can determine the plane and location with a successful\
  \ DC 20 Knowledge (planes) check. Once per day, up to eight intelligent creatures\
  \ within 20 feet of the planar keystone can concentrate upon its etched patterns\
  \ for 1 minute. This concentration is tenuous; if any of the creatures are attacked\
  \ or pause to take other actions during this time, the concentration of all participants\
  \ is broken and the planar keystone's use for that day is lost. At the end of this\
  \ time, all creatures concentrating on the planar keystone are transported to the\
  \ planar keystone's site as if via plane shift, but arriving precisely on target.\
  \ The planar keystone travels with the creatures—it is not left behind in the process."
