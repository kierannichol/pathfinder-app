description: "This small cast-iron cauldron has ring handles and three latches that\
  \ can secure the lid in place. While the pot can be used for cooking and brewing\
  \ potions, when gripped by the handles, it can also be wielded as a +1 heavy mace\
  \ without imposing an improvised weapon penalty. As a standard action that provokes\
  \ an attack of opportunity, a potion can be sealed inside the cauldron, destroying\
  \ the potion and infusing the iron with its magic. As a free action when he successfully\
  \ strikes a creature with the battlepot, the wielder can inject the stored potion\
  \ into the target, treating the struck creature as if it had just consumed the potion.\
  \ Up to five potions can be stored in a battlepot at a time, but only one potion\
  \ can be expended per successful hit; the wielder decides which potion is discharged\
  \ with each blow."
