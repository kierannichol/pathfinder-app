description: "This fist-sized statue of a curled-up cat is crafted from gleaming moonstone.\
  \ When the statue is placed upon the chest of a helpless creature, it briefly animates\
  \ and stretches like a real cat waking up from a fitful sleep, then curls up again.\
  \ When this happens, the helpless creature is lulled into a deep sleep, and doesn't\
  \ awaken until the cat is removed from its chest.\nIf the creature placing the cat\
  \ expends three uses of mythic power while doing so, the helpless creature can't\
  \ be awoken for a week, even if the cat is removed. If the user instead expends\
  \ six uses of mythic power, the helpless creature can't be awoken for a month. If\
  \ the user expends 10 uses, the helpless creature can't be awoken for a year. If\
  \ the user expends 20 uses, the helpless creature can't be awoken for an entire\
  \ century.\nWhile in this sleep, the helpless creature's heart rate and breathing\
  \ slow to a barely perceptible rate. It doesn't need to eat or drink, though it\
  \ must still breathe and it ages normally while in this magical sleep. A wish, miracle,\
  \ or mythic break enchantment can end this magical sleep."
