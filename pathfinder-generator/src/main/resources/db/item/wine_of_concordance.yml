description: "This sweet white wine contains notes of apple, lemon, and peach and\
  \ is among the most citrus-flavored of the local wines produced in Caliphas. According\
  \ to traditional legends, drinking glasses of wine of concordance together can forge\
  \ strong bonds between those individuals who share it, both emotionally and magically.\n\
  Drinking a glass of wine of concordance takes at least 1 round, though many imbibers\
  \ take longer to savor the wine's fruity flavor. Creatures that each finish at least\
  \ one glass of the wine while within 10 feet of each other become aware of each\
  \ other, as per status (each drinker is aware of the direction and distance to each\
  \ other and any conditions affecting the others). In addition, while they're within\
  \ 100 feet of each other, the drinkers share equally in any wounds they take, as\
  \ per shield other. If a drinker moves more than 100 feet from any other drinker,\
  \ the shield other effect is suppressed, but it resumes functioning once the drinker\
  \ moves within range again. These effects last for 3 hours. A bottle of wine of\
  \ concordance contains six glasses' worth of wine."
