description: "This tea set includes an array of utensils, painted with pictures of\
  \ willows and flowers, used in traditional tea ceremonies: a small teapot, three\
  \ bowls of various sizes and shapes, six cups, bamboo utensils (a ladle, a scoop,\
  \ and a whisk), and several smaller containers, all stored in a wooden box. Once\
  \ per day, a user can spend 1 hour performing a tea ceremony with the tea set. At\
  \ the end of this time, the user must make a Diplomacy check. The tea used in the\
  \ ceremony must be green tea of exceptional quality (worth a minimum of 10 gp per\
  \ dose) or the user takes a â€“4 penalty on her Diplomacy roll to perform the ceremony.\
  \ Up to six creatures (including the user) can drink the tea brewed during the ceremony.\
  \ The tea's aroma arouses a sense of serenity in those who drink it, as they receive\
  \ an impression of the sights, sounds, and smells of a blooming willow grove at\
  \ sunset. The result of the user's Diplomacy check determines the effects of the\
  \ tea on those who drink it."
