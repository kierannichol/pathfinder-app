description: "These bracers look like normal protective wear. They empower the wearer\
  \ to use any bow (not including crossbows) as if she were proficient in its use.\
  \ If she already has proficiency with any type of bow, she gains a +2 competence\
  \ bonus on attack rolls and a +1 competence bonus on damage rolls whenever using\
  \ that type of bow. Both bracers must be worn for the magic to be effective."
