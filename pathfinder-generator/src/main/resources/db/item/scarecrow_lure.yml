description: "This life-sized scarecrow is garbed in old clothing and armor. At its\
  \ center is the real skeleton of a former adventurer. A scarecrow lure is enchanted\
  \ to writhe and cry out for help as if wounded. The lure's voice is usually that\
  \ of the adventurer whose remains are inside, though the creator may choose any\
  \ voice when creating the item. Anyone who hears or sees a scarecrow lure can attempt\
  \ a DC 11 Will save to disbelieve the effect. Activating a scarecrow lure is a standard\
  \ action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity."
