description: "This black silk quiver bears a silver star-and-moon motif. It can transform\
  \ up to 20 arrows per day into tangible beams of light. When drawn from the quiver,\
  \ these arrows produce light as the daylight spell for 5 rounds, after which they\
  \ disappear. Arrows enhanced in this way prove particularly deadly to light-sensitive\
  \ and shadowy creaturesâ€”an arrow altered by a nightbane quiver bypasses the DR of\
  \ any creature with light sensitivity and counts as a force effect against shadows\
  \ and wraiths. Arrows gain these benefits only when shot by the current owner of\
  \ the quiver. Arrows placed in this quiver retain any magical effect already placed\
  \ on them."
