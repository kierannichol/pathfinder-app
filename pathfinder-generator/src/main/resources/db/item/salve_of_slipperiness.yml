description: "This substance provides a +20 competence bonus on all Escape Artist\
  \ checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape from a grapple. The salve also\
  \ grants a +10 competence bonus to the wearer's CMD for the purpose of avoiding\
  \ grapple attempts. In addition, such obstructions as webs (magical or otherwise)\
  \ do not affect an anointed individual. Magic ropes and the like do not avail against\
  \ this salve. If it is smeared on a floor or on steps, the area should be treated\
  \ as a long-lasting grease spell. The salve requires 8 hours to wear off normally,\
  \ or it can be wiped off with an alcohol solution (even wine).\nSalve of slipperiness\
  \ is needed to coat the inside of a container meant to hold sovereign glue."
