description: "This radiant crown of steel is bedecked with miniature mithral swords.\
  \ A crown of swords can be used up to 10 times per day. When struck in combat, the\
  \ wearer may spend one use as an immediate action to create a longsword-shaped spiritual\
  \ weapon that then attacks her attacker. On the wearer's next turn, she may spend\
  \ one additional use each round to continue attacking that target with the spiritual\
  \ weapon; the spiritual weapon cannot be redirected and disappears if the target\
  \ is killed or moves out of range. Multiple spiritual weapons may be created (even\
  \ attacking the same target) if the wearer is attacked in subsequent rounds."
