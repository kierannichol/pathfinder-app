description: "This large, furry hat is sewn from the thick pelt of an animal native\
  \ to the frozen north, and has earflaps that can be pulled down or folded up over\
  \ the crown of the hat. When worn, an ushanka of the northlands grants its wearer\
  \ a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against cold effects and a +5 competence\
  \ bonus on Survival checks. When the earflaps are pulled down, the wearer gains\
  \ a +2 bonus on saving throws against sonic effects, but also takes a –2 penalty\
  \ on Perception checks made to hear. Pulling the earflaps down is a move action."
