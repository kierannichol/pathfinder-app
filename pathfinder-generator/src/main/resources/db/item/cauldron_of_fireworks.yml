description: "This heavy cauldron emits colorful smoke whenever a potion is poured\
  \ into it. Pouring a potion into a cauldron of fireworks is a standard action, and\
  \ a creature can use the fireworks cauldron to store a number of potions equal to\
  \ her Intelligence modifier. The wielder can command the cauldron to fire a stored\
  \ potion at a target within 30 feet as a standard action; the target creature is\
  \ affected as if it drank the potion. The wielder can target allies automatically,\
  \ but she must succeed at a ranged touch attack to target unwilling creatures.\n\
  Only the creature that placed potions in the cauldron of fireworks can command it,\
  \ and only one creature can store potions within the cauldron at a time. A new creature\
  \ adding a potion to the cauldron of fireworks immediately destroys any potions\
  \ currently stored within it. A creature that has the cauldron hex can command a\
  \ cauldron of fireworks she controls to fire potions stored by another user."
