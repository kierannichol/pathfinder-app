description: "These mithral +2 defending bastard swords are favored blades of the\
  \ Eagle Knights. Easily recognized by its eagle's-head pommel and golden quillons\
  \ crafted like upswept eagle wings, a talonstrike sword's defending special ability\
  \ also protects the wielder's mount. Once per day when the wielder confirms a critical\
  \ hit with a talonstrike sword, the wielder can cast dimensional anchor on the target\
  \ as a free action."
