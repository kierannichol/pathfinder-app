description: "Created by the Prophets of Kalistrade, this chest is approximately 2\
  \ feet wide and 1 foot long. On creation, the maker chooses 10 nonmagical items\
  \ worth under 100 gp that could fit within the chest's dimensions. They can be specially\
  \ created items for the chest (such as a silvered dagger) or a standard item (such\
  \ as 50 feet of silk rope). Thereafter, when the box is closed, the owner need only\
  \ speak the name of one of the the items, and it appears within the chest, ready\
  \ to be removed and used. A given item only appears once per day, and disappears\
  \ after 24 hours. Prophets use these chests to keep backups of important tools,\
  \ and to hide weapons in case of emergency."
