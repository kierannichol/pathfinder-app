description: "This round, rainbow-hued glass flask allows up to three alchemical splash\
  \ weapons of the same type to be poured into it, concentrating them such that they\
  \ never increase its weight noticeably. If multiple types of alchemical items are\
  \ poured in, all the contents are ruined. The flask can be thrown as a normal splash\
  \ weapon, and when it breaks, it releases all of the contained splash weapons in\
  \ the same space, and the focusing flask is destroyed. If the items held within\
  \ the flask normally allow a saving throw to reduce or negate the effects, the target\
  \ of a focusing flask needs to succeed at only a single saving throw, regardless\
  \ of the number of items held within the focusing flask. The DC of the saving throw\
  \ increases by 2 if the flask contains two alchemical items, or by 4 if it contains\
  \ three items."
