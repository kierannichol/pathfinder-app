description: "Ants occasionally crawl in and out of the numerous tiny holes dotting\
  \ these sturdy, thick-soled boots. The boots' wearer receives a +4 competence bonus\
  \ on Fortitude saving throws against swarms' distraction ability. Additionally,\
  \ once per day, the wearer can call forth a swarm of army ants as a standard action.\
  \ This functions as the spell vomit swarm, except the swarm crawls out from the\
  \ boots instead of being vomited forth. The swarm lasts for 13 rounds before dissipating."
