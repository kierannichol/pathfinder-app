description: "This hollow metal or wooden tube contains slow-burning powder. When\
  \ you light the fuse (a move action), it creates a 3-foot-long, blazing fountain\
  \ of red-hot fiery sparks. You wield this fountain of sparks as if it were a heavy\
  \ mace. Attacks with the fountain are melee touch attacks. The fountain deals 1d8\
  \ points of fire damage (your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage).\n\
  The fountain sheds light as a torch and can ignite combustible materials such as\
  \ parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth. Once ignited, it lasts for 1 minute.\
  \ If extinguished before this time, the remaining duration is wasted. Crafting this\
  \ item is a DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
