description: "This delicate needle is attached to fine springs and a small reservoir\
  \ that contracts on itself when the trap is disturbed or grabbed, turning a minor\
  \ prick into a painful injection. This trap is normally hidden under door latches,\
  \ drawer handles, and other small openings where it can deliver any injury poison,\
  \ destroying itself in the process. A roll of natural 1 on the skill check to install\
  \ the trap exposes its installer to the poison. A poison latch needle cannot be\
  \ reused.\nThis can be crafted with a DC 20 Craft (traps) check."
