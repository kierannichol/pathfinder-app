description: "Considered the greatest archers among the Shoanti people, the folk of\
  \ the Lyrune-Quah tribe treasure this +2 klar shaped from the skull of a lion. The\
  \ specific shape of the skull allows the wielder to properly hold and shoot a shortbow\
  \ (though not a longbow) while still benefiting from the Lyrune-Quah klar's shield\
  \ bonus.\nUp to three times per day as a free action, the wielder of a Lyrune-Quah\
  \ klar can utter praise to the nature totem of the moon. The next arrow fired after\
  \ the prayer trails a line of shimmering stars in its wake. If a creature is struck\
  \ by this arrow, the stars orbit it for the next 8 rounds, negating any concealment\
  \ for the target and causing it to emit light as if it were holding a sunrod."
