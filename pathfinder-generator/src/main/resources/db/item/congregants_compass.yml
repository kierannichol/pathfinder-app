description: "This ornate bronze compass aids the faithful in locating allies, or\
  \ inquisitors in identifying cultists. When a holy symbol is touched to a congregant's\
  \ compass as a standard action, the needle spins lazily for the next 5 minutes.\
  \ If a devoted member of the faith associated with that holy symbol (an outsider\
  \ servant, a mortal cleric, or a mortal worshiper carrying a holy symbol) is within\
  \ 60 feet of an activated congregant's compass, the needle spins rapidly for 3 rounds\
  \ before pointing in the direction of the nearest worshiper. The needle continues\
  \ to point to the nearest worshiper until the 5-minute duration expires, changing\
  \ its direction if another worshiper moves closer to the compass. The needle returns\
  \ to spinning lazily if all worshipers move out of range, although it reorients\
  \ to the nearest worshiper after another 3 rounds of rapid spinning if one approaches\
  \ within 60 feet. The congregant's compass's detection is blocked by a sheet of\
  \ lead, 1 inch of common metal, 1 foot of stone, or 3 feet of wood or dirt, and\
  \ spells such as misdirection and nondetection can foil it. A congregant's compass\
  \ doesn't detect the creature holding it, even if she worships the appropriate faith.\
  \ A congregant's compass can be used three times per day."
