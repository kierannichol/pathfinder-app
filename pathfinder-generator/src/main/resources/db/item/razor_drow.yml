description: "Meant for quick strikes and slashes, this long, slender knife is incredibly\
  \ sharp along one edge. Drow swashbucklers and assassins are particularly fond of\
  \ these weapons. A confirmed critical hit or successful sneak attack with a drow\
  \ razor deals an additional 2 points of damage; this damage is precision damage\
  \ and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A character with the drow's weapon familiarity\
  \ racial trait treats the drow razor as a martial weapon."
