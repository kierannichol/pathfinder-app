description: "Two large horns jut from the sides of this iron helm, each of them carved\
  \ with runes representing storms, thunder, and lightning. The runes give the wearer\
  \ the ability to control the elements and bring forth a great storm. Once per day,\
  \ the wearer can call upon the magic of the helm to call a thunderstorm, as if casting\
  \ the control weather spell. Like that spell, it takes 10 minutes to call the weather\
  \ and an additional 10 minutes for the thunderstorm to manifest. Once it does, the\
  \ wearer can call lighting (as the spell) for 10 minutes or until the wearer dismisses\
  \ the thunderstorm with a standard action."
