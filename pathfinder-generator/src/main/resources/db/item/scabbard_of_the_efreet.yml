description: "These black-and-red leather scabbards are produced in the distant Padishah\
  \ Empire of Kelesh; in the Inner Sea region, they are predominantly found in Qadira.\
  \ Each scabbard fits any bladed weapon, and has the bound essence of an efreeti\
  \ within. Any weapon drawn from the scabbard gains the flaming weapon special ability\
  \ for 5 rounds. Three times per day on command, the scabbard can impart the flaming\
  \ burst (Ultimate Equipment 141) weapon special ability to a weapon drawn from it\
  \ for 10 rounds.\nOnce per day, the wielder can summon a pyroclastic storm when\
  \ drawing a weapon from the scabbard. Treat this as an ice storm spell that deals\
  \ fire damage instead of cold damage. The storm is centered on the location of the\
  \ wielder, but doesn't harm or otherwise affect her."
