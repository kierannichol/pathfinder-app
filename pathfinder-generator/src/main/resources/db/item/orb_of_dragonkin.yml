description: "Each of the Orbs of Dragonkin holds power over a specific race of lesser\
  \ draconic creatures with the dragon type (except for true dragons). The bearer\
  \ of an Orb of Dragonkin can, as a standard action, dominate a creature of the orb's\
  \ particular variety within 200 feet (as dominate monster), with the targeted creature\
  \ being forced to make a DC 23 Will save to resist. Spell resistance is not useful\
  \ against this effect. Each Orb of Dragonkin grants the wielder the AC and saving\
  \ throw bonuses of the draconic creature the orb is associated with. These values\
  \ replace whatever values the character would otherwise have, whether better or\
  \ worse. These values cannot be modified by any means short of ridding the character\
  \ of the orb. The owner of an orb knows if there are draconic creatures of the type\
  \ the orb is related to within 10 miles at all times. Each Orb of Dragonkin also\
  \ has an individual power that can be invoked once per round at caster level 10th."
destruction: "An Orb of Dragonkin shatters if subjected to the breath weapon of a\
  \ true dragon of the same alignment as the orb's associated draconic creature."
