description: "This simple chalkboard consists of a book-sized wooden frame surrounding\
  \ a thin, rectangular slice of flat black slate. Though mediums typically use mundane\
  \ slates to demonstrate automatic writing, this magical version can obtain answers\
  \ to specific questions regarding a dead creature if the user has access to at least\
  \ a fragment of bone from the deceased's body. Once the user places a bone fragment\
  \ upon the slate, that fragment animates and begins scribbling answers to the following\
  \ four questions on the slate's surface."
