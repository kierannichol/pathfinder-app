description: "Boots of friendly terrain turn inhospitable territory into a perfect\
  \ hunting grounds for any ranger who wears them, so much so that his footprints\
  \ vanish behind him with each step he takes. Each pair of these supple leather boots\
  \ corresponds to a specific sort of environment as defined by the ranger's favored\
  \ terrain class feature (jungles, plains, and so on). A ranger wearing the boots\
  \ can treat the corresponding environment of the boots as one of his favored terrains,\
  \ granting him a +2 bonus. If he already has that particular environment as one\
  \ of his favored terrains, that terrain's bonus increases by 2."
