description: "This small relic is designed to resemble a holy symbol of a genuine\
  \ or fictional deity and can be worn about the neck. A charlatan's symbol contains\
  \ an extradimensional compartment that can hold one wand of a 1st-level cleric spell,\
  \ which becomes attuned to the symbol after 24 hours. Speaking a command word or\
  \ phrase activates the wand as if the user had succeeded at a DC 20 Use Magic Device\
  \ check, which also causes the symbol to glow faintly. Those observing a spell cast\
  \ through the use of a charlatan's symbol must succeed at a DC 20 Spellcraft check\
  \ in order to determine that the spell was cast from a wand rather than through\
  \ normal divine spellcasting.\nAfter using the symbol, the wearer receives a +5\
  \ circumstance bonus on Bluff checks related to the assumed religion against witnesses\
  \ for 24 hours.\nTo anyone using detect magic, the charlatan's symbol appears to\
  \ be nonmagical (as magic aura), as if it were a standard holy symbol."
