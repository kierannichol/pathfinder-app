description: "Favored by worshipers of Desna and elves alike, the silvery wooden limbs\
  \ and green riser of this +3 composite longbow are decorated with rows of tiny stars,\
  \ sparkling comets, and little moons. Arrows fired from this bow trail streams of\
  \ silvery light, and resemble shooting stars as they fly. Creatures that take penalties\
  \ in bright light take these penalties for 1 round after being struck by such an\
  \ arrow. An arrow shot from the starbow sheds light as a sunrod for 1 minute after\
  \ it is shot. A starbow responds to the strength of its wielder, acting as a bow\
  \ with a strength rating equal to its wielder's Strength bonus. The wielder can\
  \ fire it with a lesser Strength bonus (and cause less damage) if desired. Three\
  \ times per day as a standard action, the wielder can use a starbow to fire a 30-foot-long\
  \ cone of arrow-shaped bolts of radiance. All creatures in the area of effect take\
  \ 5d8 points of damage unless they are undead or creatures harmed by sunlight, in\
  \ which case the damage increases to 10d8. This damage bypasses damage reduction\
  \ and energy resistance. A successful DC 18 Reflex save halves the damage. A creature\
  \ that takes damage from this attack is shrouded with a soft radiance (as faerie\
  \ fire) for 1 minute."
