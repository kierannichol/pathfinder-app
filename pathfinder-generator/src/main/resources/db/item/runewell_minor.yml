description: "Runelord Alaznist, inspired by and jealous of Karzoug's success with\
  \ the runewell of greed, experimented with variant runewells of her own design.\
  \ Many of these minor runewells of wrath existed in her domain—though today most\
  \ are lost deep under the waters of the Varisian Gulf or are hidden away in Hollow\
  \ Mountain, with only the one remaining on mainland Avistan hidden in the Catacombs\
  \ of Wrath under Sandpoint.\nEvery time a creature with a wrathful soul (including\
  \ most goblins and quite a few of the victims murdered years ago by Jervas Stoot)\
  \ dies within a mile of a minor runewell, it gains 1 wrath point. There's no limit\
  \ to the number of wrath points the minor runewell can store, but it currently contains\
  \ only 20. Each time the well's waters are drawn upon (as detailed below), a number\
  \ of wrath points are expended. If enough points are expended to put its total at\
  \ 0 or negative wrath points, the minor runewell deactivates, its waters fading\
  \ away. Reactivating the minor runewell requires long-lost rituals—or the reactivation\
  \ of a major runewell somewhere else in the world. Such an event restores a minor\
  \ runewell of wrath to a starting level of 3 wrath points.\nA minor runewell is\
  \ only 3 feet deep, yet any living creature that enters its freezing orange waters\
  \ immediately takes 2d6 points of cold damage and must succeed at a DC 15 Will save\
  \ or be overcome with wrath. Failure indicates the creature becomes enraged (as\
  \ if under the effects of a rage spell) and immediately attacks the nearest living\
  \ creature. If no living creatures are in sight, the enraged creature is compelled\
  \ to seek out a victim, moving at full speed in its search. This rage persists for\
  \ 2d6 minutes, after which point the creature becomes fatigued. Each activation\
  \ of a minor runewell in this manner costs 3 wrath points.\nA minor runewell can\
  \ also be commanded to disgorge a sinspawn. To manifest a sinspawn, a creature need\
  \ only allow a few drops of its blood to fall into the pool. One round later, a\
  \ sinspawn emerges from the well and immediately attacks the closest creature in\
  \ which it cannot scent wrath. Each use of a minor runewell in this manner costs\
  \ 6 wrath points."
destruction: "Once a minor runewell of wrath is deactivated, it can be destroyed forever\
  \ by filling it with holy water that is then set to a boil for no less than 24 hours."
