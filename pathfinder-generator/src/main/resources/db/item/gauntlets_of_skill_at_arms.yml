description: "These finely crafted leather gauntlets have plates of silvered steel\
  \ covering the back, and silver buckles at the wrist and forearm. The gloves enable\
  \ the wearer to use any traditional elven weapon (longbows, composite longbows,\
  \ longswords, rapiers, shortbows, composite shortbows, and any weapon with the word\
  \ \"elven\" in its name) as if he were proficient in its use. If he uses such a\
  \ weapon and is already proficient with it, he gains a +1 competence bonus on attack\
  \ and damage rolls. Both gauntlets must be worn for the magic to be effective."
