name: "Potion of Healing Thief"
description: "With this spell you can steal the healing of the target creature. You\
  \ must succeed at a melee touch attack to strike the target. If you do, until the\
  \ effect ends, whenever your target is subject to a healing spell or a supernatural\
  \ effect that heals hit points, the target only receives half the healing (rounded\
  \ down) and you receive the other half (also rounded down). You must remain within\
  \ 25 feet (plus 5 feet per two caster levels) of the target to gain this benefit.\
  \ If you move outside that range, the spell is discharged. Once you steal 5 hit\
  \ points per your caster level (maximum 50 hit points) of healing from this spell's\
  \ effect, the spell is discharged."
