description: "Hand-painted images decorate this harrow deck, and the cards frames\
  \ are gilded in silver so that they sparkle and flash under lighting. Despite the\
  \ worn condition of the card backs, the images on the faces are so vibrant they\
  \ seem to move when viewed out of the corner of the eye. The deck handles with surprising\
  \ ease, almost shuffling itself. A bent, torn, or lost card always seems to mend\
  \ itself or reappear when no one is looking.\nThese features are subtle manifestations\
  \ of the spirit that haunts the cards. In life, Zellara lived by this deck, and\
  \ in death, she has become the deck. Although this magical harrow deck wasn't created\
  \ using the standard method for creating magic items, it should nonetheless be treated\
  \ as an intelligent magic item. Zellara can sense the world around the deck via\
  \ sight and sound, and she can communicate with anyone who holds the deck via empathy.\
  \ She can create a major image once per day, often doing so to generate an image\
  \ of herself manipulating the cards—in this manner, she can carry on conversations\
  \ with other creatures in Common or Varisian. She can also cast identify for anyone\
  \ who holds one of the cards of the deck to his forehead (a move action) up to three\
  \ times per day.\nZellara's harrow deck has a special purpose as well: to defend\
  \ and protect the city of Korvosa, her home in life and in death. In order to attain\
  \ this purpose, she can periodically perform powerful harrow readings for those\
  \ she has chosen as Korvosa's defenders—the PCs. These harrowings grant those who\
  \ benefit from them a number of Harrow Points that can be used to manipulate fate\
  \ and chance. See The Harrow on page 416 for more details on this complex power.\n\
  Zellara can suppress the deck's powers at will and doesn't hesitate to do so if\
  \ anyone attempts to sell the deck or otherwise displeases her. At best, a foolish\
  \ character could possibly sell the cards as a standard harrow deck for about 50\
  \ gp—thus, no pricing information for the deck is needed."
