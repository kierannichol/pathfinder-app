description: "Rather than opening to random locations across the planes, the shadow\
  \ well opens only to random locations on the Shadow Plane (or random locations on\
  \ the Material Plane when on the Shadow Plane). Regardless of which plane the user\
  \ opens the well from, there is a 15% chance it randomly diverts the user into the\
  \ Ethereal Plane, given its nature as a natural buffer between the two realities."
