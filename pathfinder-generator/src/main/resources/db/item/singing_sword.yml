description: "This +2 keen dancing longsword is infused with the soul of a bard who\
  \ chose to instill his consciousness into a weapon rather than to see his voice\
  \ die. The sword constantly sings. The only way to silence it to a whisper is with\
  \ a DC 15 Diplomacy or Intimidate check, and even this only quiets the sword for\
  \ 10 minutes plus another 10 minutes for every 5 points by which the DC is exceeded.\
  \ The sword speaks, though it typically communicates through song. A singing sword\
  \ has the following powers."
