name: "Potion of Arrow Eruption"
description: "You create exact duplicates of the arrow or crossbow bolt you used to\
  \ kill a creature in the previous round and launch one at enemy creatures within\
  \ a 30-foot radius of the corpse. You can target one creature per caster level (maximum\
  \ 15) within range of the burst and must make a single attack roll and apply it\
  \ to each arrow. These duplicate arrows possess all the intrinsic magical properties\
  \ of the arrow that killed the original creature as well as those passed on to it\
  \ by your bow. They also enjoy the full benefit of any bonuses or modifiers you\
  \ applied to the attack from other magical items, feats, and class or racial features.\
  \ However, this spell cannot reproduce any spells or other limited-use magical effects\
  \ that you used to enhance that particular attack. This includes such effects as\
  \ the true strikespell, as well as any area spell you might have placed on the arrow\
  \ by means of the arcane archer's imbue arrow class feature."
