description: "This heavy rod is carved to look like the fanged head of the river serpent\
  \ Apep, the primordial snake-being who was the deceiver, devourer, and destroyer\
  \ of the sun, light, and life. You can use the rod as a +1 heavy mace. If you are\
  \ chaotic, you can activate the other abilities of the rod.\nYou gain darkvision\
  \ at a range of 30 feet when you hold the rod. Once per day, you can use the rod\
  \ to create an eerie pattern of shadows that acts as a hypnotic pattern (Will DC\
  \ 13 negates); this pattern also acts as a dispel magic to any spells with the light\
  \ descriptor within its area of effect.\nWhen you confirm a critical hit with the\
  \ rod, it automatically attempts a grapple (+5 bonus) against the target as a free\
  \ action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the grapple check succeeds,\
  \ the snake head on the rod unhinges its jaw to swallow the target whole into a\
  \ flesh-walled extradimensional space. The swallowed target suffers 1d8 points of\
  \ bludgeoning damage per round on its turn and is considered grappled. It can escape\
  \ with a DC 20 Escape Artist check or by damaging the fleshy walls of the extradimensional\
  \ prison (AC 12, 24 hit points); either means of escape causes the rod's mouth to\
  \ expand and disgorge the trapped creature into a random adjacent square (as does\
  \ the death of a swallowed creature). The prison can hold 1 Medium, 2 Small, 8 Tiny,\
  \ or 32 Diminutive or smaller opponents."
