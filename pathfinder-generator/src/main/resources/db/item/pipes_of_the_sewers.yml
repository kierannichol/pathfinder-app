description: "If the possessor learns the proper tune, he can use these pipes to attract\
  \ 1d3 rat swarms if any rats are within 400 feet. For each 50-foot distance the\
  \ rats have to travel, there is a 1-round delay. The piper must continue playing\
  \ until the rats appear, and when they do so, the piper must make a DC 10 Perform\
  \ (wind instruments) check. Success means that they obey the piper's telepathic\
  \ commands so long as he continues to play. Failure indicates that they turn on\
  \ the piper. If for any reason the piper ceases playing, the rats leave immediately.\
  \ The Perform DC increases by +5 for each time the rats have been successfully called\
  \ in a 24-hour period.\nIf the rats are under the control of another creature, add\
  \ the HD of the controller to the Perform check DC. Once control is assumed, another\
  \ check is required each round to maintain it if the other creature is actively\
  \ seeking to reassert its control."
