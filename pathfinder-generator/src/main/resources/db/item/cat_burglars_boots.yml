description: "These soft-soled boots provide their wearer with a +2 competence bonus\
  \ on Acrobatics, Climb, and Stealth checks. Once per day as an immediate action,\
  \ the wearer of cat burglar's boots can reroll any one failed Acrobatics, Climb,\
  \ or Stealth check, taking the result of that check in place of the first failed\
  \ check (even if the second result is worse). In addition, a secret pocket in the\
  \ boots is built to hold a fully functional set of masterwork thieves' tools. A\
  \ DC 22 Perception check is required to notice this pocket. Any other object in\
  \ the pocket causes it to bulge and become obvious to even casual observation."
