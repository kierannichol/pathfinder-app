description: "Written and signed in blood, a pact parchment ensures the utter and\
  \ undeniable fulfillment of the actions stated within. Upon a pact parchment, you\
  \ can inscribe a contract, defining a certain service or course of action by one\
  \ or more creatures. If all listed creatures willingly (without magical influence,\
  \ threats, and so on) sign this pact in blood, they are bound to fulfill this agreement.\
  \ Henceforth everyone breaking the pact suffers a –4 penalty on attack rolls, saves,\
  \ ability checks, and skill checks, until they either satisfy the pact's conditions\
  \ (if still possible) or the parchment is destroyed."
