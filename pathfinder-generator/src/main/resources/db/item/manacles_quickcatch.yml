description: "These masterwork manacles are designed to swiftly secure a restrained\
  \ creature. The price includes a quick-release mechanism that, when attached to\
  \ a belt or pack, allows you to retrieve the quickcatch manacles with one hand as\
  \ a swift action. Quickcatch manacles include a good lock that locks automatically\
  \ when the manacles are applied. When you take the tie up action in a grapple, you\
  \ can lock your opponent in quickcatch manacles instead of using rope. The quickcatch\
  \ manacles must be sized appropriately for your opponent. Quickcatch manacles can\
  \ be constructed for creatures of different sizes using the same multipliers as\
  \ ordinary manacles."
