description: "This bone-white paste makes your face appear skeletal and emotionless,\
  \ like a visage of death itself. When you apply frightful war paint to yourself\
  \ (or to a willing adjacent creature) as a full-round action, attempt a Disguise\
  \ or Charisma check. Living creatures within 30 feet of the wearer must succeed\
  \ at a Will save (DC equal to the result of your Disguise or Charisma check, maximum\
  \ DC 20) or become shaken for 1d4 rounds. Blind creatures and creatures out of line\
  \ of sight are unaffected. A creature that succeeds at its check becomes immune\
  \ to this frightful war paint for 24 hours. Frightful war paint can be worn indefinitely,\
  \ but it contains quicksilver and realgar, which have deleterious mental effects.\
  \ If you wear frightful war paint for more than 1 minute per day (whether as a single\
  \ use of it or as multiple uses over several periods of time), you take 1 point\
  \ of Constitution damage, plus 1 point of Wisdom damage for every minute you wear\
  \ the paint that day after the first."
