description: "This advanced version of the blunderbuss shoots in a 30-foot cone when\
  \ firing pellets, and has a 20-foot range increment when firing a bullet (often\
  \ called a slug). Shotguns can either be simple and functional, or art pieces in\
  \ their own right, with engravings and inlay on the stocks and breeches. Those used\
  \ by the upper class are often emblazoned with images of game animals, family crests,\
  \ or elaborate maker's marks.\nA shotgun uses metal cartridges (loaded with either\
  \ a bullet or pellets) as ammunition. This is an advanced firearm."
