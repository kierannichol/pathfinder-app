description: "While most objects—such as ancient trinkets and jewelry— sold as purported\
  \ belongings of a Lung Wa emperor have no actual magical value, some do have magical\
  \ properties. Such items all function much the same way, despite taking a variety\
  \ of shapes and being attributed to different emperors. Whatever its origin and\
  \ form, a relic of a virtuous emperor can be used to cast augury three times per\
  \ day. It can also be used to summon one kodama or 1d4+1 shikigami as if they had\
  \ been summoned by summon nature's ally V, once per day. Additionally, anyone in\
  \ possession of a relic of a virtuous emperor gains a +1 insight bonus to AC."
