name: "Scroll of Entangle"
description: "This spell causes tall grass, weeds, and other plants to wrap around\
  \ creatures in the area of effect or those that enter the area. Creatures that fail\
  \ their save gain the entangled condition. Creatures that make their save can move\
  \ as normal, but those that remain in the area must save again at the end of your\
  \ turn. Creatures that move into the area must save immediately. Those that fail\
  \ must end their movement and gain the entangled condition. Entangled creatures\
  \ can attempt to break free as a move action, making a Strength or Escape Artist\
  \ check. The DC for this check is equal to the DC of the spell. The entire area\
  \ of effect is considered difficult terrain while the effect lasts."
