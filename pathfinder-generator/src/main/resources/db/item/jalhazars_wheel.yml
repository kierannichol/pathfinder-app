description: "Handles of polished bone and grim skulls decorate this ornately carved\
  \ ship's wheel. When grasped, the wheel's handles feel comfortably smooth. Those\
  \ who stand watch at the wheel claim to hear the whispered guidance of Captain Xiribal\
  \ Jalhazar, and occasionally feel ghostly hands holding the ship's course true.\
  \ When fitted to the helm of a ship, Jalhazar's wheel grants a +5 competence bonus\
  \ on sailing checks to turn the ship with the hard to port or hard to starboard\
  \ actions (Skull & Shackles Player's Guide 13). The wheel also halves the penalty\
  \ on sailing checks made when turning the ship while traveling at three or more\
  \ times the ship's acceleration. In addition, the ship's pilot can combine a hard\
  \ to port or hard to starboard action with a full ahead or heave to action as a\
  \ full-round action up to three times per day."
