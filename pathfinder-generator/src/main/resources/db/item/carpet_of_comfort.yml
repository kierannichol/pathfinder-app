description: "This specialized carpet of flying always measures 10 feet by 10 feet.\
  \ When it's in flight, its passengers are shielded from wind and extreme temperatures\
  \ as if inside a tiny hut (though without creating an opaque, immobile sphere).\
  \ In addition, once per day while the carpet of comfort is on the ground, a command\
  \ word transforms the carpet into an opulent silk tent that, other than its appearance,\
  \ is equivalent to a secure shelter."
