description: "Grave candles are magical candles that draw forth spirits from the mortal\
  \ remains of long-dead creatures, allowing the living to speak to these spirits\
  \ for a short period while the candle's wick burns. In order to function, a grave\
  \ candle must be placed amid the physical remains of the body whose spirit the user\
  \ wishes to contact. These remains can be partial, or even just a handful of ash\
  \ or grave dust, but a totally destroyed body (as results from destruction or disintegrate)\
  \ doesn't leave enough material for a grave candle to function. When the candle\
  \ is lit, the smoke rising from the candle grows thick, and a ghostly shape similar\
  \ to the creature's appearance in life manifests in the smoke.\nAt this point, the\
  \ manifested spirit (which is as much an echo of the creature as it is the actual\
  \ departed soul) can speak. A grave candle does not impart any additional understanding\
  \ of languages to its user. In other respects, the conversation with the dead spirit\
  \ adheres to the rules for speak with dead, save that the dead spirit takes a –\
  4 penalty on its saving throw to resist the spell. Furthermore, a dead body can\
  \ be subjected to the effects of a grave candle only once—the burning of a grave\
  \ candle effectively burns out the latent necromantic and spiritual energy left\
  \ behind by the soul's departure from the world (this does not harm the actual soul\
  \ of the dead spirit, however) and destroys the candle."
