description: "A broken chain link of tempered steel is embedded in the head of this\
  \ +1 warhammer. If the wielder successfully uses the hammer to make an attack or\
  \ perform a sunder combat maneuver against a nonmagical metal chain or an object\
  \ made of nonmagical chain links (excluding weapons or armor), it deals an additional\
  \ 2d6 points of damage. In addition, once per day as a standard action, the wielder\
  \ can speak a command word to attempt to remove a compulsion spell or effect from\
  \ a willing creature that is within 30 feet, as per break enchantment. The owner\
  \ can use this ability as long as she has the Andoren emancipation hammer on her\
  \ person, even if she's not wielding it; however, when targeting an unwilling creature,\
  \ the wielder must succeed at a touch attack, and may choose to forgo the damage\
  \ that would usually be dealt. (If the wielder's attack misses, the hammer's magic\
  \ is not expended.) The owner of the hammer can use this ability to remove a compulsion\
  \ from herself, as long as the compulsion doesn't prevent it."
