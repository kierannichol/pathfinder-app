description: "This heart-shaped locket is attached to a thin metal chain made of looped\
  \ strands of gold or silver. Inside the locket is a small, spring-loaded vial that\
  \ can hold a single dose of powdered poison. Loading the locket with poison carries\
  \ the same risks as applying poison to a weapon. When the locket is opened, the\
  \ vial is shattered by a ball bearing, releasing the powder into the air and treating\
  \ the poison's type as if it were inhaled. The airborne poison affects all creatures\
  \ within 10 feet of the locket."
