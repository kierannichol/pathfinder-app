description: "A boarding pike is an 8-foot-long pole topped with a foot-long tapered\
  \ metal tip. Boarding pikes look much like longspears, but the metal pike is designed\
  \ to flow into the wooden haft, leaving no grooves, collars, or spikes that could\
  \ trap salt water and cause rust. Boarding pikes are mainly used defensively, to\
  \ repel boarding actions. The pikes are kept in brackets around the mast, so sailors\
  \ can quickly grab pikes and brace them against the gunwale to repel boarders."
