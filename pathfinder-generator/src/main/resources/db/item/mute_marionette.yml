description: "Every mute marionette appears as a hag with its lips sewn shut. The\
  \ creator of a mute marionette chooses a creature type or subtype from the ranger's\
  \ list of favored enemies to which the doll is attuned. If the doll's owner is within\
  \ 30 feet of one or more creatures of the attuned type, the owner can shake the\
  \ doll as a standard action. Creatures of the attuned type must attempt a DC 11\
  \ Will save; on a failure, for the next hour, affected creatures have a 10% chance\
  \ of failing to cast spells or spell-like abilities as long as they remain within\
  \ 30 feet of the doll. Regardless of the result of its save, a creature cannot be\
  \ targeted by a mute marionette more than once per 24 hours. Once per day, a mute\
  \ marionette can be presented forcefully to cast confusion (DC 16) at an area within\
  \ 170 feet, affecting all creatures of the attuned type in a 15-foot-radius burst."
