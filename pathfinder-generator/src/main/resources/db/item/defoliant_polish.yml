description: "This container of sickly gray paste can coat the armor of one Medium\
  \ or two Small creatures. Affected objects produce dark gray fumes for the next\
  \ 24 hours. These fumes cause natural plants to wilt and diminish as soon as they\
  \ come into contact with the affected armor. This allows the wearer to move through\
  \ terrain made difficult due to the presence of vegetation as if it were normal\
  \ terrain, though the creature leaves a clear path of ruined vegetation. In addition,\
  \ creatures belonging to the plant type that target someone protected by defoliant\
  \ polish with a natural attack or grapple take 1 point of damage with each successful\
  \ attack or each round they maintain the grapple."
