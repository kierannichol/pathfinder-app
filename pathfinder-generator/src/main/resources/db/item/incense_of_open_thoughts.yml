description: "While a block of this sweet-scented incense burns, creatures inhaling\
  \ its fumes become unusually receptive to thought. In still air, the incense's smoke\
  \ permeates a 40-foot-by-40- foot area to a height of 20 feet. Creatures within\
  \ that area can communicate telepathically with other creatures in the area. Creatures\
  \ communicating in this fashion don't need to share a language, but must have an\
  \ Intelligence of 3 or higher. The openness of mind engendered by the incense also\
  \ provides a +5 insight bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks against creatures\
  \ in the area, and imposes a –5 penalty on Bluff and Intimidate checks against such\
  \ creatures and a –2 penalty on saving throws against mind-affecting effects.\n\
  Moderate wind halves the area of the smoke. Strong wind disperses the incense, rendering\
  \ it ineffective as long as the wind continues. A single block of incense of open\
  \ thoughts burns for 1 hour. It can be extinguished and relit, but each use consumes\
  \ at least 10 minutes of its remaining duration."
