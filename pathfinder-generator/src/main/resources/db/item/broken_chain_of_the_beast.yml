description: "This 8-foot length of corroded, broken chain is threaded with a leather\
  \ strap to hold it together; it is worn like a belt and must be tied in place, as\
  \ it lacks a buckle. Once per day, the wearer can call upon its power to summon\
  \ an evil creature from the summon monster I list; the creature attacks the wearer's\
  \ enemies if any are present, but it is not under the wearer's control and attacks\
  \ the wearer or the wearer's allies if there are no more enemies to kill.\nIf Rovagug\
  \ is the wearer's patron, the wearer can gain the benefits of a rage spell once\
  \ per day by speaking the god's name. If the wearer is ever bound, shackled, or\
  \ otherwise rendered helpless while still conscious, this rage ability automatically\
  \ activates if the wearer hasn't already used it that day."
