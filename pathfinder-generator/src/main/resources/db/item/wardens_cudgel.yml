description: "Commonly created by members of the Green Faith, this type of +1 greenwood\
  \ club is made from knotted wood, is covered in thorns and vines, and looks as though\
  \ it is still alive. Twice per day when the wielder hits a target with a warden's\
  \ cudgel, vines, leaves, and roots instantly grow from the target's square in a\
  \ 15-foot radius. These plants remain for 1 minute and are treated as difficult\
  \ terrain and natural plant growth for the purposes of the woodland stride class\
  \ feature. If the area already has brush and trees in it, the plants in the affected\
  \ area instead grow as the overgrowth version of plant growth."
