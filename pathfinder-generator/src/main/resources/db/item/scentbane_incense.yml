description: "Scentbane incense is a form of smokestick that also blocks most scents.\
  \ As long as the smoke lasts, creatures with the scent special ability must make\
  \ Perception checks, opposed by the Stealth checks of any creatures within the smoke,\
  \ to use scent to locate creatures within the smoke. If a creature remains in scentbane\
  \ incense for 5 rounds or more, the smoke clings to it for 1 round after it leaves,\
  \ making it similarly difficult to find by scent during that time."
