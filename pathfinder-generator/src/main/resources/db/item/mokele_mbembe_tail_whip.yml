description: "This item is crafted from tightly braided rawhide from a water buffalo\
  \ skin, and is usually awarded to a prominent member of a tribe. The mokele-mbembe\
  \ tail whip functions as a +2 whip, but deals an additional 1d6 points of sonic\
  \ damage on a successful hit. In addition, anyone hit by a critical hit with the\
  \ whip must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. A successful\
  \ critical hit with the whip does not multiply the weapon's sonic damage."
