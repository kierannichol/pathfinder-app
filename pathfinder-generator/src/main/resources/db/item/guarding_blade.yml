description: "This +1 dancing short sword automatically rises up to defend a fallen\
  \ or sleeping wielder. To activate the sword, the wielder must fall unconscious\
  \ or die while wielding the weapon or holding it in her hand. Thereafter, should\
  \ any creature other than an ally of the wielder attempt to touch or strike him\
  \ with a melee attack, the sword attacks that creature for up to 4 rounds. After\
  \ 4 rounds, the weapon drops in the wielder's square. Unless the guarding blade\
  \ is an intelligent item, it lacks the wits to make decisions about which is the\
  \ best opponent to attack, and when confronted by multiple opponents attacking the\
  \ wielder, it tends to select a random target each round."
