name: "Potion of Shifting Sand"
description: "You cause an earthen or sandy surface to shift and churn within the\
  \ area. The shifting sandobliterates tracks and is considered difficult terrain.\
  \ Acrobatics checks in the area take a penalty equal to your caster level (maximum\
  \ +10). Creatures entering or beginning their turn in the shifting sandmust make\
  \ a Reflex save each round or become entangled until the beginning of their next\
  \ turn. If they attempt to move while entangled, they must make a second Reflex\
  \ save or fall prone. Creatures with the stability racial trait (like dwarves) may\
  \ apply it as a bonus on their saving throws."
