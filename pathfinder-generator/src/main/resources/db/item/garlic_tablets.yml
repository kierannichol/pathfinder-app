description: "These small gray-white tablets are made of dehydrated and condensed\
  \ garlic bulbs. One hour after you eat a garlic tablet, you begin to stink as the\
  \ essence of the tablet seeps out of your pores. This state lasts for 4 hours. Subsequent\
  \ doses of garlic tablets reset this duration. During this time, you can keep a\
  \ vampire at bay (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 270) as a free action without need of\
  \ a holy symbol or mirror. The vampire must succeed at a DC 25 Will save to overcome\
  \ its natural revulsion to garlic; failure means it must stay at least 5 feet away\
  \ from you and cannot touch you or make melee attacks against you. However, unlike\
  \ while keeping a vampire at bay with a mirror or holy symbol, once the vampire\
  \ succeeds at its save against the garlic tablets, it's no longer affected by that\
  \ creature's odor and may act normally without need of further saving throws.\n\
  Garlic tablets are valuable aids to vampire hunters, but while benefiting from the\
  \ tablets' strong odor, you take a â€“2 penalty on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based\
  \ skill checks for the duration of the effect. The listed price is for three tablets.Crafting\
  \ garlic tablets requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
