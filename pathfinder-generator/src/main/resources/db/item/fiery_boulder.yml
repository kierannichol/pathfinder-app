description: "A fiery boulder is a large, roughly boulder-shaped version of alchemist's\
  \ fire favored by giants. A direct hit from a fiery boulder deals 2d6 points of\
  \ fire damage and 5 points of fire damage to every creature affected by its splash\
  \ damage. All creatures affected by a fiery boulder's direct damage take an additional\
  \ 2d6 points of fire damage the following round; affected creatures can use a full-round\
  \ action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage."
