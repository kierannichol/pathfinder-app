description: "This traditional Osirian crown—known as a khepresh, or \"war crown\"\
  —made of hardened blue leather and adorned with discs of blue-tinted electrum and\
  \ a rearing, hooded cobra of gold, was crafted specifically for the Sky Pharaoh\
  \ Hakotep I. The khepresh of refuge grants its wearer a +3 deflection bonus to AC\
  \ and fire resistance 10. In addition, the crown has 3 charges per day. When struck\
  \ by a critical hit or sneak attack, the wearer can spend 1 charge as an immediate\
  \ action to negate the critical hit or sneak attack (as the fortification armor\
  \ special ability, but without requiring a roll). The damage is instead rolled normally.\
  \ Alternatively, the wearer can spend 1 charge as an immediate action to reroll\
  \ a failed saving throw. He must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse."
