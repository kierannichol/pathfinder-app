description: "This 5-foot-long pole is fitted with a metal spike at its base. A trekking\
  \ pole is meant to assist with overland movement, particularly long hikes and travel\
  \ through difficult terrain. If you use a trekking pole as part of overland movement,\
  \ you increase your distance traveled by 10% (so a creature with a 30-foot base\
  \ speed travels 3-1/3 miles in 1 hour of walking, instead of just 3 miles). While\
  \ traveling in areas of impaired movement—such as a trackless desert or a swamp\
  \ trail—the increase to distance traveled while using a trekking pole increases\
  \ to 25%."
