description: "Rather than opening to locations on different planes, this well instead\
  \ opens to worlds on the Material Plane. It does not, however, necessarily open\
  \ to worlds with similar environments to that of its user; hence it can pose much\
  \ the same danger as the traditional well in terms of both the unpredictable environs\
  \ of the destination and the alien beings that might step through from the other\
  \ side."
