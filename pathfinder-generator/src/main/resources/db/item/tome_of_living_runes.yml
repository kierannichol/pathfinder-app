description: "This massive, metal-bound tome is filled with 20 thin pages of beaten\
  \ copper, each indented with arcane sigils and Thassilonian runes. These runes seem\
  \ to shimmer and twist and writhe when read, and the phrases and words they spell\
  \ out are utter nonsense. By studying a page with a successful DC 20 Linguistics\
  \ check, a person can make sense of the runes and as a full-round action can cause\
  \ the runes on that page to swim together into a single shape that immediately leaps\
  \ off the page to serve the user in one of three ways. The rune can manifest as\
  \ a living rune (see page 88) that serves the user for 15 rounds, as if it had been\
  \ summoned via a summon monster spell. The rune can infest and deactivate any symbol,\
  \ glyph of warding, or other trap made of magical writing with a +25 Disable Device\
  \ check. The rune can also be made to float around the user's head for 10 rounds,\
  \ during which time it can be used as an additional material component when casting\
  \ a spell that creates magical writing. Doing so causes the spell to be cast at\
  \ +1 caster level. Once a rune is activated, the page in the tome of living runes\
  \ on which the rune was written goes blank. Only one rune can be active at any one\
  \ time."
