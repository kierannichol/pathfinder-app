description: "The wave harp is an unusual musical instrument that was popular in ancient\
  \ Azlant. Three thin mithral rods extend from a thick plate, emitting invisible,\
  \ short-range fields that respond to specific movements with notes of different\
  \ pitches and timbres. Plucking the air between the mithral rods creates a variety\
  \ of tones that a skilled musician can work into complicated chords and melodies.\n\
  The music of a wave harp is usually thin and high pitched, even when the lower notes\
  \ are played closest to the plate. A wave harp is generally placed upon a stool\
  \ or table at waist height to the musician, but it can be fitted with a strap to\
  \ hang in front of the musician like a marching drum. As the necessary finger-motions\
  \ are something between playing an organ and a zither, a musician can use either\
  \ Perform (keyboard) or Perform (strings) to play a wave harp, although a musician\
  \ without ranks in both skills takes a –4 penalty on his Perform checks.\nThere\
  \ is no limit to the time a wave harp can be played as a mundane instrument, but\
  \ the device has two additional magical effects that can be activated by anyone\
  \ playing the wave harp as a standard action three times per day. First, the musician\
  \ can conjure a pair of ghostly hands made of sonic energy to assist in plucking\
  \ the air for 1 minute; the hands automatically assist the wearer with Perform checks,\
  \ providing a +2 bonus on Perform checks with the instrument for 1 minute. These\
  \ hands also absorb errant noises that would impact the performance, providing the\
  \ musician with sonic resistance 10. Second, the musician can cause the wave harp\
  \ to emit a discordant wail. The musician attempts a DC 15 Perform check with the\
  \ wave harp; on a success, all creatures within 30 feet other than the musician\
  \ take a –2 penalty on saving throws against sonic effects for 1 round, plus 1 additional\
  \ round for every 5 points by which the Perform check result exceeds the DC."
