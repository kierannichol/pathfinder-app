description: "A 2-foot-long blade extends from the heavy crossbar of this +1 boar\
  \ spear. Designed to catch and hold humanoid prey, a spear of manhunting automatically\
  \ resizes to match the size of its wielder when grasped. Once per day on a successful\
  \ critical hit, the wielder of a spear of manhunting can cast hold person as an\
  \ immediate action on the target hit by the attack (Will DC 13 negates). The hold\
  \ person effect immediately ends if the spear is dropped or withdrawn, such as by\
  \ making additional attacks with the weapon."
