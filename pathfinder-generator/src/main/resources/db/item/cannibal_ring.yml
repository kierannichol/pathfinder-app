description: "This simple and unadorned copper ring appears slightly tarnished, but\
  \ seemingly wards off the effects of hunger or other sorts of deprivation; all tests\
  \ reveal it to be a ring of sustenance. However, after wearing it for 7 days, its\
  \ owner instead comes to suffer from almost constant hunger and thirst, which, if\
  \ not sated, ultimately drives him mad enough to become a cannibal. The wearer must\
  \ eat and drink a full day's worth of food and water each hour to avoid making a\
  \ starvation or thirst check. Once the wearer starts to take lethal damage instead\
  \ of nonlethal damage due to failed checks, he begins to experience ever more powerful\
  \ cravings for the flesh of intelligent creatures (any living creature with an Intelligence\
  \ of 3 or higher).\nOnce the wearer feasts in such a manner, he recovers all nonlethal\
  \ damage sustained from hunger and thirst, though he continues to suffer lethal\
  \ damage on failed starvation and thirst checks. The next time he is in a situation\
  \ in which he could eat part of an intelligent being, he must make a DC 15 Will\
  \ save or dine on the forbidden meat. If the wearer succumbs to this urge again,\
  \ he recovers all lethal damage from failed starvation and thirst checks, and realizes\
  \ cannibalism is the key to avoiding the increased hunger and thirst—on any day\
  \ he eats at least one meal of flesh from an intelligent creature, he does not have\
  \ to make hourly starvation and thirst checks, and recovers any accumulated damage\
  \ from failing these checks. Once its curse activates, the ring cannot be removed\
  \ until the curse is broken."
