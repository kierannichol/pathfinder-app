description: "This helm masks the wearer's face and functions as a helm of telepathy\
  \ combined with an amulet of proof against detection and location. The wearer can\
  \ cast disguise self at will and benefits from discern lies and true seeing at all\
  \ times. The helm provides complete protection from all gaze attacks and all forms\
  \ of mental control. The helm also interfaces with illusory effects, allowing the\
  \ wearer to see and hear through certain illusions as though those illusions acted\
  \ as scrying sensors. The helm is currently attuned to numerous projection pads\
  \ depicting Jazradan's programmed image, scattered throughout the ruins of Azlant.\n\
  Once per day as a swift action, the wearer of the helm of governance can utter the\
  \ Azlanti word for \"stop,\" which causes a time stop effect. Similarly, up to three\
  \ times per day as a swift action, the wearer can say \"insufficient\" in Azlanti,\
  \ which targets a creature within 300 feet with greater dispel magic."
destruction: "The helm is forever tied to its wearer, even unto death. Only by killing\
  \ the helm's owner, Grand Arcanist Jazradan, can this artifact be destroyed."
