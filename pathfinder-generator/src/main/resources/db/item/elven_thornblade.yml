description: "This blade is suited for thrusts and parries, making it especially capable\
  \ of inflicting deep, penetrating wounds. A wielder with Weapon Finesse can apply\
  \ her Dexterity modifier to attack rolls with an elven thornblade instead of her\
  \ Strength modifier. An elven thornblade grants no additional benefit when wielded\
  \ two-handed. In addition, attacks with an elven thornblade gain a +2 bonus on attack\
  \ rolls made to confirm critical hits."
