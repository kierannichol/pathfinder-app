name: "Potion of Solid Fog"
description: "This spell functions like fog cloud, but in addition to obscuring sight,\
  \ the solid fog is so thick that it impedes movement. Creatures moving through a\
  \ solid fog move at half their normal speed and take a â€“2 penalty on all melee attack\
  \ and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except\
  \ for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into solid fog is\
  \ slowed so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces the falling\
  \ damage by 1d6. A creature cannot take a 5-foot-step while in solid fog. Solid\
  \ fog, and effects that work like solid fog, do not stack with each other in terms\
  \ of slowed movement and attack penalties."
