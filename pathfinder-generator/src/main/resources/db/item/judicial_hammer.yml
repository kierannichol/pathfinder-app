description: "The head of this +1 earth breaker (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment\
  \ 27) is shaped like a massive version of the gavel one might see in a court of\
  \ lawâ€”the weapon is nearly 4 feet long from end to end. The Hellknights of Citadel\
  \ Vraid are attributed with crafting the first judicial hammers, having adopted\
  \ their form from the weapons of the same Shoanti tribes they used the judicial\
  \ hammers against. Once per day, the wielder may speak the judicial hammer's command\
  \ word and name a specific crime he believes an individual within 30 feet has committed.\
  \ Whenever the designated target takes damage from the judicial hammer, the target\
  \ must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or immediately and truthfully confess its innocence\
  \ or guilt in the named crime (if the target can speak the same language as the\
  \ wielder of the judicial hammer, it must confess in this language). This effect\
  \ lasts for 24 hours or until the creature fails its Will save, whichever comes\
  \ first."
