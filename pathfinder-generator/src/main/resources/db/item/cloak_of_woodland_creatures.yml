description: "This forest-green wool cloak is thick and warm. Its hem and the edge\
  \ of its hood are embroidered with small figures of forest creatures (rabbits, squirrels,\
  \ and the like) in white thread.\nWhen worn, this cloak bestows a +1 resistance\
  \ bonus on all saving throws. The wearer can remove the cloak at any time and lay\
  \ it on the ground outdoors. This ends the resistance bonus but summons a number\
  \ of animals from the cloak. The animals serve the character who summoned them for\
  \ 10 minutes (or until slain or returned to the cloak's folds). A summoned creature\
  \ can follow any of the commands described in the Handle Animal skill. Use the following\
  \ tables to determine what animals can be called forth.\nThe cloak summons creatures\
  \ only when laid down outdoors on naturally occurring ground (not, for example,\
  \ on a wooden deck or stone pathway). The cloak can be used to summon animals up\
  \ to three times per day."
