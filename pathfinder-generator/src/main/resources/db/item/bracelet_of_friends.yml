description: "This silver charm bracelet has four charms upon it when created. The\
  \ owner may designate one person known to him to be keyed to each charm. (This designation\
  \ takes a standard action, but once done it lasts forever or until changed.) When\
  \ a charm is grasped and the name of the keyed individual is spoken, that person\
  \ is called to the spot (a standard action) appearing at the user's location along\
  \ with his gear, as long as the bracelets's owner and the called person are on the\
  \ same plane. The keyed individual knows who is attempting to teleport him, and\
  \ the bracelet of friends only functions on willing travelers. Once a charm is activated,\
  \ it disappears. Charms separated from the bracelet are worthless. A bracelet found\
  \ with fewer than four charms is worth 25% less for each missing charm."
