description: "These talismans are crafted by evil spellcasters on the first steps\
  \ of the path of the wendigo. The amulet, a tiny human figure formed from unmelting\
  \ ice, rests on the wearer's chest. When worn, it freezes the wearer's heart solid,\
  \ chilling body and soul. The wearer immediately develops hypothermia, becoming\
  \ permanently fatigued for as long as he wears the amulet, but is otherwise protected\
  \ against cold weather by a constant endure elements effect. The amulet also grants\
  \ 10 points of cold resistance, immunity to bleed effects, and a +4 resistance bonus\
  \ on saving throws against spells with the emotion descriptor. Once per day as a\
  \ standard action, the wearer can use frigid touch (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic\
  \ 221) as a spell-like ability. Removing the amulet thaws the wearer's heart but\
  \ leaves him fatigued until he spends 8 hours warming up."
