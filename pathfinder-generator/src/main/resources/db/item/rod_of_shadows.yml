description: "This ebon rod is so dark it seems to absorb the light around it. The\
  \ rod functions as a +2 light mace, and allows its wielder to see in darkness as\
  \ if she had the see in darkness ability (Bestiary 2 301). Three times per day,\
  \ the wielder can use it to create a deeper darkness effect (caster level 8th).\
  \ To use this ability, the rod's wielder must touch the target object, which is\
  \ a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity."
