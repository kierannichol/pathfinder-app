description: "This Fine brass construct is made to look like a beetle, and is sometimes\
  \ painted in green, brown, or gray camouflage. A clockwork bug can record all nearby\
  \ sounds within a 20-foot-radius spread onto a low-quality gemstone worth 10 gp,\
  \ which is embedded in its body. The bug can record up to 1 hour of sound, which\
  \ must be continuous; if the recording is stopped early, it cannot be restarted.\
  \ Making the clockwork bug replay the recorded audio is a swift action.\nOnce a\
  \ gemstone is imprinted with an audio recording, it cannot be reused, and must be\
  \ replaced with a fresh gemstone in order for the bug to make a new recording. Replacing\
  \ a gemstone is a full-round action that requires a DC 25 Disable Device check.\
  \ Failing this check causes the used gemstone to become cracked and erases any recorded\
  \ sounds on that gemstone.\nThough a clockwork bug isn't treated as a creature and\
  \ cannot move or perform other actions by itself, it can cling indefinitely to any\
  \ surface onto which it is placed, including the underside of objects. These bugs\
  \ are also equipped with a timer that can delay the start of recording process by\
  \ up to 24 hours. Additionally, the bug is equipped with an optional self-destruct\
  \ timer with a maximum duration of 72 hours. If engaged, the self-destruct sequence\
  \ causes the bug to erase any information on its current gemstone and then send\
  \ a surge of energy through its filaments, rendering itself useless and irreparable."
