description: "This spiraled metal rod has alchemically treated bristles that can be\
  \ used in the barrel of an early or advanced firearm to liquefy grime and bullet\
  \ fouling while leaving a thin protective film in the bore. Using this brush is\
  \ a standard action, and the protective film grants a 5-foot alchemical bonus to\
  \ the firearm's first range increment and a +1 alchemical bonus on attack rolls.\
  \ These effects last for 1 hour or until the firearm is fired. A newly crafted bore\
  \ brush contains 5 applications. Crafting a bore brush requires a successful DC\
  \ 15 Craft (alchemy) check."
