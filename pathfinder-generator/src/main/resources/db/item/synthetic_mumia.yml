description: "A laboratory-created version of the expensive and infamous Osirian drug\
  \ mumia (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lost Kingdoms 21), synthetic mumia is a mixture\
  \ of honey, embalming fluids, and various animal organs. The murky liquid comes\
  \ enclosed in small packets made of intestine. Mumia and synthetic mumia may be\
  \ taken interchangeably to stave off the effects of addiction to either substance,\
  \ and is thus used by some mumia junkies hoping to quit their addiction. Crafting\
  \ synthetic mumia requires a successful DC 14 Craft (Alchemy) check."
