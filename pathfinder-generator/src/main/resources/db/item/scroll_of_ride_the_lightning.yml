name: "Scroll of Ride the Lightning"
description: "You may transform into lightning as a standard action and instantly\
  \ travel in a straight line to a distance of up to 120 feet, rematerializing in\
  \ the new location as a free action. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\
  \ Creatures in this line take 10d6 points of electrical damage and are staggered\
  \ for 1 round (a successful Reflex save halves the damage and negates the staggered\
  \ condition, spell resistance applies). Objects in your path are damaged as well,\
  \ with combustible objects being set ablaze and metals with low melting points melted.\
  \ If your path is interrupted by a barrier or otherwise deflected, you materialize\
  \ short of your final destination in the nearest open space; targets in the line\
  \ to that point take damage as normal. You are immune to electricity while this\
  \ spell lasts."
