description: "This rod is indistinguishable from a +1 light mace. The rod bestows\
  \ a +1 insight bonus on initiative checks. If grasped firmly, it enables the wielder\
  \ to use detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, discern\
  \ lies, light, or see invisibility. Each different use is a standard action.\nIf\
  \ the head of a rod of alertness is planted in the ground and the possessor wills\
  \ it to alertness (a standard action), the rod senses any creatures within 120 feet\
  \ that intend to harm the possessor. At the same time, the rod creates the effect\
  \ of a prayer spell upon all creatures friendly to the possessor in a 20-foot radius.\
  \ Immediately thereafter, the rod sends forth a mental alert to these friendly creatures,\
  \ warning them of any unfriendly creatures within the 120-foot radius. These effects\
  \ last for 10 minutes, and the rod can perform this function once per day. Last,\
  \ the rod can be used to simulate the casting of an animate objects spell, utilizing\
  \ any 11 (or fewer) Small objects located roughly around the perimeter of a 5-footradius\
  \ circle centered on the rod when planted in the ground. Objects remain animated\
  \ for 11 rounds. The rod can perform this function once per day."
