description: "Barbatos wields a potent weapon named Eyjatas, a +4 speed unholy quarterstaff\
  \ embedded with innumerable inhuman eyeballs. Three times per day when striking\
  \ a creature with Eyjatas, its wielder can rip the target's eyes out, permanently\
  \ blinding it and dealing 2d6 points of bleed damage. A creature can resist this\
  \ effect with a successful DC 30 Fortitude save, but no save is allowed if the attack\
  \ was a confirmed critical hit. Once Eyjatas rips out a creature's eyes, it functions\
  \ as a bane weapon against that target.\nThree times per day, the wielder of Eyjatas\
  \ can cast prying eyes. In addition, the wielder can use arcane eye at will, even\
  \ on other planes viewed through scrying, and can use eyebite (DC 20) at will within\
  \ 30 feet of the arcane eye."
destruction: "To destroy Eyjatas, the quarterstaff's dozens of eyes must be blinded\
  \ by the purifying light of an unwavering truth spoken by an immortal that has only\
  \ ever spoken lies in its life. Once the eyes are blinded in this way, the staff\
  \ must be hurled into a magical portal that has no entrance and that leads nowhere."
