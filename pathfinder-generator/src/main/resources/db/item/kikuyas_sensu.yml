description: "This folding fan made from cypress wood and lacquered paper is said\
  \ to have belonged to Kikuya, a legendary Minkai oiran, or courtesan. When held\
  \ in the hand, Kikuya's sensu grants a +2 competence bonus on the bearer's Charisma-based\
  \ checks. While held, the fan provides the somatic component for spells cast by\
  \ the bearer. Once per day on command, the bearer can use one face of the fan to\
  \ cast calm emotions. Also once per day, the fan's other face can create a forceful\
  \ hand. In addition, the bearer can whisper behind Kikuya's sensu and send the words\
  \ up to 3 miles away, as the whispering wind spell, once per day."
