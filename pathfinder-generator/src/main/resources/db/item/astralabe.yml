description: "An astralabe is essentially an extraplanar compass: a device that explorers\
  \ of the planes can use to orient themselves in realms without shared cardinal directions\
  \ or physical laws. The device creates an abstraction of north, east, south, and\
  \ west, as well as up, down, in, out, back, forward, past, future, and a variety\
  \ of other directions that can prove helpful in navigating the planes. Despite diverse\
  \ cosmetic differences, astralabes share a uniform internal design and, by and large,\
  \ give consistent, shared directions. As such, many—if not most— planar cartographers\
  \ utilize astralabes when creating maps, allowing travelers to navigate lands without\
  \ magnetic poles or with malleable terrains as though there were one consistent\
  \ north. The device keeps a constant orientation, but it does not adjust or circumvent\
  \ hazards or show particular paths. Any creature not on the Material Plane who employs\
  \ an astralabe while attempting a Knowledge, Survival, or similar skill check to\
  \ navigate gains a +4 bonus on that check.\nAdditionally, an astralabe can aid a\
  \ traveler in preparing to travel to another plane. The device can read emanations\
  \ from portals, gates, and other connections between the planes and display them\
  \ upon its surface. These displays can be interpreted with a successful Knowledge\
  \ (planes) check. A user must typically succeed at a DC 25 Knowledge (planes) check\
  \ to correctly read an astralabe, though demiplanes and stranger realms might require\
  \ a higher DC or yield inconclusive results. Those who succeed learn the name of\
  \ the plane beyond the portal, though not the portal's exact location upon that\
  \ plane—it doesn't reveal tiers, layers, or subrealms, in the case of planes divided\
  \ into multiple parts. Those who fail the check are unable to tell what plane lies\
  \ beyond. Those who fail the check by 10 or more incorrectly identify what plane\
  \ lies beyond, with the details of this misinformation determined by the GM.\nAstralabes\
  \ generally don't function on the Material Plane, shutting down and emanating an\
  \ aura of only faint divination. However, should one be brought within 20 feet of\
  \ a portal or similar passage to another plane, it becomes active for as long as\
  \ it remains nearby. An astralabe operates continuously while on any plane other\
  \ than the Material Plane."
