description: "A racing broom of flying functions like a broom of flying, except for\
  \ 9 minutes per day it can fly faster than its standard counterpart. Activating\
  \ this increased speed is a swift action. The broom's increased fly speed is 60\
  \ feet with a load up to 200 pounds, or at a speed of 40 feet carrying up to 400\
  \ pounds. Each minute at this faster speed uses 1 hour of the broom's daily flight\
  \ time. As a swift action, the rider may expend 5 hours of flight time to increase\
  \ the broom's speed to 120 feet with a load up to 200 pounds, or at a speed of 80\
  \ feet carrying up to 400 pounds. This speed boost lasts for 1 round, but when it\
  \ ends there is a 50% chance that the broom gains the broken condition and is powerless\
  \ until repaired."
