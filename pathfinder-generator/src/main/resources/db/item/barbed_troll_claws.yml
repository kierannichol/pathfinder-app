description: "These metal sheaths slide onto the claws of a troll. When a troll hits\
  \ with a claw attack while wearing the sheaths, it can either keep the sheaths on\
  \ its hand (in which case the claw attack deals 1 extra point of damage) or allow\
  \ the four sheaths on that hand to slide off and become embedded in the wound (in\
  \ which case the claw attack deals 1 point of bleed damage). The listed price is\
  \ for a set of 8 sheaths (one for each claw on both of a troll's four-fingered hands)."
