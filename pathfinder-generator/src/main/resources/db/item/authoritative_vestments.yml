description: "Typically worn by senior members of a faith, these cumbersome but splendidly\
  \ ornate garments create an aura of dignity and gravitas that few dare to challenge.\
  \ When activated, the garments make you seem more impressive and worthy of respect\
  \ to all viewers within 60 feet of you; you may make a single Diplomacy check to\
  \ change the attitudes of these viewers as a swift action. You can only use this\
  \ ability on a particular viewer once per day (additional attempts have no effect,\
  \ though you can still persuade viewers normally without the help of the focus)."
