description: "This black linen tunic has simple brass buttons. Once per day, the wielder\
  \ can attune the garment to one ally by standing for 1 minute in a position in which\
  \ both the wielder's and his ally's shadows overlap. For the next 24 hours, whenever\
  \ the wielder is adjacent to that ally and that ally takes damage, the wielder can\
  \ sacrifice up to 10 hit points to prevent an equal amount of damage done to the\
  \ ally. This damage cannot be reduced or redirected, and if the wielder is incapable\
  \ of sacrificing hit points, the damage to the ally cannot be prevented. If the\
  \ vest is removed before its duration ends, the connection between the wielder and\
  \ ally is lost and the vest is powerless until 24 hours have passed since its last\
  \ attunement."
