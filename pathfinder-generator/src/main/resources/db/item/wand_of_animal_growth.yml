name: "Wand of Animal Growth"
description: "The target animal grows to twice its normal size and eight times its\
  \ normal weight. This alteration changes the animal's size category to the next\
  \ largest, grants it a +8 size bonus to Strength and a +4 size bonus to Constitution\
  \ (and thus an extra 2 hit points per HD), and imposes a â€“2 size penalty to Dexterity.\
  \ The creature's existing natural armor bonus increases by 2. The size change also\
  \ affects the animal's modifier to AC, attack rolls, and its base damage. The animal's\
  \ space and reach change as appropriate to the new size, but its speed does not\
  \ change. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature\
  \ attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased\
  \ Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained\
  \ without harm by the materials enclosing it--the spell cannot be used to crush\
  \ a creature by increasing its size."
