description: "This +1 light mace is forged of black iron and topped with what appears\
  \ to be a clenched fist with spikes protruding from between the fingers. As a move\
  \ action, the wielder can expend 1 point from his arcane pool (as per a magus),\
  \ 1 point from his arcane reservoir (as per an arcanist), or one use of fervor (as\
  \ per a warpriest) to make a single melee attack with the signifer's fist. Characters\
  \ without any of these options can instead activate a signifer's fist in this way\
  \ as a standard action once per day. If the attack deals damage to a creature, the\
  \ signifer's fist gains the bane weapon special ability against that creature's\
  \ type (or subtype if the creature is a humanoid or outsider) for 1 minute. This\
  \ benefit doesn't apply if the target is immune to bleed, though the attack still\
  \ deals damage normally."
