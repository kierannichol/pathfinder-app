description: "This item is a receptacle for a lich's soul. It was broken into five\
  \ pieces. Individually, each piece can do no more than whisper \"Jadis-Vel,\" the\
  \ name of the lich whose fragmented soul is trapped within. When the pieces of the\
  \ phylactery are all gathered within 30 feet of each other, they collectively become\
  \ an intelligent item with the memories and will of the lich whose soul it contains.\
  \ The spirit retains only fractured memories of its former existence, but it gains\
  \ an understanding of how to escape and reclaim those memories.\nThe combined pieces\
  \ teach their owner how to find the path to lichdom, a process that is unique to\
  \ each soul. They have a +13 bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks for this purpose.\
  \ A prospective lich can choose the Phylactery of Jadis-Vel as her own phylactery,\
  \ negating the gold cost of crafting a phylactery (though this does not bypass the\
  \ other construction requirements for creating a phylactery). Once the prospective\
  \ lich performs the necessary ritual to become a lich, the trickery of the phylactery\
  \ comes to fruition: the new lich's spirit becomes trapped within the shards of\
  \ this phylactery, and the soul of Jadis-Vel is released into the new lich's body.\
  \ The freed lich is without a phylactery and must craft a new one, but is otherwise\
  \ returned to the world intact, albeit in a different body."
