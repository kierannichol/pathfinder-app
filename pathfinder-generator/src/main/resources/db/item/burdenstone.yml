description: "This smooth lodestone is gray and streaked with veins of glossy obsidian.\
  \ As a ranged touch attack, the bearer can throw it at an opponent within 30 feet.\
  \ If it strikes a target in metal armor, the burdenstone attaches itself to the\
  \ target for 2d6 rounds.\nAn attached burdenstone increases the target's load by\
  \ one step. If a target's load is already heavy, the target is knocked prone, its\
  \ movement is reduced to 10 feet, and it cannot run. An attached burdenstone also\
  \ prevents the target from flying. A target may not be affected by more than one\
  \ burdenstone at a time.\nA successful DC 20 Strength check made as a full-round\
  \ action can remove the stone from a target before the duration elapses. Once a\
  \ burdenstone has been removed or the duration expires, it becomes an ordinary magnetic\
  \ stone."
