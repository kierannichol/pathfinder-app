description: "This complex wind instrument is made of interwoven, gilded pipes. It\
  \ is considered a masterwork musical instrument, granting a +2 bonus on all Perform\
  \ (wind instrument) checks. The bonus is also added to the DC of any bardic performances\
  \ made using the entwined syrinx.\nAnytime anyone attempts to play the entwined\
  \ syrinx, however, he must make a DC 15 Will save or be compelled to play a dirge\
  \ of somber beauty. The dirge acts like the fascinate bardic performance— even if\
  \ the character is not a bard or cannot use Perform (wind instrument)—affecting\
  \ every creature within 90 feet able to see and hear the character, including the\
  \ musician playing the entwined syrinx. The DC to resist this effect is 12 + the\
  \ character's Charisma modifier (though if it is being played by a bard, the DC\
  \ increases to include 1/2 the bard's level; the +2 Perform bonus is included).\
  \ This effect persists and the musician continues to play for 1 hour, or until the\
  \ performance is interrupted."
