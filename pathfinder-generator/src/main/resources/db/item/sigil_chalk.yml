description: "This short stick of grayish chalk is flecked with mithral. When the\
  \ chalk's bearer succeeds at a Knowledge check to identify a monster's special powers\
  \ or vulnerabilities, he can take a standard action to draw a 1-foot-wide runic\
  \ shape in the air that represents the monster's type. This rune floats around the\
  \ user's head for 1 hour, moving with the user. The hovering rune provides the user\
  \ a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls and skill checks against creatures of the type\
  \ represented by the rune. It doesn't impair the user's vision or movement in any\
  \ way. The rune cannot be harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate,\
  \ a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. A rune's Armor\
  \ Class against touch attacks is equal to 10 + the user's Dexterity modifier.\n\
  If the user fails an attack roll or skill check against a creature of the type represented\
  \ by his hovering rune, he can dismiss the rune as an immediate action to gain a\
  \ +2d4 competence bonus on the attack roll or skill check retroactively, which may\
  \ turn the failure into a success. Each stick of sigil chalk may be used to draw\
  \ five runes. A single user can have a number of hovering runes equal to his Intelligence\
  \ modifier (minimum 1) simultaneously, but each must represent a different creature\
  \ type."
