description: "This longsword glows and has an aura, making it appear valuable. Its\
  \ grip is hollow and can be filled with a dose of poison (bought separately, and\
  \ requiring a full-round action to refill and rearm). Once the sword is grasped,\
  \ its mechanical trap engages: Small needles in the grip deliver the poison. Detecting\
  \ the trap requires a successful DC 30 Perception check made by a character with\
  \ the trapfinding ability, and disabling it requires a successful DC 28 Disable\
  \ Device check."
