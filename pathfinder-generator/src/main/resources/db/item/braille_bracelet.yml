description: "This bracelet contains 10 small clay beads, each carved with a raised\
  \ symbol. The beads can be removed from the bracelet cord and rearranged in any\
  \ order. Once arranged, the carvings can be felt with the fingers to determine the\
  \ symbols' meaning and decipher any message the bracelet is meant to convey. A single\
  \ bead could impart a simple message, or multiple beads can be strung together to\
  \ form more complicated messages. Interpreting the beads allows individuals to communicate\
  \ in absolute silence, even in complete darkness or otherwise unable to see. To\
  \ use the beads properly, you and your allies must assign each bead a meaning prior\
  \ to using the bracelet in this way. Recalling the meaning of a single bead requires\
  \ a successful DC 10 Intelligence check. Conveying more complicated messages increases\
  \ this check by 2 for each additional bead used. Deciphering the message is practically\
  \ impossible for a creature that doesn't know the meanings assigned to the beads,\
  \ increasing the DC by 20."
