  \ per day on command, the wearer can point the ring and mentally designate one or\
  \ more creatures or objects in a 60-foot cone as enemies, after which the ring roars\
  \ triumphantly. Selected targets in the area are affected by shout (Fortitude DC\
  \ 20). All other objects in the area are unharmed, and all other creatures in the\
  \ area receive the benefits of the inspire courage bardic performance as performed\
  \ by a 7th-level bard for 3 rounds. When activating the ring, the wearer can expend\
  \ 1 round of her bardic performance ability to use her own bard level to calculate\
  \ the performance's effect.\nIn addition, the ring grants the wearer a +4 enhancement\
  \ bonus to Charisma; treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours\
  \ the ring is worn."
