description: "This 4-foot-by-6-foot framed painting is a detailed portrait of a particular\
  \ intelligent creature, animated to show movement or action within the painted scene.\
  \ The image reacts when questioned, with the creature turning to face the viewer\
  \ and responding appropriately. The image is a magical effect with no actual intelligence,\
  \ but is programmed with up to ten 25- word verbal responses and can respond to\
  \ questions if these responses seem appropriate. For example, if one of the programmed\
  \ responses is the name of the person shown in the portrait, it can answer questions\
  \ such as \"who are you?\" and \"what is your name?\" If the item crafter is familiar\
  \ with or has the cooperation of the creature depicted in the painting, the illusory\
  \ image has the voice and mannerisms of that creature."
