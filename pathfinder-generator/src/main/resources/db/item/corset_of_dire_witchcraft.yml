description: "This slimming garment is fastened with laces, buckles, and buttons and\
  \ reinforced with ribs of leather or bone. A corset of dire witchcraft grants a\
  \ +4 armor bonus to AC. If the wearer is a witch, each day when she communes with\
  \ her familiar to prepare spells, she may enhance one hex she knows, increasing\
  \ its caster level by +2 for 24 hours. This enhancement ends if the corset is removed\
  \ or if she uses it to enhance a different hex."
