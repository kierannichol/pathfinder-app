description: "This +2 breastplate typically bears the image of a rampant grizzly bear\
  \ or other impressive predator. It bestows a commanding aura upon its wearer. The\
  \ wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on all Charisma checks, including Charisma-based\
  \ skill checks. The wearer also gains a +2 competence bonus to his Leadership score.\
  \ Friendly troops within 360 feet of the user become braver than normal, gaining\
  \ a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against fear. Since the effect arises in\
  \ great part from the distinctiveness of the armor, it does not function if the\
  \ wearer hides or conceals herself in any way."
