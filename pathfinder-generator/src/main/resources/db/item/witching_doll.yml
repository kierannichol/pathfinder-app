description: "A spellcaster binds herself to a witching doll through an hour-long\
  \ ritual in which the owner stitches some of her hair and fingernails into the rag\
  \ doll's mouth. Thereafter, the owner can concentrate to see and hear as if she\
  \ were the doll for up to 1 hour at a time; doing so leaves the owner blind and\
  \ deaf to her body's immediate surroundings. While concentrating, the spellcaster\
  \ imparts a modicum of animation to the doll, allowing it to turn its head, gesture,\
  \ and speak in hushed whispers. Extraordinary senses such as darkvision function\
  \ through this link, but magical senses such as arcane eye and detect magic do not.\
  \ Once per day, the owner can cast a single spell with a range of touch or greater\
  \ from the witching doll instead of herself. Many hags use this ability to make\
  \ a witching doll seem mundane by casting magic aura, or they transform it into\
  \ a distant minion with animate object."
