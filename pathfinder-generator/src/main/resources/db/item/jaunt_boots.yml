description: "These stylish black leather boots are stitched with images of winding\
  \ roads and trails through peaceful orchards. They can be worn up to mid-thigh,\
  \ or have their cuffs turned down to make knee-high boots. Three times per day,\
  \ as a move action, the wearer can move up to 15 feet (or her movement speed if\
  \ it's less than 15 feet). This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity."
