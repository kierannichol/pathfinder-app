name: "Scroll of Fire Storm"
description: "When a fire storm spell is cast, the whole area is shot through with\
  \ sheets of roaring flame. The raging flames do not harm natural vegetation, ground\
  \ cover, or any plant creatures in the area that you wish to exclude from damage.\
  \ Any other creature within the area takes 1d6 points of fire damage per caster\
  \ level (maximum 20d6). Creatures that fail their Reflex save catch on fire, taking\
  \ 4d6 points of fire damage each round until the flames are extinguished. Extinguishing\
  \ the flames is a full-round action that requires a DC 20 Reflex save."
