description: "This arrow ends in a crystalline bubble filled with a viscous alchemical\
  \ dyeing agent. Firing a dye arrow is a ranged touch attack; a creature struck by\
  \ a dye arrow takes no damage but is splashed with enough black, blue, green, or\
  \ red marker dye (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 104) to coat about 1 square\
  \ foot. The stain caused by marker dye cannot be washed off except with magic for\
  \ the first 72 hours, but fades completely after 2 weeks."
