description: "Extracted from bioluminescent jellyfish, plankton, and other marine\
  \ organisms that glow in the ocean's depths, this ink is refined in a process that\
  \ makes the ink stable and long lasting. This colorful ink glows gently like a candle,\
  \ so it is easier to discern any writing at a distance, especially in the dark.\
  \ The ink's glow lasts for about 1 year, after which time the writing remains colorful\
  \ but no longer glows. Bioluminescent ink is typically stored in a waterproof bladder."
