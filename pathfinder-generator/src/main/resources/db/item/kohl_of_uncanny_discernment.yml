description: "The dark cosmetic in this small decorative tube is made from finely\
  \ ground minerals. Favored by Osirian men and women alike, nonmagical kohl is applied\
  \ around the eyes and is used to reduce the glare from the desert sun, and cosmetically\
  \ to cause the whites of the wearer's eyes to stand out distinctly.\nWhen applied\
  \ to the eyes, kohl of uncanny discernment grants its wearer low-light vision and\
  \ a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks. If the wearer already has low-light\
  \ vision, the kohl doubles the distance the wearer can see. The wearer also gains\
  \ a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against gaze attacks, patterns, visual\
  \ effects, and sightbased attacks. These effects last for 1 hour. Applying the kohl\
  \ is a full-round action, and it must be applied to both eyes to function. An unopened\
  \ tube of kohl of uncanny discernment contains 5 applications."
