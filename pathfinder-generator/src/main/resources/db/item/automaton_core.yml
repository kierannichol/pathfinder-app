description: "These glowing metal cylinders are often gold- or silver-plated and decorated\
  \ with tiny, glowing arcane symbols. These cores are primarily used to provide life-giving\
  \ power to an automaton, but an automaton core can also be harvested from an automaton's\
  \ body and used to enhance spellcasting (see page 21 for details). A spellcaster\
  \ holding an automaton core treats her caster level as 4 higher for all purposes.\
  \ The innate power of an automaton core depends on the CR of the automaton from\
  \ which it was extracted: it contains 1 spell point per CR. As a swift action, a\
  \ spellcaster can expend a number of spell points from the automaton core to cast\
  \ a spell she has prepared without expending that spell or spell slot. The number\
  \ of spell points required to use this ability is equal to twice the level of the\
  \ spell cast. Once all of the automaton core's spell points are expended, the automaton\
  \ core can no longer power an automaton. There are currently no known methods to\
  \ restore an automaton core.\nAn automaton core can also be used to offset the cost\
  \ of building a construct. When it is included in the process of crafting a construct,\
  \ an automaton core offsets an amount of the construction cost equal to 2,500 gp\
  \ per spell point. A core used in this manner is still removable following the normal\
  \ rules for removing an automaton core.\nAutomatons covet these cores, as they can\
  \ use a core to reactivate automaton allies whose cores have failed, or whose cores\
  \ have been stolen. Automatons have been known to ruthlessly hunt down and kill\
  \ creatures who carry these items."
destruction: "An automaton core can be destroyed only by placing it in a ritual circle\
  \ where it is surrounded by six other automaton cores. These surrounding cores must\
  \ then expend an amount of spell points equal to the remaining points in the central\
  \ core. This overloads the central core, destroying it forever."
