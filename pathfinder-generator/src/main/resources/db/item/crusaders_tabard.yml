description: "A crusader's tabard is a sturdy cloth vestment worn over armor and other\
  \ clothing. It is normally decorated with the symbol or heraldic device of the owner,\
  \ and may be trimmed with expensive and delicate materials (such as silk, fur, or\
  \ cloth of gold). Once per day, the wearer of the tabard may say its command word\
  \ (often a family motto); thereafter, the wearer can spend a standard action (instead\
  \ of a full-round action) to move up to his speed and make a single charge attack.\
  \ This ability lasts until used or for 1 minute, whichever duration is shorter."
