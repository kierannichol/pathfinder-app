description: "Each of these distinctive jars contains an organ associated with both\
  \ a trait of the valiant knight Arazni and an aspect of the lingering power of the\
  \ god Aroden. Any cleric who bears one of these jars is granted an additional domain,\
  \ with the associated granted powers and domain spells, for as long as he possesses\
  \ it. The domain granted depends on the Bloodstone possessed. If the bearer is not\
  \ a cleric, he is granted the lowest-level domain power, but no spells or other\
  \ related abilities. In addition, the bearer of a Bloodstone is inspired by some\
  \ trait of Arazni, gaining an ability she possessed in life. The bearer does not\
  \ need to meet any prerequisites or requirements to gain this ability.\n"
destruction: "Together, the tyrant Geb and the lich Arazni can destroy any of the\
  \ Bloodstones, binding the organ inside into the withered form of the fallen hero\
  \ as part of a 24-hour-long ritual."
