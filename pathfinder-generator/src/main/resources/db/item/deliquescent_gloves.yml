description: "These heavy leather gloves ripple and flows at the wearer's command,\
  \ reshaping to fit any hand, claw, tentacle, or alien limb. The wearer's melee touch\
  \ attacks with that hand deal 1d6 points of acid damage. If the wearer uses that\
  \ hand to wield a weapon or make an attack with an unarmed strike or natural weapon,\
  \ that attack gains the corrosive weapon special ability.\nThe wearer's gloved hand\
  \ is protected from the acid ability of oozes, allowing him to use that hand to\
  \ attack oozes with unarmed strikes or natural attacks without risk of harm from\
  \ contact with the ooze. These unarmed strikes and natural attacks never cause an\
  \ ooze to split."
