description: "Even bulkier than its nonmagical cousins, this set of +3 stoneplate\
  \ is crafted from stones of widely differing colors, and is often allocated to Ninth\
  \ Battalion soldiers assigned to the deepest and most dangerous of the Darklands'\
  \ tunnels.\nOnce per day, the wearer can call forth a wall of stone that fills up\
  \ to nine contiguous 5-foot squares. Unlike with the standard spell, the wall must\
  \ be a straight line, and the wielder must choose to occupy one 5-foot section of\
  \ the wall, as the armor merges with the wall around it. While the wall of stone\
  \ is in effect, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC, but can move only\
  \ within the wall. The wearer can dismiss the wall as a standard action; otherwise,\
  \ it dissipates in 10 rounds.\nAs a full-round action, the wielder can make the\
  \ wall permanent by allowing himself to be consumed by the stone. In this case,\
  \ the wearer can be restored to life only by a miracle or wish."
