description: "This +2 buckler is emblazoned with a swirl of stars and comets. Many\
  \ of the Saoc Brethren commissioned these bucklers as markers of high social standing;\
  \ they had them each decorated with unique depictions of constellations, comets,\
  \ phases of the moon, or other distinctive astronomical sights, and used them as\
  \ much as decor as for defense.\nAs a swift action, the user of a starsling buckler\
  \ can cause the face to illuminate and whirl to life, duplicating the effect of\
  \ the light spell. The stars, comets, and sun begin to glow as they lift off the\
  \ shield and spin around in a brilliant display. They can be fired from the spinning\
  \ celestial vortex as if via a +2 sling (the user is considered proficient with\
  \ the sling for purposes of resolving such attacks from a starsling buckler). All\
  \ feats and proficiencies related to slings apply to stars fired from a starsling\
  \ buckler. These sling attacks cannot be made as offhand weapon attacks. The shield\
  \ contains five sling starsâ€” once all five have been fired, new sling stars are\
  \ restored to the shield automatically after 1 minute."
