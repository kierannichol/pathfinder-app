description: "This reinforced wicker box is decorated with images of owls, ravens,\
  \ or other cunning birds. It has enough room for up to three Tiny birds to perch\
  \ inside. Any bird of the animal type stored in the aviary for 24 hours becomes\
  \ attuned to the aviary's magic, radiating the same aura as the aviary itself. By\
  \ issuing a command word and concentrating on the bond between their spirits, a\
  \ user can direct a released bird to fly either to a known location (as with animal\
  \ messenger) or in a specific direction. The bird flies in a direct route at its\
  \ normal speed. For the next hour, by maintaining physical contact with the aviary,\
  \ the user can scry through the bird's senses, making the bird the sensor for a\
  \ clairaudience/clairvoyance spell. While scrying, the user cannot sense her own\
  \ surroundings, but she can switch between her senses and the bird's as a move action."
