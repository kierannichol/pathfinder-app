description: "Forged by Staunton Vhane with the aid of several Templars of the Ivory\
  \ Labyrinth, this intelligent +2 transformative glaive is infused with a babau's\
  \ sentience and eagerness for murder. Soulshear is capable of hiding its evil nature\
  \ with misdirection, and if its wielder's alignment isn't chaotic evil, it delights\
  \ in infiltrating enemy forces to create personality conflicts with its wielder,\
  \ manipulating his downfall through acts of conspiracy, betrayal, and murder. Even\
  \ without dominating those who carry it, Soulshear can occasionally summon a babau\
  \ demon to clandestinely carry out its will. These summonings often result in unexplained\
  \ murders, or even the death of Soulshear's owner so the glaive can pass to further\
  \ victims or be returned to the devoted cultists of Baphomet.\nSoulshear can use\
  \ misdirection on itself three times per day, typically selecting an unaligned magic\
  \ item carried by its wielder to hide its evil. Once per day, it can cast summon\
  \ monster V, but only to summon a babau demon."
