description: "This artifact was crafted ages ago, weaving together wispy strands of\
  \ shadow into a twisted black staff. The Shadowstaff makes the wielder slightly\
  \ shadowy and incorporeal, granting him a +4 bonus to AC and on Reflex saves (which\
  \ stacks with any other bonuses). However, in bright light (such as that of the\
  \ sun, but not a torch) or in absolute darkness, the wielder takes a –2 penalty\
  \ on all attack rolls, saves, and checks. The Shadowstaff also has these powers."
destruction: "The Shadowstaff fades away to nothingness if it is exposed to true sunlight\
  \ for a continuous 24 hour period."
