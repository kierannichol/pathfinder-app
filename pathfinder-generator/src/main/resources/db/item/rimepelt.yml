description: "This snow-white fur pelt of a winter wolf can be worn over the shoulders\
  \ as a cloak. The pelt functions as furs, granting its wearer a +2 bonus on Fortitude\
  \ saves to resist cold weather. The wearer can, as a standard action, transform\
  \ into a Large winter wolf as if using beast shape IV. In certain special locations\
  \ where winter wolves have the ability to take human form, such as the Howlings\
  \ district of Whitethrone or the town of Redtooth, the wearer of a rimepelt in wolf\
  \ form can take human form as winter wolves do, appearing as a whitehaired, blue-eyed\
  \ human. In either wolf or human form, the wearer of a rimepelt smells like a winter\
  \ wolf to other winter wolves and creatures with the scent ability. When the wearer\
  \ returns to his normal form, or after 2 hours have elapsed, the rimepelt becomes\
  \ a mundane winter wolf pelt.\nVery rarely, a properly skinned winter wolf pelt\
  \ manifests the properties of a rimepelt without requiring additional enchantment.\
  \ A winter wolf whose pelt has such potential usually manifests some telltale physical\
  \ attribute, such as heterochromatic eyes. Creating a rimepelt from such a rare\
  \ creature requires a successful DC 25 Profession (hunter) or Survival check. Taking\
  \ 20 is not allowed in this situation, and a failed check results in the pelt being\
  \ utterly ruined for any use."
