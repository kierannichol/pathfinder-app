description: "This sword of twisted black silver has a burst of dark flames adorning\
  \ the hilt and a pommel shaped like a pair of clawed hands. Its blade continually\
  \ sheds an aura of shadow equivalent to the darkness spell. Heart's Bane is a mithral\
  \ bastard's sting (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 150); normally a +2 mithral\
  \ longsword, it becomes a +5 unholy mithral longsword (with all of the other abilities\
  \ of a bastard's sting) in the hands of an antipaladin. Heart's Bane also functions\
  \ as a bane weapon against creatures that worship Iomedae.\nHeart's Bane grants\
  \ the following abilities when wielded by an evil creature. The wielder gains a\
  \ +6 profane bonus to AC and 60 additional hit points. As a swift action up to eight\
  \ times per day, the wielder can gain a profane bonus equal to the sword's enhancement\
  \ bonus on a single Charisma-based skill check or Charisma ability check. As a standard\
  \ action three times per day, the wielder can force a good creature to reflect on\
  \ its past misdeeds and be overcome by grief, as per terrible remorse (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Ultimate Magic 243). Once per day, the wielder can swing Heart's Bane above\
  \ her head as a standard action to create an incendiary cloud. Half the damage caused\
  \ by the spell is fire damage and the other half results directly from unholy power\
  \ and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks."
destruction: "If Iomedae's current herald uses Heart's Bane to deliver a coup de grace\
  \ attack to an unwilling paladin of Iomedae, the sword shatters and is permanently\
  \ destroyed."
