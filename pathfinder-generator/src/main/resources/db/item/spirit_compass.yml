description: "This device resembles an ordinary compass, save that it is filled with\
  \ alcohol and water, in which bob two pieces of alchemically treated metal (one\
  \ silver and one iron). A spirit compass can be operated by a creature so as to\
  \ allow the user to employ Survival in place of Perception to notice haunts (it\
  \ provides no benefit toward detecting those unusual haunts that are not noticed\
  \ by Perception checks). A creature that is untrained in Survival takes a â€“4 penalty\
  \ on any Survival checks when attempting to use a spirit compass in this manner,\
  \ representing the action of focusing on the compass rather than one's surroundings."
