description: "These goggles, made from a pair of smoky crystal lenses set in an adjustable\
  \ leather strap, help the wearer see through storms of rain, snow, or even dust.\
  \ A pair of storm goggles fully negates any Perception penalties imposed by a natural\
  \ storm or atmospheric condition. Also, once per round when the wearer makes an\
  \ attack against a target that has concealment from him because of natural or magical\
  \ fog, mist, clouds, or vapor, the wearer can choose to roll the miss chance percentile\
  \ twice and take the better of the two results."
