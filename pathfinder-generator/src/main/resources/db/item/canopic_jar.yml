description: "This clay burial jar is designed to hold viscera from a corpse. A creature\
  \ can spend 10 minutes and make a DC 15 Heal check to harvest the intact intestine,\
  \ liver, lungs, or stomach from a Tiny to Large corpse and preserve it inside the\
  \ jar. The corpse must be fresh (dead for no longer than 1 hour) and of the animal,\
  \ dragon, or humanoid type. A full jar weighs 5 pounds.\nUp to three times per day,\
  \ the bearer can gain any one of the following abilities that the creature possessed\
  \ in life for 10 minutes at a value no greater than the creature had: climb speed,\
  \ darkvision (up to 60 feet), resist energy, fly speed, low-light vision, scent,\
  \ or swim speed. Movement abilities are limited to a speed of no more than 60 feet,\
  \ and flight can be of no greater than good maneuverability. Energy resistance can\
  \ be gained in any single energy type the creature was resistant or immune to, to\
  \ a maximum of 20 points (if the creature had immunity, the user gains resistance\
  \ 20 to that energy type).\nBy expending one use of mythic power, the bearer can\
  \ instead take the form of the creature for 10 minutes, as if using alter self,\
  \ beast shape II, form of the dragon II, or giant form I, as appropriate. The bearer\
  \ resembles the original creature as it appeared in life, as though he were impersonating\
  \ that creature with a Disguise check result of 20. To use the jar's abilities,\
  \ it only has to be carried on the bearer's person. In addition to these properties,\
  \ the canopic jar preserves its contents for an indefinite period, similar to gentle\
  \ repose. The organs are suitable remains for resurrection, but insufficient for\
  \ raise dead."
