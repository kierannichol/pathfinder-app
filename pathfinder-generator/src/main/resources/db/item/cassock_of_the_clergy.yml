description: "The cut and color of this solemn vestment varies from religion to religion,\
  \ but its properties are the same. The wearer may command the cassock of the clergy\
  \ to display the holy symbol of her deity or hide this symbol. At the most basic\
  \ level, the garment functions as a divine focus. Additionally, the wearer gains\
  \ a +3 competence bonus on Charisma-based checks to influence creatures that match\
  \ her alignment or that of her patron deity. Also, the wearer may use bless and\
  \ sanctuary (DC 11) each once per day, and may prepare one additional orison each\
  \ day. If the wearer is a spontaneous divine caster, once per day she may spend\
  \ 1 hour in prayer to gain an orison of her choice as a spell known for the next\
  \ 24 hours."
