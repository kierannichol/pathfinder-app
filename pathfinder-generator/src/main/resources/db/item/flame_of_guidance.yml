description: "This charm resembles an orrery composed of small, freely orbiting orbs\
  \ circling a candle-sized flame. The device functions as an ioun stone, and when\
  \ released, the flame perches above the user's head, remaining stationary relative\
  \ to the user as the smaller planetary orbs take up elliptical transit around it.\
  \ When in use, the flame grants the user a natural armor bonus of +4, the fire subtype,\
  \ immunity to fire, and vulnerability to cold. If within 3 miles of the celestial\
  \ lens, the user can control the horizontal orbital direction of the item, but cannot\
  \ make the lens stop or move it vertically from its standard position of 100 feet\
  \ from the ground."
destruction: "Holding the item in a maximum-intensity blast of the celestial lens\
  \ for 3 rounds destroys this artifact."
