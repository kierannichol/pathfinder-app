name: "Scroll of Smug Narcissism"
description: "You cause your target to become overwhelmed by its own importance, talents,\
  \ and attractiveness. The target cannot help but look at itself in every reflective\
  \ surface at every possible opportunity. In social situations, the target always\
  \ tries to comment about how attractive it is or how ugly someone else is by comparison.\
  \ The target remains constantly distracted, always looking for a reflective surface\
  \ to gaze upon (such as a mirror, pool of water, a polished shield, and so on).\
  \ The distraction gives the target a â€“2 penalty on all skill checks. In combat,\
  \ the target worries about enemies damaging its appearance, and focuses on defense\
  \ rather than offense (casting defensive spells rather than offensive spells, using\
  \ the fight defensively or total defense action, and so on)."
