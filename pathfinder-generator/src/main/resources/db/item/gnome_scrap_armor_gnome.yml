description: "The following suit of armor is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nA suit of gnome scrap armor protects its wearer\
  \ as +2 studded leather armor, but myriad metal trinkets festoon it in place of\
  \ studs. A number of these badges bear a special dweomer; each such badge can be\
  \ removed as a move action, at which point it turns into a full-sized version of\
  \ the trinket. The wearer automatically recognizes which badges have this property,\
  \ and only the wearer can detach them.\nA fully stocked suit of gnome scrap armor\
  \ holds 20 badges representing the following gear: a flask of acid, two flasks of\
  \ alchemist's fire, a block and tackle, a buckler, a crowbar, a heavy pick, a folded\
  \ net, a potion of invisibility, a potion of lesser restoration, a shovel, two lit\
  \ sunrods, two tanglefoot bags, a throwing axe, a thunderstone, a warhammer, a bottle\
  \ of fine wine, and a winter blanket. When the armor has 10 or fewer badges remaining,\
  \ it is reduced to +1 studded leather armor until sufficient badges are returned.\
  \ If all the patches are removed, the armor becomes nonmagical masterwork studded\
  \ leather armor.\nWhile the armor retains any magic, the wearer can return badges\
  \ to the armor by casting shrink item on the appropriate object while wearing the\
  \ armor and touching the object to the armor. This can even convert appropriate\
  \ potions into badges, despite shrink item not normally working on magic items.\
  \ Only items exactly corresponding to missing badges can be merged with the armor.\
  \ Merging a potion reduces the potion's caster level to the minimum caster level\
  \ for that spell. Items produced by gnome scrap armor match the size of the armor,\
  \ so the typical gnome-sized version of the suit produces items sized for Small\
  \ creatures."
