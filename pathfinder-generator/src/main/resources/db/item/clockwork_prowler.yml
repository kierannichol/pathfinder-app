description: "This 2-foot-tall wooden clockwork automaton is shaped roughly like a\
  \ short-backed, wheeled chair. When wound up with the folding handle at its side,\
  \ the clockwork prowler trundles forward at a speed of 15 feet per round for up\
  \ to 2 minutes. A clockwork prowler cannot move through difficult terrain. Each\
  \ round of vigorous winding powers 2 rounds of movement. If its brake is not released\
  \ immediately after winding, the prowler loses 1 round of movement for every 2 rounds\
  \ it sits idle. The clockwork prowler can carry up to 20 pounds of weight at full\
  \ speed, or up to 50 pounds at a speed of 10 feet. Higher weights prevent the prowler\
  \ from moving. A clockwork prowler has hardness 5 and 90 hit points, and when in\
  \ motion has AC 12 (a motionless clockwork prowler has AC 5)."
