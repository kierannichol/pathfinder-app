description: "This gleaming silver sword has a spray of quillons resembling a sunburst\
  \ and a pommel shaped like a pair of hands clasped together. Its blade continually\
  \ sheds light equivalent to the light spell. Heart's Edge is a mithral holy avenger;\
  \ normally a +2 mithral longsword, it becomes a +5 holy mithral longsword (with\
  \ all of the other abilities of a holy avenger) in the hands of a paladin of Iomedae.\
  \ Heart's Edge also functions as a bane weapon against creatures with the shapechanger\
  \ subtype. In addition, if a shapechanged creature or creature under the effects\
  \ of a spell of the polymorph subschool is struck by the sword with a successful\
  \ melee attack, that creature must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or immediately revert\
  \ to its true form.\nLastly, Heart's Edge grants the following abilities when wielded\
  \ by a good creature. The wielder gains a +6 sacred bonus to her AC and 60 additional\
  \ hit points. As a swift action up to eight times per day, the wielder can gain\
  \ a sacred bonus equal to the sword's enhancement bonus on a single Charisma-based\
  \ skill check or Charisma ability check. As a standard action three times per day,\
  \ the wielder can force an evil creature to reflect on its past misdeeds and be\
  \ overcome by grief, as per forced repentance (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's\
  \ Guide 224; Will DC 16 negates). Once per day, the wielder can swing Heart's Edge\
  \ above her head as a standard action to create and launch a globe of searing radiance,\
  \ as per sunburst (Reflex DC 22 partial)."
destruction: "If a paladin of Iomedae uses Heart's Edge to deliver a coup de grace\
  \ attack to Iomedae's current herald, who must offer the paladin its unconditional\
  \ surrender, the sword shatters and is permanently destroyed."
