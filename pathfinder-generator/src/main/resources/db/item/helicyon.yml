description: "Helicyon is a +5 anchoring ghost touch holy quarterstaff. Helicyon can\
  \ also appear as a walking stick and can assume its true form as a free action.\
  \ Any time Helicyon deals damage, the creature struck must attempt a DC 25 Will\
  \ saving throw. If it fails, the target becomes overwrought with remorse for events\
  \ that took place in the course of its existence, even if it is denied, never had,\
  \ or lost the capacity to feel emotion, as per overwhelming grief. This effect affects\
  \ only creatures with Intelligence 3 or greater, even if they are normally immune\
  \ to mind-affecting effects. Once affected or after a successful saving throw, the\
  \ target becomes immune to this ability for 24 hours. As a standard action, Andoletta\
  \ can summon Helicyon to her hand from any distance, even across planar boundaries."
destruction: "Helicyon must be broken in the bare hands of an archon whose CR is 20\
  \ or greater, while that being renounces Heaven and swears allegiance to an evil\
  \ master or cause."
