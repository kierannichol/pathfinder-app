description: "Carried in a tube of beaten silver, this rough-ground salt is a powerful\
  \ defense against evil conjurers. As a full-round action that provokes attacks of\
  \ opportunity, the salt can be poured in a circle with a diameter of 5 feet or a\
  \ straight line up to 15 feet long. While the line of salt remains unbroken and\
  \ undisturbed, evil summoned or called creatures cannot physically cross it or interfere\
  \ with it. These creatures can continue to make ranged or magical attacks over the\
  \ line. Any other creature may disturb the line simply by scuffing it. The effects\
  \ of the salt last as long as the line remains unbroken. Once laid, the salt cannot\
  \ be recollected."
