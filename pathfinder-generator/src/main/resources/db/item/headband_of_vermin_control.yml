description: "The wearer of this black leather headband can spend 10 minutes attuning\
  \ the headband to one touched vermin of Medium or larger size. Once the headband\
  \ is attuned, any creature wearing it can attempt Handle Animal and Ride checks\
  \ to influence or control that vermin as if it were an animal and had animal-level\
  \ intelligence. The attunement lasts until the vermin dies, the headband is destroyed,\
  \ or the headband is attuned to a different vermin.\nDuergar-created items of this\
  \ type are usually protected by a dust ward spell."
