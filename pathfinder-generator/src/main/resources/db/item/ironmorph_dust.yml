description: "This bag of powder has a sharp metallic odor. Ironmorph dust can be\
  \ applied to a willing adjacent creature as a standard action, or thrown as a ranged\
  \ touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. On contact, it causes the target's\
  \ clothing to stiffen and harden (Reflex DC 15 negates). If the target is wearing\
  \ light or no armor, his clothing is treated as chainmail for all purposes—including\
  \ armor bonus, arcane spell failure chance, and armor check penalty—except weight.\
  \ Exceptionally light clothing (such as a nightshirt or silks) is instead treated\
  \ as a chain shirt. Exceptionally heavy clothing (such as a cold-weather outfit\
  \ or elaborate ceremonial garb) is instead treated as full plate. If the target\
  \ is already wearing medium or heavy armor, he instead gains DR 5/adamantine, but\
  \ the maximum Dexterity bonus of his armor decreases by 3 (to a minimum of +0),\
  \ and its armor check penalty increases by 3.\nAfter 5 rounds, affected clothing\
  \ returns to normal. Ironmorph dust has no effect on creatures not wearing clothing\
  \ or armor.\nArmor or clothing affected by ironmorph dust is effectively metal,\
  \ and counts as such for abilities or classes that are restricted to certain types\
  \ of armor (such as druids); however, any abilities that are suppressed or lost\
  \ due to the ironmorph dust's effects are restored at the end of the dust's duration,\
  \ instead of after their normal time limit."
