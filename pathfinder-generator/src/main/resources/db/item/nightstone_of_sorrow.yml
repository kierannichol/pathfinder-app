description: "This black rock, usually worn on a heavy chain, looks pitted and partially\
  \ charred and melted. It gives the impression of reckless evilâ€”more a dangerous\
  \ scent than any other kind of feeling. The wearer gains fire resistance 1 and a\
  \ +1 resistance bonus on Will saves against fear. If the wearer takes 10 or more\
  \ points of fire damage in a single round, a claw-shaped pattern glows faintly on\
  \ the surface of the stone, similar to an arcane mark.\nIf the dragon god Dahak\
  \ is the wearer's patron, the wearer can use shatter once per day. At will, the\
  \ wearer can cause the claw-symbol on the rock to glow; true dragons immediately\
  \ recognize the symbol as an icon of Dahak."
