description: "The wearer can spend a full-round action concentrating to change the\
  \ color of this short, silken cape to match any attire or mood. When using the derring-do\
  \ 1st-level swashbuckler deed, the wearer adds an additional die when rolling either\
  \ a natural 5 or 6 rather than just a natural 6. Additionally, the cape grants a\
  \ +2 resistance bonus on saving throws. This bonus increases to +4 for 1 round each\
  \ time the wearer uses the charmed life swashbuckler class feature."
