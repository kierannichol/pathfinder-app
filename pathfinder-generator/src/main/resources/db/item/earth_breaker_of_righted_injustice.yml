description: "The tribal symbols covering the surface of this +2 anarchic flaming\
  \ earth breaker radiate a tangible heat. These brutal weapons are crafted by the\
  \ Shoanti blacksmiths of the Storval Plateau, and each is attuned to the wildest\
  \ tempers of the people of the Sklar-Quah and the Cinderlands that they call their\
  \ home. If the wielder possesses the rage class feature, he can choose to add either\
  \ the devil bane special ability or the orc bane special ability to the weapon at\
  \ the beginning of his rage. This added weapon special ability lasts only for the\
  \ duration of the wielder's rage, and once the special ability has been selected,\
  \ it cannot be switched until the next time the wielder enters a rage."
