description: "This strange device grants the ability to mentally communicate with\
  \ others, yet proves difficult to control. It generates a constant field of mental\
  \ static that grants the wearer a +1 bonus on Will saves against mind-affecting\
  \ effects. The wearer may generate an attack similar to the spell shout, though\
  \ the sound is mental, and thus does not affect items or creatures immune to mind-affecting\
  \ effects, and its damage is not affected by sonic vulnerability, resistance, or\
  \ immunity. In addition, as part of the attack, the wearer may make a DC 20 Charisma\
  \ check to shape a specific noise or message of five words or fewer. These sounds\
  \ are purely mental and not heard by any creature outside the area of effect.\n\
  The wearer may use this effect 1d3 times per day. The GM determines how many times\
  \ per day the clasp of the mind scream can be used. If the wearer attempts to use\
  \ the clasp beyond this number of times, he is affected by its effects and the clasp\
  \ is inert for the next 24 hours."
