description: "This slender rod is usually capped with a metal knob resembling the\
  \ face of a young male or female mage. The first rod of this type was created by\
  \ a ruthless cabal of wizards and sorcerers who transferred the minds of their most\
  \ promising apprentices into a set of rods for the sake of greater power.\nThe bound\
  \ apprentices' intellects have no free will but retain their rebellious imaginations.\
  \ Under normal circumstances, the rod must do what its wielder commands, but it\
  \ can make telepathic, respectful complaints about how unhappy it is to be a group\
  \ of living minds imprisoned in an inanimate objectâ€”though few wielders care. While\
  \ no good creature would create a metamagician's apprentice, he or she can still\
  \ wield one.\nThe rod can be used as a +1 light mace. On command, it transforms\
  \ into a +1/+1 quarterstaff or back to its rod form.\nA metamagician's apprentice\
  \ knows four metamagic feats (limited to feats that use a spell slot one or two\
  \ levels higher than the spell's actual level, such as Silent Spell and Empower\
  \ Spell) and acts as a greater metamagic rod for those feats. The rod can only apply\
  \ one metamagic feat to a spell at a time, though (like a metamagic rod) the wielder\
  \ can use his own feats and the rod's on the same spell.\nThe rod can use read magic\
  \ and detect magic at will. The metamagician's apprentice is never overwhelmed by\
  \ powerful magic auras. These abilities do not trigger effects that require reading\
  \ to activate (such as the explosive runes spell). The rod grants the wielder a\
  \ +2 competence bonus on three Knowledge skills; these skills are determined when\
  \ the rod is created (and require the apprentice to have ranks in that skill) and\
  \ can never be changed. Knowledge (arcana) is almost always one of these three skills.\n\
  A typical rod of this type is lawful neutral, though rods with other alignments\
  \ exist.\nIf a metamagician's apprentice becomes dominant after a personality conflict,\
  \ it insists the wearer find a way to free its mind from the object or destroy the\
  \ item so its mind can be at peace."
