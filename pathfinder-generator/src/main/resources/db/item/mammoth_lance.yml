description: "This +2 lance is made out of white spruce wood with a handle carved\
  \ from mammoth tusk ivory. Its shaft is decorated with images of charging mammoths\
  \ or running wolves. Traditionally, the owner of a mammoth lance adorns the weapon\
  \ with small trophies attached via short leather strips or carves notches in the\
  \ shaft to represent triumphs. When wielded while mounted on a creature with the\
  \ animal type, a mammoth lance uses the mount's Strength modifier on damage rolls\
  \ rather than the wielder's Strength modifier.\nWhen its wielder is not mounted,\
  \ or is mounted on a creature without the animal type, a mammoth lance functions\
  \ as a normal +2 lance."
