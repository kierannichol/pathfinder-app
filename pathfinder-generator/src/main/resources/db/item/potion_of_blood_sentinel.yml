name: "Potion of Blood Sentinel"
description: "After casting this spell, you pour a few drops of your blood and saliva\
  \ into the mouth of the animal sculpture material component, temporarily giving\
  \ it life. The animal is bonded to you as if it were a familiar, and it has the\
  \ abilities of a familiar (use your caster level as your effective wizard level\
  \ to determine its abilities), but it does not grant you the Alertness feat or the\
  \ special ability of its animal type. If your blood sentinel is slain, you take\
  \ 2 points of Intelligence drain and the blood sentinel's body becomes a destroyed\
  \ statue. This spell has no effect if you already have a familiar or another blood\
  \ sentinel."
