description: "Abadar's church created the first safecamp wagons to protect valuable\
  \ cargo as it traveled between cities. When inactive, a safecamp wagon looks like\
  \ an elaborately carved wooden toy wagon, 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches\
  \ tall. On command, the toy transforms in a single round into an open-topped wagon\
  \ (Core Rulebook 163). A second command word creates a canvas top supported with\
  \ a sturdy wooden frame over the wagon.\nA third command word causes wooden panels\
  \ to extend down and outward from the wagon, forming a stable wooden platform extending\
  \ 5 feet in all directions from the wagon's base, suitable for walking, sitting,\
  \ standing, or sleeping upon. A sliding wooden door in the back panel allows access\
  \ to the space under the wagon. Speaking the command word again causes these panels\
  \ to retract into the wagon. A fourth command word returns the wagon to its toy\
  \ shape; any items on or in the wagon are carefully placed on the ground around\
  \ the toy.\nA safecamp wagon cannot transform if there isn't enough open space for\
  \ it to occupy at full size. In any form, the wooden parts of this item have hardness\
  \ 8, the canvas parts have hardness 2, and the entire object has fire resistance\
  \ 5."
