description: "This amethyst stone strung on a coarse iron chain protects the wearer\
  \ from curses. Three times per day, whenever the wearer rolls a saving throw against\
  \ a curse (such as a witch's hex, or a bestow curse spell), he may reroll the saving\
  \ throw as an immediate action. The wearer must decide to use this ability before\
  \ the results of the saving throw are revealed. He must take the second roll, even\
  \ if it is worse."
