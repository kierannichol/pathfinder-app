description: "This sturdy iron rod is forged with pronounced angles to allow for strong\
  \ gripping, inscribed with images and sayings of trickster figures from myths and\
  \ common folklore. Hooked at one end, a trap-stealer's rod functions as an exceptional\
  \ crowbar, granting the user a +4 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made to\
  \ force open a door or chest when using it to do such.\nIn addition, on command,\
  \ the wielder can transform the rod into a magical set of thieves' tools. Using\
  \ these grant a +4 competence bonus on Disable Device checks. The wielder can transform\
  \ these tools into the rod again with a command.\nLastly, if the rod's bearer successfully\
  \ disables a trap with the thieves' tools and beats the DC to disable the trap by\
  \ 5 or more, he can magically steal the disabled trap. A stolen trap disappears\
  \ from the surrounding area, siphoned into extradimensional space that is connected\
  \ to the rod. Terrain around the trap reworks itself as if the trap never had existed,\
  \ though doorways and portals that supported a trap remain unaffected. At any time\
  \ during the next 24 hours, the rod's wielder can place the stored trap in a new\
  \ location where it operates as normal. The new location must be able to support\
  \ the trap's placement; for example a stolen pit trap could be taken from a dungeon\
  \ floor and replaced on a dirt road, but not upon the surface of a river or lake,\
  \ and the effectiveness of the placement is subject to GM discretion. Placing a\
  \ stolen trap into a location that does not support it wastes the effect and magically\
  \ transports the trap back to its original location. Whether successfully placed\
  \ into a new location or not, a stolen trap returns to its original location after\
  \ 24 hours. This ability functions once per day."
