description: "Goblins are masters at crafting things from bits of rubbish. The category\
  \ of \"cobbled item\" is a general catchall to describe any piece of equipment that\
  \ has been repaired or modified by goblins. Such items are of an inferior quality—\
  whenever they're used as part of a skill check or attack roll, they have a 10% chance\
  \ of being broken. Cobbled items can never be masterwork items. A cobbled item is\
  \ of lesser quality than a normal item, and thus costs only 75% as much as the normal\
  \ item, but is often much bulkier. Any cobbled item of 1 pound or more in weight\
  \ actually weighs twice as much as a normal item of its type. Any item that normally\
  \ costs more than 50 gp can never be a cobbled item, nor can alchemical items be\
  \ cobbled. At the GM's discretion, other items may not be able to be cobbled items\
  \ either."
