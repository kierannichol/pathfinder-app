description: "This +4 determination heavy steel shield has the preserved head of a\
  \ medusa mounted in its center, its eyes shut tight. It grants its wearer a +4 resistance\
  \ bonus on saving throws and immunity to gaze attacks. When the wearer fights defensively\
  \ or uses Combat Expertise, the shield's bonuses to AC and on saving throws increase\
  \ to +6. When she's taking the total defense action, the bonuses increase to +10.\n\
  As a standard action, the wearer of the aegis can expend one use of mythic power\
  \ to awaken the medusa's head, causing its serpentine hair to writhe and its glowing,\
  \ red eyes to open. This unleashes a cone of widened fear in the direction of the\
  \ wearer's choice. The head remains awakened for 1 round per tier the wearer possesses,\
  \ during which the wearer gains a petrifying gaze like that of the medusa's (turn\
  \ to stone permanently, 30 feet), except the effect is caused by meeting the gaze\
  \ of the shield's mounted head rather than the bearer's gaze.\nThe save DC for both\
  \ the fear and petrification effects is equal to 10 + the wearer's tier + the wearer's\
  \ Charisma modifier. While the medusa's head is awakened, the wearer can attempt\
  \ to make an enemy look into its eyes as a standard action, using the normal rules\
  \ for gaze attacks (Bestiary 300)."
destruction: "The aegis is destroyed if the medusa whose head adorns it is brought\
  \ back to life, and the awakened shield meets the gaze of this medusa."
