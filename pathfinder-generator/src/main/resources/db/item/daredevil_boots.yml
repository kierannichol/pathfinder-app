description: "This pair of magical boots shimmers in vibrant shades of blazing red\
  \ and burning orange when they are held up to the light. These boots allow the wearer\
  \ to gain extra maneuverability while moving through hazardous areas. As a free\
  \ action, the wearer can click her heels together to grant herself a +5 competence\
  \ bonus on Acrobatics checks made to move through threatened squares or to move\
  \ through an enemy's space without provoking attacks of opportunity for up to 10\
  \ rounds per day. The rounds do not need to be consecutive. Furthermore, anytime\
  \ the wearer of the boots successfully moves though the space of an enemy without\
  \ provoking an attack of opportunity, she gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls against\
  \ that enemy until the end of her turn."
