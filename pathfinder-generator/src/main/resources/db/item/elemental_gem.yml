description: "An elemental gem comes in one of four different varieties. Each contains\
  \ a conjuration spell attuned to a specific elemental plane (Air, Earth, Fire, or\
  \ Water).\nWhen the gem is crushed, smashed, or broken (a standard action), a Large\
  \ elemental appears as if summoned by a summon nature's ally spell. The elemental\
  \ is under the control of the creature that broke the gem.\nThe coloration of the\
  \ gem varies with the type of elemental it summons. Air elemental gems are transparent,\
  \ earth elemental gems are light brown, fire elemental gems are reddish orange,\
  \ and water elemental gems are blue-green."
