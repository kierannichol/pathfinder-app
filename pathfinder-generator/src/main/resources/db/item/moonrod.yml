description: "This 1-foot-long, silver-tipped tin rod glows dimly when struck as a\
  \ standard action. It sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. However, the light given\
  \ off by a moonrod is particularly easily to perceive for creatures with low-light\
  \ vision. For such creatures, a moonrod increases the light level by one step (to\
  \ a maximum of normal) for a 60-foot radius. It glows for 6 hours, after which the\
  \ silver tip is burned out and worthless."
