description: "This ponderous book details suggestions for persuading and inspiring\
  \ others, but entwined within the words is a powerful magical effect. If anyone\
  \ reads this book, which takes a total of 48 hours over a minimum of 6 days, he\
  \ gains an inherent bonus from +1 to +5 (depending on the type of tome) to his Charisma\
  \ score. Once the book is read, the magic disappears from the pages and it becomes\
  \ a normal book."
