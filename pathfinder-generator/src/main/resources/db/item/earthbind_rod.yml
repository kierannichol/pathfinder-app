description: "This rod looks like nothing more than a large, strange sliver of rough\
  \ granite. This rod's magic interacts with stone or earth to both steady its wielder\
  \ and anchor creatures the rod touches. An earthbind rod functions like a +1 light\
  \ mace, and it grants its wielder a +4 circumstance bonus to its CMD against bull\
  \ rush, grapple, overrun, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers, but only if the\
  \ wielder is an oread, has the earth subtype, or is standing on earth or stone.\
  \ Three times per day, when the wielder hits a creature with this rod, as long as\
  \ the target of this attack is standing on stone or earth, the wielder can attempt\
  \ to entangle that creature (Fortitude DC 18 negates) for 1d4 rounds."
