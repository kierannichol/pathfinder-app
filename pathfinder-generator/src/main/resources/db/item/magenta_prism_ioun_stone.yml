description: "This stone grants you a +2 enhancement bonus to any one ability score\
  \ of your choosing. The selected ability score can be changed only once per day\
  \ at a time unique to each stone (typically sunrise or sunset). A stone attuned\
  \ to a specific ability score maintains that attunement until changed at the specified\
  \ time of day, regardless of how long it has remained unused or how many times it\
  \ changes hands.\nResonance: +1 bonus on one saving throw not modified by the ability\
  \ score the stone is currently attuned to (chosen at the same time as the ability\
  \ score)."
