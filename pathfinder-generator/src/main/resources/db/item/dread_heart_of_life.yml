description: "A boon to vampires on long sea voyages or visiting desolate locations,\
  \ the throbbing heart in this black box can store the life energy of a creature\
  \ for later consumption. When a vampire carrying the box makes a successful drain\
  \ attack, it can redirect the stolen essence to the heart, harming the target creature\
  \ but granting the vampire no immediate benefit from the feeding. The essence remains\
  \ stored in the heart for 1 week; at any time, the vampire may clutch the heart\
  \ as a standard action to drain the essence from it and thus gain the benefits of\
  \ feeding."
