description: "This small kite is usually painted with a fierce face and bright colors\
  \ and is edged with serrated wooden blades. Its twine is strengthened by soaking\
  \ it in glue and sometimes with crushed glass to give it a slight cutting edge.\
  \ The kite has hardness 5 and 3 hit points. Participants in a kite battle make alternating\
  \ sunder combat maneuvers against each other's kites; each successful maneuver allows\
  \ a competitor to roll 1d6 points of damage against the opponent's kite. When a\
  \ kite reaches 0 hit points, it is broken or its string is cut, and its player loses\
  \ the match. In some matches, points are awarded for touching the kite's top to\
  \ the opponent's string, with the winner being the first to reach a set point total.\
  \ Those interested in kite-fighting may select the terror kite as a weapon for the\
  \ purpose of feats such as Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization, and apply these\
  \ bonuses on kite damage rolls and on their sunder combat maneuver attempts made\
  \ while using terror kites."
