description: "An artful rapier with a lotus petal guard, this magnificent weapon dedicated\
  \ to Arazni's former incarnation is useful to warriors and artists alike.\nThe tip\
  \ of this narrow +3 rapier can be used as a mundane writing instrument, producing\
  \ any color of ink the wielder desires. Once per day as a free action when the wielder\
  \ confirms a critical hit against a creature with the Red Crusader's quill, she\
  \ can inscribe an arcane mark on the creature. Once per month, the wielder can instead\
  \ inscribe a mark of justice; this mark ends immediately if the wielder inscribes\
  \ another mark of justice with the Red Crusader's quill."
