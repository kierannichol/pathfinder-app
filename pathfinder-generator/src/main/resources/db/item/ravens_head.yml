description: "Holy to the church of Pharasma, this gold-plated +3 undead bane heavy\
  \ mace was the symbol of office for the Bishop of Caliphas until Prince Adamondais\
  \ Virholt lost it in battle against the Whispering Tyrant. A character with the\
  \ ability to channel positive energy gains the Channel Smite feat while wielding\
  \ Raven's Head, if she does not already possess the feat. In the hands of a cleric\
  \ of Pharasma, Raven's Head gains the disruption weapon special ability, and the\
  \ wielder can use the Channel Smite feat as if she were a cleric of four levels\
  \ higher (+2 on the DC and +2d6 damage) and an extra three times per day."
destruction: "If successfully used as a component in the creation of a lich or other\
  \ undead, Raven's Head's power is broken forever."
