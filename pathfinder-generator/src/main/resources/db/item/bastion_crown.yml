description: "Often worn by paranoid rulers, this simple iron crown is thick and heavy.\
  \ The wearer is immune to ninja, rogue, and slayer talents that add effects to a\
  \ sneak attack, such as bleeding attack or crippling strike, though the wearer takes\
  \ the extra damage from sneak attacks as normal. In addition, the wearer gains a\
  \ +4 insight bonus on saving throws against death effects and an assassin's death\
  \ attack ability. Finally, the wearer can cast neutralize poison on himself once\
  \ per day, using the caster level of the item for any caster level check required."
