description: "This slender tube is strapped to one forearm and designed to be concealed\
  \ beneath the sleeve, where the wielder can fire a featherweight dart with a twist\
  \ of the wrist. The launcher functions by means of a tightly compressed spring,\
  \ and must be reloaded and re-cocked with a separate ramrod as a full-round action.\
  \ After firing, the wearer can attempt a Sleight of Hand check opposed by opponents'\
  \ Perception checks to keep the wrist launcher concealed. If you are proficient\
  \ with hand crossbows, you are also proficient with wrist launchers."
