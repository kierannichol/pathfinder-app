description: "This +1 adamantine light fortification full plate is crafted from tightly\
  \ fitted smooth, dull plates trimmed in gold. As adamantine heavy armor, it grants\
  \ its wearer DR 3/â€”. When the armor is not worn, a creature can touch the armor\
  \ and speak a command word to cause the armor to leap up and fit itself to that\
  \ creature. The armor is considered properly donned when put on in this way. The\
  \ wearer can speak the command word to have the armor remove itself and, if not\
  \ restrained, stack itself neatly nearby or arrange itself on an appropriate armor\
  \ rack, if one is adjacent."
