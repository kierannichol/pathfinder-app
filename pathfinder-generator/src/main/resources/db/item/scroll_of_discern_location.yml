name: "Scroll of Discern Location"
description: "A discern location spell is among the most powerful means of locating\
  \ creatures or objects. Nothing short of a mind blank spell or the direct intervention\
  \ of a deity keeps you from learning the exact location of a single individual or\
  \ object. Discern location circumvents normal means of protection from scrying or\
  \ location. The spell reveals the name of the creature or object's location (place,\
  \ name, business name, building name, or the like), community, county (or similar\
  \ political division), country, continent, and the plane of existence where the\
  \ target lies."
