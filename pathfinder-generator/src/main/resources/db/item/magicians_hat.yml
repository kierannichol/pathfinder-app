description: "Mystic symbols embroidered in gold thread decorate this conical hat.\
  \ Three times per day as a free action when casting a spell, the wearer can shift\
  \ metamagic feats on prepared spells. The wearer can either move a metamagic feat\
  \ from another prepared spell to a spell being cast or from the spell being cast\
  \ to another prepared spell. In either case, the spell that gains the metamagic\
  \ feat can't exceed the spell slot of the spell that originally had the metamagic\
  \ feat. For example, a wizard with detect thoughts, silent dispel magic, and dimension\
  \ door prepared could cast a silent detect thoughts (and would now have dispel magic\
  \ prepared), but could not cast silent dimension door. Moving metamagic feats does\
  \ not increase spell casting time, even for quickened spells. The hat provides no\
  \ benefit to spontaneous casting or spell-like abilities."
