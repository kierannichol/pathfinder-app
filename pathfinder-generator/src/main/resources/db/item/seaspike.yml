description: "This elegant, short-hafted spear has a razor-sharp head carved from\
  \ a single piece of ivory. A twisting ring of ivory and jade tentacles hovers and\
  \ slowly rotates just beneath the spearhead. Along the walnut haft sparkle tiny\
  \ chips of peridot, each the size of a pinhead. Seaspike is a +3 aberration bane\
  \ shortspear with three special properties.\nFirst, the wielder of Seaspike can\
  \ cast fire shield (chill) on herself three times per day as a 7th-level sorcerer.\
  \ The chill shield takes the appearance of luminous blue and green flames that swirl\
  \ around the wielder as if underwater.\nSecond, Seaspike grants its wielder a swim\
  \ speed of 30 feet when held. If the wielder already has a swim speed, Seaspike\
  \ increases the swim speed by 10 feet.\nThird, Seaspike is treated as a light weapon\
  \ for purposes of the Weapon Finesse feat and other similar abilities."
