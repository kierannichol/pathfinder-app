description: "This small bone container is filled with a thick dye. Each container\
  \ holds enough dye to cover one ornament created with the Grisly Ornament feat.\
  \ When applied to an ornament, it aids in the ornament's preservation, allowing\
  \ it to remain effective for an additional 24 hours. Once per day as a free action,\
  \ a dyed ornament can be commanded to attack a target adjacent to the wearer. A\
  \ ghostly image of the creature from which the ornament was harvested appears and\
  \ makes a natural attack against the target, attacking with the wearer's base attack\
  \ bonus and dealing 2d6 points of damage. This attack can be made in addition to\
  \ any actions performed by the wielder. An ornament integrated into a wondrous item\
  \ with the Monstrous Crafter feat can gain this attack ability, but doing so requires\
  \ two applications of monstrous dye to function properly."
