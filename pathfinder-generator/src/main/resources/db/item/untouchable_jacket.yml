description: "This black jacket is marked with the insignia of the Blackjackets. Once\
  \ per day, the wearer can speak a command word to gain spell resistance 20 for 3\
  \ rounds. This spell resistance ends if the wearer successfully resists a spell\
  \ as a result of it failing to penetrate his spell resistance. The first time each\
  \ day that a spell has no effect on the wearer because of spell resistance or a\
  \ successful saving throw, the jacket becomes charged with abjuration magic and\
  \ its insignia glows faintly. The wearer can touch the glowing insignia as a standard\
  \ action to cast dispel magic from the jacket, expending the charge. The charge\
  \ fades with no effect if unused for 1 hour."
