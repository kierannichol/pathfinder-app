description: "Wing sheaths are protective coverings created from thick fabric or canvas.\
  \ The sheaths are designed to tightly cover a pair of wings to keep them hidden\
  \ beneath a cloak or loose-fitting clothing. Noticing hidden wings bound within\
  \ wing sheaths requires a successful DC 20 Perception check. Donning or removing\
  \ wing sheaths requires 1 minute, or a full-round action with assistance. Wing sheaths\
  \ can be burst with a successful DC 22 Strength check."
