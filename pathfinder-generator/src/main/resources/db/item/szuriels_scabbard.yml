description: "A single shattered soul gem is located on the tip of this leather-and-ceramic\
  \ sheath. This scabbard fits only a greatsword, the favored blade of Szuriel, the\
  \ Horseman of War. Any magical greatsword sheathed in the scabbard for 24 hours\
  \ gains the keen weapon special ability [this doesn't stack with other methods that\
  \ increase a weapon's critical threat range). If another blade gains the benefit\
  \ of the scabbard, the previous blade loses the keen weapon special ability. In\
  \ addition, if the greatsword has been sheathed in the scabbard for 1 minute, the\
  \ wielder can invoke Szuriel's name as part of the action to draw the sword, affecting\
  \ the wielder with the rage spell for 1 minute or until she slays a creature, whichever\
  \ comes first."
