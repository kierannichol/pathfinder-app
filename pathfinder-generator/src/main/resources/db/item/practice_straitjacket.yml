description: "This straitjacket (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 250) is designed\
  \ for use by a single person. The leather straps and arm restraints are accessible\
  \ in such a way as to be tightened by the wearer. Restraining or releasing oneself\
  \ through these mechanisms requires 1 minute of work. Once restrained, the wearer\
  \ can attempt to escape from the straitjacket as normal (that is, without using\
  \ the built-in releases). Using a practice straitjacket to train for escape requires\
  \ 1 hour of practice and a DC 20 Escape Artist check. If you succeed at the check,\
  \ you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks to escape from bindings,\
  \ a grapple, a net, rope, or similar restraints. This bonus lasts for 24 hours."
