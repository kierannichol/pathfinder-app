description: "These cloaks are popular among traveling bards, and each patchwork cloak\
  \ is unique. The patches represent where the traveler has been, and often the performer\
  \ uses them to recall specific stories from his repertoire. When a bard retires\
  \ or dies, he often bequeaths his cloak to a young entertainer he mentored or admired."
