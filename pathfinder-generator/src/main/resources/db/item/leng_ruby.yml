description: "Leng rubies are red gemstones all identical in size and appearance,\
  \ distinguishable from ordinary rubies by their complete lack of imperfections or\
  \ inclusions. Mined on the desolate Plateau of Leng—an outer plane connected to\
  \ the ever-shifting Dimension of Dreams—these rubies are used as currency by the\
  \ sinister denizens of Leng (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 82). These denizens travel\
  \ the planes, bartering Leng rubies for goods, slaves, and assistance in their inscrutable\
  \ schemes. Possession of these rubies is seen as suspicious and shameful by scholars\
  \ who understand their origin, as the rubies mark the owner as someone willing to\
  \ deal with enigmatic foes of light and life.\nA small number of Leng rubies (10%)\
  \ can be used as the focus of a plane shift spell, though it is impossible to determine\
  \ what location a particular ruby is attuned to before the spell is cast. Some Leng\
  \ rubies are substantially larger than the common size, and can fetch prices of\
  \ 50,000 gp or more. The denizens of Leng trade these larger rubies for armies of\
  \ slaves or as part of nation-ending plots."
