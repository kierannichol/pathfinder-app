description: "Reflections visible in this palm-sized hand mirror always seem ghostly\
  \ and insubstantial. When a creature holding the mirror is targeted by an attack,\
  \ he can spend an immediate action to summon his reflection from the glass to interpose\
  \ itself between him and the blow. The reflection functions as an image produced\
  \ by the spell mirror image. If the image is struck by the attack, it shatters with\
  \ a resounding crash. The creature that destroyed the image is subject to bad luck;\
  \ the next time it makes an attack roll or saving throw, it must roll twice and\
  \ take the worse result. If the attack does not strike the image, the image fades\
  \ away at the start of the mirror bearer's next turn. The mirror can be used three\
  \ times per day."
