description: "These bracers find particular use by Aspis agents who often tangle with\
  \ the Pathfinder Society. As a standard action, a creature wearing these bracers\
  \ can attempt a steal combat maneuver check to nab any orbiting ioun stone within\
  \ 30 feet, though the ioun stone's owner receives a +4 circumstance bonus to her\
  \ CMD. If the bracers' wearer succeeds, the stolen ioun stone embeds itself in one\
  \ of the bracers' four available slots (each bracer has two). Embedded ioun stones\
  \ provide their bonuses to the wearer and can be removed with a move action.\nAs\
  \ a standard action, the wearer can temporarily drain the power of any ioun stone\
  \ that is embedded in the bracers and isn't dull gray, and can then channel that\
  \ power to cast magic missile as a spell-like ability, firing three missiles at\
  \ a target or targets up to 160 feet away. Drained ioun stones become dull gray\
  \ for the next 2d4 hours."
