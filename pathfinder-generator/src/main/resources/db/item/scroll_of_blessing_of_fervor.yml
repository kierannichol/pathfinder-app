name: "Scroll of Blessing of Fervor"
description: "With this blessing, you call your allies to move forth and empower them\
  \ to conquer and become victorious. Each round for the duration of this spell, each\
  \ of your allies can choose one of the following bonuses for that round at the beginning\
  \ of its turn (their choice). Increase its speed by 30 feet. Stand up as a swift\
  \ action without provoking an attack of opportunity. Take one extra attack as part\
  \ of a full attack action, using its highest base attack bonus. Gain a +2 bonus\
  \ on attack rolls and a +2 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Cast a single spell\
  \ of 2nd level or lower as if it were an enlarged, extended, silent, or still spell.\
  \ These effects are not cumulative with similar effects, such as those provided\
  \ by haste or a speed weapon, nor do they actually grant an extra action, so you\
  \ can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.\
  \ Blessing of fervordoes not stack with haste."
