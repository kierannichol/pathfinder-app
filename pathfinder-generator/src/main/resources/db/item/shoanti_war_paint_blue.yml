description: "The Shoanti have developed numerous types of magical war paint, each\
  \ providing a specific benefit to aid their hunters, warriors, and heroes in a variety\
  \ of tasks. Shoanti war paint can be applied to any visible part of the body—typically\
  \ the face, shoulders, legs, or arms. Applying a dose of war paint is a full-round\
  \ action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Shoanti war paint does not take\
  \ up a magic item slot, but you can benefit from only one color of Shoanti war paint\
  \ at a time and applying a dose of a different color replaces the effects of the\
  \ previous application. Once Shoanti war paint is applied, its effects last for\
  \ 24 hours. Below are the eight most common colors and their effects. Black (1,800\
  \ gp): The wearer becomes cloaked in shadows and smoke, gaining the effects of a\
  \ blur spell. Blue (900 gp): The wearer gains a 30-foot enhancement bonus to her\
  \ base move speed. Green (900 gp): When the wearer uses bardic performance to inspire\
  \ courage, the morale bonus she grants increases by 1. Orange (900 gp): The wearer\
  \ gains damage reduction 1/—. This effect stacks with damage reduction gained via\
  \ a character class, such as barbarian. Red (900 gp): The wearer gains fire resistance\
  \ 10. Silver (900 gp): The wearer gains a +3 deflection bonus to her AC. White (1,800\
  \ gp): The wearer gains a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws against energy\
  \ drain and negative energy. As soon as the wearer takes a negative level from an\
  \ energy drain attack, the white war paint absorbs the negative level and then fades\
  \ away, ending the ongoing duration of the paint's effect immediately. Yellow (900\
  \ gp): The wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks."
