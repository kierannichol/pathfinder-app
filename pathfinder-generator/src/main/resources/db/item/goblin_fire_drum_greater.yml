description: "This small crude-looking drum is attached to a strap long enough to\
  \ loop around the wearer's neck. A successful DC 12 Perform (percussion) check activates\
  \ the drum, which enhances any nearby natural or magical fire as long as the bearer\
  \ spends a move action each round to continue playing. All fires (including fire\
  \ spells and effects) within 30 feet of the bearer deal an additional 1 point of\
  \ fire damage (or 2 points for the greater version).\nAll unattended flammable alchemical\
  \ objects such as tindertwigs, flasks of oil or alchemist's fire, and fireworks\
  \ within this range have a 10% chance of spontaneously igniting or exploding (as\
  \ appropriate to the item) when the drum activates. This chance increases by 5%\
  \ each round and is checked at the start of the performer's turn as long as the\
  \ playing continues.\nA greater goblin fire drum has all the above abilities and\
  \ can create pyrotechnics once per day."
