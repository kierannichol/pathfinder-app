description: "This sealed vial contains 1 ounce of milky white gel. Once the vial's\
  \ seal is broken, the liquid reacts with the surrounding air and begins to rapidly\
  \ heat up, glowing like a candle for 1 hour. After that hour, the oxidization of\
  \ the chemical agent is complete, and the gel dissolves in a white-hot flash, dealing\
  \ 3d6 points of fire damage to anything directly in contact with it. A single dose\
  \ of phosphorescent gel can coat 6 square inches of a surface. Multiple doses of\
  \ phosphorescent gel can be used to coat larger surfaces, but the amount of damage\
  \ dealt does not stack. The conflagration occurs in an instant, and the fire generated\
  \ doesn't spread, though it can be used to ignite a larger explosive such as a fuse\
  \ grenade or pot of oil."
