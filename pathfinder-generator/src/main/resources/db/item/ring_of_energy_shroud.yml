description: "A ring of energy shroud always appears to be glass or crystal in construction,\
  \ tinted in a red, green, blue, or yellow hue. Closer inspection reveals a small\
  \ band of metal within the glass or crystal. Treasured by frontline fighters and\
  \ anyone with a trusted evoker ally, rings of energy shroud normally function as\
  \ a minor ring of energy resistance. However, once per day as an immediate action,\
  \ the ring's wearer can negate the damage of an incoming acid, cold, electricity,\
  \ or fire energy effect for himself (but not for other creatures affected by the\
  \ spell or effect), transforming that damage into a shroud of energy that wreathes\
  \ the wearer's body acting as if under the effects of the elemental aura spell (Advanced\
  \ Player's Guide). The elemental aura effect has the same energy type of the damage\
  \ negated."
