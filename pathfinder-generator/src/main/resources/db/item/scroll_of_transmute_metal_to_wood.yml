name: "Scroll of Transmute Metal to Wood"
description: "This spell enables you to change all metal objects within its area to\
  \ wood. Weapons, armor, and other metal objects carried by creatures are affected\
  \ as well. A magic object made of metal effectively has spell resistance equal to\
  \ 20 + its caster level against this spell. Artifacts cannot be transmuted. Weapons\
  \ converted from metal to wood take a â€“2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. The\
  \ armor bonus of any armor converted from metal to wood is reduced by 2. Weapons\
  \ changed by this spell splinter and break on any natural attack roll of 1 or 2,\
  \ and armor changed by this spell loses an additional point of armor bonus every\
  \ time it is struck with a natural attack roll of 19 or 20."
