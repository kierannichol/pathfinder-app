description: "Resembling a slim scroll case made of bamboo or metal, this tube is\
  \ filled with fine sand that is soaked or coated with inhaled or contact poison.\
  \ When loaded with 3 doses of these types of poison, you can blow into the tube\
  \ to disperse the poisoned sand into your enemies' faces in a 15-foot cone. Each\
  \ creature in the cone is affected as if afflicted with 1 dose of the poison. Even\
  \ when loaded with unpoisoned sand, the tube lets loose a powerful irritant, and\
  \ an opponent struck must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude saving throw or be dazzled\
  \ for 1 round. Once expended, the tube must be repacked before it can be used again.\
  \ Repacking a tube requires a full-round action, or a standard action if you have\
  \ the Rapid Reload feat."
