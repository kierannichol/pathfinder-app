description: "This black scabbard is engraved with intricate silver runes that depict\
  \ all manner of bladed weapons. A scabbard of keen edges can shrink or enlarge to\
  \ accommodate any knife, dagger, sword, or similar weapon up to and including a\
  \ greatsword. Up to three times per day on command, the scabbard casts keen edge\
  \ on any blade placed within it. Runes similar to those on the outside of the scabbard\
  \ appear on a blade while it is under this keen edge effect."
