description: "Handheld magnets are relatively weak and are mainly used to detect or\
  \ pull iron, mithral, or adamantine at a short range. They are not powerful enough\
  \ to tug metal over significant distances or aid in disarming creatures wielding\
  \ metal weapons. This hand-sized horseshoe magnet can lift up to a 3-pound iron\
  \ weight."
