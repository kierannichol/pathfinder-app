description: "Wrought from cold iron, this rod allows its wielder to escape from even\
  \ the tightest of bonds or grasps. If an opponent grapples the wielder of this rod,\
  \ the ends of the rod extend, flailing about in an attempt to free the user. The\
  \ rod's wielder gains a +5 bonus to CMD when attempting to evade or break out of\
  \ a grapple; additionally, the holder cannot be pinned while wielding the rod.\n\
  The rod's wielder gains a +5 competence bonus on Escape Artist checks when restrained\
  \ by nonmagical and inanimate means, such as ropes or manacles. The rod's owner\
  \ does not need to be holding the rod to gains this bonus; it must merely be on\
  \ the owner's person."
