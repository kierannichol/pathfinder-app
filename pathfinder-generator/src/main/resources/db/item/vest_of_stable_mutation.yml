description: "This leather vest is fitted with a number of pockets that are useful\
  \ for storing the ingredients necessary for alchemical tinkering. The main ability\
  \ of this vest, however, is to lessen the debilitating effects of an alchemist's\
  \ mutagen. While under the effect of any type of mutagen, the wearer takes no penalty\
  \ to mental ability scores from that mutagen."
