description: "This +3 aberration-bane conserving heavy crossbow is crafted with a\
  \ darkwood body and embedded with brass, gold, and silver inlays. A creature struck\
  \ by a bolt from this crossbow is affected by calm emotions (Will DC 16). On a confirmed\
  \ critical hit, the save DC for this effect increases by 4.\nUp to three times per\
  \ day as a swift action, the wielder can modify a loaded bolt into a brain-boring\
  \ shot. These shots are not replenished by the conserving property of the weapon\
  \ and are destroyed on impact or miss.\nBrain-Boring Shot: The bolt is magically\
  \ capped with a reinforced metal head. When the bolt hits, it automatically strikes\
  \ somewhere near the target's brain (this attack has no effect against a target\
  \ without a brain). The bolt head detaches and bores into the target's flesh, dealing\
  \ an additional 6d6 points of damage before dissolving. This damage is not multiplied\
  \ on a critical hit. If the target is affected by an ongoing mind-affecting effect,\
  \ it can immediately attempt a new Will save to remove the effect. If the brain-boring\
  \ shot was a confirmed critical hit, the target gains a +4 circumstance bonus on\
  \ its Will save."
