description: "This long-barreled early firearm has a slim horizontal disk with eight\
  \ uncovered slots, each of which can hold one bullet and 1 dose of black powder\
  \ (but not alchemical cartridges). Each time the weapon is fired, the disk rotates\
  \ to load the next available shot. Misfiring with a cylinder rifle causes rogue\
  \ sparks to cause the gun to erratically fire all the remaining bullets loaded in\
  \ the disk, and each stray bullet has a 50% chance to hit the wielder, dealing 1d6\
  \ points of damage. Reloading a cylinder rifle requires two full-round actions,\
  \ regardless of the number of slots being loaded. The Rapid Reload feat reduces\
  \ this to a single full-round action."
