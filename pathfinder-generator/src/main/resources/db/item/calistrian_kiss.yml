description: "The long blade of this weapon bears shifting black and yellow patterns,\
  \ resembling the markings of a wasp. This +1 heartseeker elven curve blade has three\
  \ slots built into the hilt for storing doses of poison. Adding or removing a dose\
  \ of poison from the blade is a swift action that requires a free hand.\nAny creatures\
  \ struck by a Calistrian kiss take a –4 penalty on any saving throw against the\
  \ poison applied to the weapon. The frequency of any poison applied to the Calistrian\
  \ kiss increases by 2 (for example, black adder venom lasts 8 rounds instead of\
  \ 6, and arsenic lasts for 6 minutes instead of 4). Attempts to cure the poisoned\
  \ target with a skill or magic take a –4 penalty."
