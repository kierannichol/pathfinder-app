description: "This small flag sports a banner that is 2 inches wide by 3 inches tall\
  \ and has a thin wooden dowel that serves as the flag post. When a creature plants\
  \ the flag in the ground and speaks the command word, the flag expands into a military\
  \ tent of stout canvas with the flag flapping from the centermost tent pole. The\
  \ tent fills a space that is 15 feet by 30 feet. The entrance of the tent consists\
  \ of a vestibule with an outer and inner flap for keeping light from spilling out.\
  \ Inside, the commander's tent contains a central table and several chairs and cushions.\
  \ Several lanterns hang from pegs around the perimeter of the interior, providing\
  \ sufficient light for reading letters, maps, and so forth. Despite this illumination,\
  \ the exterior of the tent does not glow so long as only one tent flap at the vestibule\
  \ (inner or outer) is open at any given time. The center table features a blank\
  \ map. Once per week, any creature inside the tent can utter a second command word\
  \ to transform the map into a model of the nearby area, as sand table (see page\
  \ 164).\nWhile the commander's tent is in tent form, the user can utter a third\
  \ command word while holding a new flag to replace the flag atop the tent with one\
  \ of his own choosing. The two pennants swap places. A fourth command word causes\
  \ the tent to break down, returning to its miniature flag form."
