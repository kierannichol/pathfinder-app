description: "This small brass cauldron is engraved with arcane runes, and its bottom\
  \ is blackened by fire. To function, the cauldron must be filled with pure water\
  \ and heated from below. When any two potions are emptied into the cauldron, they\
  \ are transmuted into a single potion, the spell level of which must be equal to\
  \ or lower than that of the component potion with the lower spell level. The user\
  \ of the cauldron must designate which potion is to be created when the process\
  \ begins. The entire process takes 1 minute per spell level of the potion being\
  \ created."
