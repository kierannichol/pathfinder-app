  \ battle. When the horn is blown, all creatures within 60 feet who have not yet\
  \ acted in combat are no longer considered flat-footed. The horn has no effect on\
  \ other conditions or abilities that treat a creature as flat-footed.\nA barbarian\
  \ who sounds a horn of battle clarity may spend 2 rounds of rage to act as if she\
  \ had the superstition rage power for the remainder of that battle."
