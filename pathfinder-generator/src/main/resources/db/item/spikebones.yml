description: "Spikebones are a collection of bleached humanoid bones— typically the\
  \ ribs, vertebrae, and finger bones—carried in a crude pouch made of the humanoid's\
  \ skin and connective tissue. Three times per day, the spikebones can be cast upon\
  \ the ground as a standard action to create an area of dangerous spikes. Bony in\
  \ color and shape, these sharp protrusions function like a spike growth spell. The\
  \ spikes fill four contiguous 10-foot-square areas, shaped by the user at the time\
  \ of deployment. The spikes remain effective for up to 3 hours, after which they\
  \ vanish and the spikebones magically reappearing in their pouch."
