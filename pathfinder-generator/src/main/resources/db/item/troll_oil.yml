description: "This crimson liquid is viscous and tastes foul. If you drink it, for\
  \ the next hour you automatically stabilize when reduced to negative hit points\
  \ (unless the damage is sufficient to instantly kill you) and have a 50% chance\
  \ each round to end any bleed effect on you. If you take fire or acid damage, the\
  \ benefits of troll oil are suspended for 1 round."
