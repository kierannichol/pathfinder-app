description: "These mithral horseshoes are imbued with heavenly power. They grant\
  \ the holy weapon special ability to the wearer's hoof attacks, and if the wearer\
  \ hits an evil-aligned target with both hooves in the same round, the target is\
  \ staggered for 1 round (Fortitude DC 16 negates). In addition, the wearer gains\
  \ a +2 sacred bonus on bull rush, drag, and overrun combat maneuvers. If the wearer\
  \ is a mount and the rider uses the Trample feat, add 2 to the rider's overrun combat\
  \ maneuver check. If the wearer uses the trample special ability, increase the trample\
  \ DC by 2; if the target fails its save against the trample attempt, add the damage\
  \ from the holy weapon special ability to the trample damage."
