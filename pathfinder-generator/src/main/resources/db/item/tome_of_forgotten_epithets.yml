description: "The cover of this hefty, leather-bound volume has an ornate spine adorned\
  \ with a stylized eye worked in metal and jewels hinges and is sealed shut by a\
  \ strap with a brass scarab fastener. When first created, a tome of forgotten epithets\
  \ has 50 pages. Each page can hold the name of a creature, along with a short description\
  \ that distinguishes it from other creatures with the same name. The wielder of\
  \ a tome of forgotten epithets can speak a command word to cause the burning eye\
  \ on the cover to close, protecting those named within as per mind blank for 24\
  \ hours and sealing the book shut for this duration. Afterward, the eye on the cover\
  \ reopens, and any pages that held names vanish."
