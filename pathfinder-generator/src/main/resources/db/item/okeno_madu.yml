description: "A common sight among the more deplorable slavers of Katapesh, this +1\
  \ leather madu is adorned with body parts— ranging from fingers and toes to severed\
  \ heads— each one crudely affixed to the shield's spikes. The wielder of the shield\
  \ gains a +4 competence bonus on Intimidate checks while the shield is visible.\
  \ The wearer and any associated companions take a –4 penalty on all Diplomacy checks\
  \ made against good-aligned creatures while the shield is visible.\nOnce per day\
  \ as a standard action, the wielder of an Okeno madu can shake the shield, causing\
  \ the fetishes to rattle uncontrollably for 3 rounds. When he shakes the shield,\
  \ the wielder can choose one creature within 35 feet to suffer the effects of the\
  \ spell castigate (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 210) as long as the fetishes\
  \ continue shaking."
