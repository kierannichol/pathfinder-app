description: "The helm of reclamation is designed to destroy large groups of undead\
  \ or powerful individual undead creatures, and is often used by undead-hating clerics\
  \ with a flair for the dramatic. The gems of this helm produce sunburst (10 yellow\
  \ diamonds), searing light (30 bloodstones), and daylight (40 opals). Like a standard\
  \ helm of brilliance, it glows near and harms undead, and has the flaming weapon\
  \ ability, but does not protect against fire or risk detonation."
