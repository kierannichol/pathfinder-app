description: "Large eagle feathers decorate the back and arms of this magnificent\
  \ cape. Should the cape's wearer fall more than 5 feet, the cape spreads out behind\
  \ the wearer and she gently drifts to the ground. This acts exactly like a feather\
  \ fall spell for the wearer only. Once per day, if the wearer grasps the edges of\
  \ the cape and spreads her arms, she transforms into an eagle (as per the beast\
  \ shape I spell, except that it allows only eagle form and the wearer gains the\
  \ eagle's full fly speed of 80 feet). This effect lasts for 10 minutes but can be\
  \ ended prematurely as a standard action. In addition, while in eagle form, the\
  \ wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks."
