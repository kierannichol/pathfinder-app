description: "A maleficus spike is an ancient item forged of cold iron with an adamantine\
  \ core designed to keep demons at bay. When driven into the wall of a building,\
  \ a maleficus spike infuses the walls of the structure with a dimensional lock effect\
  \ and a ward that repels evil outsiders. Any outsider with the evil subtype that\
  \ tries to enter or damage the warded building must attempt a DC 30 Will save. If\
  \ it fails, the outsider takes 12d6 points of damage and becomes nauseated for 1\
  \ hour. An outsider that remains inside a building warded in this manner must make\
  \ a new Will save each round to avoid damage and nausea. The effect is lessened\
  \ against non-outsider evil creatures, but they too are affected—such creatures\
  \ gain a +4 bonus on their Will saves, take only 4d6 points of damage on a failed\
  \ save, and are nauseated for only 1 minute.\nThe stone and doors of a structure\
  \ warded by a maleficus spike are considered to be magically treated (+20 to Break\
  \ DCs, double hardness, and double hit points). Additionally, the structure self-repairs\
  \ damage at the rate of 5 points of damage per round, provided the damage was inflicted\
  \ while the maleficus spike was functioning; the spike can't repair existing damage\
  \ when it is installed.\nA maleficus spike consumes an enormous amount of magical\
  \ energy. It contains enough energy to ward a structure for 24 hours, after which\
  \ it becomes dormant until recharged. Recharging a maleficus spike requires a spellcaster\
  \ to spend 10 minutes in contact with the spike, after which the spellcaster selects\
  \ a number of spell slots totaling no fewer than 24 spell levels to expend to infuse\
  \ the artifact with enough energy to ward the structure for another 24 hours. Prepared\
  \ spells in these slots are lost for a day, and for spontaneous spellcasters those\
  \ slots are used for a day. Spell-like abilities cannot be used to fuel a maleficus\
  \ spike."
destruction: "To destroy a maleficus spike, it must be hammered into a structure on\
  \ the Abyss using a tool bearing the unholy symbol of any demon lord."
