description: "This +1 firearm bullet deals normal damage, but when it hits a living\
  \ creature, it burrows into the creature's flesh, causing wracking pain until removed\
  \ or until the bullet burrows its way out of the creature. While these bullets burrow,\
  \ the creature is staggered. This effect lasts for 1d3 rounds or until the bullet\
  \ is removed with a DC 15 Heal check made as a standard action. Greater burrowing\
  \ bullets take longer to pass though the bodies of living creatures (the staggered\
  \ effect lasts 1d3+2 rounds) and are harder to remove (DC 20 Heal check as a standard\
  \ action)."
