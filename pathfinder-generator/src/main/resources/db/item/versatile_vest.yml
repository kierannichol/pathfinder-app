description: "This sturdy vest stays dry and spotless in the worst of conditions.\
  \ You can secure up to six objects (weighing up to 1 pound each) to the vest by\
  \ holding them to it and speaking a command word. You can retrieve any of these\
  \ items as a move action.\nIn addition, the vest has four large pockets, each capable\
  \ of holding as much as 1/2 cubic foot in volume or 5 pounds in weight, and weighing\
  \ only 1 pound when full. When closed, the pockets are proof against water and the\
  \ elements. The first pocket contains 1 day's worth of trail rations, a quart of\
  \ water in a waterskin, two candles, and a tindertwig. The vest recreates these\
  \ items if the first pocket is left empty for 3 days."
