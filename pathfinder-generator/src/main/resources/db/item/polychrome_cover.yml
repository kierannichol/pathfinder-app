description: "This multicolored tarp is made from intricately woven cloth that gives\
  \ its exterior the texture of stonework. It covers a 10-foot-by- 10-foot area and\
  \ can be placed vertically, magically supporting its own weight. A polychrome cover\
  \ magically takes on the same coloration of nearby stone, imitating any terrain\
  \ it's in contact with. The coloration of the cover is an illusion effect that can\
  \ be disbelieved (Will DC 16). Those who successfully disbelieve the effect instead\
  \ see the cover's true coloration.\nWhen a polychrome cover is crafted, the maker\
  \ designates any number of creatures present at its creation to be immune to the\
  \ cover's illusory effect. The crafter can instead exclude a specific race from\
  \ the item's illusion. Most polychrome covers are set to exclude svirfneblin."
