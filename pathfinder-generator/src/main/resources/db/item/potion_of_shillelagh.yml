description: "Your own nonmagical club or quarterstaff becomes a weapon with a +1\
  \ enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. A quarterstaff gains this enhancement\
  \ for both ends of the weapon. It deals damage as if it were two size categories\
  \ larger (a Small club or quarterstaff so transmuted deals 1d8 points of damage,\
  \ a Medium 2d6, and a Large 3d6), +1 for its enhancement bonus. These effects only\
  \ occur when the weapon is wielded by you. If you do not wield it, the weapon behaves\
  \ as if unaffected by this spell."
