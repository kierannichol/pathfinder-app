description: "These vambraces change their appearance depending on who wears them.\
  \ If the wearer is a cavalier, these vambraces display the symbol of his order.\
  \ When unworn or in the hands of a non-cavalier, they appear to be an ordinary pair\
  \ of steel vambraces. A cavalier wearing these vambraces is considered two class\
  \ levels higher for purposes of determining the effects of his challenge class feature.\
  \ Furthermore, once per day as a swift action, a cavalier with the tactician class\
  \ feature can increase the area in which he grants teamwork feats. Before the end\
  \ of his next turn, when the cavalier grants his allies a teamwork feat, he can\
  \ grant it to all allies within 60 feet, though they must still be able to see and\
  \ hear him."
