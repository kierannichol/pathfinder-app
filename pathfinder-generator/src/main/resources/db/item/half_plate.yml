description: "Half-plate armor combines elements of full plate and chainmail, incorporating\
  \ several sizable plates of sculpted metal with an underlying mesh of chain links.\
  \ While this suit protects vital areas with several layers of armor, it is not sculpted\
  \ to a single individual's frame, reducing its wearer's mobility even more than\
  \ a suit of full plate. Half-plate armor includes gauntlets and a helm."
