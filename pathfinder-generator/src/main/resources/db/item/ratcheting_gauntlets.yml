description: "This set of cold iron gauntlets has pistons, gears, and hinges connecting\
  \ all the joints and plates. As a swift action, the wearer can command one or both\
  \ of the gauntlets to lock into position or unlock and move normally. If a gauntlet\
  \ locks while holding a weapon, it acts as a locked gauntlet, providing the wearer\
  \ a +10 bonus to his Combat Maneuver Defense against being disarmed. Locking the\
  \ gauntlets also grants the wearer a +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks to pin a\
  \ grappled foe and Climb checks to catch himself while falling. They can also allow\
  \ other uses at the GM's discretion, such as hanging from a ledge or similar position\
  \ without having to attempt a Climb check or becoming fatigued."
