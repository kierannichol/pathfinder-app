description: "This bloodstained, skull-bedecked bayonet (Advanced Player's Guide 176)\
  \ has thin blood gutters running along both sides of its 14-inch blade. When attached\
  \ to a magic crossbow or firearm, a sharpshooter's blade gains the enhancement bonus\
  \ and other weapon special abilities of the ranged weapon it is attached to, and\
  \ feats, spells, and abilities that enhance or improve attacks with the ranged weapon\
  \ can be used with the sharpshooter's blade, provided these would work with a weapon\
  \ of the bayonet's type (a two-handed piercing melee weapon). These bonuses and\
  \ benefits don't stack with bonuses or benefits of the same type or from the same\
  \ source. For example, a character with both Weapon Focus (bayonet) and Weapon Focus\
  \ (heavy crossbow) would only gain the benefits of one of those feats when attacking\
  \ with a sharpshooter's blade attached to a heavy crossbow. Use-activated abilities\
  \ of the ranged weapon can be triggered through the sharpshooter's blade but count\
  \ toward the usage limitations of the ranged weapon.\nWhen not attached to a magic\
  \ crossbow or firearm, a sharpshooter's blade has no enhancement bonus, but is still\
  \ of masterwork quality and counts as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage\
  \ reduction."
