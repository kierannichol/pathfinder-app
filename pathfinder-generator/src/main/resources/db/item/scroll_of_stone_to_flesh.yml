name: "Scroll of Stone to Flesh"
description: "This spell restores a petrified creature to its normal state, restoring\
  \ life and goods. The creature must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to survive the process.\
  \ Any petrified creature, regardless of size, can be restored. The spell also can\
  \ convert a mass of stone into a fleshy substance. Such flesh is inert and lacking\
  \ a vital life force unless a life force or magical energy is available. For example,\
  \ this spell would turn an animated stone statue into an animated flesh statue,\
  \ but an ordinary statue would become a mass of inert flesh in the shape of the\
  \ statue. You can affect an object that fits within a cylinder from 1 foot to 3\
  \ feet in diameter and up to 10 feet long or a cylinder of up to those dimensions\
  \ in a larger mass of stone."
