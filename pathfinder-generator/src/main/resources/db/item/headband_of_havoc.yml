description: "This band of raggedly stitched animal skins and teeth focuses a barbarian\
  \ wearer's bloodlust. When the wearer enters a rage, she selects one of her rage\
  \ powers. For the duration of the rage, that power functions as if the wearer's\
  \ barbarian level were four levels higher.\nOnce per day when the wearer is attacked\
  \ or has to make a saving throw against a hostile effect, she may spend 2 rounds\
  \ of rage to begin a rage as an immediate action. This rage becomes active prior\
  \ to resolving the attack that triggered it and lasts until the start of her next\
  \ turn (at which time she may continue to rage as if she had begun the rage in the\
  \ normal manner)."
