description: "A whispering amulet looks like a bejeweled glabrezu head to the person\
  \ who owns it, but to anyone else appears to be a relatively unremarkable necklace.\
  \ As long as it is worn, a whispering amulet masks the wearer's alignment as if\
  \ by undetectable alignment. Once per day by grasping the amulet in one hand and\
  \ whispering, as a standard action, the wearer may send a single message of no more\
  \ than 25 words to another creature as if via sending —the message arrives at the\
  \ intended target in the form of a soft whisper in the left ear, and the recipient\
  \ can opt to whisper a return message to the wearer of the amulet. A single glabrezu\
  \ is linked to each whispering amulet, and any message sent or received via the\
  \ amulet can be heard by the demon as well. Finally, by grasping the amulet and\
  \ whispering the glabrezu's name, the wearer can make a single wish. This destroys\
  \ the whispering amulet, and as the wish itself is granted by the glabrezu, it likely\
  \ has unexpected and unintended consequences. If the glabrezu has already used its\
  \ wish ability during that month, the attempt to wish fails and the amulet is not\
  \ destroyed— there's a 5% chance that this occurs if the GM doesn't already know\
  \ for sure if the glabrezu's wish is available."
