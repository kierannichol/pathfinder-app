description: "Powdered chalk, flour, and similar materials are popular with adventurers\
  \ for their utility in pinpointing invisible creatures. Throwing a bag of powder\
  \ into a square is an attack against AC 5, and momentarily reveals whether an invisible\
  \ creature is there. A much more effective method is to spread powder on a surface\
  \ (which takes 1 full round) and look for footprints."
