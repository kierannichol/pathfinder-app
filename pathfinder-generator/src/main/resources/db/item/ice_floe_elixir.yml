description: "This chilled elixir usually takes the form of a pale blue liquid in\
  \ a small glass vial coated in ice. Imbibing the elixir grants the drinker cold\
  \ resistance 10 and the ability to merge with solid ice in the same fashion as meld\
  \ into stone. These effects last for 1 hour.\nAlternatively, instead of drinking\
  \ the ice floe elixir, the vial can be uncorked, releasing a cold, glowing vapor\
  \ from the vial's mouth that coalesces around all living creatures within 30 feet.\
  \ Creatures covered with the cloying vapor take a –20 penalty on Stealth checks\
  \ and do not benefit from blur, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects for\
  \ as long as they stay in the affected area. The vapor also reveals figments, mirror\
  \ images, and projected images in the area for what they really are. This effect\
  \ lasts for 5 rounds before the vapor dissipates. This effect does not function\
  \ in any environment already affected by fog, mist, or cloud-like effects."
