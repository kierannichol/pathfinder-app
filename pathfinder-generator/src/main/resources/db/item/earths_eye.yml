description: "The earth's eye is a small geode that resembles a crystalline eye that\
  \ sparkles brilliantly. When the earth's eye is worn on a headband and positioned\
  \ in the center of the forehead, it creates a mental bond between the wearer and\
  \ all natural, unworked stone within 200 feet. By concentrating, the wearer can\
  \ alter this stone in the following ways. These changes are permanent but are too\
  \ gradual to damage most creatures and objects.\nCalcific Alterations: The wearer\
  \ pulls mineral-rich moisture through the stone to create stalactites, stalagmites,\
  \ and similar rock formations. These formations are the same type of stone as the\
  \ surrounding area, and they appear to be seamless, natural growths. This change\
  \ requires 1 full round of concentration for each 5-foot square affected.\nCreate\
  \ Habitat: The wearer draws forth a natural spring or pool of clear water, causes\
  \ edible molds or fungi to sprout, or opens narrow vents that bring in fresh air\
  \ from elsewhere. This change requires 1 full round of concentration for each 5-foot\
  \ square affected.\nCrystalline Forms: The wearer transforms stone into translucent\
  \ crystal. Sighted creatures can see through up to 30 feet of translucent crystal;\
  \ thicker crystal is too cloudy to see through. The wearer can also transform nonmagical\
  \ crystal into ordinary stone. This change requires 1 minute of concentration for\
  \ each 5-foot square affected.\nReduce Stone: The wearer can remove stone entirely,\
  \ but the resulting open space appears natural. Anything previously supported by\
  \ stone that was removed entirely—such as a cavern ceiling—collapses. This change\
  \ requires 1 minute of concentration for each 5-foot square affected.\nStone Tell:\
  \ The wearer can cause a 5-foot-square area of stone to ripple slightly, displaying\
  \ momentary images of creatures and objects that have touched, used, or passed by\
  \ the stone. This functions as stone tell but works only on natural stone. This\
  \ requires 10 minutes of concentration.\nThe earth's eye does not function when\
  \ in natural sunlight."
destruction: "A mortal wearer must use the earth's eye to entomb herself entirely\
  \ within stone, with no open space within 200 feet other than the space the wearer\
  \ occupies. The wearer must then cast flesh to stone on herself to merge with the\
  \ surrounding earth, destroying herself and the earth's eye."
