description: "A bilious bottle appears to be a tightly stoppered container of water.\
  \ It can be thrown as a splash weapon. When a bilious bottle is opened or shatters,\
  \ the foul fluid inside immediately expands into a 30-foot-radius cloud of noxious\
  \ vapors. These vapors are invisible, but any creature within the area of effect\
  \ of the cloud must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw at the start of its\
  \ turn or suffer one of the following random effects. The vapors created by a bilious\
  \ bottle dissipate after 1 minute, or automatically if exposed to anything more\
  \ than a moderate wind. The vapors created by a bilious bottle are a poison effect."
