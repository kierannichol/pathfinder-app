description: "Designed to resemble the wide scales on a serpent's belly, this armor\
  \ functions as a +1 breastplate of fire resistance. The first time the wearer is\
  \ struck in melee, the armor animates and begins crushing its wearer. On the round\
  \ that the armor animates, it automatically grapples the wearer. In following rounds,\
  \ at the beginning of the wearer's turn, the armor makes a grapple combat maneuver\
  \ check (CMB +20) to constrict the wearer. If successful, the armor deals 2d6 points\
  \ of damage each round. Once animated, the armor releases its grip only when it\
  \ is destroyed or its wearer dies. The wearer can't physically remove the armor\
  \ once it activates, but others can help destroy or remove it. This armor functions\
  \ normally (without animating) when worn by unliving creatures such as constructs\
  \ and undead."
