description: "When this translucent +2 arrow is fired, it becomes ethereal until it\
  \ enters the target's space. A phase arrow ignores cover of all kinds, including\
  \ total cover, and can be fired at a target even if the wielder doesn't have line\
  \ of effect. However, if the wielder cannot see or otherwise pinpoint the target,\
  \ she risks attacking the wrong space, and even if she attacks the right space,\
  \ the target still has total concealment against the attack (granting a 50% miss\
  \ chance)."
