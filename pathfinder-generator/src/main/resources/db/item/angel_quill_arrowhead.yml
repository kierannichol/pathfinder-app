description: "This barbed, cold iron arrowhead is alchemically treated to inflict\
  \ additional harm while embedded in creatures that are vulnerable to cold iron.\
  \ For every angel quill arrowhead that damages a target with DR/cold iron, the target's\
  \ damage reduction decreases by 1. Up to five angel quill arrowheads can affect\
  \ a single target at any one time, reducing the target's DR/cold iron by up to 5\
  \ (additional arrowheads have no effect aside from dealing damage as normal). An\
  \ affected target can pull out a number of arrowheads equal to her Dexterity modifier\
  \ (minimum 1) as a full-round action with a successful DC 15 Heal check. Alternatively,\
  \ the application of any magical healing causes all angel quill arrowheads embedded\
  \ in the creature to instantly fall out.\nAngel quill arrowheads of silver and adamantine\
  \ are also available for the same price, and affect creatures with DR/silver or\
  \ DR/adamantine, respectively. Crafting any type of angel quill arrowhead requires\
  \ a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
