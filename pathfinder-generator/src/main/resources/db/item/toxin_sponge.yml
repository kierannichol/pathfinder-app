description: "This rough, ridged sponge is chalky black in color, and is used to absorb\
  \ poisonous gases from the surrounding air. When the command word is spoken, a toxin\
  \ sponge can absorb a 10- foot cube of inhaled poison, removing the gas from that\
  \ area and concentrating it in the sponge, which turns a pale green when filled.\
  \ The sponge must be in the affected area of the poison gas in order to absorb it,\
  \ and once it is absorbed, the duration of the poison effect (if any) is effectively\
  \ paused. A toxin sponge can absorb either nonmagical poisons or magical poisons\
  \ (and the poisonous effects of magical gases and mists) with a caster level of\
  \ 9th or lower.\nA toxin sponge can absorb only one poison at a time; an absorbed\
  \ poison dissipates harmlessly after 24 hours. Alternatively, a creature can squeeze\
  \ the filled sponge as a standard action before 24 hours have passed to release\
  \ the noxious gas back into the air centered on the user. A creature may unknowingly\
  \ activate a poison-filled toxin sponge during the course of regular bathing. Released\
  \ poison takes up the same area it did when it was absorbed and lasts for the remaining\
  \ duration of the poison when it was initially absorbed."
