description: "These needles of dried and augmented mugwort ignite at one end when\
  \ removed from the alcohol in which they are stored. A set of vivifying moxibustion\
  \ needles can be used to perform a healing procedure on a willing or helpless creature\
  \ with a successful DC 15 Heal check and 1 hour of effort. Failing the check by\
  \ 4 or less indicates that nothing happens, while failure by 5 or more deals 1d4\
  \ points of damage to the subject. If the procedure is performed successfully, the\
  \ subject gains a +2 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves against diseases, cold\
  \ effects, and effects that deal Dexterity or Strength damage for the next 24 hours.\
  \ If the patient is affected by an ongoing effect that can be resisted with a successful\
  \ Fortitude save, he can attempt an immediate saving throw to end the effect (using\
  \ the +2 alchemical bonus if applicable); this final benefit can be gained only\
  \ once per day."
