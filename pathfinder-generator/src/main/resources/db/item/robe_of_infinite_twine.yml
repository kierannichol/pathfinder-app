description: "This coarse hempen robe seems made from a single strand of twine. The\
  \ wearer can draw up to 30 feet of twine or up to 10 feet of hemp rope per round\
  \ from the robe without harming it. As an immediate action, the wearer can draw\
  \ up to 150 feet of twine or 50 feet of rope from the robe, but this gives the robe\
  \ the broken condition and suppresses its powers until it is repaired. Twine or\
  \ rope drawn from the robe remains connected until cut or torn, but is treated as\
  \ common material rather than part of a magic item. Pieces removed become normal\
  \ twine or rope."
