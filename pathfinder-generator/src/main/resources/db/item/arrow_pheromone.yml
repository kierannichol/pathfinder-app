description: "The arrowhead of this arrow is coated with potent substances that react\
  \ to blood and sweat, releasing a strong aroma that most predators recognize as\
  \ the scent of tasty injured prey and other creatures perceive as merely unpleasant.\
  \ Any creature with the scent ability gains a +2 circumstance bonus on attack and\
  \ damage rolls against a target marked with a pheromone arrow. This effect lasts\
  \ for 1 hour or until the target spends 1 minute washing it off."
