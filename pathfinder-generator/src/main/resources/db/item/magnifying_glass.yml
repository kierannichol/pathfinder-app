description: "This simple lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful\
  \ as a substitute for a flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with\
  \ a magnifying glass requires bright light, such as sunlight to focus, tinder to\
  \ ignite, and at least a fullround action. A magnifying glass grants a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus on Appraise checks involving any item that is small or highly detailed."
