name: "Potion of Hideous Laughter"
description: "This spell afflicts the subject with uncontrollable laughter. It collapses\
  \ into gales of manic laughter, falling prone. The subject can take no actions while\
  \ laughing, but is not considered helpless. After the spell ends, it can act normally.\
  \ On the creature's next turn, it may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect.\
  \ This is a full round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this\
  \ save is successful, the effect ends. If not, the creature continues laughing for\
  \ the entire duration."
