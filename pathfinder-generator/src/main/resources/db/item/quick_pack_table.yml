description: "A quick-pack table is a piece of lightweight furniture designed to be\
  \ both portable and versatile. Street-corner hawkers commonly use such tables to\
  \ display small goods for sale.\nA quick-pack table can be set up in a relatively\
  \ small area and usually takes up a few square feet. When opened, the table has\
  \ four legs and a flat top surface, along with a bookcase-style upright display\
  \ where items such as jewelry can be exhibited. When necessary, the table and its\
  \ contents can be closed, folded up, and collapsed in a single round, with all the\
  \ goods safely held in their respective compartments. The owner can carry the folded\
  \ table under one arm."
