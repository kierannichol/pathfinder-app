name: "Scroll of Vampiric Shadow Shield"
description: "This spell wreathes you in shadowy energy and damages those that make\
  \ melee attacks against you. Any creature that strikes you with its body or a handheld\
  \ weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points\
  \ of negative energy damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). If the attacker\
  \ has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding melee weapons\
  \ with reach are not subject to this damage. When an attacker takes damage from\
  \ the spell, you heal a number of hit points equal to 25% of the damage the spell\
  \ dealt."
