description: "This alabaster headdress is studded with lines of delicate rubies and\
  \ represents the height of Kersite fashion mixed with Kalistocratic needs. These\
  \ austere headdresses come with an imbued soulâ€”one utterly dedicated to assisting\
  \ the adherents of the Prophecies of Kalistrade unto death. Once per day as an immediate\
  \ action, the wearer can allow the personality within the miter to rise to the fore\
  \ of her own consciousness. This effect lasts for 1 minute, during which the wearer\
  \ can roll twice and use the higher result for all Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based\
  \ skill checks. The wearer can activate this ability after such a skill check has\
  \ been rolled but before the result is determined, allowing for a reroll.\nAdditionally,\
  \ once per day as an immediate action, the wearer can gain the benefits of tower\
  \ of iron will V, as the possessing spirit rises to block any mental effects against\
  \ the wearer. This ability can be used regardless of whether the miter's other ability\
  \ is active."
