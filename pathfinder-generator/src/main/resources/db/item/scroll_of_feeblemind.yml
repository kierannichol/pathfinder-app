name: "Scroll of Feeblemind"
description: "Target creature's Intelligence and Charisma scores each drop to 1. The\
  \ affected creature is unable to use Intelligence- or Charisma-based skills, cast\
  \ spells, understand language, or communicate coherently. Still, it knows who its\
  \ friends are and can follow them and even protect them. The subject remains in\
  \ this state until a heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell is used to cancel\
  \ the effect of the feeblemind. A creature that can cast arcane spells, such as\
  \ a sorcerer or a wizard, takes a â€“4 penalty on its saving throw."
