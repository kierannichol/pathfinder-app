description: "Though they are technically sling ammunition, these thread- or cloth-wrapped\
  \ pebbles are mainly used for signaling or celebration rather than battle, as they\
  \ barely hit hard enough to sting. When soaked in oil or strong alcohol, they burn\
  \ brightly for 1 round, illuminating an area like a candle and creating brief streaks\
  \ of light as they fly through the air. They generally aren't hot enough and burn\
  \ out too quickly to ignite combustibles."
