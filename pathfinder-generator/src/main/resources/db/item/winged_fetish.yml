description: "This amulet is made of a dulled dagger wrapped with feathers. When activated,\
  \ it protects the wearer against undead creatures. The first time the wearer is\
  \ subject to an attack from an undead creature that requires a saving throw (such\
  \ as disease, paralysis, or energy drain), the amulet gives the wearer a sacred\
  \ (if activated with positive energy) or profane (if activated with negative energy)\
  \ bonus on her saving throw against that attack. This bonus is equal to the number\
  \ of dice of the activating cleric's channel energy ability. The amulet remains\
  \ charged until its magic is used or 1 hour has passed."
