description: "This verdant branch glows with a soothing, pale green light. Carefully\
  \ pruned from the world's first tree, this artifact hums with energy. Full of everlasting\
  \ life, it needs time to transfer its magic. It can cast heal at will, but needs\
  \ a full hour to do so. Once a day, it can cast resurrection, but it takes the full\
  \ day to do so.\nThe branch serves only those who are worthy. It will not stay in\
  \ the possession of a non-good creature for long, disappearing in 1d4 days. It will\
  \ similarly disappear while in the possession of a good creature who associates\
  \ with nongood creatures, but this takes 2d8 days to occur."
destruction: "The branch of life can be destroyed by taking it to the heart of the\
  \ Negative Energy Plane."
