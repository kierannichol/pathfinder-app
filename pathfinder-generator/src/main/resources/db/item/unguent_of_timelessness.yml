description: "When applied to any matter that was once alive, such as wood, paper,\
  \ or a dead body, this ointment allows that substance to resist the passage of time.\
  \ Each year of actual time affects the substance as if only a day had passed. The\
  \ coated object gains a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. The unguent never\
  \ wears off, although it can be magically removed (by dispelling the effect, for\
  \ instance). One flask contains enough material to coat eight Medium or smaller\
  \ objects. A Large object counts as two Medium objects, and a Huge object counts\
  \ as four Medium objects."
