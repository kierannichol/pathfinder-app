description: "These simple calfskin gloves intensify the avaricious inclinations of\
  \ their wearer. Kleptomaniac's gloves confer the same +5 competence bonus on Sleight\
  \ of Hands checks as gloves of larceny (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 237),\
  \ but the first time the wearer attempts to take something from a given creature\
  \ with a Sleight of Hand check, she must attempt another such check against that\
  \ creature at the first available opportunity, whether or not the first attempt\
  \ was successful. This increases the DC of the check by 10, as though the first\
  \ attempt were a failure, and it imparts a â€“20 penalty on the check. Kleptomaniac's\
  \ gloves can be removed only after the wearer benefits from a remove curse spell\
  \ or similar effect."
