description: "The tools of juvenile necromancers and bitter witches, mockingskulls\
  \ are immortal and sleepless guardians. Each is made from a humanoid skull inlaid\
  \ with a precious gem \"eye.\" Mockingskulls keep watch over an area with a +8 Perception\
  \ check bonus, and can be commanded to either warn away intruders or raise an alarm\
  \ by screaming insults and invectives. If a mockingskull screams invectives, it\
  \ can attempt an Intimidate check at a +10 bonus each round against one creature\
  \ within 30 feet.\nTreat a mockingskull as a single Hit Die mindless undead for\
  \ the purposes of spells and effects that control, damage, or hide creatures from\
  \ undead. A mockingskull has hardness 3 and 10 hit points; these hit points are\
  \ automatically restored every midnight. Although largely mindless, especially old\
  \ mockingskulls sometimes develop personality quirks."
