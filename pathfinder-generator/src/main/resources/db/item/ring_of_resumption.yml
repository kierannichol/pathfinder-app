description: "This adamantine ring contains a moving, notched golden circle that whirs\
  \ with healing energy when activated. Once per day when the wearer takes hit point\
  \ damage by any means, she can activate the ring as an immediate action. This immediately\
  \ allows a living wearer to regain 5 hit points per round and recover from an equal\
  \ amount of nonlethal damage. The wearer regenerates a total number of hit points\
  \ equal only to the damage taken when the ring was activated, and only a single\
  \ attack (or another single instance) can activate the ring. If the wearer sustains\
  \ damage from multiple sources simultaneously, she must pick which source activates\
  \ the ring. When either all of this damage is healed or the wearer's hit points\
  \ reach her hit point maximum (whichever comes first), the hit point regeneration\
  \ ceases.\nIn addition, the wearer is immune to bleed damage while the ring's regeneration\
  \ is active. If the wearer lost a limb, an organ, or any other body part as a result\
  \ of the effect she used to activate the ring, the ring regenerates it as per regenerate.\
  \ As with the spell, if the severed members are not present and touching the creature,\
  \ this regenerate effect takes 2d10 rounds (this may cause the regenerate effect\
  \ affecting a lost limb or organ to last longer than the hit point regeneration)."
