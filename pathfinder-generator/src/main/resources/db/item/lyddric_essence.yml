description: "This enzyme is derived from a parasitic fungus that breaks down most\
  \ organic tissue, and is especially destructive to plants and other fungi. A flask\
  \ of lyddric essence can be used like a flask of acid, dealing normal acid damage\
  \ to creatures not of the plant type. However, plant creatures, plants, and fungi\
  \ targeted with lyddric essence take 2d6 points of acid damage on a direct hit,\
  \ or 2 points of acid splash damage if within 5 feet of where it hits."
