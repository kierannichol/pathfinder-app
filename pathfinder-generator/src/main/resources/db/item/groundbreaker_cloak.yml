description: "This heavy cloak is made from the hide of a bulette, its thick gray\
  \ leather heavily abraded and seemingly always dusty, and features a plated dorsal\
  \ fin that protrudes from between the wearer's shoulders.\nAs a standard action,\
  \ the wearer of a groundbreaker cloak can dive into the ground, gaining a burrow\
  \ speed of 20 feet through sand, soil, gravel, and loose stone. While burrowing,\
  \ the wearer cannot run or charge and must travel along the surface, leaving the\
  \ exposed dorsal plate visible from above. As the wearer burrows, displaced dirt\
  \ swells before her and collapses behind her to create difficult terrain in her\
  \ wake. She has cover from attacks while burrowing. Unless the wearer has some other\
  \ means of breathing while submerged, she must hold her breath while burrowing.\
  \ Emerging from the ground is a move action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.\n\
  Once per day, the wearer can perform a charge attack by diving deep into the ground,\
  \ burrowing up to 40 feet in a straight line (ignoring any obstacles that don't\
  \ extend at least 10 feet into the ground) and bursting forth into a square adjacent\
  \ to a target creature. This use of the cloak does not disturb the terrain as noted\
  \ above, except where the wearer enters and exits the ground. The wearer ends this\
  \ movement standing and the target of the charge is considered flat-footed against\
  \ the attack."
