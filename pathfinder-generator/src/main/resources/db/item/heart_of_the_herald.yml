description: "This still-warm heart drips trickles of golden blood. Torn from the\
  \ chest of the Herald of Iomedae, the Heart of the Herald has been corrupted with\
  \ evil. Any lawful or good character who carries the heart gains 2 negative levels.\
  \ These negative levels remain as long as the heart is carried, even if it's carried\
  \ in an extradimensional space. These negative levels never result in actual level\
  \ loss, but they can't be overcome in any way so long as the heart is carried, with\
  \ one exception: a worshiper of Iomedae can cast atonement on the heart to suppress\
  \ this effect for 24 hours.\nOnce per day, by squeezing the heart in the hand as\
  \ a standard action, the user can cause all good outsiders within 60 feet to take\
  \ 1 point of Constitution bleed. A successful DC 20 Fortitude save negates this\
  \ effect. At the start of each round, a target may attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save\
  \ to end the effect.\nAs long as it its carried, the Heart of the Herald grants\
  \ SR 25 against all spells cast by worshipers of Iomedae and a +4 profane bonus\
  \ on all saving throws against such spells."
destruction: "The Heart of the Herald must be used to redeem the Herald of the Ivory\
  \ Labyrinth (see page 52)."
