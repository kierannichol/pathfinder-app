description: "This elaborately tapered lattice of adamantine and copper channels the\
  \ essence of one plane to which it has been attuned. Whenever it leaves a plane\
  \ of existence, it becomes attuned to one planar trait from among the following\
  \ that the plane possessed: minor negative-dominant, minor positivedominant, mildly\
  \ aligned. If a plane had multiple appropriate traits, one is chosen randomly. If\
  \ the plane has a more powerful version of one of these traits, the item attunes\
  \ to the weaker version of the trait. Once per day, when a command word is spoken,\
  \ the area within a 30-foot-radius emanation centered on the funnel gains the attuned\
  \ trait for 1 minute. If the user of a void funnel chooses, she becomes immune to\
  \ any negative effects of the funnel when it's activated."
