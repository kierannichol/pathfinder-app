description: "This pair of hinged metal plates is decorated with studs to add texture\
  \ to the pastry cakes you cook with it. You pour batter on it, close it, and place\
  \ it on a fire or stove to cook. Some waffle irons have plates that imprint the\
  \ waffle with a noble's coat of arms, a religious symbol, or a country's flag. A\
  \ mithral waffle iron almost always bears a specific insignia rather than the generic\
  \ waffle pattern. As with other mithral cookware, food rarely sticks to a mithral\
  \ waffle iron."
