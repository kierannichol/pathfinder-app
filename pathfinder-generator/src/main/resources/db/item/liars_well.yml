description: "When opened, this cursed well of many worlds has a 50% chance of displaying\
  \ a false image of its destination. For example, the well may appear to open onto\
  \ the plane of Axis while in reality opening onto a layer of the Abyss, though the\
  \ difference is not always to the user's detriment. Any creatures emerging from\
  \ the other side are not subject to the illusion. The false image is defeated by\
  \ a true seeing spell."
