description: "This air-filled leather or organ bladder ends in a trailing rope weighed\
  \ down with a 40-pound stone or piece of metal. The weight is just heavy enough\
  \ to counteract the bladder's buoyancy and cause it to sink. When the rope is cut\
  \ free from the weight and tied to an object weighing less than 40 pounds, the lifting\
  \ bag rises to the surface with its cargo (the lighter the cargo, the faster the\
  \ ascent). Lifting bags collapse under too much pressure and are destroyed if brought\
  \ to a depth greater than 200 feet."
