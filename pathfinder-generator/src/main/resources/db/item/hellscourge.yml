description: "This +1 unholy scorpion whip (Ultimate Combat 144) is fashioned from\
  \ skin flayed from a barbed devil's back. It grants its wielder a +5 competence\
  \ bonus on Intimidate checks. A shaken creature struck by the hellscourge must succeed\
  \ at a DC 17 Will save or become frightened for 1 round. A frightened or panicked\
  \ creature struck must instead save or cower for 1d4 rounds. Both of these are mind-affecting\
  \ fear effects.\nIf wielded by a person who wears hamatula hide armor, the hellscourge\
  \ functions as a +1 flaming unholy whip. Such a wielder can lash the whip once per\
  \ day to hurl flames as a scorching ray (creating two rays); doing so extinguishes\
  \ the whip's flames until the next day."
