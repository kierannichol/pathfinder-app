description: "This giant-sized silver-and-steel crown allows its wearer to telepathically\
  \ control Ironcloud Keep's engine and direct the castle's motion. In addition, the\
  \ wearer of the cloud diadem can extend his perception through the castle's constructs\
  \ (such as the animated statues in area F11 and the mithral golem in area F48),\
  \ allowing him to see and hear through the statues' senses, as the witness spell\
  \ (Ultimate Magic 249), and can telepathically control the statues remotely, in\
  \ a manner similar to shield guardians (Bestiary 158). Lastly, as a full-round action,\
  \ the wearer can concentrate to teleport one of the animated statues from its teleportation\
  \ pedestal in area F11 to his side.\nMost of cloud diadem's gems are magically connected\
  \ to the controls on the stelae in Ironcloud Keep's engine room (area F12). The\
  \ ash giant alchemist Ulkraf was able to connect one of the crown's unused gems\
  \ to his alchemic bomb in the castle's propulsion ducts (area F3), creating the\
  \ dead man's switch that will detonate the bomb if Volstus is defeated.\nThe cloud\
  \ diadem is sized for a Huge wearer, and does not magically adjust to wearers of\
  \ different sizes, so the PCs will be unable to use the magical properties of the\
  \ crown, but the precious materials used to create the diadem amount to 20 pounds\
  \ of pure silver (worth 100 gp) and 150,000 gp worth of enormous gemstones."
destruction: "If Ironcloud Keep is destroyed, the cloud diadem loses all of its magic,\
  \ becoming a mundane (though still valuable) crown."
