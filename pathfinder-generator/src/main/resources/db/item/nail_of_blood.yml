description: "Inscribed along its length with wicked-looking runes, this 3-inch-long\
  \ nail is made of black metal and gives off a faint, eerie blue glow. Powered by\
  \ strange necromantic magic, the nail allows a spellcaster to cast spells within\
  \ a magic dead zone by drawing on the caster's life force to power her magic. To\
  \ be effective, the nail must be placed alongside the flesh in an empty magic item\
  \ slot (excluding eyes, head, and headband). In a process that takes 1 round, the\
  \ nail melts painlessly into the wielder's flesh before taking effect (removing\
  \ the nail is also painless and takes 1 round). Once the nail is in place, its wielder\
  \ can cast within a magic dead zone up to one spell of each spell level she knows\
  \ or has prepared and could normally cast. If she wishes to cast additional spells\
  \ in the magic dead zone, she can do so up to her normal limit, but each additional\
  \ spell she thus casts causes her to become fatigued and requires a successful concentration\
  \ check (DC = 15 + the spell's level) or the spell fizzles. If the nail of blood\
  \ would cause the wielder to be fatigued when she already has the fatigued condition,\
  \ she becomes exhausted. She can't use the nail of blood to cast additional spells\
  \ while she is exhausted, no matter what effect caused her exhausted condition."
