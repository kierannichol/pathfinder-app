description: "The matte surface of this +1 voidglass heavy shield is cold to the touch.\
  \ The shield's face contains a disorienting field of flickering stars. On command,\
  \ the wearer of this shield can take 1 point of Wisdom drain to banish a single\
  \ creature within 30 feet into the Dark Tapestry. The target of this ability must\
  \ succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be teleported into the airless void of space.\
  \ The target can attempt a new saving throw as a full-round action each round to\
  \ return. While banished in this way, the target takes 3d6 points of cold damage\
  \ per round and must hold its breath or begin to suffocate. If the Wisdom damage\
  \ is negated or does not occur, the ability does not function. If the Wisdom drain\
  \ is healed, any banished creature returns, and the shield becomes permanently nonmagical."
