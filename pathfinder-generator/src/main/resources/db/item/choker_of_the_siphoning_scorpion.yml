description: "This choker consists of a thin gold chain with a small scorpion charm\
  \ that presses snugly against the neck when worn. Once per day as an immediate action,\
  \ the wearer of this item can forgo her saving throw against a poison effect, and\
  \ instead let the scorpion charm siphon the poison, filling to its maximum capacity\
  \ of 1 dose. The wearer suffers no effects from the poison in this manner. While\
  \ filled, the charm doesn't protect against poison.\nAs a full-round action, the\
  \ wearer can remove the choker and affix it to her melee weapon by pressing the\
  \ scorpion against the weapon and allowing the chain to automatically secure itself\
  \ around the weapon's hilt or handle. If the weapon hits, the wearer can choose\
  \ to dose the target with the poison (in addition to any effects the attack would\
  \ normally have) as though the weapon were coated with a dose of the poison. This\
  \ drains the scorpion of its stored dose. The target can attempt a Fortitude save\
  \ as normal (using the poison's original DC) to resist the effect."
