description: "The eye of the overwatched is a 6-inch-wide stone ring inset with the\
  \ symbol of a partly lidded eye. The flawless marble of onyx that's set as the eye's\
  \ pupil contains glittering points of light that resemble stars.\nMade from the\
  \ exotic mineral called veinstone, the eye of the overwatched is an ancient amulet\
  \ crafted by Ralzeros the Overwatched. While he lived, Ralzeros used his observatory\
  \ to study the otherworldly forces that reside in the Dark Tapestry. In turn, those\
  \ forces watched him, and he became increasingly paranoid as a result. Just before\
  \ he disappeared following a duel with the Absalom mage Beldrin, Ralzeros constructed\
  \ this amulet in hopes that it would protect him from his perceived spellcaster\
  \ enemies.\nHe failed to create a traditional magic item, but an occultist who has\
  \ learned the abjuration implement school and uses the eye of the overwatched as\
  \ an implement can use the following focus power.\nSpellarmor (Sp): As a swift action,\
  \ you can expend 1 point of mental focus to try to shake off unwanted magical effects.\
  \ If you are under the effect of an enemy's spell or spell-like ability when you\
  \ activate this ward, you immediately receive a new saving throw with a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus. This focus power does not grant a saving throw if the original effect did\
  \ not allow one."
