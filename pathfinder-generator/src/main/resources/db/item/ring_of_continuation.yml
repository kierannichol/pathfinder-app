description: "This band of braided copper wires throbs ever so slightly in harmony\
  \ with its wearer's heartbeat. Whenever the wearer of this ring casts a spell with\
  \ a range of personal and a duration of 10 minutes per level or greater, that spell\
  \ remains in effect for 24 hours or until the wearer casts another spell with a\
  \ range of personal (whichever comes first). Spells that usually only affect one\
  \ specific action (such as making a particular attack) are expended after that action.\
  \ This does not reduce the duration of spells that normally last longer than 24\
  \ hours. Casting a new spell does not eliminate a previous spell if its normal duration\
  \ is such that it would still be in effect. However, attempts to dispel or otherwise\
  \ eliminate a spell kept active by the ring work normally and, if successful, remove\
  \ the spell from the ring, causing the wearer to lose all benefits from that spell."
