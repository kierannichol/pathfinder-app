description: "This +1 greatsword is made of blackened steel and embodies the Lambreth\
  \ ideal that all crimes must be punished twice. Once per day after the wielder slays\
  \ a creature with the Black Eagle's blade, the wielder can empower the weapon to\
  \ become a +2 bane greatsword as an immediate action; the sword's bane ability is\
  \ keyed to the same creature type as the one that the wielder killed to activate\
  \ the effect. This effect lasts for 8 rounds or until the wielder kills a second\
  \ creature with the weapon, whichever comes first."
