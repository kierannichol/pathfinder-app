description: "This wayfinder is crafted from polished gold and when viewed in bright\
  \ light is highly reflectiveâ€” resembling a mirror more than it does simple metal.\
  \ A truthseeker wayfinder allows the wielder to cast zone of truth for up to 7 minutes\
  \ per day (Will DC 14 negates). This duration doesn't need to be continuous, but\
  \ must be used in 1-minute increments. If a creature saves against this effect once,\
  \ it is immune to the effect for 24 hours. Creatures that fail their saves are granted\
  \ a new save each time the effect is activated anew. Once per day, the wielder of\
  \ a truthseeker wayfinder can gain the benefits of discern lies for up to 7 rounds\
  \ (Will DC 16 negates). When the truthseeker wayfinder senses the target creature\
  \ issue an intentional falsehood, it vibrates just enough to be perceptible to the\
  \ wielder but no one else."
