description: "This delicate circlet appears to be made of living blue-green vines\
  \ with tiny leaves. Clearly of elven manufacture, the interlocking vines occasionally\
  \ shift and grasp each other in new configurations. In the springtime the crown\
  \ sprouts crystalline flowers which eventually fall off but retain their beauty\
  \ (the elven monarch has a tradition of giving these flowers to favored citizens).\n\
  The oldest legends of Kyonin's elves seem to indicate that there was a time when\
  \ their ruler did not wear the Viridian Crown, but only a handful of fragmentary\
  \ tales survive from that prehistory. In elven memory it has always been part of\
  \ the crown jewels. The crown is a living thing that grows according to its wearer's\
  \ will. In centuries where war is the norm the crown tends to grow thorns in a helm-like\
  \ configuration, while in times of peace it prunes itself to become delicate and\
  \ artistic.\nAt will you may use detect poison, heal, light, or break enchantment\
  \ as a standard action. Once per day you may use heroes' feast and resurrection.\n\
  If you are the properly anointed ruler of the Kyonin elves, you gain a +2 enhancement\
  \ bonus to Wisdom and Charisma. You may use scrying at will on any of your subjects\
  \ (any elf who acknowledges your authority as the elven monarch). You and any subjects\
  \ within 60 feet gain the benefits of a good hope spell at all times. Three times\
  \ per day while within Kyonin you may create a guards and wards effect."
