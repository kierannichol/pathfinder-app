name: "Scroll of Clenched Fist"
description: "This spell functions like interposing hand, except that the hand can\
  \ also push or strike one opponent that you select. The floating hand can move as\
  \ far as 60 feet and can attack in the same round. Since this hand is directed by\
  \ you, its ability to notice or attack invisible or concealed creatures is no better\
  \ than yours."
