description: "You instantly wrap your body in a suit of armor made from opaque force.\
  \ At your option, the armor can be decorated with your religion's holy symbol in\
  \ a prominent place, such as upon the breastplate or helm. While it exists, this\
  \ armor replaces any garments or other sort of armor worn, magical as well as mundane.\
  \ You lose access to, and all benefits from, armor replaced by this spell until\
  \ the spell ends and the instant armor disappears."
