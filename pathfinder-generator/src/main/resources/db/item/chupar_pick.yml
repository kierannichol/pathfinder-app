description: "A curved yellow fang juts from the wooden haft of this light pick in\
  \ place of a metal tip. Though the fang seems fragile, the enchantments on the weapon\
  \ render it as hard as steel, and the fang evokes some of the powers of the beast\
  \ from which it came. A chupar pick functions as a +1 light pick of wounding. When\
  \ the chupar pick scores a critical hit, its wielder is affected by a haste effect\
  \ for 7 rounds as if targeted by a haste spell. Subsequent critical hits made while\
  \ the wielder is affected extend the duration of the haste effect but have no additional\
  \ effect."
