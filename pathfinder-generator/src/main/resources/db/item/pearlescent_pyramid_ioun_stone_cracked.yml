description: "This stone functions as normal, but the user's unarmed strikes and melee\
  \ weapons lose all enhancement bonuses and other weapon special abilities except\
  \ for the ghost touch special ability granted by this stone (although a magic weapon\
  \ that loses its enhancement bonuses still counts as a magic weapon for the purpose\
  \ of overcoming damage reduction).\nResonance: This stone grants the ghost touch\
  \ special ability to normal or masterwork light armor the user has worn for at least\
  \ 24 hours. This benefit lasts as long as the armor is in the user's possession."
