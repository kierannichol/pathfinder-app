description: "These two transparent red crystal lenses fit directly over the wearer's\
  \ eyes. On command, the wearer can speak a prayer to Asmodeus as a standard action\
  \ to be granted darkvision with a range of 60 feet; within that range, the wearer\
  \ can see in darkness of any kind, including that created by deeper darkness. While\
  \ the lenses are activated, they take on the appearance of red-hot, glowing embers,\
  \ making them extremely distinctive and foiling Disguise checks unless the wearer\
  \ is disguised as someone or something with glowing red eyes.\nThe eyes of embersight\
  \ work for a total of 9 minutes each day. These minutes need not be consecutive,\
  \ but the eyes must be used in 1-minute increments. Both lenses must be worn by\
  \ the same wearer for the magic item to take effect."
