description: "This long pen is made from a delicate feather and has a thin and unusually\
  \ long nib. The quill is typically white in color, though variations that are crimson,\
  \ onyx, or some combination of these colors also exist. A hidden compartment inside\
  \ the nib allows the quill to hold a single dose of poison that is dispensable with\
  \ a small squeeze. Additionally, this provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Sleight\
  \ of Hand checks to conceal poisons inside the quill. If this quill is used with\
  \ vector ink, it increases the DC of a poison mixed with the ink by 1. This quill\
  \ can be used as a small shiv to deal 1d3 points of damage and deliver its contained\
  \ poison. However, because of the fragility of the nib, using the quill in this\
  \ way destroys it."
