description: "The head of this +1 heavy mace is made from a single piece of roughly\
  \ spherical, polished granite. Once per day, the wielder can command the mace to\
  \ release this head, which grows to the size of a Large boulder and rolls quickly\
  \ in a direction the wielder specifies. The boulder rolls in a straight line for\
  \ up to 60 feet, crushing everything in its path for 3d8+5 points of damage (Reflex\
  \ DC 19 half). The boulder collapses into rubble and dust at the end of its path\
  \ or if it encounters an obstacle it cannot break through or roll over, creating\
  \ a 10-foot-square area of difficult terrain. A new stone mace-head grows on the\
  \ weapon's haft over the next 24 hours, and it is unusable as a weapon until the\
  \ head regrows."
