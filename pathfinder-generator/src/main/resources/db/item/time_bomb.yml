description: "A time bomb consists of an 6-inch-tall hourglass in an obsidian frame\
  \ etched with tiny runes. To activate it, the user must uncap one end and place\
  \ an amount of ground sulfur sand inside. The hourglass can hold as little as 1\
  \ minute's worth of sand to as much as 1 hour's worth. Once the sand is inside and\
  \ the time bomb is recapped, the magic is activated. If left undisturbed, after\
  \ the sand has run down, the time bomb explodes as a fireball spell dealing 5d6\
  \ points of fire damage (Reflex DC 14 half).\nIf an activated time bomb is broken,\
  \ tipped over, or otherwise disturbed before its sand drains completely and it detonates,\
  \ the magic is ruined. If it is disarmed in this manner without being damaged, the\
  \ item can thereafter function as a normal hourglass."
