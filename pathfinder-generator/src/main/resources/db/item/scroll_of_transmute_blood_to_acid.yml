name: "Scroll of Transmute Blood To Acid"
description: "You transmute blood in the target's body to acid, dealing 1d6 points\
  \ of acid damage/2 levels (maximum 12d6) each round. The creature is staggered and\
  \ sickened by the debilitating pain. A successful Fortitude save each round halves\
  \ the damage and negates the staggered condition for 1 round. If this damage reduces\
  \ the creature to 0 or fewer hit points, it dissolves, leaving only the barest trace\
  \ of remains. A dissolved creature's equipment is unaffected."
