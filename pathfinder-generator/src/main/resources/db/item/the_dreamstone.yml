description: "The dreamstone 's primary function is to surround itself with a stable\
  \ dreamscape within the Dimension of Dreams. The dreamstone 's radius is fluid and\
  \ ever-expanding when the artifact is awakened, overlaying both the Material and\
  \ Ethereal Planes, though it is held in check by any significant bodies of water,\
  \ such as rivers or seas. The nature of the dream realm changes within this radius,\
  \ creating a communally shared dreamscape that distortedly reflects the features\
  \ of the Material Plane. Its power shifts the Dimension of Dreams' properties to\
  \ alterable morphic and normal magic planar traits.\nDreamers who fall asleep within\
  \ planes affected by the dreamstone 's influence do not create their own ephemeral\
  \ demiplanes, but rather appear randomly within the dreamstone 's stabilized dreamscape.\
  \ Those who experience deadly nightmares are affected differently in the dreamstone\
  \ 's realm. Normal dreamers killed in the dreamscape wake up exhausted, while lucid\
  \ dreamers whose lucid bodies perish also die in the waking world. Lucid dreamers\
  \ can still make attempts to alter the dreamscape's reality with Charisma checks,\
  \ just as in their own personal dreamscapes, but the DC increases by 5. Spell slots\
  \ and magic item charges used by lucid dreamers in the dreamstone 's dreamscape\
  \ are also consumed in the real world. A person falling asleep in the dreamstone's\
  \ radius has a 10% chance of experiencing a lucid dream.\nThe dreamscape holds other\
  \ dangers. Regardless of the lucidity of their dreaming body, each dreamer must\
  \ make a successful saving throw each night or be set upon by the realm's dark presences,\
  \ affecting the dreamer as a nightmare spell. This effect initially requires a DC\
  \ 15 Will save, but dreamers begin with a +10 Will save modifier due to the dreamstone\
  \ 's lack of familiarity with them as a target. On each subsequent visit, the dreamstone\
  \ becomes more aware of its demiplane's visitors, and its familiarity with dreamers\
  \ grows after every 15 visits, increasing the DC by 5 (removing the +10 Will save\
  \ modifier after the first increase).\nWhen a creature dies within the stabilized\
  \ dreamscape, whether due to the perils of lucid dreaming or the dreamstone 's nightmare\
  \ effect, the dreamstone 's radius spreads 1 foot for each of that creature's Hit\
  \ Dice. Close proximity to the dreamstone is also hazardous, and the stone radiates\
  \ a vision of Hell effect (Will DC 20 negates) out to 50 feet that reflects the\
  \ terror and destruction it was destined to inflict as it fell to Golarion. Ancient\
  \ tomes such as the Paginarum Lethargica theorize that once the dreamstone 's boundaries\
  \ reach a certain threshold, it can overcome bodies of water, and all within will\
  \ be consumed in a fiery cataclysm, fulfilling the predictions of its visions. Neither\
  \ the dreaming nor the waking world will be spared."
destruction: "Should a breach the veil of dreams occult ritual be performed in the\
  \ immediate proximity of the dreamstone on the Material Plane, the meteorite falls\
  \ into an inactive slumber, or reawakens if it is already asleep. If the ritual\
  \ is performed with the dreamstone within i ts own dreamscape, the stone placed\
  \ within the ritual's open threshold, and the portal then shut, the dreamstone is\
  \ forever destroyed."
