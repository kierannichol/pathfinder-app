description: "Each carefully forged link of these masterwork manacles (with a good\
  \ lock) contains a parable or other quotes excerpted from sacred texts. Activating\
  \ the focus increases its Disable Device, Escape Artist, and break DCs by 5; its\
  \ hardness increases by 2 and its hit points by 4. This effect lasts 24 hours or\
  \ until the creature frees itself or is released."
