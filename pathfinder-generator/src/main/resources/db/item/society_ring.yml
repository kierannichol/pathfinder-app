description: "The flat bezel of this signet ring is typically set with a semiprecious\
  \ gem. If the wearer of the ring is successfully inducted into a group or organization\
  \ through an initiation ritual, the ring becomes attuned to that organization and\
  \ wearer. A suitable initiation ritual takes at least 10 minutes and at the very\
  \ least involves a pledge of allegiance to the group or organization, but it can\
  \ take a variety of forms. The crest or symbol of the organization appears engraved\
  \ on the gem, and the ring becomes invisible (as per invisibility) and hidden from\
  \ scrying effects (as per obscure object) to all except those who also wear society\
  \ rings attuned to the same organization (referred to below as \"similar rings\"\
  ). Creatures that are capable of seeing invisible objects, such as via see invisibility,\
  \ can still perceive a society ring.\nOnce attuned, the society ring's wearer can\
  \ communicate with wearers of similar rings within 150 feet (as per message). It\
  \ also grants +10 competence bonuses on Bluff checks to pass secret messages to\
  \ members of the attuned organization and Sense Motive checks to receive secret\
  \ messages from them. In addition, if the wearer touches his society ring to a similar\
  \ ring, for the following hour, the wearer can sense the direction and distance\
  \ to that ring, as well as any conditions affecting its wearer (as per status).\
  \ Only one ring at a time can be linked in this way; if the wearer touches his ring\
  \ to another similar ring within the duration of the effect, the status effect switches\
  \ to the most recently touched ring.\nIf a society ring is worn or carried by a\
  \ creature other than the attuned wearer, the ring silently alerts attuned ring\
  \ wearers from the same organization within 1 mile (as per alarm), does not display\
  \ the crest or symbol of the attuned organization, and glows with a red aura visible\
  \ only to wearers of similar rings. A new owner can end this effect by becoming\
  \ initiated into any organization, at which point the ring attunes to the new wearer\
  \ and organization."
