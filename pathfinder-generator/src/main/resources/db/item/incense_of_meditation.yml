description: "This incense comes in many shapes and colors, but is otherwise indistinguishable\
  \ from nonmagical incense until lit. When it is burned, the special fragrance and\
  \ pearly hued smoke of this special incense are recognizable by anyone making a\
  \ DC 15 Spellcraft check.\nWhen a divine spellcaster lights a block of incense of\
  \ meditation and then spends 8 hours praying and meditating nearby, the incense\
  \ enables him to prepare all his spells as though affected by the Maximize Spell\
  \ feat. However, all the spells prepared in this way are at their normal level,\
  \ not at three levels higher (as with the regular metamagic feat).\nEach block of\
  \ incense burns for 8 hours, and the effects persist for 24 hours. The incense may\
  \ be burned in a censer of controlling air elements to summon a more powerful elemental;\
  \ this renders it useless for maximizing spellcasting."
