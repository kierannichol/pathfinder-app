description: "This sentry mannequin is designed to seem more lifelike than its common\
  \ counterpart. After 5 minutes of assembly and coverage with the included loose\
  \ hood and baggy clothing, this wire frame looks like a vigilant humanoid figure.\
  \ It has pivoted joints with counterweights that move it in ways reminiscent of\
  \ an alert guard every few rounds for 8 hours after it's set up. Creatures more\
  \ than 30 feet from the mannequin must succeed at a DC 15 Perception check to realize\
  \ it's not someone standing watch."
