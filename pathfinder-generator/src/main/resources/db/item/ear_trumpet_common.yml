  \ end for anyone listening at the narrow end. The listener gains a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus on sound-based Perception checks but must use one hand to hold the trumpet\
  \ to the ear in order to gain the benefit. A masterwork ear trumpet's exquisite\
  \ acoustic properties grant the listener a +4 circumstance bonus instead."
