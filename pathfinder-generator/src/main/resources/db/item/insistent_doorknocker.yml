description: "This iron gargoyle face holds an iron ring in its mouth. Once per day,\
  \ when the flat back of the gargoyle face is placed against a wall, floor, or ceiling,\
  \ it fuses into place, creating a usable door and penetrating the space beyond up\
  \ to 1 foot as if using passwall. Speaking the command word again ends the passwall\
  \ effect, returns the surface to its previous doorless shape, and releases the doorknocker\
  \ from the surface."
