description: "This ornate +2 lance changes in color and style to match the armor of\
  \ the wielder. A bright pennon flies from the end of the lance, mounted just behind\
  \ the lance's point, and if the wielder has personal heraldry, the pennon displays\
  \ that heraldry. This pennon can serve as a cavalier's banner. The weapon counts\
  \ as alchemical silver for purposes of penetrating DR. Three times per day, when\
  \ the wielder successfully damages a target with the knight-captain's lance, as\
  \ a swift action she may grant all allies within 60 feet a +2 morale bonus on the\
  \ next attack roll they make against the same target. The bonus lasts for 1 round."
