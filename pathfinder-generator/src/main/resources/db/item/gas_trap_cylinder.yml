description: "This tarnished canister appears to be a normal gas cylinder for releasing\
  \ poisonous gases (see page 66), but it is actually a strange combination of arcane\
  \ magic and modern technology designed to trap free-roaming vaporous creatures.\
  \ A gas-trap cylinder can be armed as a standard action, and the device activates\
  \ 1 round later. Once a gas-trap cylinder is activated, it remains so for 10 minutes,\
  \ and any creature composed primarily of air, fog, mist, or other vapor (including\
  \ air elementals, hungry fogs, mihstus, trench mists, vampiric mists, and creatures\
  \ in gaseous form) within 30 feet of the cylinder must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude\
  \ save or be sucked into the device, becoming trapped within. Once trapped, a creature\
  \ is held in stasis until released. A gas-trap cylinder can hold one Gargantuan\
  \ or Huge creature, or up to two Large creatures, four Medium creatures, or eight\
  \ Small or smaller creatures.\nReleasing creatures trapped in a gas-trap cylinder\
  \ follows the same process as arming the cylinder. Arming the device requires a\
  \ standard action, and the trapped creatures are released 1 round later. A gas-trap\
  \ cylinder can also be perforated (hardness 10, hp 30) to release those trapped\
  \ within. All of the creatures trapped within the cylinder are released at one time.\
  \ Freed creatures are not under the control of the device's user and are free to\
  \ act as they wishâ€”often violently.\nA gas-trap cylinder can hold a creature or\
  \ creatures indefinitely, but once the trapped creatures are released, the cylinder\
  \ becomes nonmagical."
