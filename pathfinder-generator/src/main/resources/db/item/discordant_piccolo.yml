description: "This bright silver piccolo has an uncanny connection to the alien Dark\
  \ Tapestry and produces only disjointed notes when played, no matter how talented\
  \ the user. In fact, talented performers produce more dissonant notes. If the user\
  \ succeeds at a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check while playing the discordant\
  \ piccolo, one target creature within 30 feet is sickened for 1 round (Will DC 14\
  \ negates). If the user succeeds at a DC 25 Perform check, the target is instead\
  \ nauseated for 1 round (Will DC 16 reduces the effect to sickened). A creature\
  \ that successfully saves cannot be affected by the discordant piccolo for 24 hours.\
  \ This is a mind-affecting effect."
