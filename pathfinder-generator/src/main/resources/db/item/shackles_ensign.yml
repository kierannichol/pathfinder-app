description: "This red-and-black naval ensign displays the grinning skull and crossed\
  \ manacles of the Shackles. While the flag feels as sleek as silk, the material\
  \ is stronger than the toughest sail canvas. Openly flying a Shackles ensign improves\
  \ the initial attitude of most hostile or unfriendly pirates by one step, and worsens\
  \ the starting attitude of those opposed to piracy by one step. The ensign has no\
  \ effect when not properly mounted on a ship.\nOnce per day, a Shackles ensign can\
  \ be hoisted and unfurled on a ship to impose a sinister sense of doom upon an opposing\
  \ ship's crew. It takes two full-round actions to raise the flag. All non-pirate\
  \ creatures (defined at the GM's discretion) within 300 feet who are able to see\
  \ the flag take a â€“1 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws,\
  \ and skill checks for 1 minute. This is a visual mindaffecting effect. In addition,\
  \ all allied creatures aboard the ship flying the Shackles ensign gain a +1 luck\
  \ bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for\
  \ 1 minute."
