description: "One end of this short length of petrified wood burns with a flame of\
  \ ever-changing hue, a tiny portion of the fires of the Founder's Flame (Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting: Magnimar, City of Monuments 32). It provides light as per a\
  \ normal torch but is not consumed, and its fire cannot be extinguished by mundane\
  \ means (though total immersion temporarily quenches the flame). The torch can be\
  \ wielded as an improvised light mace that deals an additional 1d2 points of fire\
  \ damage; in addition, a creature damaged by the torch's fire takes a â€“1 penalty\
  \ on saving throws for 1 round against effects that deal fire damage."
