name: "Scroll of Phase Door"
description: "This spell creates an ethereal passage through wooden, plaster, or stone\
  \ walls, but not other materials. The phase door is invisible and inaccessible to\
  \ all creatures except you, and only you can use the passage. You disappear when\
  \ you enter the phase door and appear when you exit. If you desire, you can take\
  \ one other creature (Medium or smaller) through the door. This counts as two uses\
  \ of the door. The door does not allow light, sound, or spell effects through it,\
  \ nor can you see through it without using it. Thus, the spell can provide an escape\
  \ route, though certain creatures, such as phase spiders, can follow with ease.\
  \ A gem of true seeing or similar magic reveals the presence of a phase door but\
  \ does not allow its use."
