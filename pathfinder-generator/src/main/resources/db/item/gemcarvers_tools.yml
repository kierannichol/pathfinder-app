description: "These thin, elegant adamantine tools are inscribed with numerous runes\
  \ in the four elemental languages (Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran). These tools\
  \ grant a user the skill to imbue gems with elemental power during the cutting process.\
  \ In addition, they act as masterwork artisan's tools for the Craft (jewelry) skill.\n\
  The user of these tools can attempt to craft elemental gems (Pathfinder RPG Core\
  \ Rulebook 511). Creating an elemental gem requires 8 total hours of work and an\
  \ uncut gem worth 1,000 gp. The user must succeed at a DC 21 Craft (jewelry) check\
  \ or the process fails and the raw materials are ruined. The user must speak the\
  \ appropriate elemental language to use the elementalist's tools to craft an elemental\
  \ gem of a specific element. Although the user doesn't need to meet any of the prerequisites\
  \ for crafting elemental gems, this process otherwise follows the normal rules for\
  \ magic item creation."
