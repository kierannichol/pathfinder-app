name: "Potion of Symbol of Mirroring"
description: "This spell functions as symbol of death, except it instead creates one\
  \ illusory duplicate of each creature within 60 feet of the symbol. These duplicates\
  \ function as mirror image, moving with the original creatures and mimicking their\
  \ movements, sounds, and actions exactly. If an illusory double is destroyed, a\
  \ new one appears on the creature's turn. The images last for as long as a creature\
  \ remains within 60 feet of the symbol, and for 1 round/level thereafter. Once triggered,\
  \ the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per caster level."
