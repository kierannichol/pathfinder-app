description: "This bandolier is made of finely tanned leather. It has slots for up\
  \ to 200 rounds of ammunition. Pellets and black powder are kept in tiny individual\
  \ pouches, and bullets in small loops. The bandolier alters itself as needed to\
  \ accommodate both. There are also places on the beneficial bandolier for a gunsmith's\
  \ kit and a powder horn. Regardless of what quantities of these items are placed\
  \ within the beneficial bandolier, its weight does not change.\nAs a swift action,\
  \ the wearer can command a single round of ammunition from the beneficial bandolier\
  \ to teleport into a firearm of the appropriate type that he is wielding."
