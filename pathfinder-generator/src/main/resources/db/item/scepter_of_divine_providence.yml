description: "This iron rod is crowned with a metallic sphere and functions as a +1\
  \ heavy mace. In the hands of a divine spellcaster, the rod also counts as a holy\
  \ or unholy symbol and divine focus. If the wielder of a scepter of divine providence\
  \ has the channel energy class feature, she can increase the radius of her channeled\
  \ energy burst by 10 feet, at the cost of one additional use of her channel energy\
  \ ability. The wielder can expend additional uses of her channel energy ability\
  \ to further expand the burst radius, to a maximum of 30 additional feet."
