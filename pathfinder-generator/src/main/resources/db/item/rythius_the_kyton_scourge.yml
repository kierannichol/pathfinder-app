description: "Once possessed by a brijidine azata dedicated to ending the depredations\
  \ of kytons, this potent magic weapon now holds a portion of her essence. This +1\
  \ shock whip is woven from green leather and crackles with electricity, seemingly\
  \ writhing of its own volition. Three times per day, when the wielder uses Rythius\
  \ to successfully trip a creature, the target of the trip attack is subject to a\
  \ dimensional anchor effect. The wielder can choose to suppress this ability as\
  \ a swift action.\nFurthermore, in the hands of a wielder with a good alignment,\
  \ the weapon becomes a +1 kyton bane shock whip. Rythius is infused with good, and\
  \ as a result it bestows 1 negative level on any nongood creature wielding it. This\
  \ negative level persists as long as the weapon is wielded and disappears when the\
  \ item is put away. The negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including\
  \ by means of restoration spells) while it is wielded."
