description: "This crossbow-style device is modified to throw splash weapons or contact\
  \ poisons rather than firing bolts. Its trigger connects to a long spool of wire,\
  \ which can be strung across one or two 5-foot squares within 10 feet. Once set,\
  \ the flask launcher can be loaded with a thrown splash weapon or vial of contact\
  \ poison (which must be purchased separately). The flask launcher fires automatically\
  \ at the first Tiny or larger creature that disturbs its tripwire. Alchemist bombs\
  \ cannot be fired by a flask launcher.\nThe flask launcher isn't designed to be\
  \ used as a ranged weapon; treat it as an improvised weapon with a 10-foot range\
  \ increment. Reloading the launcher is a full-round action that requires two hands\
  \ and provokes an attack of opportunity.\nThis can be crafted with a DC 25 Craft\
  \ (traps) check."
