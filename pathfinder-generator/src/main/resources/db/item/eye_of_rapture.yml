description: "The Eye of Rapture, once triggered, shrouds an area as large as one\
  \ square mile in a powerful meld of enchantment and illusion magic. Those within\
  \ range see only what they want to see and are filled with euphoric glee. They ignore\
  \ anything that happens that does not mesh with their preconceptions. The effect\
  \ lasts for 2d4 hours, and the wielder may alter the illusions witnessed at any\
  \ time. When the duration expires, the eye crumbles to crystalline dust and loses\
  \ all magical properties. A DC 25 Will save is necessary to avoid falling under\
  \ the eye's spell. The eye requires a powerful evil fey custodian to work its magic,\
  \ as it draws on this fey's darkest thoughts and hate. If the custodian is slain,\
  \ the eye fractures and crumbles to dust."
