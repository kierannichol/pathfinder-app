name: "Scroll of Eruptive Pustules"
description: "Your skin erupts in swollen, pus-filled bumps that burst open if you\
  \ are struck. Any creature that strikes you with its body or a handheld weapon deals\
  \ normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of acid damage\
  \ and must save or be sickened for 1 round. If the attack against you is a critical\
  \ hit, the attacker must save or be nauseated instead of sickened. This damage can\
  \ harm a swarm."
