description: "Heavy golden coils form this serpentine armband. It wraps snugly around\
  \ the upper arm of its wearer and stays firmly in place once donned.\nAn armband\
  \ of the golden serpent allows its wearer to cast spells with the range of touch\
  \ in melee combat without provoking attacks of opportunity. Spells with ranges other\
  \ than touch provoke attacks of opportunity as normalâ€”even spells with a range of\
  \ personal. When the wearer of an armband of the golden serpent casts a touch spell\
  \ in melee combat, the armband animates, slithering down the wearer's arm and striking\
  \ to deliver the touch attack. Although the armband delivers the spell, the wearer\
  \ is still required to take the necessary actions and make the required attack roll;\
  \ the wearer does not gain any additional actions."
