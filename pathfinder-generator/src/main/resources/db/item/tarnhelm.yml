description: "This mithral cap includes prominent guards for the eyes and nose. The\
  \ helmet was forged under duress by a dwarven smith to further the ambitions of\
  \ his mad brother. The Tarnhelm has the following powers."
destruction: "The Tarnhelm can be destroyed by being struck by a succession by hammer\
  \ blows from a dwarven smith wielding an adamantine hammer, a human smith with a\
  \ steel hammer, and an elven smith using a hammer of spun glass. Each must succeed\
  \ at a DC 30 Craft (armor) check when landing the blow. Failure destroys the hammer,\
  \ disrupts the attempt to destroy the Tarnhelm, and deals 12d6 points of damage\
  \ to the smith."
