description: "By boiling certain seeds with handfuls of rust, halfling alchemists\
  \ create these red flakes, which smolder slowly when touched by a spark or flame.\
  \ If sprinkled over food and lit, a handful of cooking powder can cook meat or vegetables\
  \ in 20 minutes without light or significant heat, though it lends a metallic flavor\
  \ to any foods. If held to a living creature's flesh, smoldering cooking powder\
  \ deals 1 point of fire damage per minute for 20 minutes. One jar of cooking powder\
  \ is enough to cook up to 5 pounds of food in 1-pound increments. Crafting a jar\
  \ of cooking powder requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check."
