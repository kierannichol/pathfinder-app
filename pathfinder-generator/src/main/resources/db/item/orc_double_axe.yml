description: "A cruel weapon with blades placed at opposite ends of a long haft, an\
  \ orc double axe is a double weapon. Though invented by and traditionally associated\
  \ with orcs, the double axe can be crafted and wielded by other races as well, though\
  \ many disdain it for its extreme weight and clumsiness. Because of the blades at\
  \ either end of the axe, the wielder must hold an orc double axe in the middle of\
  \ its haft, and utilize a weaving, slashing fighting style more akin to that of\
  \ a quarterstaff than to that of a greataxe or battleaxe."
