name: "Oil of Mirror Strike"
description: "You briefly alter the flow of time to split a melee attack into two\
  \ attacks. Before the end of your next turn, when you make your next melee attack\
  \ roll, compare the result to the AC of two opponents within your reach. If the\
  \ selected opponents are flanking you, you gain a +2 bonus on your attack roll (and\
  \ confirmation attack roll, see below). If you hit both enemies, you can deal half\
  \ damage to each. Hitting only one opponent allows you to deal that opponent normal\
  \ damage for your attack. On a critical threat, you can make only one attack roll\
  \ to confirm the critical hit against both opponents. If you confirm against both,\
  \ you deal half your critical hit damage to each. Your hit is a normal hit rather\
  \ than a critical if you confirm against only one opponent. If you fail to use the\
  \ effect before the end of your next turn, the spell ends."
