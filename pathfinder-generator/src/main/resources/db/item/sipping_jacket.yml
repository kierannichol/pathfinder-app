description: "Absorbent fibers line this heavy canvas coat. Once per day as a standard\
  \ action, the wearer can pour a potion onto this lining, suffusing it into the coat.\
  \ If the potion has an instantaneous duration, the wearer can activate the coat\
  \ as a swift action to consume the potion. If the potion's duration is measured\
  \ in rounds, the wearer can activate the coat as a swift action to gain the potion's\
  \ benefits for 1 round, repeating as desired each round until the potion's entire\
  \ duration has been used. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. The coat absorbs\
  \ only potions with instantaneous or round-based durations, and only those which\
  \ affect creatures (for example, it does not work on oils). Once the coat absorbs\
  \ a potion, the potion cannot be retrieved from it, only used as described above.\
  \ The absorbed potion loses its powers after 24 hours, even if unused."
