description: "Poison lip paint is a favorite among courtiers who practice the arts\
  \ of deception and intrigue. It allows the wearer to deliver a dose of contact or\
  \ ingested poison by means of a kiss. This kiss can be to the hand, cheek, or other\
  \ exposed skin to deliver a contact poison, but must be on the mouth for an ingested\
  \ poison. A kiss delivers the full dose of the poison, and that application of poison\
  \ lip paint then becomes nonpoisonous. To use poison lip paint without being exposed\
  \ to the poison, the wearer must first apply a protective layer of base material.\
  \ When using an ingested poison, the wearer can instead consume an antidote prior\
  \ to application. (When the user applies a contact poison, preemptively consuming\
  \ an antidote results in the wearer's skin harmlessly absorbing the poison, as does\
  \ immunity to poison.) A kit contains enough base material and lip paint for 10\
  \ doses. The poisons must be purchased separately and mixed into the lip paint."
