description: "Heavy blades typically used by guardians of religious sites, temple\
  \ swords have distinctive crescentshaped blades, which appear to be an amalgam of\
  \ sickle and sword. Many have holes drilled into the blade or the pommel so that\
  \ charms, bells, or other holy trinkets can be attached to reflect the owner's devotion\
  \ or to serve as foci for prayer or meditation. Monks are proficient with the temple\
  \ sword."
