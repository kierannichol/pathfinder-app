description: "This enchanted apple appears to be made of solid gold. When dropped\
  \ or thrown, it draws the attention of the nearest hostile creature within 20 feet.\
  \ The creature must make a DC 13 Will save or be paralyzed as if by hold person\
  \ as it focuses its undivided attention on the golden apple. If the creature makes\
  \ its save on a later round, it realizes it has been affected by magic and the apple\
  \ is not actually gold. While focusing on the apple, the target takes a â€“2 penalty\
  \ on Perception checks. The apple is consumed upon being dropped or thrown."
