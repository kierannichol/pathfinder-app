description: "This disk of paper or light cloth is stretched over a frame of thin\
  \ wooden supports, with tubes of paper or cured hide spaced evenly around the rim.\
  \ The whole firework is mounted on a spike or peg and placed on the ground. At the\
  \ end of the round when it's lit, it spins rapidly and sheds a curtain of dazzling\
  \ sparks 15 feet wide. The curtain of sparks obscures vision, granting concealment\
  \ against creatures on the opposite side. A sparking pinwheel burns for 1d4+1 rounds,\
  \ and any creature that begins its turn adjacent to the curtain of sparks takes\
  \ 1 point of fire damage and is dazzled for 1d4 rounds (Reflex DC 14 negates). Creatures\
  \ that pass through the curtain of sparks take 1d4 points of fire damage and are\
  \ blinded for 1 round (a successful save halves the damage and negates the blindness).\
  \ If not mounted on a solid, immobile object, a sparking pinwheel cannot spin smoothly\
  \ and instead fills a single 5-foot square with a shower of sparks; its effects\
  \ are otherwise unchanged for creatures adjacent to or passing through that square."
