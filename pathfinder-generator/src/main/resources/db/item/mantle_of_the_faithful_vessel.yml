description: "This simple robe automatically shifts color and style to match the signature\
  \ colors, fabrics, and symbols of the wearer's faith (if any) when she dons it.\n\
  When the wearer channels energy, any creatures healed by the energy gain the benefits\
  \ of bless for 1 minute, and any creatures harmed by the energy are subjected to\
  \ bane (Will DC 11 negates) for 1 minute. The wearer adds her mythic tier to the\
  \ damage dealt or healed when she channels energy."
