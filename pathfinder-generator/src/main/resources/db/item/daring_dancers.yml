description: "These glittering anklets or spurs are favorites of Varisians, both for\
  \ their showy addition to performances and their more practical uses. Normally made\
  \ of metal and leather and adorned with glass beads or small gemstones, they make\
  \ the wearer's feet light and agile, granting a +5 competence bonus to Perform (dance)\
  \ checks. The wearer's footfalls become so light that she can dance gracefully on\
  \ any surface and make a 5-foot step even in difficult terrain.\nIf the wearer has\
  \ 5 or more ranks in Perform (dance), daring dancers allow her to cast dimension\
  \ door on herself once per day to travel up to 700 feet."
