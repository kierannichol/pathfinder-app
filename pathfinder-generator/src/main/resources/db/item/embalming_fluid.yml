description: "This fluid is used to preserve corpses, whether for later dissection,\
  \ taxidermy, necromancy, or magic such as raise dead. Embalming fluid is technically\
  \ a poison, and using it makes a corpse unpalatable to most animals and vermin,\
  \ though corpse-eating undead don't mind the taste. Treating a corpse with embalming\
  \ fluid takes 1 hour and a successful DC 25 Heal check. The embalmed corpse decays\
  \ at half the normal rate (each day dead counts as half a day for the purpose of\
  \ raise dead)."
