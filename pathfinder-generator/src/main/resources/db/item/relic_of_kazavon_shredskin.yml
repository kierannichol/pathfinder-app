description: "Kazavon's shattered ribs were twisted into a mantle of bone fragments\
  \ known as the Shredskin. The mantle grants its wearer a +6 enhancement bonus to\
  \ Wisdom, a +5 resistance bonus on all saving throws, and the ability to hide in\
  \ plain sight as per the shadowdancer class feature. The wearer can speak with any\
  \ shadow, in a way similar to the effects of the spell stone tell. Shadows willingly\
  \ tell the wearer what dangers they obscure and what creatures have come in contact\
  \ with them in the past 24 hours. The shadows can only relate information about\
  \ creatures they've enshrouded. Creatures bearing a light source are not usually\
  \ touched by shadows, though shadows can tell when they've been disrupted by passing\
  \ light."
destruction: "The Shredskin must be taken to the Positive Energy Plane or Sarenrae's\
  \ domain on Nirvana and exposed to direct light for 1 month."
