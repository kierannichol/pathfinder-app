description: "This 1-inch red marble statue depicts a tiny praying mantis. When the\
  \ command word is uttered, the mantis comes to life and moves as its owner instructs,\
  \ as per a sensor eye from a prying eyes spell. The mantis remains animated for\
  \ up to 9 hours or until it returns to the bearer and replays what it saw, at which\
  \ point it reverts to statue form for 1 day. If the mantis is destroyed while animate,\
  \ it reverts to statue form."
