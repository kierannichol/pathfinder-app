description: "This jade ring is carved in the shape of an ouroboros. Three times per\
  \ day, the wearer can use it to empower a spell she casts. This grants her a +2\
  \ bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance, and increases the save\
  \ DC of the spell (if any) by 2.\nWhile enhancing a spell this way, the caster can\
  \ expend one use of mythic power plus an additional use per two spell levels (minimum\
  \ two uses), to instead cast the mythic version of her spell (though not an augmented\
  \ version of the mythic spell) as if she knew the mythic version of that spell.\
  \ This has no effect if the spell doesn't have a mythic version. The save DC increase\
  \ for being a potent mythic spell (see page 80) stacks with the save DC increase\
  \ granted by using the ring's power.\nFor example, if the wearer enhances fireball\
  \ with this ring, she can expend two uses of mythic power to cast mythic fireball\
  \ instead (one use plus one use for a 3rd-level spell)."
