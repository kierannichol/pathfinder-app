description: "You create a powerful bond between yourself and a single creature. Until\
  \ the end of the spell's duration, each time the target is hit with an attack or\
  \ fails a saving throw, you can take the full damage of that attack and any other\
  \ effects that creature suffers. If you choose not to take on the damage and effects,\
  \ you instead take a number of points of damage equal to your Constitution score\
  \ as backlash. Any resistances or immunities you have are applied normally, but\
  \ you cannot otherwise reduce or negate the damage or effects of either the transfer\
  \ or the backlash. If you or the subject of the spell move out of line of sight,\
  \ the spell ends."
