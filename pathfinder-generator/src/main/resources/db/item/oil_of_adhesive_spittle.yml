name: "Oil of Adhesive Spittle"
description: "Once during this spell's duration, you can spit a viscous liquid as\
  \ a standard action. This liquid functions as a tanglefoot bag, except you do not\
  \ have to make a successful attack roll to hit your target. The DCs to counteract\
  \ this adhesive (to avoid being stuck to the floor, to fly, to break the adhesive,\
  \ or to cast a spell) use the spell's DC rather than a tanglefoot bag's normal DCs.\
  \ The adhesive persists for 2d4 rounds after you spit it."
