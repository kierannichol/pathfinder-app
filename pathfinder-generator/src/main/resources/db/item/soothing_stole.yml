description: "Snowborn frequently fight off hostile enemies of both the intelligent\
  \ and animalistic varieties. The smart half-elf knows that he can't lose a fight\
  \ that never begins and makes every attempt to stave off combat. This white fur\
  \ stole helps the wary snowborn, or anyone else, temporarily calm down opponents.\
  \ While wearing this stole, the wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on Diplomacy\
  \ checks to improve someone's attitude and on wild empathy checks to improve an\
  \ animal's attitude. Three times per day on command, the wearer can activate the\
  \ stole to gain a 20-foot radius aura of either calm animals or calm emotions for\
  \ 1 minute (Will DC 13 negates). The stole also functions as cold weather clothing."
