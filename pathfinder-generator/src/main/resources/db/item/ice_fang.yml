description: "This +2 frost short sword has a blade made of sparkling blue ice. Anyone\
  \ wielding an ice fang is protected from cold weather as if they were affected by\
  \ endure elements. As a move action, the wielder may cause the blade to either grow\
  \ to the size of a longsword, melt away to the size of a dagger, or return to its\
  \ original size. An ice fang left unattended automatically reverts to its original\
  \ size in 1 minute. An ice fang functions as a dagger, short sword, or longsword\
  \ depending on the current size of its blade.\nOnce per day upon confirming a critical\
  \ hit, the wielder may choose to have the blade shatter and send razor-sharp shards\
  \ of ice flying in a 15-foot cone. The original target of the attack must be within\
  \ this cone's area of effect. Roll the damage for the critical hit normally and\
  \ apply to the original target. All other creatures in the cone take damage equal\
  \ to the amount of the critical hit; one half of this damage is piercing, the other\
  \ half is cold damage. A successful DC 16 Reflex saving throw reduces the damage\
  \ by half. After using this ability, the wielder must spend a standard action to\
  \ reform the blade of the ice fang, at any size, before it can be used as a weapon\
  \ again."
