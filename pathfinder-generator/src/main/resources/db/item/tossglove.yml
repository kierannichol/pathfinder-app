description: "A tossglove is a hefty leather and metal glove made for holding and\
  \ throwing an insect, snake, or other tiny creature that would otherwise bite the\
  \ goblin. Those who don't use a tossglove when attempting to sling such creatures\
  \ provoke an attack of opportunity from the animal they attempt to throw or stash.\
  \ The glove has overlapping plates that cover the goblin's arm up to the elbow.\
  \ It's a full-round action to put on or take off a tossglove, and while it's worn,\
  \ that hand can't be used to perform acts of fine manipulation (such as making a\
  \ Disable Device check or firing an arrow). The gloved hand can still wield a melee\
  \ weapon."
