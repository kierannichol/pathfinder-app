description: "The forms of numerous animals, magical beast, and other famous creatures\
  \ appear in relief on every inch of this iron wayfinder's surface, creating a maze\
  \ of lions, hawks, dragons, and elephants. Though a headhunter wayfinder looks like\
  \ a normal compass, it doesn't point toward true north as one would expect. Rather,\
  \ if a piece of hair, a drop of blood, or some other organic matter from a individual\
  \ creature is placed in the socket normally reserved for an ioun stone, the wayfinder's\
  \ needle points out this creature as though it were the subject of a locate creature\
  \ spell with a radius of 680 feet from the wayfinder's wielder. This effect has\
  \ no set duration, and functions as long as a specimen of the target creature is\
  \ held within the wayfinder and the creature is within range. If the target creature\
  \ isn't in range, the headhunter wayfinder's needle slowly spins clockwise. As with\
  \ the locate creature spell, running water and spells such as mislead, nondetection,\
  \ and polymorph fool or otherwise block the effect. A headhunter wayfinder can't\
  \ hold an ioun stone and doesn't provide resonant powers."
