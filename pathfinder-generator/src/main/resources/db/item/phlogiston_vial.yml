description: "This 1-inch-long, clear glass vial is filled with a dark, amber-colored\
  \ fluid that resembles the twisting, flickering form of a fire elemental. The vial\
  \ is sealed with a brass cap and attached to a lightweight gold chain. When the\
  \ chain is wrapped around a divine caster's holy symbol, the saving throw DC of\
  \ the next banishment or dismissal spell he casts on an outsider with the fire subtype\
  \ is increased by 4, and additionally, the caster gains a +2 alchemical bonus on\
  \ the caster level check to overcome the creature's spell resistance against the\
  \ spell. If the spell is successful, the outsider leaves behind a small pile of\
  \ magical ashes and the phlogiston vial cannot be used to banish outsiders again\
  \ until the oil inside is replaced as a standard action (see below).\nIf the ashes\
  \ are collected and placed inside the vial, and the vial is used as an additional\
  \ material component for a planar ally spell, the spell conjures the exact same\
  \ outsider, provided the creature is a viable target of that spell. The owner of\
  \ the vial receives a +4 bonus on her Charisma check to negotiate with the creature.\
  \ The ashes are consumed after an agreement with the creature is made.\nA phlogiston\
  \ vial is a single-use item that can be recharged with a rare alchemical agent called\
  \ phlogiston oil, which can only be found on the Plane of Fire and costs 2,000 gp\
  \ when sold on the open market. The listed price is for a phlogiston vial full of\
  \ phlogiston oil."
