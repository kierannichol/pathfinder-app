description: "Made from elaborately carved wood in the shape of a mythical creature,\
  \ this mask covers the face of its wearer, leaving only two holes for eyes. A mesmerist\
  \ wearing this mask increases the range of his hypnotic stare ability by 10 feet\
  \ as the mask allows him to better focus on his targets. Creatures under the effects\
  \ of the wearer's hypnotic stare take a â€“2 penalty on all attack rolls against the\
  \ wearer.\nOnce per day, if the wearer possesses the mesmerist trick class feature,\
  \ he can implant a trick without expending a use of his mesmerist trick ability.\
  \ This trick also does not count against his limit of total tricks active at the\
  \ same time."
