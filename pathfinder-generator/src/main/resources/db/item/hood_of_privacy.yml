description: "This voluminous silver hood shimmers like a scattered handful of diamonds.\
  \ The hood completely covers the wearer's face, hiding his identity, but does not\
  \ impair the wearer's senses. The wearer gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against\
  \ mind-affecting effects. The wearer is immediately aware when someone attempts\
  \ to gain information about him through a divination spell or effect, such as scrying.\
  \ As a swift action, the wearer can reduce the hood's saving throw bonus by 1 to\
  \ thwart such a divination attempt, providing whatever false information the wearer\
  \ desires to the diviner, or even to conceal the information entirely as though\
  \ the wearer were undetectable to the divination effect. The creature using the\
  \ divination effect can attempt a DC 26 Will save to learn that the information\
  \ is fabricated or concealed. Expended bonuses return at a rate of 1 per week."
