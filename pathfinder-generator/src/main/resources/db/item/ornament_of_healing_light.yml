description: "This palm-sized holy symbol is composed of tiny pieces of stained glass\
  \ held in a gold frame. The exact symbol is determined upon the item's creation.\
  \ As a free action, the creature holding the ornament can project the image of the\
  \ holy symbol upon any creature or surface within 15 feet, similar to using a shadow\
  \ puppet and lamp. This light is not bright enough to illuminate an area. If the\
  \ bearer is a paladin, she may use her lay on hands ability on a creature touched\
  \ by the symbol's light (effectively increasing her lay on hands range from touch\
  \ to 15 feet)."
