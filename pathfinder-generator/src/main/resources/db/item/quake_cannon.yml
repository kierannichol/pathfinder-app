description: "The cannon consists of a pivoting chair designed for a Medium creature\
  \ mounted atop a tripod that splays 10 feet in diameter. Attached to the front of\
  \ the chair is a 12-foot-long, hollow mithral cylinder wound with a fine braid of\
  \ incredibly thin copper wire and set at a variable angle to allow it to be aimed\
  \ like a siege weapon. At the cylinder's end is a small clamp designed to hold a\
  \ large crystal through which the cannon's beam travels, acting as a focal lens.\n\
  Once per week, the quake cannon can be activated to create an earthquake effect\
  \ (as the spell) centered on any point within 50 miles. Activating the cannon takes\
  \ 10 minutes, and a diamond worth at least 10,000 gp must be used as the device's\
  \ focal lens. This diamond is expended in the process of firing the weapon.\nIf\
  \ an eidite gem worth at least 5,000 gp is instead used as a focal lens, the quake\
  \ cannon does not create an earthquake at the targeted location, but instead fires\
  \ an ultrasonic pulse that affects only clockworks within the same area of effect\
  \ as the cannon's normal earthquake effect. Any constructs with the clockwork subtype\
  \ in the affected area must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be overwhelmed with\
  \ electromagnetic impulses and ultrasonic disruptions. Clockwork creatures that\
  \ fail their saving throws against this effect become confused for 1 minute. During\
  \ this time and for 24 hours afterward, affected creatures are compelled to move\
  \ toward the quake cannon as fast as they can. This is a sonic effect."
destruction: "The crystallized heart of a shaitan that has never left the Elemental\
  \ Plane of Earth must be used as a focal lens. Doing so centers the device's earthquake\
  \ effect on the quake cannon itself and destroys the device, but not before it activates\
  \ one last time."
