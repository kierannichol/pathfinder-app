description: "Iomedae often grants the use of the Stole of the Inheritor to her champions\
  \ in times of great need. When draped across the shoulders, the stole grants DR\
  \ 5/good, and it grants the use of heal as a quickened spell-like ability once per\
  \ day. Once per day, a good-aligned wearer of the Stole of the Inheritor can cast\
  \ holy word. In addition, as long as it is worn, the user can use detect evil and\
  \ detect chaos at all times. A divine spellcaster who worships Iomedae gains a +2\
  \ sacred bonus on all saving throws while wearing the stole. The stole's greatest\
  \ power, though, is allowing its wearer to use plane shift on himself and any allies\
  \ within 120 feet as an immediate action; the stole immediately returns to Iomedae's\
  \ shoulders when this effect is used."
destruction: "A demon lord must adorn itself with the stole and use its plane shift\
  \ power to travel to Iomedae's court, whereupon anyone who pulls the stole from\
  \ the Inheritor's shoulders can tear it apart while the demon lord remains alive\
  \ and in Iomedae's presence."
