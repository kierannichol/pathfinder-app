description: "This thick book contains tips for improving instinct and perception,\
  \ but entwined within the words is a powerful magical effect. If anyone reads this\
  \ book, which takes a total of 48 hours over a minimum of 6 days, she gains an inherent\
  \ bonus from +1 to +5 (depending on the type of tome) to her Wisdom score. Once\
  \ the book is read, the magic disappears from the pages and it becomes a normal\
  \ book."
