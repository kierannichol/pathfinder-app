description: "This bronze skinning knife bears the symbol of Old Deadeye on its blade.\
  \ Designed as a hunting tool, it cannot be used as an effective weapon. As long\
  \ as the bearer carries the knife, he can find enough food and water in the wilderness\
  \ to satisfy one creature's hunger and thirst (either the bearer himself or someone\
  \ traveling with him). In addition, the bearer gains a +1 resistance bonus on Fortitude\
  \ saving throws.\nIf Erastil is the bearer's patron, once per day the bearer can\
  \ speak a command word to use true strike. Once per day the bearer can speak a command\
  \ word to give a touched thrown weapon, arrow, or bolt the returning weapon special\
  \ ability for 1 minute. A magic arrow or bolt that returns does not keep its magical\
  \ properties but is still usable as masterwork ammunition."
