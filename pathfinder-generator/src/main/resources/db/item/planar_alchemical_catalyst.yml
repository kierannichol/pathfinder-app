description: "This vibrant, variegated gemstone is found naturally on the Elemental\
  \ Plane of Earth but can also be artificially reproduced, albeit with a fair amount\
  \ of difficulty. The catalyst is highly sought for its remarkable ability to enhance\
  \ and alter alchemical tools and weapons.\nAs a move action, you can apply the catalyst\
  \ to one of the following items to enhance or alter the alchemical item's effects\
  \ (items marked with an asterisk [\"*\"] are detailed in Pathfinder RPG Ultimate\
  \ Equipment). If the item is not used within 3 rounds, the benefit of the enhanced\
  \ alchemical item is lost and the item reverts to normal. Once applied to an item,\
  \ a planar alchemical catalyst is expended.\nAlchemist's Fire: The type of energy\
  \ damage changes to acid, cold, or electricity (user's choice).\nFlash Powder *:\
  \ The DC of the Fortitude save increases to 15, and targets are dazzled for 1d4+1\
  \ rounds whether or not they succeed at their saving throw.\nHoly Water: The splash\
  \ area becomes difficult terrain for undead and evil outsiders, and undead or evil\
  \ outsiders that end their turn in the affected area take 2 points of damage. Both\
  \ of these effects last 3 rounds.\nImpact Foam *: The foam does not dissolve when\
  \ exposed to acid or water, and instead becomes a pliable-yet-rigid platform that\
  \ can be dragged onto water and used as a makeshift raft for up to 5 Medium creatures.\
  \ The 10-minute duration still applies.\nLiquid Blade *: The blade deals 2 points\
  \ of bleed damage on a hit (this does not stack with bleed damage from other sources).\n\
  Liquid Ice *: In addition to its normal effects, the liquid ice acts as a smokestick,\
  \ except it emits dense white fog rather than smoke.\nShard Gel *: The shard gel\
  \ remains embedded in the target on a direct hit, continuing to deal 1d3 points\
  \ of damage each round after until the gel dissolves (5 rounds) or the target takes\
  \ a full round action to remove it.\nTanglefoot Bag: The DC of the Reflex saving\
  \ throw increases to 17, the penalty on attack rolls is â€“3, and the tanglefoot bag\
  \ can affect targets up to size category Huge.\nThunderstone: In addition to being\
  \ deafened, targets that fail their Fortitude saves are staggered for 1 round. Affected\
  \ targets are deafened for 1d4 rounds whether or not they succeed at their saving\
  \ throw."
