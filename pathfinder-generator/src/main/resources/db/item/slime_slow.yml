description: "Dark blue crystals are suspended at various points in this chunky mixture\
  \ of icy liquid. When the liquid inside is exposed to open air, a vial of slow slime\
  \ has a unique congealing effect on amorphous bodies. The wielder can throw a vial\
  \ of slime slow as a splash weapon. If a creature with the amorphous special quality\
  \ suffers a direct hit, that creature must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or\
  \ lose the benefits of being amorphous for 1d4 rounds. Amorphous creatures indirectly\
  \ hit by slime slow must attempt the same Fortitude save, but only risk losing the\
  \ benefits of being amorphous for 1 round. Crafting a vial of slime slow requires\
  \ a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
