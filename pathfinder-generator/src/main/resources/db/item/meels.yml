description: "Also called Vudrani clubs, meels are heavily weighted clubs used to\
  \ train one's strength. They range in size from only a few pounds to specially crafted\
  \ lead or stone meels which weigh as much as a human. This set contains three wooden\
  \ meels of more common dimensions. Athletes practice with meels by taking a club\
  \ in each hand and swinging them in a rhythmic fashion around the body. Training\
  \ with a set of meels requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 10 Strength check. If\
  \ you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks\
  \ and treat your Strength score as 1 higher for the purpose of determining your\
  \ carrying capacity. This bonus lasts for 24 hours."
