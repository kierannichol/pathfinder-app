description: "This simple pair of leather shooting bracers are designed to protect\
  \ the wearer's wrist from being snapped by bowstrings. They appear similar to a\
  \ set of bracers of archery, but a wearer notices the difference as soon as she\
  \ dons them.\nThe wearer of these bracers gains damage reduction 5/ magic against\
  \ ranged weapons, as well as a +1 deflection bonus against ranged attacks. In addition,\
  \ once per day, as a swift action, the wearer can grant herself a +20 insight bonus\
  \ on her next ranged attack roll before the end of her next turn."
