description: "This magic instrument comes in four varieties. Each appears to be a\
  \ normal, scarred old horn used for hunting or signaling during battle. When someone\
  \ speaks its command word and blows the horn, however, the horn summons a number\
  \ of human barbarians to fight for the character who summoned them. Each horn can\
  \ be blown just once every 7 days. Roll d% and refer to the table above to see what\
  \ type of horn is found. The horn's type determines what barbarians are summoned\
  \ and what prerequisite is needed to use the horn. Any character who uses a horn\
  \ of Valhalla but doesn't have the prerequisite is attacked by the barbarians she\
  \ herself summoned.\nSummoned barbarians are constructs, not actual people (though\
  \ they seem to be); they arrive with the starting equipment for barbarians. They\
  \ attack anyone the possessor of the horn commands them to fight until they or their\
  \ opponents are slain or until 1 hour has elapsed, whichever comes first."
