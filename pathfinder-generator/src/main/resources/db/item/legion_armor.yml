description: "This gilded suit of +2 banded mail is decorated with images of celestial\
  \ beings holding their weapons high. Legion armor is typically worn by high-ranking\
  \ angels and archons directly combating the forces of evil on the Material Plane.\n\
  Once per day as a standard action, the wearer of a suit of legion armor can cast\
  \ the spell spiritual ally with a duration of 1 minute. This ally typically takes\
  \ on the appearance of an imposing angelic warrior. At any time while the armor's\
  \ spiritual ally is conjured, the wearer of a suit of legion armor can dismiss the\
  \ effect as a standard action, causing the spiritual ally to explode with a thunderous\
  \ choir of voices and blaring trumpets. This effect causes each evil-aligned creatures\
  \ within 100 feet to become shaken unless it succeeds at a DC 20 Will save."
