description: "This thin iron chain holds up to 10 extracted teeth of common predatory\
  \ animals strung along it. As a move action, the wearer can place up to three teeth\
  \ into a thrown splash weapon or an alchemist's bomb. When such a splash weapon\
  \ or bomb hits a target, it deals an additional 1d4 points of slashing damage per\
  \ tooth used. Each tooth used in such a splash weapon or bomb also increases its\
  \ splash damage by 2 points of slashing damage per tooth. Once all of the necklace's\
  \ teeth are used in this way, the necklace's magic is expended. A newly purchased\
  \ necklace of bloody incisors contains 10 extracted teeth."
