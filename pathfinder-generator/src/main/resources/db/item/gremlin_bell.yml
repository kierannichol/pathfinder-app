description: "From rural villages to bustling cities, many blame even the slightest\
  \ misfortunes on the depredations of gremlins. Regardless of whether such creatures\
  \ are truly to blame for a community's problems, many shrines and hedge wizards\
  \ sell tiny charms to their neighbors, talismans meant to ward off lesser evils:\
  \ gremlin bells.\nCrafted from bronze, brass, or countless other semiprecious metals,\
  \ these miniature bells—no more than an inch tall—hang from delicate chains or short\
  \ silken cords and ring with a tinny tinkling. Typically affixed over doorframes\
  \ or to precious objects, when rung frequently these ornaments supposedly ward off\
  \ gremlins and protect those nearby from ill fortune. And unlike most such folk\
  \ magic, expertly made gremlin bells actually work.\nGremlin bells have two uses.\
  \ First, they irritate gremlins. Any gremlin that comes within 20 feet of a gremlin\
  \ bell cannot make use of any of its supernatural abilities and becomes uncomfortable,\
  \ typically seeking to leave the area (though it is not compelled to do so). Secondly,\
  \ once per day a gremlin bell can be purposefully rung. All gremlins within 20 feet\
  \ who can hear the chime must make a DC 16 Will save or be sickened for the next\
  \ 5 minutes."
