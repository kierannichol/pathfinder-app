  \ by moss-covered stones and dew-drenched ferns. Mountains rise up in the background,\
  \ casting rippled shadows across the water's surface. The silver frame is etched\
  \ with symbols of healing.\nBy touching the painting while uttering one of three\
  \ seperate command words, you may cast the following spells: 3/day - maximized cure\
  \ light wounds (13 points); 1/day - maximized cure moderate wounds (26 points);\
  \ 1/week - heal."
