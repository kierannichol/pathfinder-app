description: "This +2 heavy steel shield has a distinct curve to its shape and often\
  \ bears the device of a valiant knight. The wearer of this shield gains a +2 bonus\
  \ on Reflex saves against effects that originate or burst from a point outside his\
  \ own square, as though he had cover. It does not protect against spread effects.\
  \ This bonus does not stack with that granted by actual cover or give cover to any\
  \ creature other than the wearer. In addition, the dragonslayer's shield grants\
  \ its wielder a +2 morale bonus on Will saves against the frightful presence ability."
