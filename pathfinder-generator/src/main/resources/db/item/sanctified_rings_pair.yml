description: "A single tiny religious symbol adorns each ring in this matched pair.\
  \ If two people each wear one of the rings and clasp hands, a cleric may activate\
  \ both rings with one use of channel energy. If the person wearing one of these\
  \ rings dies or removes it, the other ring instantly cracks; the wearer of the broken\
  \ ring knows if it cracked because the other wearer died or the ring was removed."
