description: "This rod functions as a +1 flaming burst light mace. Furthermore, when\
  \ the rod confirms a critical hit, not only does it deal the extra damage from the\
  \ flaming burst special ability, a nimbus of cold blue flames ignites the target\
  \ for 1d4 rounds. This illuminates the target as the faerie fire spell. While the\
  \ nimbus does not burn the target, it responds to melee attacks made against that\
  \ foe. Each time an ignited foe takes damage from a melee attack, it takes and additional\
  \ 1d10 fire damage.\nFurthermore, once per day, as a free action, after hitting\
  \ a foe with this rod, the wielder can surround the target of that attack with the\
  \ nimbus, which has the same effect as the nimbus created by a confirmed critical\
  \ hit."
