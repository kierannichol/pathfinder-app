description: "This dirt-stained cloak was woven in shadow from the burial shroud of\
  \ a condemned murderer. It prevents nonintelligent undead from detecting you, as\
  \ per the hide from undead spell. Intelligent undead can perceive you if they succeed\
  \ at a DC 11 Will save. The warding is ended if you touch an undead creature, channel\
  \ energy against undead, or attack any creature. Once per day as a standard action\
  \ you can silently call forth the shadows bound into the shroud, rendering you invisible\
  \ for 5 minutes."
