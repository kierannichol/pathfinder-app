description: "This thick, murky liquid comes in a large earthenware jug, and can be\
  \ purchased in a variety of colors. Hide dye can be applied to the feathers, fur,\
  \ scales, or skin of most types of animals and magical beasts, allowing creatures\
  \ a measure of camouflage. Hide dye comes in a variety of colors and shades matching\
  \ the following different kinds of terrain: cold (including ice, glaciers, snow,\
  \ and tundra), desert, forest, jungle, mountain (including hills), plains, swamp,\
  \ underground, urban, and water.\nOne jar of hide dye can be applied to a Small\
  \ or smaller animal or magical beast in 1 hour. Thereafter, the dyed creature gains\
  \ a +2 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks in the associated terrain. If the Environment\
  \ entry in a creature's statistics indicates that the creature can typically be\
  \ found in a specific type of terrain (such as an owl's environment of temperate\
  \ forests) and the creature is adorned with hide dye of a matching type, the bonus\
  \ on Stealth checks increases to +4. Applying a new color of dye immediately covers\
  \ and replaces the previous dye.\nHide dye doesn't adhere to clothing or humanoid\
  \ flesh, and grants no benefit to creatures other than animals or magical beasts.\
  \ Once applied, hide dye is waterproof and can't be rubbed or burned away. It fades\
  \ after 1d4+1 days unless it's removed earlier by magical means."
