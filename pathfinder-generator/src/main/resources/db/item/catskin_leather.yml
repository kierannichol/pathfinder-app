description: "Rather than the hide of a cat, this extremely supple suit of jetblack\
  \ +1 shadow leather armor grants a portion of the grace and fortune of a feline.\
  \ It has no armor check penalty or maximum Dexterity bonus. The wearer receives\
  \ a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks and takes only half normal damage from\
  \ falling. When the wearer's hit points would be reduced to a negative amount equal\
  \ to her Constitution score from an attack or spell, the armor falls to pieces and\
  \ is destroyed, and the wearer takes only half damage from the attack or spell."
