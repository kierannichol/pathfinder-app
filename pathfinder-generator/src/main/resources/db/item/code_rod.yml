description: "To all appearances, this device is nothing more than a plain rod, such\
  \ as a dowel, although it can be made in the form of any cylindrical object, such\
  \ as a cane or walking stick, curtain rod, scroll case, wind chime, or blow gun.\
  \ The simplest form of code rod costs 1 sp and weighs 1 pound. If the rod has another\
  \ use other than as a code rod, it uses the higher price and weight of the two items.\
  \ Two code rods of matching circumference must be used in pairs to work properly.\
  \ The second rod can be an item similar to the first, or it can simply be made to\
  \ the same dimensions. To use a code rod, a long, narrow strip of paper is wrapped\
  \ around the rod in a spiral pattern such that the edge of the paper touches the\
  \ previous circuit with each pass, forming a continuous surface. A message is written\
  \ along the length of the rod, one character to each coil of paper, row by row,\
  \ until the paper is full. Once the message is completed, the strip of paper is\
  \ unwound, rendering the message indecipherable. It can then be rolled up and sent\
  \ to the recipient, who wraps it around the other rod and can then read the message.\
  \ The users can write in plain language or further encode the message. Someone intercepting\
  \ the message, if they recognize the use of a code rod, can attempt to find another\
  \ rod of similar circumference, using Linguistics to crack the code rod's message."
