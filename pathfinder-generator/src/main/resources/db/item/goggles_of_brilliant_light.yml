description: "These sturdy goggles have a mirror sheen on the outside of their lenses,\
  \ a wrapping of leather holding them snugly in place. This tint blocks a considerable\
  \ amount of natural light. Twice per day, the goggles' wearer can emit bright light\
  \ on command to a range of 30 feet. Any creature within that area must succeed at\
  \ a DC 13 Fortitude saving throw or be blinded for 1 hour. In addition, the wearer\
  \ also gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against visual effects."
