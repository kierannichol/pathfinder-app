description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThese small, stylish golden clasps come in pairs:\
  \ one for a handler and one for an agent. The handler's clasp provides constant\
  \ information to the wearer as per the spell status regarding the wearer of the\
  \ agent's clasp. At will, the wearer of either clasp can speak a command word to\
  \ transmit a sending (as per the spell) to the wearer of the other clasp. If the\
  \ other clasp is not worn, the sending is stored in the recipient clasp until it\
  \ is next donned, at which time the message is delivered and the recipient has a\
  \ chance to respond as normal.\nThe price and cost listed are for a matched pair\
  \ of clasps."
