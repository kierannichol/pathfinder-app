description: "You channel the power of good and law into the target, temporarily giving\
  \ it powers similar to those of a paladin. The target gains the ability to use detect\
  \ evilat will as a spell-like ability, immunity to disease (suppressing any diseases\
  \ currently affecting it), and immunity to fear (ending any fear effects currently\
  \ affecting it); can lay on hands (on itself only) once as a paladin of 1/2 your\
  \ caster level; and can smite evil once as a paladin of 1/2 your caster level. It\
  \ adds its Charisma bonus to all its saving throws. It can use spell completion,\
  \ spell trigger, or other magic items that require the ability to cast spells as\
  \ a paladin. Any abilities not used by the time the spell expires are lost. This\
  \ spell has no effect if cast on a paladin."
