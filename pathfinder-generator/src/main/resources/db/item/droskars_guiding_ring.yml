description: "This gold ring is misshapen and uncomfortable to wear for long periods\
  \ of time; inscribed on it is a crude symbol of a fire burning under an arch. Once\
  \ per day, the wearer may use charm person. If Droskar is the wearer's patron deity,\
  \ any time the wearer crafts a magic item, she may choose to pay half of the item's\
  \ construction cost instead of the full cost. The wearer spends time working on\
  \ the item normally, but at the time of completion there is a 50% chance that the\
  \ item turns out nonmagical and worthless. For example, if creating a magic bracer\
  \ that normally costs 1,000 gp to craft, the wearer may craft it for only 500 gp,\
  \ but there is a 50% chance the wearer's shortcuts and cheap materials result in\
  \ a valueless, nonfunctional item."
