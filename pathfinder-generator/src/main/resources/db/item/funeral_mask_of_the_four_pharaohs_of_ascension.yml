description: "This golden mask, decorated with a headdress of 56 hieracosphinx feathers,\
  \ acts in all regards as a silver horn of Valhalla save that the summoned barbarians\
  \ appear as Ancient Osirion slave warriors, each armed with a longspear. Summoning\
  \ the barbarians is a swift action you can activate with a thought, rather than\
  \ by blowing a horn.\nThe mask's greater power, however, is to summon forth the\
  \ missing portion of the pyramid of the Four Pharaohs of Ascension (see Part 3).\n\
  Should the PCs defeat all four of the pharaohs, the mask shatters into four jagged\
  \ pieces and is destroyed."
