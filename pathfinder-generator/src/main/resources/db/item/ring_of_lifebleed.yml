  \ it is worn in combat, however, the true nature of the ring becomes apparent. Each\
  \ time the wearer is hit with a melee or ranged weapon attack, he takes an additional\
  \ 1d4 points of damage. This ring cannot be removed until the wearer dies or by\
  \ way of a remove curse, wish, or miracle spell."
