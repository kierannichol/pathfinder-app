description: "A lord's banner is a cloth flag or standard, typically at least 2 feet\
  \ wide and 4 feet long (though some are up to twice that size), meant to be carried\
  \ and displayed on a lance, polearm, frame, or staff. It has no effect when not\
  \ mounted properly or when laying on the ground. It normally depicts the insignia\
  \ or heraldic symbol of a particular noble.\nA lord's banner may be carried (on\
  \ foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the banner does not need a bearer,\
  \ but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until\
  \ reclaimed and replanted by allies of its owner.\nCrusades (evocation aura): A\
  \ noble-looking lord's banner of crusades emits a hallow effect in a 40-foot radius\
  \ around it, so long as it is borne by one true to the religion of the person whose\
  \ crest is on the banner (these sorts of banners usually have a holy symbol or other\
  \ religious insignia worked into the design).\nSwiftness (abjuration aura): A group\
  \ or army that are traveling under a lord's banner of swiftness can make a forced\
  \ march without needing Constitution checks or suffering any nonlethal damage from\
  \ doing so, allowing them to cover great distances while still arriving ready to\
  \ do battle. This ability affects all allied creatures within 1 mile as long as\
  \ they are able to see the banner at least once a day.\nTerror (necromancy aura):\
  \ Enemies of the bearer of a lord's banner of terror, while within 30 feet and able\
  \ to see the banner, must make a DC 16 Will save or become panicked, fleeing as\
  \ quickly as possible for as long as they can see the banner. Those that succeed\
  \ on the save are shaken. A creature that makes its saving throw cannot be panicked\
  \ by the banner for 24 hours.\nVictory (evocation aura): Allies of the owner of\
  \ a lord's banner of victory gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and\
  \ skill checks for as long as they can see the banner."
