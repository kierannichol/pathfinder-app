description: "This ash-gray powder is refined from the crushed bones of creatures\
  \ that died of virulent diseases, illegally produced by nefarious alchemists, and\
  \ sold on the black market to those seeking to spread illness and death. The application\
  \ of the powder depends on the disease from which it is refined. Someone using powder\
  \ made from diseases contracted by ingestion must apply it to food (a full-round\
  \ action) for the victim to consume. Those using powder made from diseases contracted\
  \ by injury must apply the powder to weapons (a standard action, as per the poison\
  \ application rules) and deal damage to victims to subject them to the contagion.\
  \ Diseases contracted by inhalation require the user to disperse the powder by throwing\
  \ it into the air. Throwing a handful of plague powder is a splash attack with a\
  \ range increment of 5 feet. Anyone standing in the square of impact must succeed\
  \ at a save with a DC equal to that of the disease from which the powder is made\
  \ to avoid contracting the illness, while those in adjacent squares must attempt\
  \ the same save with a +4 bonus. Diseases spread through contact can use any of\
  \ the three manners of application.\nThe most common disease refined for these powders\
  \ is filth fever, costing 144 gp, but refined plague powders of other diseases are\
  \ available, with a price equal to the base save DC of the disease squared. Making\
  \ a plague powder always requires access to a sample of the disease and exposes\
  \ the creator to the disease in question each day of crafting. Crafting a dose of\
  \ plague powder requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
