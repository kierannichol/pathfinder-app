description: "Primarily used by the cliff-dwelling Shoanti of western Varisia's Shadde-Quah\
  \ clan, a +1 Shoanti bolas is elementally enchanted. Each end of a bolas has its\
  \ own magical enhancements: one side bears cold magic, and the other bears fire\
  \ magic. A target damaged by a Shadde-Quah spirit bolas takes an additional 1d3\
  \ points of cold damage and 1d3 points of fire damage, as the two weights damage\
  \ their target as though the weapon had both the flaming and frost special weapon\
  \ abilities at half their normal effectiveness.\nOnce per day as a standard action,\
  \ the wielder of a Shadde-Quah spirit bolas can utter a prayer to the elements and\
  \ throw the bolas, causing both ends to crash together mid-flight. The bolas transforms\
  \ into a roiling ball of water, as the spell aqueous orb (Advanced Player's Guide\
  \ 202), under the control of the thrower. Once the spell ends, the bolas falls to\
  \ the ground at the same location the orb ended its movement."
