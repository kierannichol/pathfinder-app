description: "These delicate sliver bracers are decorated with blue butterflies. While\
  \ worn, swallowtail bracers grant the wearer a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws,\
  \ ability checks, and skill checks. If the wearer worships Desna, the bracers grant\
  \ an additional boon: Once per day, by speaking a command word and the name and/or\
  \ title of the intended recipient, the wearer may cast dream. Such a wearer is also\
  \ immune to nightmare, and when the wearer is targeted by that spell, the effects\
  \ reflect back upon the caster."
