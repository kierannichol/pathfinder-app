description: "When activated, this black pebble acts as a limited gravitational singularity.\
  \ Once the command word is spoken, the pebble delays for 1 round, then pulls all\
  \ stone or earth within a 5-foot-diameter sphere toward it with irresistible force.\
  \ This causes small tunnels to collapse inward, creating localized cave-ins. Imploding\
  \ stones do not affect living creatures, though any creature in the same square\
  \ as an activated imploding stone is caught in the bury zone of the collapse (Core\
  \ Rulebook 415). Imploding stones are destroyed when used. Activating an imploding\
  \ stone is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity."
