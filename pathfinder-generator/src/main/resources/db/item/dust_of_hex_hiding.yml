description: "This translucent dust warps harmful magical auras, making it difficult\
  \ to discern cursed items from beneficial ones. Sprinkling the dust over a cursed\
  \ magic item shields it from divination magic for 5 days. When identifying the item,\
  \ a creature must exceed the item's DC by 15 (instead of by 10) to determine whether\
  \ the item is cursed. If a creature activates the curse while the item is under\
  \ this effect, treat the curse's caster level as 2 higher for the purpose of resisting\
  \ spells such as remove curse and break enchantment.\nThe dust can also be scattered\
  \ over a magical glyph, rune, or symbol to increase the DC to find and disable the\
  \ trap by 5 for 5 days."
