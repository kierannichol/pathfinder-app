description: "This unobtrusive but fashionable velvet choker allows the wearer to\
  \ change certain aspects of her physical form. Once per day on command, the choker\
  \ can alter the wearer's body in one of the following ways: adopt the physical characteristics\
  \ of a different gender, appear up to 10 years older or younger, become up to 10%\
  \ taller or shorter, or become up to 10% thinner or heavier. This is a polymorph\
  \ effect. This alteration does not change any of the wearer's statistics, such as\
  \ size category or ability scores, although it does provide a +2 circumstance bonus\
  \ on Disguise checks. The choker can provide only one alteration at a time, and\
  \ its effects last until the choker is removed or 24 hours pass, whichever comes\
  \ first."
