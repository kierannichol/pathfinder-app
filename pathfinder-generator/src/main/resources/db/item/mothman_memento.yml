description: "Mothmen sometimes create these tokens when they know their powers won't\
  \ be needed for a long period of time or they are close to death and wish to preserve\
  \ their legacies. A mothman memento can be any item that is worn around the neck,\
  \ such as an amulet or pendant. As a full-round action while wearing a mothman memento,\
  \ a mothman can simultaneously kill itself and inject its soul into the item.\n\
  A mothman memento can lie untouched for years or even decades before it winds up\
  \ in the hands of another creature. Any humanoid or monstrous humanoid that wears\
  \ the memento gains the ability to cast modify memory as a spell-like ability three\
  \ times per day (caster level 12th). If a creature goes to sleep or falls unconscious\
  \ while wearing a mothman memento, the wearer must succeed at a DC 19 Will save\
  \ or be affected as though by a nightmare spell (no modifiers due to knowledge or\
  \ physical connection; caster level 12th). A creature can be affected by this nightmare\
  \ effect only once every 24 hours. After the first time the wearer is affected by\
  \ the nightmare effect, the memento can only be removed by means of a remove curse\
  \ spell. A creature that dies from the nightmare effect rises as a mothman the next\
  \ morning."
