description: "At first glance resembling a baton-like stick with a sling dangling\
  \ from each end, this weapon requires extraordinary skill, or halfling acrobatics,\
  \ to use to full effect. You can use a double sling as a normal sling, or use the\
  \ second end to make one additional ranged attack each round. You take the normal\
  \ penalties for fighting with two weapons when you use both ends of a double sling\
  \ (as if it were a double weapon); the Two- Weapon Fighting feat reduces these penalties\
  \ as normal. Reloading one end of a double sling is a move action (just like a normal\
  \ sling), so unless you have an ability or feat (such as Ammo Drop) that allows\
  \ you to quickly reload a sling, you cannot normally make multiple attacks per round\
  \ for several consecutive rounds with this weapon.\nYou can hurl ordinary stones\
  \ with a double sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus,\
  \ such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one\
  \ size category smaller than you, and you take a â€“1 penalty on attack rolls."
