description: "Magical analysis indicates that this armor is a normal suit of +3 full\
  \ plate. The armor works normally with regard to melee attacks but actually attracts\
  \ ranged weapons. The wearer takes a â€“15 penalty to AC against ranged weapons. The\
  \ true nature of the armor does not reveal itself until the character is fired upon\
  \ in earnest."
