id: "item:scroll_of_mind_blank"
name: "Scroll of Mind Blank"
description: "The subject is protected from all devices and spells that gather information\
  \ about the target through divination magic (such as detect evil, locate creature,\
  \ scry, and see invisible). This spell also grants a +8 resistance bonus on saving\
  \ throws against all mind-affecting spells and effects. Mind blank even foils limited\
  \ wish, miracle, and wish spells when they are used in such a way as to gain information\
  \ about the target. In the case of scrying that scans an area the creature is in,\
  \ such as arcane eye, the spell works but the creature simply isn't detected. Scrying\
  \ attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all."
