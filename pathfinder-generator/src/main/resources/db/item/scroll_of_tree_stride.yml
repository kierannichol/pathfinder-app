name: "Scroll of Tree Stride"
description: "When you cast this spell, you gain the ability to step into a tree,\
  \ magically infusing yourself with the plant. Once within a tree, you can teleport\
  \ from that particular tree to another tree. The trees you enter must be of the\
  \ same kind, must be living, and must have girth at least equal to yours. By moving\
  \ into an oak tree (for example), you instantly know the location of all other oak\
  \ trees within transport range (see below) and may choose whether you want to pass\
  \ into one or simply step back out of the tree you moved into. You may choose to\
  \ pass to any tree of the appropriate kind within the transport range as shown on\
  \ the following table."
