description: "This massive forge is built into the structure of a temple to Magrim\
  \ and can't be moved without divine intervention. Made of precious metals and gemstones,\
  \ the forge is surprisingly resilient, and even hard metals can be crafted upon\
  \ its seemingly soft, delicate surfaces.\nAny item crafted with this forge can be\
  \ constructed in half the normal amount of time.\nWhen the forge's furnace is fed\
  \ by a specific set of bellows, currently buried beside the remains of Naika Omenspeaker\
  \ (see area 10), the flames glow with a divine radiance and emit no noticeable heat,\
  \ allowing for forging at a temperature more comfortable to the crafter. While the\
  \ Soulforge is so lit, if a character's successful Craft (armor, jewelry, locks,\
  \ or weapons) check result using the forge exceeds DC 40, that crafter garners Magrim's\
  \ favor and can choose from one of the three following special rewards.\nFirst,\
  \ the crafter can ask of the god a single miracle, so long as the request does not\
  \ conflict with Magrim's lawful neutral alignment. A creature can receive at most\
  \ one such miracle over the course of her life.\nSecond, at the GM's discretion,\
  \ the crafter can override the destruction conditions of a minor artifact without\
  \ a lawful aura and destroy it in the Soulforge.\nFinally, the crafter can choose\
  \ for her soul to pass from her body, traveling through the Soulforge to Magrim's\
  \ realm in the Boneyard, effectively causing the crafter to die. Magrim immediately\
  \ ushers the crafter's soul before Pharasma for judgment and petitions on her behalf\
  \ before the Lady of Graves, advocating for his most faithful followers to find\
  \ ultimate rest in the realm best befitting their lives."
destruction: "If the great anvil of the Soulforge is used as a sacrificial altar to\
  \ slay a willing lawful outsider of at least 18 Hit Dice while the forge burns with\
  \ divine flame, the artifact is destroyed."
