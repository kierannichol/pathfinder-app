description: "These gloves of thick leather do not impair delicate work and grant\
  \ a +4 competence bonus on Disable Device checks to disable magic traps. Once per\
  \ day, a wearer trained in Disable Device can command the gloves to alter an unattended\
  \ magic item she touches to incorporate a trap. The wearer attempts a caster level\
  \ check using the higher of her caster level or the gloves' caster level (DC = 11\
  \ + the target item's caster level). If the check is successful, the target item\
  \ is marked with a glyph of warding (blast glyph only) that lasts for up to 1 day."
