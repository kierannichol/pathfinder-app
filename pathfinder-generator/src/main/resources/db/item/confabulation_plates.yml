description: "Approximately 10 inches on each side, these two square, brass-colored\
  \ metal plates have rubber edges and screws at each corner used to tighten the plates\
  \ like a clamp. In the center of the top plate is a fleshy tube that ends in a suction\
  \ cup ringed with tiny teeth. Next to the base of the tube is a small winding key\
  \ that powers the device and a toggle switch that selects the device's function\
  \ (dead or plants).\nTo use the confabulation plates on a dead entity, the user\
  \ must clamp the plates around part of the subject's body and attach the tube to\
  \ the subject's bare skin. Then the user has to crank the winding key for 1 minute.\
  \ Once this is complete, the user can ask the corpse two questions, and the response\
  \ emits from the device in a metallic, buzzing tone. This effect is identical to\
  \ speak with dead.\nIf the device is selected to be able to communicate with plants\
  \ and clamped onto a plant, the user can communicate freely with the subject for\
  \ 5 minutes as the spell speak with plants.\nConfabulation plates can be used once\
  \ per day."
