description: "Infused with the power of Hell's courts, this blood-quenched steel gavel\
  \ emits an ear-splitting din when struck against a hard surface. Once per day, as\
  \ a standard action, you can use it to judge a single foe within 30 feet, who then\
  \ suffers the effect of a dictum spell.\nThe gavel bestows one negative level on\
  \ any chaotic or good creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains\
  \ as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded.\
  \ This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome\
  \ in any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded. If the\
  \ creature is chaotic good, these negative levels stack."
