description: "The blade of this unassuming longsword is permanently broken, snapped\
  \ at an angle halfway along the blade. In spite of this, the sword can be wielded\
  \ as a +2 short sword without penalty. As long as the wielder of a rabbit's blade\
  \ is threatening two or more foes and he has no allies within 15 feet, he gains\
  \ the use of the Cleave feat. If he is threatening three or more foes and has no\
  \ allies within 30 feet, the wielder gains the use of the Great Cleave feat instead.\
  \ Each threatened foe must have Hit Dice equal to or greater than 1/2 the wielder's\
  \ character level in order to count toward this weapon's ability."
