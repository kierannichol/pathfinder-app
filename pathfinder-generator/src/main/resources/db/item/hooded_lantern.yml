description: "A hooded lantern sheds normal light in a 30-foot radius and increases\
  \ the light level by one step for an additional 30 feet beyond that area (darkness\
  \ becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A hooded lantern does not\
  \ increase the light level in normal light or bright light. A lantern burns for\
  \ 6 hours on 1 pint of oil. You can carry a lantern in one hand."
