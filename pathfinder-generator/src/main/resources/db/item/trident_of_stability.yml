description: "The base of this sturdy but tarnished +1 trident has a wide metal bar\
  \ at the bottom, perfectly situated to serve as a solid footrest or other sort of\
  \ step. The bar acts as an immovable rod, except instead of an activation button,\
  \ the immobility power triggers whenever the wielder places one or both feet on\
  \ the bar, and ends whenever the wielder is no longer touching the bar with at least\
  \ one foot. If the wielder remains in place and steps on the bar, he gains a +10\
  \ bonus to his CMD when trying to resist efforts to move him. The wielder is always\
  \ considered braced against oncoming charge attacks. If the wielder is falling,\
  \ he may step on the bar as an immediate action to halt his fall, though the sudden\
  \ jolt means he takes falling damage for the current distance fallen."
