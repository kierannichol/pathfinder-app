description: "This clear, 1-inch-thick glass orb is the size of a large melon and\
  \ hangs from a thick chain. It can hold up to 2 gallons of freshwater or saltwater,\
  \ allowing it to house aquatic creatures such as fish or frogs. The cap near the\
  \ top of the ball can be unscrewed for access. One Tiny creature or two Diminutive\
  \ creatures can fit comfortably into an aquarium ball. The water within the orb\
  \ must be changed daily in order to keep the creatures within alive. Otherwise,\
  \ the inhabitants begin to slowly suffocate (see page 445 of the Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Core Rulebook)."
