description: "Three flensed skulls jut from the face of this +2 heavy steel shield.\
  \ Three times per day as a free action, the shield's wearer can command the heads\
  \ to attack independently of her, biting with the wearer's base attack bonus (making\
  \ multiple attacks if the wearer has a high enough base attack bonus). This attack\
  \ is in addition to any actions performed by the wearer, and deals 1d6 points of\
  \ damage plus 1 point of Constitution damage.\nWhen using the bloodfeast shield's\
  \ ability, if the wearer is a vampire (or regains hit points from blood drain in\
  \ a similar manner), she also heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary hit points\
  \ for 1 hour."
