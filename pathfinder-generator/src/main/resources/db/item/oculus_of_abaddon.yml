description: "An oculus of Abaddon is a potent artifact rumored to have been created\
  \ by one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as a way to reward those who work\
  \ as their agents on the Material Plane. More likely, these items were crafted by\
  \ a powerful pre- Earthfall race that has long since moved on, leaving behind these\
  \ dangerous artifacts to tempt mortals into serving the needs of the Horsemen.\n\
  An oculus of Abaddon appears as a sphere of clear crystal that contains a pinpoint\
  \ of flickering red light at its center. When held, the oculus feels warm to the\
  \ touch and fills the holder with a sudden desire to pluck out an eye and place\
  \ the oculus within the socket—this causes 1d8 points of damage, 1 point of bleed\
  \ damage, and 2 points of Constitution damage. Once placed in an eye socket, the\
  \ oculus can only be removed by ripping it free (causing the same amount of damage\
  \ as the initial plucking). An oculus placed in an empty eye socket immediately\
  \ heals all damage caused by plucking the previous eye out. Once placed, an oculus\
  \ allows its new owner to utilize its powers, as listed below."
destruction: "A foul and hideous object, the oculus of Abaddon is fortunately relatively\
  \ easy to destroy, as far as artifacts go. To destroy an oculus of Abaddon, it must\
  \ be smashed by a bludgeoning holy weapon wielded by a permanently blinded humanoid—\
  alternatively, any bludgeoning weapon wielded by a permanently blinded good outsider\
  \ with at least 7 HD will work as well. A DC 30 Knowledge (arcana) check is enough\
  \ to learn this method of destruction."
