description: "This thimble-sized clay container of thick, moist face paint has enough\
  \ material to paint streaks and whorls of any color on one creature's face. Once\
  \ applied, the wearer can, as a swift action, make the paint rearrange itself into\
  \ a ghastly mélange of colors, making her appearance momentarily disturbing and\
  \ hideous. The wearer chooses one creature who can see her painted face within 30\
  \ feet to be affected by cause fear (DC 11). Once the paint is used in this fashion,\
  \ it loses all magic and becomes normal face paint. Once applied, the wearer has\
  \ 24 hours to use the paint's magic; otherwise it fades away."
