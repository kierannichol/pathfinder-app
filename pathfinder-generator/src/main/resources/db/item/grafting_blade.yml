description: "This plain-looking +1 spring blade is attached to a weatherbeaten cedar\
  \ grip. By speaking a command word, the wielder can magically merge the grip into\
  \ a larger wood handle, such as a cane, club, staff, stylus, or oar, transforming\
  \ the infused item into either a +1 shortspear, +1 spear, or +1 siangham (depending\
  \ on the handle's size). The blade can even be affixed to magic items such as staves,\
  \ rods, and wands so long as they are made of wood, but doing so renders their other\
  \ magical properties nonfunctional until the grafting blade is removed.\nRemoving\
  \ a grafting blade from an item it has merged with requires a full-round action,\
  \ and leaves both items unharmed."
