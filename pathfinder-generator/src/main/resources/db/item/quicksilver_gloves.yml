description: "These tight-fitting gloves have silver tips at the end of each finger.\
  \ When worn, the silver spreads to cover the gloves so they appear to be covered\
  \ in liquid metal.\nAs a swift action, the wearer can command the gloves to coat\
  \ a held weapon with silver. The affected weapon is treated as silver for the purpose\
  \ of overcoming damage reduction. The effect can be applied only to light or onehanded\
  \ weapons made primarily of metal. This ability can be used for up to 10 rounds\
  \ each day, though these rounds need not be consecutive.\nOnce per day, the gloves'\
  \ wearer can make an extra attack with a melee weapon as if using a speed weapon.\
  \ This benefit does not stack with similar effects, such as a haste spell."
