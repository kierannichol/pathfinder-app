description: "Gathered within this tightly woven, alchemically treated canvas sack\
  \ is a sample of the pervasive fetid fog that looms near the border of the Plane\
  \ of Air and the Plane of Water. When opened, the fog billows out in a 30-foot-radius\
  \ area. Sight is extremely limited in an area of stagnant fog. A creature within\
  \ 15 feet has concealment (20% miss chance), while creatures farther away have total\
  \ concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target).\
  \ In addition, creatures that end their turn within the cloud must succeed at a\
  \ DC 14 Fortitude save or become sickened for 1 round. Stagnant fog dissipates naturally\
  \ after 1 minute. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the stagnant fog in 1 round.\
  \ This item can be crafted with a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
