description: "An arcane battery is a fist-sized lead container—typically a sphere,\
  \ pyramid, or cylinder—that stores magically treated saltwater. When affixed to\
  \ the head of a magical staff with the attached lashings, an arcane battery increases\
  \ the maximum number of charges the staff can hold to 11 (instead of 10). An attached\
  \ arcane battery also allows the wielder of a staff to imbue a staff with up to\
  \ two charges per day. In order to do so, the wielder must expend two prepared spells\
  \ or spell slots that meet the prerequisites for recharging a staff.\nA staff may\
  \ only have a single arcane battery attached to it, and an arcane battery must be\
  \ adjoined to a staff for 24 hours before its powers are attuned to the staff. If\
  \ an arcane battery is removed from a staff by the staff's wielder, it must be reattached\
  \ and remain so for 24 hours before it's attuned again."
