description: "These alchemically treated incense sticks contain pheromones that certain\
  \ creatures find repellent. Each odor stalk is created to irritate a specific creature\
  \ type. After burning for 1 round, an odor stalk fills a 10â€“foot square with a clear\
  \ gas that causes any living creature of the prescribed type to become nauseated\
  \ for 1 round, then sickened for as long as it remains in the area. On a successful\
  \ DC 12 Fortitude save, the creature negates the nauseated condition but not the\
  \ sickened condition. This is a poison effect. The cloud lasts for 10 minutes, but\
  \ can be dispersed like obscuring mist. Additionally, odor stalks can be used as\
  \ an additional spell component for the following spells to modify the spell's effects.\n\
  Ghoul touch: The stench only affects creatures of the odor stalk's associated creature\
  \ type.\nRepel vermin: The spell functions as written, but applies to the odor stalk's\
  \ associated creature type instead of to vermin. The Will save DC is always 12 when\
  \ using this component.\nStinking cloud: The Fortitude save DC increases by 1 for\
  \ creatures of the odor stalk's prescribed type, but decreases by 1 for all other\
  \ creature types."
