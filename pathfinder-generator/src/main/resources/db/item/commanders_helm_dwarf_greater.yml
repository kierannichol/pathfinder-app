description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis broad helmet is marked with archaic dwarven\
  \ military insignia. When each helm is created, it is attuned to one teamwork feat.\
  \ The wearer gains that feat for as long as she wears the helm and meets its prerequisites.\
  \ With a command word, the wearer can grant that feat to all allies that meet its\
  \ prerequisites within 30 feet for 1 minute. The helm can be activated up to three\
  \ times per day.\nIf the wearer is a dwarf, she can choose any teamwork feat she\
  \ possesses to grant in this way. The helm can grant no more than one feat at a\
  \ time; when a new feat is granted, all subjects lose any previously granted feat.\n\
  A lesser commander's helm can contain a feat with either a base attack bonus prerequisite\
  \ no greater than +5 or a skill rank prerequisite no greater than 5. A greater commander's\
  \ helm can contain a feat with a base attack bonus prerequisite no greater than\
  \ +10 or a skill rank prerequisite no greater than 10. A superior commander's helm\
  \ can contain any teamwork feat. The same restrictions apply to the feats that a\
  \ dwarf wearer can grant when choosing from feats she possesses."
