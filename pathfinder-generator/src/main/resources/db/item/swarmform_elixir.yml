description: "This squarish jar holds dead insects suspended in bright pink liquid.\
  \ When the imbiber drinks this concoction, his body dissolves into a swarm of stinging\
  \ wasps, causing his equipment to fall to the ground. During this transformation,\
  \ the imbiber retains all his mental statistics but gains the physical statistics\
  \ of a wasp swarm. The imbiber can take only actions to control the movement of\
  \ the swarm form or purely mental actions. If at any point during the duration the\
  \ swarm reaches 0 hit points, the effect immediately ends and the imbiber transforms\
  \ back to his original form. This effect otherwise lasts 1 hour."
