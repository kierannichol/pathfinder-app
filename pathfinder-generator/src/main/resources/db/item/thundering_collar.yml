description: "Made of twisted copper wire braided into a torc with redstained dog\
  \ paws at its ends, a thundering collar is so named after Cayden Cailean's faithful\
  \ red mastiff, Thunder. A thundering collar allows the wearer to issue a rumbling\
  \ growl that sounds like rolling thunder three times per day. Creatures within 15\
  \ feet must succeed at a DC 12 Will save to attack (as if affected by sanctuary).\
  \ The wielder can bestow the effect on one adjacent ally as well. This effect lasts\
  \ for 3 rounds or until the wearer or its ally attacks."
