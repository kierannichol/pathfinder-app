description: "On command, this semiprecious stone adheres to an object weighing not\
  \ more than 100 pounds. As long as it is attached, the stone increases the object's\
  \ hardness by 5, its break DC by 5, and its hit points by 20. Like temporary hit\
  \ points, these additional hit points are lost first when the object the stone is\
  \ protecting is damaged, and once they are exhausted, the fortifying stone is destroyed.\
  \ However, unlike temporary hit points, they can be completely restored by repairing\
  \ the fortifying stone via a single casting of a make whole spell. Any effect that\
  \ breaks or destroys the protected object also destroys any attached fortifying\
  \ stones."
