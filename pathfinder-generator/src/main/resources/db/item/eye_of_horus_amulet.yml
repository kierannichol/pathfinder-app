description: "This triangular amulet of gold and lapis lazuli depicts a stylized eye—\
  the symbol of the Ancient Osirian deity Horus, god of rulership, the sky, and the\
  \ sun. Priests of Horus fashioned the first eye of Horus amulets centuries ago to\
  \ protect members of their order, particularly from minions of the god Set. Now,\
  \ the occasional eye of Horus amulet turns up in a marketplace or in the hands of\
  \ nomadic traders or adventurers.\nAn eye of Horus amulet grants its wearer a +2\
  \ resistance bonus on all saving throws. In addition, once per day, the wearer can\
  \ surround herself with an aura of shimmering sunlight that protects her as dispel\
  \ evil. Using this effect to drive an evil extraplanar creature back to its home\
  \ plane or to end either an evil spell or an enchantment spell cast by an evil creature\
  \ cancels this effect.\nLastly, if the wearer of an eye of Horus amulet is targeted\
  \ by an effect that causes blindness, she can, as an immediate action, cause the\
  \ amulet to absorb the effect. The wearer suffers no harm from the effect, but the\
  \ amulet cracks in half, rendering it forever useless thereafter."
