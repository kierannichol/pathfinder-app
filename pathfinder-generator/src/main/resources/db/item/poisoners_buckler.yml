description: "Half-drow make these bucklers to allow for quick application of exactly\
  \ the right poison in the middle of combat. This mithral buckler is painted black\
  \ with three deep grooves running over the surface, each fitted with a slot that\
  \ can hold a vial of poison. As a move action, the user can swipe a weapon over\
  \ the surface of the buckler, coating it with a single dose of poison. The buckler\
  \ can hold 3 doses of poison. If the wearer does not have the poison use ability,\
  \ she faces the standard risk of poisoning herself"
