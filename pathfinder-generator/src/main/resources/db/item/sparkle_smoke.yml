description: "When inhaled, this incense causes creatures to see dazzling auras around\
  \ light sources, drawing their attention to such illumination as the moon or stars\
  \ and away from other nearby creatures. Any creature inhaling sparkle smoke that\
  \ fails a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw takes a â€“4 penalty on Perception checks to\
  \ notice creatures smaller than itself in areas of at least dim light for 1 hour.\
  \ Crafting a dose of sparkle smoke requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check."
