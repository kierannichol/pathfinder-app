description: "This bandolier holds six pouches along its length and a satchel at the\
  \ hip. Each pouch has a stiff leather flap that can be secured against jostling\
  \ with a clasp (requiring a move action to open or close) or left unfastened for\
  \ easier access. The pouches and satchel contain loops and ties for securing additional\
  \ equipment. The sash buckles at the shoulder, and in an emergency can be freed\
  \ with a sharp tug as a move action."
