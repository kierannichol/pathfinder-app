description: "This 5-foot-square cloth canopy is brightly colored with gold fringe\
  \ around the edges, something a slightly foppish sultan might use while resting\
  \ on the seashore. When you speak the command word, the canopy unfolds and floats\
  \ 3 feet above your head, positioning itself to keep you shaded. The travel canopy\
  \ cannot hold any weight. It reverts to its 1-foot-square folded form at your command,\
  \ or automatically when it is out of the sun for more than 1 minute."
