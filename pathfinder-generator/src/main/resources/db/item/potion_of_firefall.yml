description: "Firefallcauses a fire to erupt into a geyser of dazzlingly bright liquid\
  \ flame. The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extinguished. A fire\
  \ larger than a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished. Magical fires are not\
  \ extinguished, but a creature of the fire subtype used as the source takes 1 point\
  \ of damage per caster level (no saving throw)."
