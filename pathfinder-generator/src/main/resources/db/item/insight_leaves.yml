  \ while it's still warm before going to bed. While you sleep, you experience vivid\
  \ hallucinations that offer insight into matters with which you previously had only\
  \ limited familiarity. After 8 hours of uninterrupted rest, you can attempt a previously\
  \ failed Knowledge check with a +2 alchemical bonus."
