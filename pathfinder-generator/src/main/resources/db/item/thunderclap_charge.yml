description: "Used by the dwarves of Dongun Hold to excavate precious crystals from\
  \ deep underground, this heavy ceramic canister is packed with inert fibers surrounding\
  \ a large alchemically infused blackpowder charge with a fuse. Lighting the fuse\
  \ is a move action; 1d3 rounds after the fuse is lit, the charge explodes, dealing\
  \ 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of sonic damage in a 10-foot-radius\
  \ burst (Reflex DC 15 half). Creatures in the area of effect are knocked prone and\
  \ deafened (a successful saving throw negates being knocked prone and reduces the\
  \ deafened condition to 1 round). Crafting a thunderclap charge requires a successful\
  \ DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
