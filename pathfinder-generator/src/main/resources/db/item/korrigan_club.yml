description: "Etchings of small, hairy folk adorn this knotty +1 thundering club.\
  \ Once per day as a standard action, a wielder can animate his own hair to wield\
  \ the club without his hands for 4 rounds, as if the korrigan club had the dancing\
  \ weapon special ability. A wielder's head hair or beard hair must be at least 2\
  \ feet long to activate this ability. Sundering the wielder's hair (hp 2) immediately\
  \ causes the korrigan club to fall to the ground and renders the wielder unable\
  \ to activate this special ability until the lost length regrows."
