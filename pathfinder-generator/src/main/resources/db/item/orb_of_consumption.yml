description: "This cruel Thassilonian device could not seem less intimidating—it appears\
  \ as nothing more frightening than a hollow sphere of pink glass the size of a halfling's\
  \ head. When it is held in both hands and its command word is spoken, a pulsing\
  \ light throbs at the core of the sphere and the sound of an ongoing exhalation\
  \ of breath emanates from the orb. This effect lasts for as long as the user concentrates,\
  \ up to a maximum of 6 rounds per day. All creatures within 10 feet of the orb that\
  \ possess an Intelligence of 3 or higher (save the orb's user, who is immune to\
  \ its effects as long as it is held) must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be compelled\
  \ to approach the sphere and touch it—this save is required every round the creature\
  \ remains within 10 feet of the user and the orb. This is a mind-affecting sonic\
  \ effect. The first applicable creature to touch an active orb of consumption takes\
  \ 1d2 points of Constitution damage and 1d2 points of Wisdom damage (a successful\
  \ DC 15 Will save negates this damage). The life energy and sanity consumed by the\
  \ orb grant the user a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma for 1 hour per point of\
  \ Constitution or Wisdom damage dealt. Additional uses do not increase the bonus\
  \ to Charisma but do increase the duration of the effect."
