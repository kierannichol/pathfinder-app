description: "Fetters are manacles fitted around the ankles rather than the wrists,\
  \ and use the same rules for breaking, escape, and cost relative to size. A creature\
  \ in fetters is entangled and can only move at half speed. In addition, a fettered\
  \ creature must succeed at a DC 15 Acrobatics check to move more than its (reduced)\
  \ speed in a round. If it fails the check by 5 or more, the creature falls prone."
