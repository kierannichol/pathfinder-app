name: "Scroll of Treasure Stitching"
description: "You can transform all objects placed on a cloth into an embroidered,\
  \ two-dimensional representation, making it easy for you to store and transport\
  \ the items. You can pile any amount or weight of objects on the cloth so long as\
  \ the pile stays within the dimensions of the cloth (up to a 10-foot cube). When\
  \ you cast the spell the entire pile disappears into the cloth, replaced by a highly\
  \ accurate, sewn picture of the pile from whatever angle you wish. The cloth retains\
  \ its normal weight and dimensions. You can restore the pile of objects at any time\
  \ as a full-round action by unfurling the cloth and ordering the spell to end, consuming\
  \ the cloth. Anyone else wishing to restore the objects must successfully dispel\
  \ your spell. If the cloth is destroyed or significantly damaged, all objects held\
  \ within the cloth are lost. This spell cannot affect artifacts or other sorts of\
  \ similarly unique objects."
