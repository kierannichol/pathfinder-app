description: "This round-bellied bottle contains a deep indigo liquid. Drinking this\
  \ liquid causes the imbiber's skin and organs to harden as a metallic sheen encases\
  \ her body. This imparts a +2 competence bonus to her natural armor and 5 temporary\
  \ hit points. This effect lasts 10 minutes. The first time the imbiber is in melee\
  \ combat during the duration, he can increase the competence bonus to +4 and gain\
  \ an additional 5 temporary hit points, but all of her movement speeds are halved\
  \ for the remainder of the duration."
