description: "This squat arrow has a large, bulbous metal tip that expands and flattens\
  \ in flight. If you hit a creature with a trip arrow, the arrow deals no damage\
  \ but performs a trip combat maneuver against the target with a Combat Maneuver\
  \ Bonus of +5. For the purpose of determining Combat Maneuver Bonuses or penalties\
  \ based on size, the arrow is treated as if it were the size of the creature it\
  \ was designed for."
