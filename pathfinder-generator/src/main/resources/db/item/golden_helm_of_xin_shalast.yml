description: "This ornate, crested helmet of gold is typical of those worn by palace\
  \ and household guards in and around Xin-Shalast. Topped with a brush of platinum\
  \ bristles and filigreed with silver around the rim and nose guard, the golden helm\
  \ is as much a display of wealth and status as it is a powerful magic tool. When\
  \ donning a golden helm of Xin-Shalast, the wearer takes on the appearance of a\
  \ masterfully sculpted golden statue. This change is purely cosmetic, except for\
  \ 10 minutes per day when the owner can activate the effects of an iron body spell.\
  \ The iron body effect can be activated as a free action."
