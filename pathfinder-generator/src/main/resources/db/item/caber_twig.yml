description: "Exquisitely carved from the very finest dark mahogany and polished to\
  \ a smooth sheen, this 4-inch-long stick feels surprisingly heavy for its size when\
  \ hefted in the palm. Three notches divide the twig into four 1-inch segments. Snapping\
  \ the twig at any notch is a swift action that creates smaller twigs of appropriate\
  \ sizes.\nThe first caber twigs were created not for combat applications but for\
  \ performances at tournaments or other festivities. When thrown, a length of caber\
  \ twig releases a thunderous crack and transforms into a massive log. For every\
  \ segment of twig used, this log measures 5 feet long and weighs 300 pounds. No\
  \ matter the length, the log created is always 2 feet in diameter. Only one length\
  \ can be thrown at a time. The dramatic expansion of a caber twig segment proved\
  \ a popular element of festivals throughout the Abendego coast before the advent\
  \ of the storm, in much the same way fireworks help accentuate celebrations elsewhere\
  \ in the world.\nThe thrower can toss a caber twig at a creature, object, or space\
  \ within 30 feet. The resulting log always lands upright upon the target. A targeted\
  \ creature must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex saving throw or be forced into an adjacent\
  \ space while taking an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 points per caber\
  \ twig length used.\nImmediately after striking its primary target, the log tilts\
  \ and crashes down in a direction of the thrower's choosing. All creatures within\
  \ a straight line that is the length of the log extending from the space of impact\
  \ must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex saving throw or take 2d6 points of bludgeoning\
  \ damage.\nOnce created, a caber twig log is permanent."
