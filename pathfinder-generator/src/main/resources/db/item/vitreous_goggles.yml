description: "This pair of clear crystal lenses allows the wearer to see the indistinct\
  \ shapes of living creatures moving below the surface of the earth. The wearer can\
  \ see any Medium or larger creatures within 60 feet as long as they are moving underground.\
  \ The wearer must have seen the creature aboveground within the past minute while\
  \ wearing the goggles to gain this benefit. Each subsequent round after the first\
  \ that the goggles are worn, the wearer has a cumulative 5% chance of immediately\
  \ going blind for 1d4 rounds. Once the goggles are removed, the wearer's eyes need\
  \ 1 hour to adjust before he or she can wear the goggles again."
