description: "The original crystalline starknife was the weapon of Nugloss, a powerful\
  \ priestess of Desna who fought for the Linnorm Kings during the Winter War. Made\
  \ of a crystal-like substance similar in appearance to ice but as hard as steel,\
  \ a crystalline starknife is a +2 starknife that deals +1d6 points of damage against\
  \ crystalline creatures, as the weapon's edges are particularly adept at shattering\
  \ and weakening such foes. When thrown in conditions of bright or normal light,\
  \ a crystalline starknife catches the light and creates a whirling disk of prismatic\
  \ color. A creature hit by a crystalline starknife thrown in such conditions becomes\
  \ dazzled for 1 roundâ€”or dazed for 1 round on a critical hit. A successful DC 14\
  \ Will save negates the dazzled or dazed condition. When thrown by a worshiper of\
  \ Desna, a crystalline starknife gains the returning weapon special ability."
