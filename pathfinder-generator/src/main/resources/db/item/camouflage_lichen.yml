description: "Though oreads with obviously stony features are rare, almost all oreads\
  \ have an essentially earthen quality to their skin that makes it perfect for cultivating\
  \ plant life. Where other races would be appalled at the thought of plants taking\
  \ root in their flesh, oreads see it as a natural and healthy extension of their\
  \ elemental nature. For this reason, oread herbalists developed several strains\
  \ of moss and lichen specifically adapted to grow on their bodies. Camouflage lichen\
  \ is the most common variety of these oread plants. It takes 1 minute to apply a\
  \ paste of camouflage lichen spores to the skin, and an additional 24 hours for\
  \ the fungus to sprout. After this time, the oread is covered in a thin green layer\
  \ of living plant matter, granting her a +4 bonus on Stealth checks made in green\
  \ forest and jungle environments. Red-orange and white varieties exist, providing\
  \ bonuses in appropriately colored environments (red-orange among autumn leaves\
  \ or in red deserts, white in snow, and so on). Camouflage lichen has a short lifespan;\
  \ it withers and dies 3 days after being applied, crumbling away into harmless powder.\
  \ This item only works on oreads and other creatures with rocklike bodies."
