description: "Loadstone studs line the straps of this ornate leather harness. When\
  \ worn by an eidolon, the bindings act as a dimensional safety harness, anchoring\
  \ the outsider to its current plane. Any time the eidolon would be forced to return\
  \ to its home plane (such as when it's reduced to negative hit points equal to its\
  \ Constitution score or when its master is rendered unconscious), it can expend\
  \ one use of its summoner's summon monster spelllike ability as a free action to\
  \ remain on the Material Plane for 1 round. The summoner does not need to be conscious\
  \ for the eidolon to use this ability, but he must be within 100 feet. If the summoner\
  \ is conscious, he can refuse to allow this expenditure (which means the eidolon\
  \ is forced back to its home plane).\nIf the condition that would have sent the\
  \ eidolon back to its home plane is still in effect after 1 round has passed, the\
  \ eidolon may expend another use of its master's summon monster spell-like ability;\
  \ otherwise it immediately returns to its home plane."
