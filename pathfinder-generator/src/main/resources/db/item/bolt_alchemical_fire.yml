description: "These carefully crafted wooden crossbow bolts have a hollow core filled\
  \ with alchemist's fire. On a hit, an alchemical fire bolt deals 1d4 points of fire\
  \ damage in addition to its normal damage. Alchemical fire bolts do not cause splash\
  \ damage, and they do not set targets on fire unless a target is particularly flammable."
