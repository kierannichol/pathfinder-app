description: "The following suit of armor is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nNormally found sized for Small humanoids, this\
  \ battered and rusted suit of +1 fire resistance full plate resists any attempts\
  \ to polish out its blemishes. When a critical hit is confirmed against the wearer\
  \ with a manufactured weapon, natural weapon, or unarmed strike, there is a 50%\
  \ chance that the armor negates the critical hit. Such a blow knocks the armor out\
  \ of alignment, giving it the broken condition until the wearer spends 1d4+1 minutes\
  \ refitting the pieces (or 1 minute if another person assists in the process). This\
  \ does not otherwise harm the armor. While out of alignment, the goblin plate cannot\
  \ negate critical hits. Broken armor provides only half the usual AC bonus (rounded\
  \ down), and any armor check penalty is doubled."
