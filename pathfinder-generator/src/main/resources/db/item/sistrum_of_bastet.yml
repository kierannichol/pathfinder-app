description: "The Sistrum of Bastet is a powerful artifact that, when used properly,\
  \ allows a bard to use her bardic performance ability to enhance the spells of a\
  \ divine spellcaster or conceal her true motives. Once per day, when the wielder\
  \ uses the Sistrum of Bastet as part of a bardic performance, she can inspire a\
  \ divine spellcaster within range of the performance and bolster the effects of\
  \ any spells that spellcaster casts. Thereafter, for the duration of the performance,\
  \ whenever the designated divine caster chooses to cast a spell, the bard can expend\
  \ 1 or more rounds of bardic performance as an immediate action to enhance her allied\
  \ divine spellcaster's spell as if that individual had prepared it with the Heighten\
  \ Spell Metamagic Feat. The number of levels by which the divine spell is heightened\
  \ is determined by the number of rounds of bardic performance sacrificed. For example,\
  \ if the sistrum's player sacrifices 2 rounds of bardic performance, the divine\
  \ caster's spell level increases by 2. A spell's level can never increase beyond\
  \ 9th level, and can't be higher than the divine caster can cast.\nSecond, a bard\
  \ wielding the Sistrum of Bastet can conceal the activity of casting a bard spell\
  \ by masking it in a performance. As a swift action, the bard can combine her casting\
  \ time for a spell with a Perform check. Observers must succeed at a Perception\
  \ or Sense Motive check opposed by the user's Perform check to realize she is also\
  \ casting a spell. This uses 1 round of her bardic performance ability, regardless\
  \ of the spell's casting time. In addition, a bard using the Sistrum of Bastet can\
  \ select a number of creatures equal to her level. The bard can deliver secret messages\
  \ to these individuals without needing to use the Bluff skill. The bard still must\
  \ be able to speak to deliver the message.\nFinally, when the wielder gains a bard\
  \ level and is able to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows, she\
  \ can choose a spell from the cleric spell list. This spell must be of the same\
  \ level as the spell that she is replacing, and the bard casts that spell as a divine\
  \ spell. If the Sistrum of Bastet ever leaves her possession for longer than 24\
  \ hours, any divine spells added in this way are lost unless she can reclaim the\
  \ instrument."
destruction: "The Sistrum of Bastet can be destroyed only if a serpent's coils crush\
  \ it after it has spent a year in complete darkness."
