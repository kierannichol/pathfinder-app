description: "This ring comes in four types: ring of spell knowledge I, ring of spell\
  \ knowledge II, ring of spell knowledge III, and ring of spell knowledge IV. All\
  \ of them are useful only to spontaneous arcane spellcasters. Through study, the\
  \ wearer can gain the knowledge of a single spell in addition to those allotted\
  \ by her class and level. A ring of spell knowledge I can hold 1st-level spells\
  \ only, a ring of spell knowledge II 1st- or 2nd-level spells, a ring of spell knowledge\
  \ III spells of 3rd level or lower, and a ring of spell knowledge IV up to 4th-level\
  \ spells.\nA ring of spell knowledge is only a storage space; the wearer must still\
  \ encounter a written, active, or cast version of the spell and succeed at a DC\
  \ 20 Spellcraft check to teach the spell to the ring. Thereafter, the arcane spellcaster\
  \ may cast the spell as though she knew the spell and it appeared on her class'\
  \ spell list.\nArcane spells that do not appear on the wearer's class list are treated\
  \ as one level higher for all purposes (storage and casting)."
