description: "This hinged pole can be unfolded and locked in place with sliding pins,\
  \ creating a 10-foot pole. When collapsed, it is only 3 feet long. Assembling or\
  \ collapsing the pole is a full-round action. The hinges and pins mean it is not\
  \ as strong as a one-piece pole, and is best used for probing rather than vaulting\
  \ or climbing."
