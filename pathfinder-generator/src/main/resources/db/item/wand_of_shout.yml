name: "Wand of Shout"
description: "You emit an ear-splitting yell that deafens and damages creatures in\
  \ its path. Any creature within the area is deafened for 2d6 rounds and takes 5d6\
  \ points of sonic damage. A successful save negates the deafness and reduces the\
  \ damage by half. Any exposed brittle or crystalline object or crystalline creature\
  \ takes 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). An affected\
  \ creature is allowed a Fortitude save to reduce the damage by half, and a creature\
  \ holding fragile objects can negate damage to them with a successful Reflex save.\
  \ A shout spell cannot penetrate a silence spell."
