description: "The plainly lacquered exterior of this wooden puzzle box cunningly hides\
  \ the devious clockwork mechanism inside. To those unversed in its abilities, Sun\
  \ Wukong's puzzle box seems to be little more than a frustratingly impossible child's\
  \ toy that is adorned with the holy symbol of the Monkey King.\nOnce per day as\
  \ a standard action, the user can unlock Sun Wukong's puzzle box to create two simultaneous\
  \ effects. First, a shower of golden sparks envelops the user, causing her to become\
  \ invisible and immediately teleporting her exactly 20 feet in a direction of her\
  \ choice. Second, a monkey swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 212) bursts from the\
  \ same square the user left.\nAlthough the monkey swarm isn't under the control\
  \ of the user, the monkeys keep at least 20 feet from the user at all times and\
  \ attempt to surround as many of her opponents as possible. This effect otherwise\
  \ acts as mad monkeys with a CMB of +12. Both the invisibility effect and the monkey\
  \ swarm last for 10 rounds."
