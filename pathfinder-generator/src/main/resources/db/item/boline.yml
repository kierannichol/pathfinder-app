description: "Bolines are hook-shaped knives commonly used by herbalists and spellcasters\
  \ to harvest ingredients for their craft. A boline's blade is typically 5 inches\
  \ long, and is too small and irregular to use as a weapon. You can use a boline\
  \ to finely slice the herbs in a healer's kit, so you can treat deadly wounds with\
  \ only a single use from a healer's kit rather than two uses."
