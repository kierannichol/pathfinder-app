description: "You create a fist-sized, red-hot ball of molten metal that you immediately\
  \ hurl as a splash weapon. A direct hit deals 2d6 points of fire damage. Every creature\
  \ within 5 feet of where the ball hits takes 1d6 points of fire damage from the\
  \ splash (Reflex half). Each of these creatures takes an additional 1d6 points of\
  \ fire damage on its turn for the next 1d3 rounds, unless it is cooled off (with\
  \ water, snow, or any effect that deals 5 or more points of cold damage)."
