description: "Darklands explorers who frequently run afoul of troglodytes, pockets\
  \ of natural gas, and toxic fumes from magma flows use this dense flask to ease\
  \ their breathing. You can open the flask as a standard action or throw it as a\
  \ splash weapon. When opened or broken, the flask releases a burst of cleansing,\
  \ breathable air in a 10-foot-radius burst, providing a +4 alchemical bonus on saving\
  \ throws against gases, inhaled poisons, or other breathable hazards. The cloud\
  \ of fresh air lasts for 1d4 rounds. If you hit a creature that has the stench ability\
  \ with a thrown flask of deep breath, the DC of its stench is reduced by 4 for the\
  \ duration of the cloud."
