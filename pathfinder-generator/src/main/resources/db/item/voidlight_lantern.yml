description: "This ornately designed lantern is crafted from volcanic glass. When\
  \ lit, the lantern's magic creates an area of darkness in a 20-foot radius and lowers\
  \ the illumination level by one step for an additional 20 feet beyond that area\
  \ (bright light becomes normal light, normal light becomes dim light, and dim light\
  \ becomes darkness). If used in an area of darkness, a voidlight lantern creates\
  \ an area of supernatural darkness (as per deeper darkness) in a 20-foot radius\
  \ instead."
