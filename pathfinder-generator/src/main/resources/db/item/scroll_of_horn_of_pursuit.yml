description: "You create the sound of a large hunting horn, blowing up to three notes\
  \ as loud as a roaring dragon. These notes can be heard up to 2 miles away in typical\
  \ outdoor conditions. You can make these sounds at any point during the spell's\
  \ duration as a free action, and each sounding can be short or long, allowing you\
  \ to send very simple coded messages."
