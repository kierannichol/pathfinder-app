description: "Made using the choicest, most malleable skin from a dragon's underbelly,\
  \ this specialized weapon grip can be added to any weapon with a hilt or handle.\
  \ Dragonskin grips may be added to an existing weapon, or incorporated into a new\
  \ weapon during crafting. The skin provides extra grip, granting the wielder a +2\
  \ bonus to CMD against disarm attempts.\nProducing a dragonskin grip requires the\
  \ Dragoncrafting feat and a successful DC 15 Craft (bows or weapons) check."
