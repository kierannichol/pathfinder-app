description: "This +1 paper alchemical cartridge contains a bullet and is marked with\
  \ a symbol of an ear. When fired from a firearm, a reporting cartridge allows the\
  \ wielder to temporarily transfer her sense of hearing to the location where the\
  \ bullet lands. Until she dismisses the effect by rubbing her ears as a move action,\
  \ the wielder can hear as clairaudience from the square in which the bullet landed,\
  \ regardless of whether it hit its mark."
