description: "This weapon usually appears to be a particularly frighteninglooking\
  \ iron or steel mace. On command, this +2 heavy mace causes the wielder's clothes\
  \ and appearance to transform into an illusion of darkest horror, such that living\
  \ creatures in a 30- foot cone become panicked as if by a fear spell (Will DC 16\
  \ partial). Those who fail this save take a â€“2 morale penalty on saving throws,\
  \ and they flee from the wielder. The wielder may use this ability up to three times\
  \ per day."
