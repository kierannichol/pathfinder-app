description: "This colorful, beaded mask bears floral patterns and attunes the wearer's\
  \ senses to flora of all varieties. The wearer gains a +3 competence bonus on Knowledge\
  \ (nature) checks relating to plants, seasons, or weather. The wearer can use a\
  \ command word to gain the effects of greensight, except that the wearer can freely\
  \ focus her vision to see through plant matter for any distance up to 60 feet (for\
  \ example, to examine the inner core of a reed) during the effect's duration. The\
  \ greensight ability can be used a total of 10 times; when these uses are expended,\
  \ the mask loses its magic and becomes a normal beaded mask. Most Tlil masks are\
  \ discovered with 1d10 uses of greensight remaining; reduce the price by 300 gp\
  \ for each expended use."
