description: "This henna-like paste creates a dark brown tattoo on the hands or feet\
  \ that fades over the next 2d6 days. The tattoo temporarily boosts the strength\
  \ of a vishkanya's natural poison, increasing the DC of the next weapon envenomed\
  \ with the vishkanya's blood or saliva by +2 (once used, the tattoo is merely decorative\
  \ and does not affect the creature's poison). A typical tattoo consists of intricate\
  \ whorls and spiritual symbols on the hands or feet."
