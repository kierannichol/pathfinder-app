description: "Craft DC 15 for hobgoblins.\nThis drink is a foul-smelling alchemical\
  \ blend of raw alcohol, mashed grubs, and medicinal mushrooms. A hobgoblin under\
  \ the effects of hobgoblin war draught ignores all penalties resulting from the\
  \ fatigued and shaken conditions for 10 minutes, after which he must succeed at\
  \ a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 hour. Anyone lacking the goblinoid\
  \ subtype who drinks hobgoblin war draught must immediately make a DC 15 Fortitude\
  \ save or be sickened for 1 hour; success means the drinker ignores all penalties\
  \ resulting from the fatigued and shaken conditions for 1 minute, after which he\
  \ is sickened for 10 minutes. Hobgoblin war draught has no effect on creatures that\
  \ are immune to poison."
