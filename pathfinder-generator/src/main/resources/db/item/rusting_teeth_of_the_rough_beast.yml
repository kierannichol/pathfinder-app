description: "This +1 greataxe has a corroded edge that constantly sheds metal shards\
  \ and rusty powder, though the blade never gets any smaller and this doesn't weaken\
  \ the weapon in any way. Whenever the axe damages a creature, the target must succeed\
  \ at a DC 14 Reflex save or a shard from the weapon lodges in the creature's flesh;\
  \ the target is sickened until the shard is removed. Removing a shard deals 1d4+1\
  \ points of damage to the target, unless whoever is removing the shard succeeds\
  \ at a DC 15 Heal check as a full-round action. For every 5 by which the check exceeds\
  \ the DC, an additional shard is removed. A rusting grasp spell immediately destroys\
  \ all shards embedded in the target."
