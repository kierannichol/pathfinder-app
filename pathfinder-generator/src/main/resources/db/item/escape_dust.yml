description: "When a handful of this coarse, crystalline powder is thrown at a single\
  \ creature, it circles around that creature and disrupts its ability to attack and\
  \ see. Using this dust requires a ranged touch attack by its user (with a range\
  \ increment of 5 feet), but doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity. On\
  \ a hit, the target is dazzled and cannot make attacks of opportunity or immediate\
  \ actions for 1 round."
