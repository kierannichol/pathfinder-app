description: "This multifaceted prism acts as an aid in concentration. It can be used\
  \ as a focus for the read aura occult skill unlock to reduce the time needed to\
  \ read an aura from 10 minutes to 5 minutes. When held by psychic creatures, a lens\
  \ of otherworldly answers emits light in a small area, increasing the light level\
  \ in a 10-foot-radius by one step (darkness becomes dim light, and dim light becomes\
  \ normal light). The lens cannot increase the light level above normal light. The\
  \ color of the light produced varies according to the psychic creature's predominant\
  \ emotional state at the time (Occult Adventures, 199), defaulting to soft white\
  \ light in the case of no significant emotional state.\nIn addition, the owner gains\
  \ special insight into questions asked and answers received from inscrutable planar\
  \ powers. When expended as an additional material component when casting contact\
  \ other plane (which causes the lens to crumble into valueless shards of crystal)\
  \ the owner can attempt a Charisma check, Intelligence check, or Wisdom check (instead\
  \ of being able to attempt only an Intelligence check) to avoid the Intelligence\
  \ and Charisma drain risked by the spell. In addition, the owner subtracts 1d10\
  \ from the percentage roll (to a minimum of 1) for determining whether a contacted\
  \ entity tells the truth, doesn't know, lies, or provides a random answer. If the\
  \ owner is on the same plane as the entity being contacted, she subtracts an additional\
  \ 1d10 from the percentage roll."
