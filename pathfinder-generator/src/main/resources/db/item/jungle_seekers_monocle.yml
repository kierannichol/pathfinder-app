description: "The lens of this classical monocle is made of carefully shaped Shory\
  \ glass. By looking through the lens, a wearer of a jungle seeker's monocle can\
  \ find hidden creatures even in the thickest of jungles. The wearer can use Perception\
  \ to detect the presence of other living creatures up to 3d6 ×10 feet away in any\
  \ forest, treating it as if it were a sparse forest (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook\
  \ 426). The monocle also grants a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks to notice\
  \ creatures using Stealth, regardless whether the wearer is in a forest or elsewhere."
