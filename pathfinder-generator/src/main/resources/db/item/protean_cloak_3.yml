description: "These multihued cloaks are as mutable as the proteans that inspired\
  \ them. The typical protean cloak appears to be crafted from the hide of a naunet\
  \ protean, but regardless of their apparent source, all protean cloaks shimmer and\
  \ flicker with a riot of color. While the material feels scaly and rugose to the\
  \ touch, a protean cloak flows like silk and does not hinder mobility.\nA protean\
  \ cloak provides a +1 to +5 resistance bonus on a single type of saving throw (typically\
  \ Will saving throws). Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can change\
  \ the type of saving throw that receives this bonus; the cloak then provides its\
  \ bonus on the new type of saving throw until its type is changed again. If a protean\
  \ cloak is unattended for more than 24 hours, the resistance bonus it applies automatically\
  \ reverts back to Will saves."
