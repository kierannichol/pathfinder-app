description: "Among Darklanders, the process of luring surface dwellers into danger\
  \ is known as \"deepbaiting.\" This practice is highly refined in kobold culture,\
  \ and requires a substantial amount of psychological subtlety. Many kobold trappers\
  \ use physical lures to draw victims into such ambushes. These lures are most often\
  \ replica items, chosen to appeal to the intended prey. Because kobolds have little\
  \ in-depth contact with the surface-dwelling world, their replicas lack detail,\
  \ and usually don't stand up to close inspection.\nFake Area Map: This faux-distressed\
  \ piece of parchment is a crude map of the local area, with red circles and arcane\
  \ gibberish scrawled on it. Intentionally made to look old and worn, it's actually\
  \ a simple piece of parchment that's been singed, crumpled, and rolled in the dirt.\
  \ Because the average kobold artisan's knowledge of Common is poor, any literate\
  \ creature within 5 feet can identify the map as a fake. However, beyond 5 feet,\
  \ a fake map requires a successful DC 25 Sense Motive check to identify it as phony.\n\
  Fake Coins: These rough-hewn discs of metal are covered in highly ref lective, gold-colored\
  \ plating, which catches the light and causes them to shimmer. At a distance greater\
  \ than 5 feet, fake coins require a DC 20 Sense Motive check to identify. However,\
  \ because these \"coins\" aren't molded and have no embellishment on either side,\
  \ any creature within 5 feet can clearly identify them as spurious."
