description: "A protective spiritis an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that hovers\
  \ about you, defending you against unexpected attacks. When a creature makes an\
  \ attack of opportunity against you, the protective spiritmakes an immediate attack\
  \ using your base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier. On a successful hit,\
  \ the spirit does no damage, but it causes the attack of opportunity to automatically\
  \ miss. A protective spiritcan defend against a number of attacks of opportunity\
  \ equal to your Dexterity bonus (minimum 1) per round."
