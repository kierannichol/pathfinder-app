description: "This flask of alchemical powder reacts to the elemental power in suli\
  \ blood. Adding at least 1 hit point worth of suli blood to it creates an alchemical\
  \ splash weapon. The splash weapon works like a flask of acid, except the damage\
  \ is a random energy type (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). A DC 10 Craft (alchemy)\
  \ check identifies what energy type the activated flask has. The activated flux\
  \ retains its power for 24 hours before becoming inert material. The Craft (alchemy)\
  \ DC to create this is 20."
