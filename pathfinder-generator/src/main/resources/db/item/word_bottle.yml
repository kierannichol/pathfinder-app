description: "This fragile glass flask encloses a single scrap of worn parchment held\
  \ in place by a taut metal wire threaded through its cork stopper. As a full-round\
  \ action, a spellcaster can cast a targeted language-dependant spell of 3rd level\
  \ or lower into the flask as a full round action, which covers the parchment with\
  \ magical writing and charges the flask with power. The flask cannot be used with\
  \ spells that have a casting time longer than 1 full round. Any of the spell's variables\
  \ that are determined by its caster (such as commands given to the spell's target)\
  \ are decided when the spell is cast into the bottle.\nThe charged flask can be\
  \ thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. The flask shatters\
  \ and is destroyed upon impact, releasing the stored spell. A creature struck by\
  \ the flask is subject to the effects of spell contained within, just as if it had\
  \ been the target of the spell. Creatures within 5 feet of the flask when it breaks\
  \ hear whispery echoes of the spell's words and are also subject to its effects,\
  \ though they receive a +5 bonus on their saves to resist the spell. If the spell\
  \ does not ordinarily allow a save, creatures caught in the splash radius may still\
  \ make a Will save to negate it (with the +5 bonus)."
