description: "This black metal urn with a lead stopper bears the image of countless\
  \ gaunt humanoids piled on top of one another in a torturous melee. When the stopper\
  \ is removed, an invisible and odorless gas pours from the bottle, covering a 50-foot-radius\
  \ area in 1 round. If the bottle is left open, the gas billows out another 10 feet\
  \ per round until it has covered a 100-foot radius. This area remains filled with\
  \ gas for 5 rounds, after which the gas dissipates naturally.\nEach round, a creature\
  \ within the area of the gas must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or attack the\
  \ nearest creature on its next turn. This condition lasts long as a creature is\
  \ in the cloud and for 1 round after it leaves the area or after the gas dissipates.\
  \ Any creature that succeeds at its save is not subject to the same gas again, whether\
  \ or not it remains within the area. This is a mind-affecting poison effect.\nA\
  \ moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the gas in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph)\
  \ disperses it in 1 round.\nOnce opened, a discord bottle must be restoppered and\
  \ recharge for 24 hours before it can be used again."
