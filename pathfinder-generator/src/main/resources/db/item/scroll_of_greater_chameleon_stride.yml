name: "Scroll of Greater Chameleon Stride"
description: "This spell functions as chameleon stride (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's\
  \ Guide 210), except it confers its bonuses upon all allies within 10 feet of you\
  \ at the time the spell is cast. Those affected by this spell are able to see each\
  \ other and themselves as if they were unaffected by the spell. If an affected creature\
  \ moves out of the area, it loses the benefit of the spell. Creatures that move\
  \ into the area after the spell is cast do not gain its benefit."
