description: "This alchemical fluid is viscous and clear, and it emits a strong chemical\
  \ smell when exposed to air. Vermin are attracted to it and perceive anything marked\
  \ with it as prey. Spiders, insects, and similar vermin gain a +5 bonus on Perception\
  \ checks and attack rolls against a creature marked with spiderdraw; if these creatures\
  \ have the scent ability, they can detect a marked creature at five times the normal\
  \ range, note its direction as a free action, and pinpoint it when it is within\
  \ 25 feet.\nDrow sometimes use spiderdraw as a contact poison or splash weapon against\
  \ opponents, allowing vermin to focus on the marked targets while the drow retreat,\
  \ regroup, or move to a more advantageous position. Washing off the spiderdraw is\
  \ a full-round action requiring at least a gallon of water or other suitable washing\
  \ liquid; otherwise, the effects last for 1 hour.\nCrafting spiderdraw requires\
  \ a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
