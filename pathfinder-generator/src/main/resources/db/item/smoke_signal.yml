description: "This alchemically fused powder ball creates a plume of brightly colored\
  \ smoke when lit. While the smoke is not thick enough to significantly impair vision,\
  \ it is clearly visible up to 1d6 miles away under average conditions, and may be\
  \ visible at greater distances in ideal conditions. Many desert clans use particular\
  \ signature colors of smoke to indicate their allegiance, or use smoke signals with\
  \ specific colors or in a pattern of sequential colors to convey coded messages."
