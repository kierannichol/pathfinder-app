description: "This stout, dense rod is always constructed of highly conductive metal,\
  \ shot through with weblike veins of white or yellow glass. While a creature holds\
  \ a conduit rod, she gains electricity resistance 5 as a constant effect as well\
  \ as a +1 bonus to her effective caster level when casting any spell with the electricity\
  \ descriptor.\nOnce per day as a free action, when the wielder of a conduit rod\
  \ casts a spell with the electricity descriptor, she can teleport anywhere that\
  \ spell's effect, but is otherwise unaffected by the spell."
