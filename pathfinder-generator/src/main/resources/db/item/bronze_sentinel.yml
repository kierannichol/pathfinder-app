description: "Built by a group of forgotten arcanists and researchers in a secret\
  \ outpost deep within the Osirian desert, the bronze sentinel is a magical vehicle\
  \ shaped as a 15-foot-tall bronze humanoid statue, crafted in the shape of a muscular\
  \ man wearing a silver headband that resembles two serpents twined together. When\
  \ the sentinel is active, its eyes shine with green light and a triangle of runes\
  \ on its chest glows silver.\nClose examination and a successful DC 25 Perception\
  \ check reveal a secret catch that opens a hatch in the statue's back. Anyone who\
  \ crawls inside finds seating for one Medium or Small occupant and eight unlabeled\
  \ levers and pedals. These controls allow a character inside to activate and control\
  \ the sentinel's movements and actions. Operating a lever is normally a move action,\
  \ but operating the lever to extend or retract the sentinel's arms (such as to attack)\
  \ is a standard action. No lever can be operated more than once per round.\n"
