description: "Belimarius's spellbook holds an infinite number of pages to inscribe\
  \ spells upon. Any wizard who prepares spells from a Sihedron Tome can prepare bonus\
  \ spells as if her Intelligence were 6 points higher. This is not an actual bonus\
  \ to Intelligence and grants the user no additional benefit. Belimarius's Sihedron\
  \ Tome contains all sorcerer/wizard spells (save for those of the schools of evocation\
  \ and necromancy) found in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook as well as those she\
  \ has prepared. At the GM's discretion, it could certainly hold more spells."
destruction: "A special 9th-level spell must be designed that exists only to destroy\
  \ the specific and particular Sihedron Tome into which it is inscribed. This spell,\
  \ which has numerous expensive and rare material components, must then be cast on\
  \ the Sihedron Tome by its owner."
