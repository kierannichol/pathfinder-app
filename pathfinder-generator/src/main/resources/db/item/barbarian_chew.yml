description: "The Shoanti of the Cinderlands combine lime, crimson galtroot leaves,\
  \ and some say horse blood to create this invigorating chew. Aside from staining\
  \ the teeth a bloody shade, barbarian chew causes the user to feel stronger, but\
  \ also angrier. One use of barbarian chew grants a barbarian +1 additional round\
  \ of rage. This additional round is used first when a barbarian begins raging. If\
  \ a barbarian does not rage within 1 hour of using the chew, this additional round\
  \ of rage is lost. This benefit can be gained only once per day; consuming multiple\
  \ doses in a 24-hour period has no additional effects. Barbarian chew can be created\
  \ with a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
