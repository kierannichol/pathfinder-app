description: "This long tapering pennant resembles a stylized serpentine figure wearing\
  \ a shimmering crown. The figure's claws function as clasps, attaching it to a lance,\
  \ polearm, frame, or staff. The pennant has no effect when not mounted properly,\
  \ or when activated by a lawfully aligned creature.\nPlanting the pennant in the\
  \ ground generates an area of twisted space around the flag out to a range of 30\
  \ feet. Any creature that teleports into or out of this area is nauseated for 1\
  \ round (a DC 18 Fortitude save reduces this penalty to sickened). Any creature\
  \ may end the effect by uprooting the pennant as a standard action. The pennant\
  \ functions for 10 rounds per day. These rounds do not need to be consecutive."
