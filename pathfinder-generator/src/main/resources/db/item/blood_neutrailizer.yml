description: "When you release this vial of alchemical particles into the water as\
  \ a standard action, the particles immediately neutralize the scent of exposed blood\
  \ within 20 feet, rendering the blood undetectable by scent (to a hunting shark,\
  \ for example). Blood neutralizer has no effect on any blood that enters the area\
  \ after the particles have been used. Blood neutralizer can be crafted with a successful\
  \ DC 25 Craft (alchemy) skill check."
