description: "This weapon consists of a long wooden shaft with protruding handles\
  \ and a sharp curved blade set at a right angle. Derived from a farm tool used to\
  \ mow down crops, a scythe requires two hands to use, and is unwieldy but capable\
  \ of inflicting grievous wounds. Its connotations as a symbol of death due to its\
  \ association with reaping also make the scythe a particularly intimidating weapon."
