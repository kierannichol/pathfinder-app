name: "Potion of River of Wind"
description: "Summoning up the power of the tempest, you direct a current of forceful\
  \ winds where you please. This spell creates a 5-foot-diameter line of wind--the\
  \ direction of the wind is away from your location when you cast the spell, and\
  \ remains constant in that direction for the spell duration. Creatures caught in\
  \ a river of windtake 4d6 nonlethal damage and are knocked prone. A successful Fortitude\
  \ save halves the damage and prevents being knocked prone."
