description: "This flowing, black silken cloak glitters with an iridescent sheen like\
  \ the feathers of a crow's wing. When the wearer moves, the fabric seems to dance\
  \ on the air, as though it longed to take flight. The wearer can speak with birds\
  \ while wearing the cloak, as if under the effects of speak with animals. Druids\
  \ of northern Avistan have long favored these cloaks as a means of communicating\
  \ with birds of the region, but they grew increasingly popular among several sects\
  \ in Lirgen as well in the decades leading up to the Age of Lost Omensâ€” despite\
  \ the fact that crows themselves are not native to that particular land. Certainly,\
  \ the exotic nature of the ebon feathers had an aesthetic appeal, for in a land\
  \ where brightly colored songbirds were the norm, the concept of a midnight black\
  \ avian couldn't help but to be somewhat intriguing to the residents.\nAs a move\
  \ action, the wearer of a crow brother's cloak can command the item to dissolve\
  \ into a swirling murder of crows, which faithfully surround the wearer for up to\
  \ 13 rounds per day. These rounds need not be consecutive. The murder of crows functions\
  \ as a bat swarm. The murder of crows deals no damage to the wearer and provides\
  \ concealment as long as the wearer remains within it. As a free action, the wearer\
  \ can recall the swarm into cloak form or issue it a simple command (such as to\
  \ direct its movement or to instruct it to follow the wearer). If the swarm is reduced\
  \ to 0 hit points, it returns to its cloak form immediately and cannot be transformed\
  \ again for 24 hours."
