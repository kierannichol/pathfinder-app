name: "Potion of Mending"
description: "This spell repairs damaged objects, restoring 1d4 hit points to the\
  \ object. If the object has the broken condition, this condition is removed if the\
  \ object is restored to at least half its original hit points. All of the pieces\
  \ of an object must be present for this spell to function. Magic items can be repaired\
  \ by this spell, but you must have a caster level equal to or higher than that of\
  \ the object. Magic items that are destroyed (at 0 hit points or less) can be repaired\
  \ with this spell, but this spell does not restore their magic abilities. This spell\
  \ does not affect creatures (including constructs). This spell has no effect on\
  \ objects that have been warped or otherwise transmuted, but it can still repair\
  \ damage done to such items."
