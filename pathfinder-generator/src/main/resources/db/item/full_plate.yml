description: "This metal suit comprises multiple pieces of interconnected and overlaying\
  \ metal plates, incorporating the benefits of numerous types of lesser armor. A\
  \ complete suit of full plate (or platemail, as it is often called) includes gauntlets,\
  \ heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and a thick layer of padding that is worn\
  \ underneath the armor. Each suit of full plate must be individually fitted to its\
  \ owner by a master armorsmith, although a captured suit can be resized to fit a\
  \ new owner at a cost of 200 to 800 (2d4 100) gold pieces."
