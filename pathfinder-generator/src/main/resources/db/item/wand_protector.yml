description: "This lacquered wooden tube is designed to protect a wand during transportation.\
  \ When held in an off hand, the wielder can safely cast spells from her wand without\
  \ chance of incurring a primal magic event (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea\
  \ Magic 13). A wand protector can be used only in conjunction with wands casting\
  \ spells that require a standard action or shorter. Once the wand protector has\
  \ prevented 10 primal magic events, it crumbles into dust."
