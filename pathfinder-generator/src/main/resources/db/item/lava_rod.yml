description: "This irregularly shaped iron rod is studded with orange gems. It can\
  \ be wielded as a +2 club. For 10 rounds per day, the rod can be wielded as a +2\
  \ flaming burst club. These rounds need not be consecutive. Additionally, three\
  \ times per day as a standard action, a creature wielding this rod can use it to\
  \ spray a 30-foot cone of lava droplets that deals 13d6 points of fire damage (Reflex\
  \ DC 20 half). Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can instead release\
  \ a cone of harmless pebbles that fall to the ground and cover the area. These pebbles\
  \ transform into tiny blobs of lava up to 5 rounds later. The user determines the\
  \ round upon which the pebbles transform into lava when initially activating the\
  \ rod for this effect. Any creature in the area of the pebbles when they transform\
  \ takes 13d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 20 half)."
