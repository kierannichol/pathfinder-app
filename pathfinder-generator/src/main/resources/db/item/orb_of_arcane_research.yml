description: "Made of a glassy, translucent substance, this orb swirls with the eldritch\
  \ energy of spellcasters long departed. When the bearer researches a spell to create\
  \ a new spell or learn an existing one from another source (see Chapter 9 of the\
  \ Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook), this orb provides a +2 competence bonus on Spellcraft\
  \ checks.\nAdditionally, when the command word is spoken, an orb of arcane research\
  \ allows its bearer to gain a +5 insight bonus on a Craft (alchemy), Knowledge (arcana),\
  \ Knowledge (nature), or Spellcraft check made to research a spell or extract formula\
  \ (see page 86 of Ultimate Campaign). The orb can be used five times in this way\
  \ before the item cracks, losing all of its magical properties and reverting to\
  \ a piece of mundane glass."
