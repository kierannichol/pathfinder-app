description: "The front of this buckler is fitted with a small, double-barreled gun\
  \ that can be shot while wearing the buckler. Unlike with a double-barreled pistol,\
  \ you can shoot only one barrel at a time. You must remove the buckler to reload\
  \ the gun. Each barrel of a buckler gun uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black\
  \ powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. Because of its awkward\
  \ construction, a buckler gun is always considered an off-handed weapon. This is\
  \ an early firearm."
