description: "The overlapping leather plates of this +2 lamellar cuirass (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Ultimate Equipment 12) oddly feel more like insect chitin than the supple\
  \ leather they are crafted from. This armor's lightweight construction gives it\
  \ a maximum Dexterity bonus of +6.\nThe wearer of a locust cuirass can take 10 on\
  \ Acrobatics checks to jump even if distracted or in danger. Once per day as an\
  \ immediate action, the wearer can summon a swarm of locusts that surround her and\
  \ support her weight during a fall, causing her to drift slowly down to the ground,\
  \ similar to feather fall. While falling, the wearer can move up to 5 feet in any\
  \ horizontal direction for every 1 foot she falls, at a speed of 60 feet per round.\
  \ The wearer takes no damage upon landing. The effect ends as soon as the wearer\
  \ touches the ground or after 6 rounds, whichever comes first. If the effect expires\
  \ while the wearer is still in the air, she falls the remaining distance as normal."
