description: "This exquisitely forged katana is the result of painstaking attention\
  \ and craftsmanship by one who is dedicated to mastering swordplay in its highest\
  \ form.\nA blade of the sword-saint is a +3 ki intensifying katana. In the hands\
  \ of a monk, it becomes an instrument of deadly utility. In addition to its more\
  \ common properties, this weapon can be employed as though the wielder were unarmed:\
  \ the wielder benefits from feats such as Deflect Arrows or Snatch Arrows (although\
  \ he can redirect attacks but not catch them if he has no hands free), and a monk\
  \ treats the blade as a monk weapon for use in his flurry of blows."
