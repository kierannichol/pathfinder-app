description: "These small rubber cones attach to a creature's fangs and allow it to\
  \ potentially poison those it bites. Poison caps must be filled with an injury poison\
  \ (see pages 557â€“560 of the Core Rulebook), and must be attached to a creature's\
  \ teeth prior to use. A creature equipped with poison caps deals bite damage as\
  \ a creature one size smaller than usual, but the next time the creature makes a\
  \ successful bite attack, it also injects the poison from the caps into its target.\
  \ The price and weight listed above are for a pair of poison caps; both must be\
  \ used simultaneously in order to be effective. A pair of poison caps can only be\
  \ used once; they are effectively destroyed after a successful bite attack. The\
  \ cost of the poison is not included in the cost of the poison caps."
