description: "This folding umbrella is translucent and not waterproof. It cuts down\
  \ on the heat from direct sunlight. In very hot conditions where the sun is a factor\
  \ (such as a desert), it gives you a +1 circumstance bonus on your hourly Fortitude\
  \ saves against heat, and reduces the damage from a failed save by 1 hit point (minimum\
  \ 1). It provides insufficient protection in conditions of severe or extreme heat.\
  \ You must hold a parasol in one hand and use it to shade yourself from the sun.\
  \ Alternatively, you can hold the parasol and use it to shade another creature of\
  \ your size or smaller. The listed price is for a simple, functional parasol made\
  \ of fabric or lacquered paper. A parasol used as a fashion accessory can be far\
  \ more expensive, depending on the materials used, and can cost from 1 gp to 10\
  \ gp. Umbrella: An umbrella is a heavier, waterproof parasol made of oiled or waxed\
  \ cloth. It is intended to keep you dry in the rain or snow, but can still protect\
  \ against sunlight just like a standard parasol."
