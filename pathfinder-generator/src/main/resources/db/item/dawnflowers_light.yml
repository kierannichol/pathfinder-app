description: "When lit, this hooded lantern shines brightly in a 60-foot radius, as\
  \ daylight. Once per day as a swift action, if the owner worships Sarenrae or is\
  \ a good-aligned divine spellcaster, she can intensify the lantern's light for 1\
  \ hour. This intensified light dazzles evil outsiders and undead in the area, and\
  \ evil incorporeal creatures take 75% damage from magical attacks instead of 50%.\
  \ If an illuminated creature or object has a mark indicating evil allegiance—such\
  \ as a demoniac's demonic mark (see page 46 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lords\
  \ of Chaos, Book of the Damned, Vol. 2)—that mark glow brilliantly, shining through\
  \ anything short of magical concealments."
