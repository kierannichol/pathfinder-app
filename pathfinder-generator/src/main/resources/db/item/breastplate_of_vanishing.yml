description: "This battered +1 mithral breastplate bears a resemblance to a stylized\
  \ turtle shell. On command, its wearer can vanish inside the armor, leaving the\
  \ breastplate behind while she stays safely hidden in an extradimensional space.\
  \ This space is barely large enough for the wearer to sit comfortably, but does\
  \ provides breathable air and light to see by. The wearer cannot perceive the environs\
  \ around the armor while inside. A second command word returns the wearer to the\
  \ armor's location, wearing the armor. If the wearer can't return to the space the\
  \ armor is in, she is instead shunted to the nearest empty space that can contain\
  \ her, but no longer wearing the armor.\nIf the breastplate is destroyed, the wearer\
  \ immediately returns to the square the armor was in when it was destroyed. Successfully\
  \ dispelling the armor likewise returns the wearer, though in this case still wearing\
  \ the armor."
