description: "This stone jar, capped with the head of an animal or human, resembles\
  \ one of the traditional carved limestone or pottery canopic jars commonly used\
  \ to hold the intestines, liver, lungs, and stomach of the deceased in Osirian mummification\
  \ rites. Unlike normal canopic jars, a canopic jar of unlife is used to preserve\
  \ the existence of a powerful undead creature. When a corporeal undead creature\
  \ is first created, one of its organs must be placed inside the canopic jar of unlife\
  \ as part of the ritual that transforms the creature into an undead being. Thereafter,\
  \ the undead creature's existence is linked to the canopic jar of unlife.\nIf the\
  \ undead creature is destroyed, the canopic jar of unlife disintegrates 2 hours\
  \ later, and the viscera within the jar start to regenerate into a new undead body\
  \ for the subject at a rate of 10 hit points per hour. The subject is helpless until\
  \ restored to full hit points. Once used to regenerate an undead creature, a canopic\
  \ jar of unlife is destroyed. If the jar is opened manually after viscera are secured\
  \ in it, the contents disintegrate with an ear-piercing scream and the jar loses\
  \ all magical power. Smashing the jar (hardness 8, hp 20) also destroys the vessel\
  \ and the viscera within.\nA canopic jar of unlife only functions if linked to an\
  \ undead creature during its creation; existing undead creatures or creatures with\
  \ phylacteries (such as liches) or with the rejuvenation ability (such as mummy\
  \ lords) cannot make use of a canopic jar of unlife."
