description: "This dark purple mask is contorted and twisted, and it covers the top\
  \ half of the wearer's face in swirls of thick brocade and lace. Dappled across\
  \ the mask's swaths are dozens of twinkling amethysts. This mask grants the wearer\
  \ the ability to transform into a poisonous gaseous form once per day, as per the\
  \ spell miasmatic form. This transformation lasts for 5 minutes, at which point\
  \ the wearer immediately turns back into her original form. If the wearer reverts\
  \ to her original form in a space that would not normally accommodate her body,\
  \ she is shunted to the nearest such open space. Activating this mask is a standard\
  \ action that provokes attacks of opportunity."
