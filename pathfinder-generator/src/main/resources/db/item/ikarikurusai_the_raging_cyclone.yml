description: "Ikarikurusai is an ornate +3 shock sansetsukon (Ultimate Combat 134)\
  \ that automatically resizes itself to match the size of its wielder. The chains\
  \ joining the segments of this three-section staff crackle with arcs of electricity,\
  \ and while held in at least one hand, the weapon acts as a lightning rod, drawing\
  \ away incoming electrical attacks and granting its wielder electricity resistance\
  \ 10. Upon striking a successful critical hit, Ikarikurusai explodes with electricity.\
  \ In addition to the electricity damage from the shock ability, the target of the\
  \ attack is struck by a stroke of lightning, which then arcs to other targets, as\
  \ chain lightning. The bolt deals 5d6 points of electricity damage to the primary\
  \ target (Reflex DC 19 for half damage). After it strikes, the lightning can arc\
  \ to up to five secondary targets within 30 feet of the primary target. The secondary\
  \ bolts each strike one target and deal as much damage as the primary bolt (Reflex\
  \ DC 17 for half damage). The chain lightning effect only triggers on the first\
  \ critical hit confirmed in a round, regardless of how many critical hits are made\
  \ by the weapon that round."
