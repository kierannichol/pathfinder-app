description: "This twisted and charred hunk of metal resembles a blacksmith apprentice's\
  \ failed work. It bears numerous sharp hooks and barbs. Rather than being suspended\
  \ from a cord or chain, it grips directly onto the wearer's chest with a life of\
  \ its own. When the item attaches, the user permanently loses 1 hit point and gains\
  \ a +10 circumstance bonus to resist any attempts to steal the pain ward of the\
  \ ostiarius and to the DC of other attempts to remove it (such as with Sleight of\
  \ Hand). Once attached, this item can act as an unholy symbol for any evil deity\
  \ and reshapes itself to match the symbol of an evil deity the wearer worships.\
  \ If the unholy symbol is removed from the wearer, he takes 1d8 points of damage\
  \ and 1 point of Constitution damage.\nThe pain ward of the ostiariu grants an evil\
  \ wearer a +4 profane bonus on any saving throws against spells and abilities with\
  \ the pain descriptor. Once per day, the wearer can channel his pain into negative\
  \ energy and inflict it on an unwilling victim. This is a touch attack that deals\
  \ 1d8+5 points of negative energy damage and sickens the victim for 1d4 rounds.\
  \ A successful DC 11 Fortitude saving throw halves the damage and negates the sicken\
  \ effect."
