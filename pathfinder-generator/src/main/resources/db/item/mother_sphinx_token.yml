description: "This wooden disk bears the image of a mother-sphinx, a symbol of Absalom\
  \ that epitomizes knowledge and arcane power, brought by Osirian families in the\
  \ city's early years. Once per day, the user can designate an enemy within 100 feet\
  \ and speak a command word. When she does, any spells she casts in the next 2 rounds\
  \ that target the designated enemy are affected as if she were under the effects\
  \ of an arcane concordance spell."
