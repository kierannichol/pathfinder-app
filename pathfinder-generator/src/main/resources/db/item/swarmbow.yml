description: "This +2 composite shortbow is carved of withered juniper wood to resemble\
  \ a swarming mass of wasps. Favored by the mystical bee-people called the thriae,\
  \ a swarmbow has a considerable draw, requiring a minimum Strength modifier of +5\
  \ to use it without penalty. Once per day on a successful strike with an arrow fired\
  \ from a swarmbow, the wielder can cause a wasp swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 275)\
  \ to appear around the target of the attack as an immediate action. The swarm attacks\
  \ any creatures occupying its area, but remains stationary and does not pursue fleeing\
  \ creatures. The wasp swarm remains for 1d4+2 rounds or until destroyed."
