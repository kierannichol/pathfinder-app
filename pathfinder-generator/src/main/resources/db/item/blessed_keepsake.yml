description: "The fine chain bears a glass-fronted locket. If a piece of an outsider\
  \ with an alignment subtype—such as a tooth from a demon or an angel's wing feather—\
  is held in the locket for 24 hours, the blessed keepsake's magic activates. If the\
  \ creature has more than one alignment subtype, one must be chosen when the piece\
  \ is added to the locket.\nThe wearer can detect creatures of the chosen alignment\
  \ at will, as the corresponding detect chaos/evil/good/law spell. Three times per\
  \ day, the wearer can use the blessed keepsake to gain protection from creatures\
  \ of that alignment, as the corresponding protection from chaos/evil/good/law spell.\
  \ Lastly, if the wearer has the channel energy ability, she can channel energy to\
  \ affect outsiders with that subtype as if she possessed the Alignment Channel feat.\n\
  If the piece of outsider is removed, the blessed keepsake is inactive until a new\
  \ piece is attuned."
