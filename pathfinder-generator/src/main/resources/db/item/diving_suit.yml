description: "This one-piece suit of clothing reduces one's drag in the water, making\
  \ swimming easier. It provides a +1 circumstance bonus on Swim checks. The suit\
  \ only grants this bonus if it is the outermost garment, and has no effect if worn\
  \ over bulky clothes or armor or with cumbersome gear (such as a backpack, large\
  \ weapons, and so on). Damage to the suit (such as from several rounds of combat\
  \ against slashing and piercing attacks) negates the suit's bonus until it is repaired."
