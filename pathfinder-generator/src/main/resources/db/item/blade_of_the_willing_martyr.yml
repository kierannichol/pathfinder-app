description: "Even the Pathfinders cannot say which tale of this item's origins is\
  \ true; it may have been made from a piece of the Pact Stone, carried by Norgorber\
  \ as he achieved apotheosis, or forged in the depths of Orv and quenched in its\
  \ maker's heartblood. This silver slender athame is deceptively plain, but has a\
  \ treacherous past. It has been credited with deeds as noble as ending the life\
  \ of the annis witch Traxyla of the Eye of Law (slain even as the blade's owner\
  \ Ioella was beheaded by Madame Margaery) and as petty as the murder of Karian (loving\
  \ mother and priestess of Sarenrae) by her estranged and vengeful husband.\nThe\
  \ blade of the willing martyr is a +3 keen vicious dagger, but its greatest power\
  \ can only be invoked outside of battle. To activate this power you must spill your\
  \ blood on your target, an object belonging to the target, or a physical token of\
  \ the target's body (such as a few strands of hair). Your target gets a DC 23 Will\
  \ save (using the same saving throw modifiers as the scrying spell for the owner's\
  \ knowledge and connection to the victim) to avoid the effect, which forges a link\
  \ between you and the target.\nOnce you forge a link, your soul and the target's\
  \ soul are intertwined. Should you die, your target dies, suffering the same apparent\
  \ injuries and symptoms; likewise, you die if your target dies. The link may only\
  \ be severed by break enchantment or remove curse."
