description: "The inside of this long, thick shawl is cool muslin, while the outside\
  \ is decorated with a flame-like rune. Hearth mantles are favored by the faithful\
  \ of Erastil, particularly those among his worshipers who rely upon the hunt for\
  \ their livelihood. With a hearth mantle, one never has to worry about building\
  \ a campfire in the wild.\nA hearth mantle's wearer gains a +2 competence bonus\
  \ on saving throws against fire-based effects; the mantle itself is immune to fire\
  \ damage. Once per day, the wearer can cause the leather exterior of the mantle\
  \ to smolder for 1 minute. While smoldering, the hearth mantle sheds light as a\
  \ torch.\nIf the user takes a full-round action to carefully spread a hearth mantle\
  \ on the ground with its exterior facing up, a campfire ignites on the mantle's\
  \ fire rune. This campfire burns for 8 hours and requires no fuel. Any creature\
  \ that sleeps within 20 feet of the mantle for the full duration of the campfire\
  \ recovers a number of hit points equal to twice its character level, as if it had\
  \ undergone complete bed rest for a full 24 hours. The campfire is automatically\
  \ extinguished if the hearth mantle is picked up, but can also be extinguished through\
  \ normal means."
