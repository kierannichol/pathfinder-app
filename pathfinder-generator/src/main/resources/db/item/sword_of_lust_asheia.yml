description: "This beautiful blade is a +5 flaming longsword. While bearing the weapon,\
  \ the wielder is immune to all enchantment effects. Any creature that casts an enchantment\
  \ spell upon Asheia's wielder is led to believe its spell or effect worked as normal\
  \ and that the sword's bearer is under its control, allowing the wielder to deceive\
  \ his opponent if he so chooses (and doesn't give his enemy a reason to believe\
  \ its magic failed). Whenever Asheia strikes an opponent, the target must succeed\
  \ at a DC 20 Will save or fall under the effects of a charm monster spell. Only\
  \ one creature can be charmed in this way at a time. If another creature becomes\
  \ charmed by the sword, the first is freed from this effect. If the sword instead\
  \ scores a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be affected\
  \ by a dominate monster spell.\nDormancy The Alara'hai were crafted to serve the\
  \ runelords of Thassilon. In modern times, however, these runelords lie dead or\
  \ dormant. With no lords to serve, the weapons of their champions lie dormant as\
  \ well, reducing each to a +2 weapon with the noted weapon special abilities (those\
  \ detailed on page 469 of the Core Rulebook) but no other properties. The only way\
  \ to awaken one of the blades is to restore its runelord master to active life or\
  \ have some other legitimate ruler take up its master's mantle (the weapon determines\
  \ what is considered legitimate). The swords can detect such restorations and f\
  \ lare to full power immediately, demanding their wielder seek out the restored\
  \ runelord and swear eternal fealty."
destruction: "Each of the Seven Swords of Sin can be destroyed merely if commanded\
  \ to break. That command, however, must come from the rightful runelord of the nation\
  \ and school of magic associated with the blade."
