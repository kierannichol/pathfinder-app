description: "Smuggler's slings are favored in Chu Ye, where they are employed by\
  \ freedom fighters sneaking contraband weapons past oni slave masters. The wielder\
  \ of this +1 sling gains a +5 competence bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal\
  \ the sling. Up to five times per day, the wearer can load the sling with a conjured\
  \ bullet as a swift action. A conjured bullet counts as magical for the purposes\
  \ of overcoming damage reduction and attacking incorporeal creatures, but is otherwise\
  \ a standard sling bullet. This bullet must be fired by the end of the round or\
  \ it vanishes."
