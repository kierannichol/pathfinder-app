description: "These amber lenses are shaped to look like the eyes of a cat. As a standard\
  \ action, the wearer can use these lenses to target a single creature that he can\
  \ see. When he does, as long as the target is not already the subject of the wearer's\
  \ studied target class feature, the wearer gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge,\
  \ Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against that creature, along with\
  \ a +1 bonus on weapon attack rolls and damage rolls against it as if he had the\
  \ studied target class feature.\nIf the wearer has the studied target class feature,\
  \ he can instead use the magic of these lenses as a free action when designating\
  \ the subject of his studied target to increase his effective slayer level by 5\
  \ for the purposes of the studied target class feature.\nThe wearer can gain these\
  \ effects for up to 10 rounds per day, but the rounds don't need to be consecutive."
