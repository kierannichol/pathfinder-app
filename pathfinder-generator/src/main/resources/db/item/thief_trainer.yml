description: "This small box is covered with varying gears, locks, panels, and other\
  \ mechanisms. Thieves practice their mechanical skills by attempting to undo or\
  \ unlock the various mechanisms to reach the box's center. The mechanisms shift\
  \ and rearrange, allowing for a multitude of combinations to keep the box from opening.\
  \ Once unlocked, the box resets itself and provides a reordered set of mechanisms,\
  \ starting the process over. Using a thief trainer to improve your skills requires\
  \ 1 hour and a DC 25 Disable Device check. If you succeed at the check, you reduce\
  \ the time required to complete a Disable Device check by 2 rounds (minimum 1 round).\
  \ This bonus lasts for 24 hours."
