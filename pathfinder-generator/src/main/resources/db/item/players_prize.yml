description: "This tiny copper statue of a featureless, dancing humanoid is sometimes\
  \ awarded to the winners of contests at Pitax's Academy of Grand Arts. The power\
  \ of a player's prize comes not from possessing it, however, but from giving it\
  \ to an unsuspecting audience member. By inscribing a personal rune on his player's\
  \ prize, a bard can cause whoever carries the item (knowingly or not) to be more\
  \ susceptible to his bardic performances. Once inscribed, a player's prize can not\
  \ be keyed to any other creature. Devious bards use Sleight of Hand to drop their\
  \ player's prize on rivals' or foes' persons, usually in a backpack or in among\
  \ other gear where it would be difficult to locate.\nA creature carrying a player's\
  \ prize keyed to a bard within 30 feet takes a –2 penalty on Will saves against\
  \ that bard's bardic performances, as well as a –2 penalty on opposed skill checks\
  \ against any skill checks the bard attempts using his versatile performance class\
  \ feature. These penalties remain as long as the affected creature continues to\
  \ carry the player's prize.\nOnce per day as an immediate action, the character\
  \ whose personal rune is inscribed on the player's prize can speak the item's command\
  \ word to cause the statue to instantly appear in his hand. The character must be\
  \ within 30 feet of the player's prize to activate this ability."
