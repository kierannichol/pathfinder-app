name: "Potion of Knock"
description: "Knock opens stuck, barred, or locked doors, as well as those subject\
  \ to hold portal or arcane lock. When you complete the casting of this spell, make\
  \ a caster level check against the DC of the lock with a +10 bonus. If successful,\
  \ knock opens up to two means of closure. This spell opens secret doors, as well\
  \ as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or\
  \ chains (provided they serve to hold something shut). If used to open an arcane\
  \ locked door, the spell does not remove the arcane lock but simply suspends its\
  \ functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself\
  \ or become stuck again on its own. Knock does not raise barred gates or similar\
  \ impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like.\
  \ The effect is limited by the area. Each casting can undo as many as two means\
  \ of preventing access."
