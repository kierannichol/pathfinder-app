description: "This medallion hangs on a leather cord, a silver disc inscribed with\
  \ the Sihedron. These medallions were given to favored agents of the runelords;\
  \ the medallions granted some minor benefits to the wearers, but also allowed the\
  \ runelords to use the wearer as proxies. By concentrating on a scrying device (such\
  \ as a runewell), a runelord can sense the world through the Sihedron medallion\
  \ wearer's senses, and could speak through her voice—provided the runelord knows\
  \ of the existence of the medallion and the fact that it is being worn. Thus, Karzoug\
  \ cannot use the medallion while it's worn by Nualia in Chapter One, as she is unknown\
  \ to him, but once the PCs come to his attention later in the campaign, that may\
  \ well change. See page 324 for more details on the ramifications of wearing a Sihedron\
  \ medallion in Xin-Shalast.\nWhile worn, a Sihedron medallion grants its wearer\
  \ a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. Once per day, as a free action, it\
  \ may be commanded to bestow the effects of false life on the wearer. Placed on\
  \ the neck of a dead body, a Sihedron medallion preserves the body indefinitely\
  \ via a gentle repose effect."
