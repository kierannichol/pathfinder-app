description: "This flask is filled with the detritus of minor ectoplasmic phantoms\
  \ and similar creatures. You can throw a flask of ectoplasmic residue as a splash\
  \ weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10\
  \ feet. A direct hit deals no damage, but the target must succeed at a DC 13 Will\
  \ save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where\
  \ the flask hits must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be shaken for 1 round. This\
  \ is a mind-affecting fear effect."
