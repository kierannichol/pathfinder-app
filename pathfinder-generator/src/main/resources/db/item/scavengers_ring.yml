description: "This polished iron band allows the wearer to walk along the ocean floor\
  \ as easily as on dry land. The wearer of a scavenger's ring sinks to the bottom\
  \ of any large body of water at a rate of 30 feet per round. Once on the body of\
  \ water's floor, the wearer can move and act as though she were on land, allowing\
  \ her to jump, roll, attack, and run as normal, although she cannot swim (nor can\
  \ she control her ascent or descent underwater) as long as she wears the ring. As\
  \ soon as the wearer removes the ring, she may swim as normal and is subject to\
  \ all the normal penalties associated with underwater action. A scavenger's ring\
  \ does not confer the ability to breathe while underwater."
