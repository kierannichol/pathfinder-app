description: "This slightly oversized ring conceals a few lockpicks and other tools\
  \ coiled inside its band. These discreet tools, made of a metal alloy that springs\
  \ straight once the tool is removed from the band, are sufficient to attempt Disable\
  \ Device checks without penalty, and long enough to pick locks on manacles fastened\
  \ around the wearer's hands (once she slips off the ring). The wearer gains a +2\
  \ circumstance bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal the ring's nature\
  \ from anyone searching her."
