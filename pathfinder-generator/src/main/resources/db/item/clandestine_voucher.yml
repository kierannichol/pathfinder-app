description: "This piece of parchment can magically transform metal coins into spots\
  \ of metallic ink on its surface. A clandestine voucher is commonly used to transfer\
  \ bribes or payment when exchanging material wealth would be illegal or draw too\
  \ much attention. The voucher comes with a magical quill that, when touched to a\
  \ coin, transforms the coin into ink of that color. Each coin fills the quill enough\
  \ to make a single dot on the parchment. The quill can hold 200 coins worth of ink,\
  \ but the ink is ruined if multiple types of coins are mixed. A single clandestine\
  \ voucher can hold a number of dots equal to 1,600 coins. Each dot takes the same\
  \ amount of space regardless of the coin's denomination.\nTo retrieve the coins\
  \ from the clandestine voucher, the owner must apply a solvent to the paper, such\
  \ as diluted alcohol or citrus juice. Coins that were magical or otherwise different\
  \ from ordinary coins are restored as mundane coins. If the voucher is otherwise\
  \ destroyed or significantly damaged, any coins stored in it are lost, though any\
  \ dots that are intact can be restored normally.\nThe voucher can be reused, but\
  \ this requires purchasing a new magical quill at a cost of 25 gp and washing any\
  \ solvent out of the parchment before applying new ink. Cursed coins can't be transformed\
  \ into ink and stored in the quill."
