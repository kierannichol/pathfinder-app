description: "Often crafted by denizens of the First World, this pinecone shaped knot\
  \ of briars can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet.\
  \ The area within a 20-foot radius of where the briar bomb lands erupts with thick,\
  \ thorny brambles (hardness 5, hp 15) that hinder creatures in the area. The briars\
  \ extend to 20 feet high, so long as there is vertical space for this growth. The\
  \ briars do not block vision, but they provide cover against attacks made through\
  \ them.\nA creature moving through the briars takes 1d4 points of piercing damage\
  \ for every 5 feet of movement through the area. In addition, each creature trying\
  \ to move through the briars must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or become entangled\
  \ in place. Entangled creatures can break free of the briars as a full-round action\
  \ with a successful DC 20 Strength check or Escape Artist check. A creature trapped\
  \ in the briars can opt to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.\
  \ A creature can try to pick its way slowly through a field of briars without taking\
  \ damage or risking entanglement by attempting a Dexterity check as a full-round\
  \ action. For every 5 points by which the result exceeds 10, the creature can move\
  \ 5 feet (up to its normal speed).\nOnce a briar bomb is thrown, it is destroyed."
