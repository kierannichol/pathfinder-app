description: "This sleeveless cotton tabard has a large but innocuous image such as\
  \ a checkered field or mailed fist emblazoned on its front panel. As a swift action,\
  \ a wearer devoted to a particular deity or religion can transform the image into\
  \ her faith's holy symbol or transform the holy symbol back to the innocuous image.\
  \ The wearer can use the holy symbol image as an actual holy symbol while it is\
  \ displayed.\nOnce per day as a standard action, the wearer can cause a false flag\
  \ tabard to flare with protective energy. All worshipers of the wearer's deity within\
  \ a 60-foot-radius burst (including the wearer) gain a +2 sacred bonus to AC and\
  \ CMD for 5 minutes. If the wearer is evil, this is a profane bonus rather than\
  \ a sacred bonus."
