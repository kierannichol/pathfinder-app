description: "This tiny dropper contains a liquid that speeds up the cure time of\
  \ alchemical glue. Applying the accelerant is a standard action. Accelerated glue\
  \ is tacky after 1 round and fully cured in 1 minute. The dropper contains 20 doses;\
  \ each dose is sufficient to cure one small application of alchemical glue. The\
  \ entire dropper must be used to cure a full square foot of glue."
