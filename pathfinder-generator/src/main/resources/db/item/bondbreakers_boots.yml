description: "These leather boots bear a knife motif worked into their durable blue\
  \ leather. Three times per day, the wearer can speak a command word as a swift action,\
  \ causing a serrated knife to fly from the boots and instantly slice through any\
  \ nonmagical bond currently restraining the wearer. The knife conjured from bondbreaker's\
  \ boots can cut through brambles, ropes, tanglefoot bags, vines, webs, or any other\
  \ similar nonmagical item restraining the wearer, but cannot help when the owner\
  \ is actively restrained by a creature. Bondbreaker's boots also cannot free the\
  \ wearer if manacles or chains restrain her."
