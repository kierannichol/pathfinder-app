description: "This weapon consists of a wooden haft and a heavy, metal head. The head\
  \ may be single (like a carpenter's hammer) or double (like a sledgehammer). The\
  \ haft is long enough that you may wield it one- or two-handed. Though heavy and\
  \ relatively slow to wield, warhammers are capable of delivering immense blows,\
  \ crushing armor and flesh alike."
