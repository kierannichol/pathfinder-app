description: "The blade called Briar is an intelligent +5 cold iron vorpal bastard\
  \ sword whose special purpose is to defeat denizens of the First World."
destruction: "If Briar is claimed by the nymph Nyrissa—of whom it is fundamentally\
  \ a part—the blade gradually begins rejoining with the fey queen. If left in Nyrissa's\
  \ possession, Briar fades out of existence over the course of a week. At the end\
  \ of this time, the weapon is destroyed and Nyrissa regains her ability to love.\
  \ Only one of the fey lords known as the Eldest can restore Briar once Nyrissa has\
  \ reclaimed it."
