description: "This small sack of green-gray powder is thrown as a splash weapon with\
  \ a range increment of 10 feet. A creature struck by a direct hit must succeed at\
  \ a DC 18 Fortitude save or begin choking and gasping for air as if suffocating\
  \ (DC 12 for creatures in the splash radius). Affected creatures cannot breathe\
  \ or speak for 1 round.\nMythic: You can expend one use of mythic power while throwing\
  \ a bag of suffocating powder to charge the item with mythic power. Non-mythic creatures\
  \ do not receive saving throws to avoid the suffocation effect. Affected creatures\
  \ suffocate for an additional number of rounds equal to your mythic tier."
