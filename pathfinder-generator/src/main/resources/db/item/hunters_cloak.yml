description: "Usually made from the skins of giant serpents, these cloaks are designed\
  \ to help rangers, hunters, and trackers blend in with and travel quickly through\
  \ the areas they are most familiar with. If the wearer has the favored terrain class\
  \ ability and is traveling through one of his favored terrains, he can transform\
  \ himself into an animal native to that environment. This works identically to the\
  \ beast shape I spell, save that it is limited to creatures native to the environment\
  \ (as defined in the appropriate Bestiary entry or per the GMs discretion). This\
  \ effect lasts for 10 minutes per day. The duration need not be continuous, but\
  \ it must be used in 1-minute increments."
