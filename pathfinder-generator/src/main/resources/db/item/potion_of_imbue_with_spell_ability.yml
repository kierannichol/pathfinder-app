description: "You transfer some of your currently prepared spells, and the ability\
  \ to cast them, to another creature. Only a creature with an Intelligence score\
  \ of at least 5 and a Wisdom score of at least 9 can receive this boon. Only cleric\
  \ spells from the schools of abjuration, divination, and conjuration (healing) can\
  \ be transferred. The number and level of spells that the subject can be granted\
  \ depends on its Hit Dice; even multiple castings of imbue with spell ability can't\
  \ exceed this limit."
