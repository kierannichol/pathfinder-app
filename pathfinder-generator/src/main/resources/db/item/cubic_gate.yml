description: "This potent magical item is a small cube fashioned from carnelian. Each\
  \ of the six sides of the cube is keyed to a different plane of existence or dimension,\
  \ one of which is the Material Plane. The character creating the item chooses the\
  \ planes to which the other five sides are keyed.\nIf a side of the cubic gate is\
  \ pressed once, it opens a gate to a random point on the plane keyed to that side.\
  \ There is a 10% chance per minute that an outsider from that plane (determine randomly)\
  \ comes through it looking for food, fun, or trouble. Pressing the side a second\
  \ time closes the gate. It is impossible to open more than one gate at a time.\n\
  If a side is pressed twice in quick succession, the character so doing is transported\
  \ to a random point on the other plane, along with all creatures in adjacent squares.\
  \ The other creatures may avoid this fate by succeeding on DC 23 Will saves."
