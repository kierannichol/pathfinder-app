description: "These drums are kettle drums (hemispheres about 1-1/2 feet in diameter\
  \ on stands). They come in pairs and are unremarkable in appearance. If both of\
  \ the pair are sounded, all creatures within 120 feet (with the exception of those\
  \ within a 20-foot-radius safe zone around the drums) are affected as by a fear\
  \ spell (Will DC 16 partial). Drums of panic can be used once per day."
