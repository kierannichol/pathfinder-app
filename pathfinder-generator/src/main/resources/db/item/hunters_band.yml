  \ Survival checks and inures the wearer to the strain of long travel, as the tireless\
  \ pursuit spell (Advanced Player's Guide). If the wearer is a ranger, the hunter's\
  \ band increases his favored enemy bonus on attack rolls by +1 for all his favored\
  \ enemies. If the ranger has the hunter's bond (companions) class feature, this\
  \ increase also applies to the attack roll bonus his allies gain from that ability."
