description: "When first created, a book of written whispers is a relatively slim\
  \ volume of blank pages. Typically, the cover of a book of written whispers is made\
  \ to appear nondescript or plain, but the actual design of the book's cover has\
  \ no bearing on the item's use. This magic item is used to pen secret messages to\
  \ allies in distant areas. Each book of whispers is linked to a specific activation\
  \ word. The backside of each of the book's pages can be removed as a standard action;\
  \ the removed page appears as a normal piece of paper, and the front side of the\
  \ page that remains in the book of whispers turns uniformly dark gray. The removed\
  \ page is known as a \"secret letter,\" while the page from which it was removed\
  \ is known as a \"source page.\" A secret letter doesn't radiate magic, behaving\
  \ as if under the effects of a magic aura spell.\nAt any point thereafter, the owner\
  \ of the book of written whispers can write a message on the source page. This message\
  \ can be up to 25 words long, a simple line drawing, or even a straightforward map.\
  \ When the book's owner writes the activation word in the page's margin (this word\
  \ does not count against the message's total word count), the message or image inscribed\
  \ on the page instantly duplicates on the page's linked secret letter, and the actual\
  \ contents of both the source page and the secret letter are hidden by a secret\
  \ page effect. The carrier of the secret letter can use the activation word to reveal\
  \ the actual contents of the message or to restore the misleading secret page contents.\n\
  As a standard action, the owner of a book of written whispers can rip an entire\
  \ source page out of the book. Doing so causes its linked secret letter to crumble\
  \ to ash, whether or not any messages have yet been sent. A book of written whispers\
  \ can be used only 25 times before it is filled; once used, a page cannot be reused\
  \ to send a new message."
