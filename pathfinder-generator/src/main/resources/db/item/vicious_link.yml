description: "Said to have been gifted by Dispater himself to Order of the Gate founder\
  \ Sheel Leroung, the vicious link is a weighty but portable portal that connects\
  \ to one of the planes' portal hubs. Anyone who speaks the command word and passes\
  \ through this 7-foot-tall frame of scarred iron instantly appears just beyond a\
  \ similar arc on the Isle of Seven Chains in the Maelstrom. The portal on the opposite\
  \ side operates in the same fashion, but is immobile.\nBeyond the portal, the Isle\
  \ of Seven Chains is a meteorlike ball of crumbling bricks and ancient, rusted metal.\
  \ Tethered to it are several orbiting ruins, the most prominent of which bear soulgates\
  \ connecting to Axis, Dis, the Elemental Plane of Water, the sahkil tormentor Dachzerul's\
  \ realm on the Ethereal Plane, a supposedly empty rift within the Abyss, a shulsaga\
  \ holy site on the Astral Plane called the Ring of Candles, and a moon on the Material\
  \ Plane that features mercury seas. Within recent centuries, the very similar, chain-linked\
  \ black towers known as the Ashstaves were erected here. Known as the Shackled Tower\
  \ and the Cage of Tomes, these spires now serve as the home of the Order of the\
  \ Gate's eldest member, Sheel Leroung, who advises his successors still.\nThe Isle\
  \ of Seven Chains has become a secret shared by the vicarius of the Order of the\
  \ Gate and his most worthy lieutenants. From here, they seek to learn more of the\
  \ multiverse and collect magical relics that might aid them in furthering their\
  \ goals upon Golarion. The danger of the planes is well known, though; thus far,\
  \ only a handful of veteran Hellknights have been allowed to explore the island,\
  \ and even fewer have ventured to the lands beyond."
destruction: "The vicious link must be transported to the Isle of Seven Chains and\
  \ thrown through its immobile, paired arch. This destroys both portals."
