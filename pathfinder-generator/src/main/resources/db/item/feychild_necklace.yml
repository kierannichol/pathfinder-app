description: "This necklace is set with a bloodstone sculpted to look like a scintillating\
  \ green eye. It gives the wearer a +4 competence bonus on Charisma checks and Charisma-based\
  \ checks made to interact with gnomes, a +2 competence bonus on similar checks when\
  \ dealing with beings of the fey creature type, and a â€“2 penalty on similar checks\
  \ when interacting with anyone else. The wearer can read, speak, and understand\
  \ the Gnome language. If the wearer is not a gnome, she gains low-light vision,\
  \ and may cast dancing lights, ghost sound, prestidigitation, and speak with animals\
  \ each once per day as a spell-like ability."
