description: "An unnaturally cold, razor-thin blade of magically-hardened ice juts\
  \ from the pommel of this +1 frost keen short sword. On a confirmed critical hit,\
  \ an ice shard breaks off into the wound and inflicts numbing cold. For the next\
  \ 5 rounds, the victim takes 2 points of cold damage and is staggered for that round\
  \ if he takes this damage. This is a bleed effect. The shard can be removed as a\
  \ standard action with a successful DC 15 Heal check or with the application of\
  \ any magical healing, and is destroyed instantly if the victim takes at least 5\
  \ points of fire damage from any attack. The shard lasts for only 1 round when inflicted\
  \ on a creature with the fire subtype. A blade of the ice stalker can implant an\
  \ ice shard once per minute."
