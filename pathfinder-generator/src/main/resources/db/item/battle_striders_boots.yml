description: "While unattended, these rough leather boots appear to be in a slightly\
  \ different place each time a creature observes them. They seem to flicker around\
  \ the wearer's feet for the first 24 hours she wears them, reducing her movement\
  \ speed by 5 feet and imposing a â€“2 penalty on Acrobatics checks.\nAfter she has\
  \ worn the boots for 24 hours, the flickering decreases, the penalties end, and\
  \ she can activate the boots. Three times per day, she can activate the boots as\
  \ a swift action to avoid provoking attacks of opportunity while moving out of a\
  \ threatened square. While activated, the boots conceal the wearer's movement in\
  \ such a way that her foes see only short, blurred flashes of movement. Any creature\
  \ that has blindsight or a similar nonvisual sense or is affected by true seeing\
  \ can still make attacks of opportunity against the wearer as normal."
