name: "Scroll of Wall of Force"
description: "A wall of force creates an invisible wall of pure force. The wall cannot\
  \ move and is not easily destroyed. A wall of force is immune to dispel magic, although\
  \ a mage's disjunction can still dispel it. A wall of force can be damaged by spells\
  \ as normal, except for disintegrate, which automatically destroys it. It can be\
  \ damaged by weapons and supernatural abilities, but a wall of force has hardness\
  \ 30 and a number of hit points equal to 20 per caster level. Contact with a sphere\
  \ of annihilation or rod of cancellation instantly destroys a wall of force."
