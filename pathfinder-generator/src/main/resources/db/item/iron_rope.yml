description: "When the end of this gray hemp rope is held and the command word is\
  \ uttered, it is irrevocably transmuted into solid iron. The transmuted rope loses\
  \ all magic and has the hardness and hit points of a normal inch-thick iron bar.\
  \ When crafted, the rope is 25 feet long, but can be cut up to three times and each\
  \ section of rope can be commanded to harden individually."
