description: "This rune-carved wooden statuette of a fish feels very slippery. When\
  \ placed at the helm of any Large water vehicle (such as a rowboat or ship's boat),\
  \ the friction between the boat and water is reduced considerably, allowing the\
  \ boat to glide through the water more smoothly and swiftly. The boat gains a +20-foot\
  \ enhancement bonus to its maximum speeds."
