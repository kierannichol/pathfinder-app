description: "This jagged crown is composed of ice that never melts regardless of\
  \ the ambient temperature. The Icecrown of Irrisen is the royal regalia of the queen\
  \ of Irrisen, was crafted by Baba Yaga specifically for that role, and has been\
  \ worn by all of Baba Yaga's daughters who have served as monarchs of that realm.\
  \ When placed on the head, the Icecrown merges with the wearer so that icicles seem\
  \ to grow directly from her head. Once in place, the crown can be removed only by\
  \ Baba Yaga or upon the death of the wearer or the destruction of the crown. The\
  \ Icecrown of Irrisen deals 3d6 points of cold damage per round to any creature\
  \ touching or wearing it as it absorbs body heat (or 6d6 points of cold damage per\
  \ round to a creature with the fire subtype).\nThe Icecrown of Irrisen grants its\
  \ wearer the following abilities: fire resistance 20, spell resistance 32, and a\
  \ +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence and Charisma (with ranks in Knowledge [local]\
  \ and Sense Motive, as a headband of vast intelligence). The wearer doesn't take\
  \ penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution from being of middle age or\
  \ older (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 169), and retains a youthful appearance, always\
  \ appearing to be the same age as when she first put on the crown. Once per day,\
  \ the wearer can summon three elder ice elementals that remain for 1 hour and follow\
  \ her commands. In addition, the Icecrown gives its wearer the following abilities:\n\
  Constant— tongues\nAt will— frigid touch, ice crystal teleport, Irriseni mirror\
  \ sight*, unseen servant\n3/day— control weather, dominate monster (creatures with\
  \ the cold subtype only), ice spears *\n1/day— overwhelming presence, polar midnight\n\
  Finally, the Icecrown of Irrisen gives its wearer the ability to shape the ice that\
  \ forms the Royal Palace in Whitethrone, allowing her to create or destroy walls,\
  \ doors, windows, and even furnishings and decorations at will."
destruction: "The Icecrown of Irrisen can be destroyed only if the perpetual winter\
  \ that shrouds the land of Irrisen ends and the normal course of the seasons returns.\
  \ In this case, the Icecrown melts away on the first day of Irrisen's new spring."
