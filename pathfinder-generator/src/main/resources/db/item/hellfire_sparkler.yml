description: "This large barrel-shaped sparkler is imbued with mysterious, hellish\
  \ forces. The fuse can be lit as a standard action; 1d4 rounds later, the sparkler\
  \ crackles violently with sickly-green sparks that take the form of an army of ferocious\
  \ devils. Creatures within a 10-foot-radius burst take 3d6 points of fire damage\
  \ and become shaken for 2 rounds; a target can attempt a DC 15 Will save to halve\
  \ the damage and the duration of the shaken condition. Crafting a hellfire sparkler\
  \ requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
