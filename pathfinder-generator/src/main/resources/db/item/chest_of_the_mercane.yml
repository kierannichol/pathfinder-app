description: "This beautiful, gem-encrusted golden chest measures 4 feet long, 2 feet\
  \ wide, and 4 feet tall. The chest of the mercane is engraved with symbols of wealth\
  \ and trade, and comes with an equally ornate key. Even without its magic properties,\
  \ the chest is worth 5,000 gp. The chest is bonded to a traveling mercane (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Bestiary 2 188) that makes i ts living trading magical items throughout the\
  \ planes. The chest acts as if affected by the secret chest spell (CL 9th), except\
  \ it allows the key wielder to retrieve the chest once per day and send it back\
  \ to its mercane master once per day. The chest's ornate key functions as the small\
  \ replica chest does in secret chest.\nEach time the chest is sent back to its mercane\
  \ master, there's a chance the mercane decides to buy any new magic item in the\
  \ chest. If the mercane buys the item, it may pay slightly less than, equal to,\
  \ or more than the standard market value (normally 50% of its total value). The\
  \ mercane's interest and payment is determined by the table below. If the mercane\
  \ does buy an item, the payment is always in gold pieces that take the item's place\
  \ in the chest of the mercane.\n"
