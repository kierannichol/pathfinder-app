name: "Potion of Mydriatic Spontaneity"
description: "You overstimulate the target with alternating flashes of light and shadow\
  \ within its eyes, causing its pupils to rapidly dilate and contract. While under\
  \ the effects of this spell, the target is racked by splitting headaches and unable\
  \ to see clearly, becoming nauseated for the spell's duration. Each round, the target's\
  \ pupils randomly become dilated or contracted for 1 round. During any round that\
  \ its eyes are dilated, the target is blinded if exposed to bright light or dazzled\
  \ if exposed to normal light. During any round its eyes are contracted, the target\
  \ is blinded if exposed to darkness or dazzled if exposed to dim light. In addition,\
  \ any creature can attempt a Stealth check to avoid detection from the target, even\
  \ if the creature lacks cover or concealment."
