description: "The metal filings within this pouch are a mixture of adamantine, cold\
  \ iron, mithral, and steel. The filings are faintly magnetic and stick to ferrous\
  \ metal but are easily wiped away. If a metal or partly metal weapon is covered\
  \ in the entire contents of the pouch and placed in a hot forge overnight, it slowly\
  \ grows or shrinks by one size category toward the size of the creature who applied\
  \ the powder. For example, a Small +1 longsword coated with the filings by a Medium\
  \ creature transforms into a Medium +1 longsword. This transformation is permanent.\
  \ The pouch contains enough material to transform one weapon, regardless of size."
