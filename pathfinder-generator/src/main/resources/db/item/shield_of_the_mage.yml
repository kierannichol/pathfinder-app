description: "This caster's shield always has one arcane scroll and knows the same\
  \ arcane spells as the wielder. When the spell on the scroll is cast, another scroll\
  \ of a spell the wielder knows randomly manifests to replace it. The shield has\
  \ no arcane spell failure. The shield can also read magic. It will often debate\
  \ with its wielder for the most devastating course of action, but does what the\
  \ wielder commands."
