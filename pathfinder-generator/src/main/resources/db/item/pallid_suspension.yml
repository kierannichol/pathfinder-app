description: "This small vial contains an alchemical suspension that preserves a sample\
  \ of pallid gift. This functions like plague powder (Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures\
  \ 213) for pallid gift (DC 20, see page 68), allowing the user to apply pallid gift\
  \ to a weapon (a standard action, or whatever action the character normally takes\
  \ to apply poison to a weapon if that is better) and deliver it as with an injury\
  \ poison. Just as for plague powder, the creation of a pallid suspension exposes\
  \ the crafter to the disease on each day of crafting."
