description: "Each of the yellow ribbons that spill from the joints of this jaundiced\
  \ suit of +3 studded leather armor bears one or more haunting runes. Three times\
  \ per day, a cleric (or other class with cleric domains) with the Rune domain can\
  \ use her blast rune domain power to mark one of the ribbons rather than a square.\
  \ Such blast runes last until the next time the cleric prepares spells and cannot\
  \ benefit from other domain abilities such as spell rune. As a swift action while\
  \ wearing this armor, the cleric can cause one of the ribbons to lash out and touch\
  \ an adjacent creature, triggering the blast rune as if the target had entered the\
  \ warded square. When marking a ribbon with a blast rune, the cleric can instead\
  \ expend two daily uses of The Forbidden Name's ability to also apply the benefits\
  \ of another Rune domain (or subdomain) power such as spell rune or warding rune\
  \ to the blast rune.\nAlternatively, any wearer can expend two daily uses when casting\
  \ glyph of warding or explosive runes —or three uses when casting greater glyph\
  \ of warding —on a ribbon to treat it much like a blast rune. As a swift action\
  \ while wearing the armor, she can trigger the glyph as though she had stepped on\
  \ it; however, she takes half damage from the effect on a failed Reflex saving throw\
  \ or no damage if successful."
