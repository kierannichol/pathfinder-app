description: "This large container is usually fashioned from silver with a rippled\
  \ pattern. It is about 1 foot in diameter and half that deep. The bowl must be filled\
  \ with fresh or salt water to function. On command as a full-round action, the bearer\
  \ may summon a water elemental. If the bowl is filled with salt water, it conjures\
  \ a Huge water elemental as if using summon monster VI. If filled with fresh water,\
  \ it conjures a Large water elemental as if using summon monster V. Conjuring an\
  \ elemental empties the bowl. The bowl cannot summon another elemental until the\
  \ previous one is dismissed, killed, or the duration of its summoning expires."
