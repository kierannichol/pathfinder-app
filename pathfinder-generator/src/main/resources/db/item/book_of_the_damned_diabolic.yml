description: "This flesh-bound folio contains pages from the Book of the Damned related\
  \ to Hell and its infernal denizens. Its dry, yellowed parchment leaves bear profane\
  \ symbols and diagrams, prayers to archdevils, descriptions of Hell and its torments,\
  \ explanations of foul rites, heresies and libel profane to every god, vituperation\
  \ against countless deities, explorations of diabolical life, and pages of evil\
  \ magic supposedly expunged from the world long ago.\nA good-aligned creature that\
  \ so much as touches this section of the Book of the Damned gains 1 negative level.\
  \ This level can't be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet\
  \ away from this section of the book for 24 hours. A creature that is not lawful\
  \ evil and attempts to read this section of the book must succeed at a DC 15 Will\
  \ save or have his alignment permanently shift one step toward lawful evil.\nThose\
  \ who dare read this section of the Book of the Damned find that it holds a wealth\
  \ of profane knowledge. Any character who can read Infernal and spends a total of\
  \ 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) studying the folio uncovers numerous foul\
  \ revelations and gains a number of benefits. Readers find that the tome holds copies\
  \ of every spell with the evil spell descriptor, as well as create drug and sacrifice\
  \ (see pages 183 and 185). A significant portion of this volume contains lists of\
  \ fiendish true names hidden in complex metaphors and codes, allowing someone who\
  \ has access to only this portion of the Book of the Damned to perform the manifest\
  \ manifestation ritual (see page 193), but at a penalty of –4 to the skill checks\
  \ involved due to the incomplete nature of these lists. The descriptions of Hell\
  \ found within prove so detailed that any magical attempt to teleport to or within\
  \ the infernal plane (such as by use of plane shift or teleport) takes the bearer\
  \ to the exact intended destination with no familiarity roll needed.\nBeyond its\
  \ contents, this section of the Book of the Damned is itself a potent unholy magic\
  \ item. At its most basic level, the tome serves as the focal point for a permanent\
  \ unhallow effect and sympathy tuned to attract lawful evil creatures. Also, any\
  \ greater devil using scry or a similar spell can view the diabolic Book of the\
  \ Damned with no risk of being detected by the bearer.\nThose in possession of these\
  \ pages also gain a number of benefits. The bearer casts evil spells as if he were\
  \ 2 caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on Charisma-based skills and checks\
  \ when interacting with lawful evil creatures (these bonuses are considered to be\
  \ profane bonuses and do not stack with similar bonuses granted by other parts of\
  \ the Book of the Damned). Three times per day, the tome can be invoked to cast\
  \ one of the following spells: desecrate, dictum, gate (to summon a hellmouth to\
  \ Hell only), greater planar binding, hellfire ray, summon monster VII, and unholy\
  \ blight. Once per day, the bearer can ask the folio a question related to Hell,\
  \ lawful evil creatures, or any other profane topic; he then opens the book to a\
  \ random page to find the answer, revealed as if he had cast vision.\nEvery time\
  \ one of the artifact's daily spells or its vision power is used, there is a cumulative\
  \ 1% chance that a powerful devil takes note of the bearer and seeks to make use\
  \ of him in some profane plot or simply claims his soul for Hell."
destruction: "The diabolic Book of the Damned can be destroyed by scrubbing each page\
  \ with waters harvested from the Maelstrom before feeding the soaked pages to a\
  \ protean (which is typically destroyed in the process of consuming the potent lawful\
  \ artifact). Unless the other three portions of the Book of the Damned are also\
  \ destroyed within 24 hours, the diabolic Book of the Damned reappears unharmed\
  \ at some random, obscure point in the multiverse."
