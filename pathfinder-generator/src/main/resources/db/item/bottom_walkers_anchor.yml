description: "This dense anchor is attached to a sturdy but easily detachable chain\
  \ (removing the chain is a move action). Wearing a bottomwalker's anchor all but\
  \ guarantees an undersea explorer a swiftly sinking buoyancy, though it also increases\
  \ her armor check penalty by 1 and decreases her maximum Dexterity bonus by 1 (or\
  \ sets it at +6, if the wearer didn't have a maximum Dexterity bonus). Compared\
  \ to simply carrying plenty of dense items, it's unwieldy, but the advantage is\
  \ that the undersea explorer can detach the anchor in a hurry in order to float\
  \ to the surface, while unloading a number of dense objects might be a slow process\
  \ (and could deprive the explorer of valuable gear)."
