description: "This set of small gold-plated scales is inscribed with words from Abadar's\
  \ holy text. When activated, its presence aids in negotiations, making attempts\
  \ to change the attitude of another person by one step a swift action instead of\
  \ requiring 1 minute. The user must touch the scales and speak to the intended target\
  \ as part of the skill check. The item remains activated for 1 hour, or until it\
  \ has been used to influence a number of creatures equal to 1/2 the effective cleric\
  \ level of the person who activated it."
