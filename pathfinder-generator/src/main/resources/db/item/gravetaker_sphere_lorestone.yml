description: "Weathered carvings of constellations, suns, and planets cover the surface\
  \ of this ancient, melon-sized stone sphere.\nThis obsidian sphere is cool and unpleasantly\
  \ clammy to the touch, feeling more like dead flesh than stone. Its layers detail\
  \ processes of rot and decay, the final resting places of certain ancient druids,\
  \ and rituals designed to exhume the ancient dead. A harmonized possessor can use\
  \ expeditious excavation five times per day. Additionally, if the harmonized possessor\
  \ (DC 35) is evil, she can use animate dead to animate a Medium or smaller humanoid\
  \ once per day, although after 24 hours a creature animated this way collapses into\
  \ carrion that cannot be animated again.\nThis lorestone currently lies in the hunting\
  \ grounds of a fiendish quickwood (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 228) east of the gnome\
  \ city of Wispil in the Verduran Forest."
