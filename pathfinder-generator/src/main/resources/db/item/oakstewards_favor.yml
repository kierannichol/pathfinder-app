  \ that bears the hallmark of the Oakstewards of Sevenarches. Occasionally given\
  \ as a gift to those who aid the druids, an Oakstewards' favor gives the wearer\
  \ a +4 competence bonus on Handle Animal checks and increases the DC of any enchantment\
  \ spells the wearer casts against animals by 2.\nIf the token of favor is broken\
  \ apart and added to boiling water, it becomes a nourishing porridge that feeds\
  \ up to eight Medium creatures. This meal cures all ongoing sickness and nausea\
  \ effects, and provides the benefits of neutralize poison and remove disease. In\
  \ addition, for 24 hours after eating the porridge, subjects gain a +2 luck bonus\
  \ on Will saves against fear."
