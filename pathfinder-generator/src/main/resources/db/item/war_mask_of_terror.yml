description: "Shamans and warriors of many of the indigenous tribes of western Garund\
  \ add to their fierceness and mystique by wearing wooden masks that bear terrifying\
  \ visages of demonic spirits. A war mask is considered sacred and personal, and\
  \ is often handed down to the next generation when a wearer dies. Individual masks\
  \ are often notorious, and many tribesfolk can readily identify masks of other tribes\
  \ with a DC 15 Knowledge (local) check.\nA war mask of terror provides its wearer\
  \ with a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate checks and a +1 deflection bonus to Armor\
  \ Class. In addition, the wearer may cast scare once per day.\nOther war masks exist\
  \ with different abilities; some have higher deflection bonuses, while others can\
  \ cast bull's strength, fear, or flesh to stone instead of scare."
