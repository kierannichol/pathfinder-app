description: "Decorated with the emblems of the Earth Child cadre, an earth child\
  \ faceguard is designed to refine the wearer's focus when fighting giants. The wearer\
  \ gains the benefits of Earth Child Style (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 99), regardless\
  \ of whether she meets the prerequisites. If the wearer does not possess the defensive\
  \ training racial trait, the dodge bonus to AC against giants is reduced to +2.\
  \ If the wearer already possesses the Earth Child Style feat, she can enter the\
  \ earth child stance as a free action."
