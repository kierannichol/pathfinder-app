description: "This minty-smelling salve is commonly used by Calistrian elves to render\
  \ unsuspecting victims more susceptible to magical manipulation, typically to glean\
  \ information from them in intricate revenge plots. When applied to the skin as\
  \ a standard action—usually incorporated into a massage or cosmetic procedure— Kyonin\
  \ bliss creates a sense of mild euphoria that lasts for 10 minutes (Will DC 14 negates).\
  \ The salve can be applied to an unwilling creature as a melee touch attack. A creature\
  \ affected by Kyonin bliss must attempt a concentration check to cast spells (DC\
  \ = 15 + the spell's level). Additionally, the victim rolls twice and takes the\
  \ lower result on saving throws against divinations, enchantments, and illusions.\
  \ This is a mind-affecting poison effect."
