description: "This small hand mirror is warped and tarnished around the edges. A creature\
  \ wielding the mirror can activate it by speaking a command word as a standard action.\
  \ Once activated, the mirror grants the wielder the ability to see all undead within\
  \ 60 feet clearly reflected in the mirror. This includes ethereal undead and incorporeal\
  \ undead hiding in objects or walls of up to 5 feet in thickness. A ghost mirror\
  \ does not confer any ability to see such creatures directly— only their mirrored\
  \ reflections—and grants creatures seen in it concealment (50% miss chance). A ghost\
  \ mirror can be used for 3 minutes per day. These uses do not need to be consecutive\
  \ but must be used in 1-minute increments."
