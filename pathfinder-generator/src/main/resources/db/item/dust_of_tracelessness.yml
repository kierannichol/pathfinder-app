description: "This normal-seeming dust is actually a magic powder that can conceal\
  \ the passage of its possessor and his companions. Tossing a handful of this dust\
  \ into the air causes a chamber of up to 100 square feet of floor space to become\
  \ as dusty, dirty, and cobweb-laden as if it had been abandoned and disused for\
  \ a decade.\nA handful of dust sprinkled along a trail causes evidence of the passage\
  \ of as many as a dozen humanoids and horses to be obliterated for 250 feet back\
  \ into the distance. The results of the dust are instantaneous, and no magical aura\
  \ lingers afterward from this use of the dust. Survival checks made to track a quarry\
  \ across an area affected by this dust have a DC 20 higher than normal."
