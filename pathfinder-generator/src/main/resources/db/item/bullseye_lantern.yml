description: "A bullseye lantern provides normal light in a 60-foot cone and increases\
  \ the light level by one step in the area beyond that, out to a 120-foot cone (darkness\
  \ becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A bullseye lantern does\
  \ not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. A lantern burns\
  \ for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil. You can carry a lantern in one hand."
