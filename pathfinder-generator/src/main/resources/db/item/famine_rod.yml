description: "A famine rod is a 2-foot length of ebony carved in the likeness of a\
  \ gaunt, emaciated man. As a standard action, the wielder can expend 1 charge to\
  \ make a ranged touch attack against a foe within 60 feet, dealing 2d6 points of\
  \ damage on a hit. The wielder gains temporary hit points equal to half of the damage\
  \ the rod deals. The temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later. The wielder can\
  \ expend 3 charges to deal 4d6 points of damage instead.\nA famine rod has 10 charges\
  \ when found. Spent charges are renewed once per week, so that a wielder can expend\
  \ up to 10 charges in any 1-week period."
