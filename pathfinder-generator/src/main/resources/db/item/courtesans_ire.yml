description: "Elegant as it is deadly, this +1 fighting fan is under a minor glamer\
  \ that causes it to resemble a nonlethal fan intended for courtly or social affairs,\
  \ though the glamer lacks the full protections of the glamered weapon quality. Dozens\
  \ of sharp barbs adorn the top of the fan, typically hidden by the glamer effect.\
  \ Up to three times per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause these blades\
  \ to shoot forth, dealing 3d4 points of piercing damage to all creatures in a 15-\
  \ foot cone (Reflex DC 14 half).\nAs with all fighting fans, the tips of the weapon\
  \ can be poisoned. Applied injury poison affects all creatures that take damage\
  \ from the fan's hail of blades, though the save DCs for such poison are reduced\
  \ by 2 due to the low dosage."
