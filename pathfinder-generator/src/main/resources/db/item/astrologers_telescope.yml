description: "This telescope has over a dozen lenses and measurement devices attached\
  \ to it. An astrologer's telescope functions as a telescope with ×50 magnification\
  \ (see page 27).\nA skilled astronomer can use an astrologer's telescope to glean\
  \ insights into the future by carefully manipulating the various lenses and other\
  \ apparatuses attached to the telescope while gazing at the stars. When doing so,\
  \ the user selects a Knowledge skill and attempts a DC 20 Knowledge (geography)\
  \ check over the course of 1 hour while stargazing with the telescope. If she doesn't\
  \ possess ranks in Knowledge (geography), she can attempt a Perception check instead,\
  \ albeit at a –5 penalty.\nIf the viewing is successful, the user records that check\
  \ result. Anytime during the next 24 hours that the user would roll the selected\
  \ Knowledge check, she can use the result of the earlier check as the result of\
  \ her Knowledge check instead of rolling as normal. If the user is untrained in\
  \ the selected Knowledge skill, she can use her Knowledge (geography) check result\
  \ as the Knowledge check's result only if the DC is 20 or lower. If she doesn't\
  \ use this benefit within 24 hours after the viewing, it is lost. The user can increase\
  \ the amount of time she has to attempt the Knowledge check by adjusting the telescope's\
  \ various apparatuses and taking a cumulative –5 penalty on her Knowledge (geography)\
  \ or Perception check for every additional 24 hours she wishes to retain her insight.\n\
  On a failed check to use the telescope, the user gains no useful insight into the\
  \ future. Unskilled viewers can attempt only one Perception check per night; a viewer\
  \ with ranks in Knowledge (geography) can attempt to use the telescope one additional\
  \ time per night for every 2 ranks she has in Knowledge (geography). Each additional\
  \ viewing attempt requires the user to spend 1 hour gazing through the telescope.\
  \ A character can benefit from only one viewing at a time; a second viewing removes\
  \ the previous benefit, regardless of whether the new attempt succeeds or fails."
