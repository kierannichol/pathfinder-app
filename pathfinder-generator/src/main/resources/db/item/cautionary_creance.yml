description: "This slim leather leash is just over 100 feet long, incredibly light,\
  \ and uncannily strong, making it an excellent tool for training birds of prey and\
  \ other flying predators. It grants a +4 circumstance bonus on any Handle Animal\
  \ check made to train such animals. When used to bind a flying animal companion\
  \ or familiar to its master, the leash allows the master to cast feather fall on\
  \ the creature at will. If the master has the share touch spells class ability,\
  \ once per day he can use that ability on the leashed creature, even if they are\
  \ not touching. The delivered spell can be no higher than 3rd level. The creance\
  \ attaches to the master's forearm; attack rolls and skill checks made with that\
  \ arm take a â€“1 penalty."
