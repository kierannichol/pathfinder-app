description: "Sun cinder is a fine powder that glows faintly when exposed to light.\
  \ One bag of this alchemically created talc contains 5 uses. When opened, it shines\
  \ like a candle. If sprinkled on a torch or similar flame, 1 dose of sun cinder\
  \ increases the light level of the area that flame illuminates by one additional\
  \ step, up to bright light. This increased illumination lasts for 1 minute. Multiple\
  \ doses of sun cinder can be used to further increase the light shed by the same\
  \ source. A single dose of sun cinder does not affect flames larger than a torch.\
  \ Sun cinder doesn't affect a light source's ability to penetrate magical darkness.\
  \ Crafting 5 doses of sun cinder requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
