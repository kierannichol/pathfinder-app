description: "This metal badge of a rampant griffon, lion, horse, or similar heraldic\
  \ creature must be attached to a shield or armor to function. Attaching or removing\
  \ it requires a DC 15 Craft (armor) check, 10 minutes, and appropriate tools. Its\
  \ powers only function if the wearer of the shield or armor has the channel energy\
  \ and smite abilities. If the wearer dispatches an opponent with a smite attack\
  \ (killing it, destroying it, or reducing its hit points below 0), she may expend\
  \ one use of her channel energy ability as a swift action that round."
