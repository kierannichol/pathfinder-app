name: "Scroll of Transport via Plants"
description: "You can enter any normal plant (equal to your size or larger) and pass\
  \ any distance to a plant of the same kind in a single round, regardless of the\
  \ distance separating the two. The plants must be alive. The destination plant need\
  \ not be familiar to you. If you are uncertain of the location of a particular kind\
  \ of destination plant, you need merely designate direction and distance and the\
  \ transport via plants spell moves you as close as possible to the desired location.\
  \ If a particular destination plant is desired but the plant is not living, the\
  \ spell fails and you are ejected from the entry plant."
