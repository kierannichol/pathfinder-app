description: "This cauldron of dark iron is large enough to accommodate a single Medium\
  \ creature. When filled with a mixture of water and rare herbs, the cauldron transforms\
  \ any dead body placed in it into a zombie as if animated by an animate dead spell.\
  \ Each corpse animated uses up 25 gp in materials per Hit Die, and the cauldron\
  \ can animate one corpse per round. The user of the cauldron commands the undead\
  \ so createdâ€”up to 12 HD worth, unless the user can cast the animate dead spell,\
  \ in which case that spell's limit is used; animating more beyond this limit causes\
  \ earlier specimens to become uncontrolled."
