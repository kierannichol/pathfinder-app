description: "This decorative wayfinder appears to be made of gold, and its face is\
  \ marked with white and silver motifs of roosters. Whenever the wielder of a noisemaker\
  \ wayfinder falls asleep, the roosters decorating the wayfinder change to crescent\
  \ moons. Whenever a Tiny or larger creature comes within 20 feet of the wayfinder's\
  \ bearer while she is asleep and this magic item is on her person, the noisemaker\
  \ wayfinder immediately begins vibrating, buzzing, and ringing loudly as long as\
  \ there is a clear line of effect between the wayfinder's bearer and the triggering\
  \ creature. The sound from this effect easily travels 60 feet, as the audible alarm\
  \ version of the alarm spell. A creature that speaks the password (determined by\
  \ the wielder and assigned to the wayfinder before she falls asleep) does not set\
  \ off the alarm.\nWhen the wayfinder's alarm is triggered, the violent motion of\
  \ the noisemaker wayfinder continues until the wielder presses a button on the side\
  \ of the device. If the wielder of a noisemaker wayfinder is affected by a magical\
  \ sleep effect (such as that caused by a sleep spell) and the alarm is triggered,\
  \ the constant buzzing and vibration of the wayfinder allows the wielder to attempt\
  \ a saving throw each round at the end of her turn to end the sleep effect and gives\
  \ her a +2 circumstance bonus on such saves. Other sleeping creatures within hearing\
  \ range of the wayfinder wake up from normal sleep, but not magical sleep. The bearer\
  \ of a noisemaker wayfinder may disable its audible alarm function at will by pressing\
  \ down on the compass needle."
