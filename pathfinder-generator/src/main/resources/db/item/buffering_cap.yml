description: "This cloth hat is floppy and shapeless. It offers its wearer an unusual\
  \ amount of protection against particularly devastating blows. Once per day when\
  \ struck by a critical hit, the wearer can spend an immediate action to convert\
  \ the bonus damage of the critical hit into nonlethal damage. The cap has no effect\
  \ if the wearer is immune to nonlethal damage."
