description: "This waxy amber substance is typically stored in a lidded container\
  \ that holds 10 applications. One application is enough to plug both of a creature's\
  \ ears—applying the wax is a standard action. Once applied, the wax imparts a –\
  2 penalty on Perception checks, but imparts a +4 resistance bonus on all saving\
  \ throws against charm or language-dependant compulsion effects, like charm monster,\
  \ command, and suggestion. If placed in the ears of a willing or helpless creature\
  \ currently under a charm or language-dependant compulsion effect, the dose immediately\
  \ allows the creature to make a new saving throw against the original effect to\
  \ throw off the charm or compulsion effect (although without the normal +4 bonus\
  \ granted by the wax if used when a creature is first targeted by such an effect).\
  \ A single dose of wax of defiance lasts for 1 hour once applied."
