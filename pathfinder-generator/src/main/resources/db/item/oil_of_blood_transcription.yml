description: "By consuming 1 pint of blood from a spellcaster killed within the last\
  \ 24 hours, you can attempt to learn a spell that spellcaster knew. Select one spell\
  \ available to the dead spellcaster (this must be a spell on your spell list); you\
  \ gain the knowledge of this spell for 24 hours. During this time, you may write\
  \ it down (or teach it to your familiar, if you are a witch) using the normal rules\
  \ for copying a spell from another source. Once you have learned it, you may prepare\
  \ the spell normally."
