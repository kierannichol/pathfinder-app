description: "A vest of the deep creates a constant shell of magical energy that protects\
  \ the wearer from extreme environmental pressure, such as that inflicted by water\
  \ at a depth of over 100 feet. It does not provide any protection from constriction\
  \ or other forms of direct crushing damage, nor does it grant water breathing."
