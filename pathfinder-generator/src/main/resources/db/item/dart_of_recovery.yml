description: "This +1 featherweight dart is designed to be fired from a small wrist\
  \ launcher. As with a normal featherweight dart, it deals no damage; it instead\
  \ administers 1 dose of an applied poison as long as the target doesn't have damage\
  \ reduction, hardness, or the like. Once the dart has been launched, whether it\
  \ hits or misses, the creature that fired it can use a swift action to recall the\
  \ dart to a convenient location, such as the palm of a hand or a pocket, removing\
  \ the dart from the scene of the attack. The magical recovery of the dart does not\
  \ prevent it from being damaged, so as with other magical ammunition, it can't be\
  \ reused."
