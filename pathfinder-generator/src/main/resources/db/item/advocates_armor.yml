description: "The papery layers of this robe barely constitute what would be traditionally\
  \ called armor, yet act as +3 leather armor. Once per day, when the wearer is struck\
  \ by a critical hit or sneak attack, he can choose to have his blood splatter across\
  \ one of the paper layers and form the words of a binding deal between the attacker\
  \ and the wearer. The wearer can put the opponent under a specific restriction for\
  \ 24 hours, such as \"I will not attack elves,\" or \"I will attack only those who\
  \ attacked me first.\" The terms of the contract must be simple enough for the creature\
  \ to comprehend and spoken in a language it understands. This acts as a lesser geas\
  \ spell, except without a limit to how many Hit Dice the target can have. A successful\
  \ DC 19 Will save negates this effect."
