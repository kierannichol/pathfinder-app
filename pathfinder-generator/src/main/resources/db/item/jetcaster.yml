description: "This device consists of one watertight central ammunition bladder and\
  \ several air bladders linked by specialized nozzles. When the wielder compresses\
  \ the air bladders (a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity),\
  \ the jetcaster sprays its ammunition in a 10-foot cone. Most adventurers use a\
  \ jetcaster to spray powder over invisible foes or holy water over incorporeal undead,\
  \ but it can also spray oil, itching powder, sneezing powder, or other mundane dusts\
  \ and liquids.\nLoading the ammunition bladder is a full-round action that provokes\
  \ attacks of opportunity and requires either a 4-pint jug of liquid (weighing up\
  \ to 4 pounds) or a 4-pound sack of powder; insufficient ammunition causes it to\
  \ misfire harmlessly. Refilling the air bladders is a move action that doesn't provoke\
  \ attacks of opportunity. Readying and firing a jetcaster requires two hands.\n\
  If a jetcaster fires ordinary powder or oil, each square in the cone is coated in\
  \ that substance. If a jetcaster fires holy water, itching powder, or sneezing powder,\
  \ treat each square in the cone as a square of impact and each square adjacent to\
  \ the cone (including the wielder's) as an adjacent square for the purpose of determining\
  \ effects and DCs. Loading a jetcaster with unstable compounds such as acid or alchemist's\
  \ fire destroys the device."
