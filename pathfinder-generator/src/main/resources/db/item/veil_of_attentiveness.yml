description: "This gauzy veil sharpens the wearer's hearing, enhances her ability\
  \ to interpret others' words, and improves her ability to perceive multiple conversations\
  \ simultaneously. Veils of attentiveness have historically been popular among Iadaran\
  \ diplomats or savvy elven political players in densely populated places. They are\
  \ still especially prized in crowded areas where nobles gather, such as royal courts\
  \ or upscale dining and lounging establishments in Iadara and beyond.\nThe wearer\
  \ of a veil of attentiveness gains a +2 competence bonus on hearing-based Perception\
  \ checks and on Sense Motive checks to interpret others' meaning or to detect possible\
  \ deception. In addition, when listening to multiple speakers' voices, the wearer\
  \ of a veil of attentiveness can understand each speaker as though she were listening\
  \ only to that voice."
