description: "This pelt of a large northern wolf is fashioned into a cloak. It can\
  \ be activated up to five times per day. When struck in combat, the wearer can spend\
  \ one use as a swift action to animate a ghostly wolf from the pelt. This ghostly\
  \ apparition strikes the creature that attacked the wearer with a wolf's bite attack\
  \ (Bestiary 278). The wearer can spend one additional use each subsequent round\
  \ to have the wolf continue attacking the target. The apparition can't be redirected,\
  \ and disappears if the target moves more than 5 feet of the wearer or dies. The\
  \ pelt can manifest only one wolf apparition at a time. Apart from these restrictions,\
  \ the wolf can be directed as a spiritual weapon spell.\nWhen a human wears a pelt\
  \ of the Ulfen wolf, he gains a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against emotion\
  \ effects. In addition, any round in which he begins his turn affected by a fear\
  \ effect, he can attempt a new save at the beginning of the turn to reduce the severity\
  \ of the fear effect from panicked to frightened, frightened to shaken, or shaken\
  \ to unaffected."
