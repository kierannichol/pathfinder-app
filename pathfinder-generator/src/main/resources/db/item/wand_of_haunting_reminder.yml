name: "Wand of Haunting Reminder"
description: "As part of casting this spell, you can attempt a single Intimidate check\
  \ to make the target act friendly to you. If you succeed, the target assists you\
  \ normally, but it remains fearful of your retribution even after its attitude shifts\
  \ to unfriendly. If the creature reports your coercion to authorities, attacks you,\
  \ or otherwise acts in a purposeful way that threatens you or your objectives (at\
  \ the GM's discretion), the spell triggers, inflicting the creature with the unshakable\
  \ certainty that you will find and punish it. This imposes the shaken condition\
  \ on the creature for 1 day per caster level; during this time, the creature takes\
  \ a â€“2 penalty on saving throws against spells you cast with the fear descriptor."
