description: "This egg-sized sponge is covered in a layer of waterproof edible wax,\
  \ designed to absorb 1 dose of a potion. Chewing a potion sponge and swallowing\
  \ its liquid contents is a full-round action. A creature of at least Large size\
  \ can swallow the sponge in its entirely; other creatures must spit out the sponge\
  \ once it's depleted (a free action). Unlike a potion that is drunk from a vial,\
  \ a potion sponge can be used underwater. A potion can be poured from a vial into\
  \ a sponge potion (or squeezed from a sponge into a vial) as a full-round action.\
  \ The potion sponge is immune to attacks that specifically target crystal, glass,\
  \ ceramic, or porcelain, such as shatter. It otherwise works like a potion vial."
