description: "This gnarled blackwood scepter seeps tar, making it sticky to the touch.\
  \ Around Cassomir, waterblight scepters are popular among inquisitors, oracles,\
  \ and witches who regularly ply the Sellen River or the waters of the Inner Sea\
  \ as members of merchant caravans, pirate crews, or pirate hunters.\nThe scepter\
  \ acts as a +1 water-outsider-bane heavy mace. When the scepter is wielded against\
  \ creatures with the water subtype, damage dealt by the scepter also ignores 10\
  \ points of DR. Additionally, the wielder can use water walk once per day for 90\
  \ minutes. The duration of this ability need not be used all at once, but it must\
  \ be used in 10-minute increments."
