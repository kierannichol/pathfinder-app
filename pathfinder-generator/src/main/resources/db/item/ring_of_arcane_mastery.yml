description: "This ring is a thin but sturdy piece of forged steel crafted to resemble\
  \ a serpent swallowing its tail, and is magically imbued to reveal the secrets of\
  \ arcane mastery to its wearer. The ring allows a wearer with an arcane pool to\
  \ store up to 4 points from his arcane pool in the ring as a swift action. These\
  \ points remain in the ring until used. A wearer can spend arcane pool points stored\
  \ in the ring as if they were his own, or can spend them in each of the following\
  \ ways."
