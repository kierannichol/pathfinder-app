description: "The wearer of this single, black silk glove can use death knell on command.\
  \ The target of death knell dies if it fails a DC 13 Fortitude save as normal, but\
  \ the glove's wearer does not immediately benefit from the death; instead the siphoned\
  \ life energy is stored inside the glove. The glove indefinitely holds a reservoir\
  \ of up to five deaths. The wearer can tap into these deaths anytime thereafter\
  \ by touching herself with the glove as a swift action, granting her death knell's\
  \ benefits with a duration of 10 minutes. She can spend more than one death at a\
  \ time, if she wishes. Temporary hit points from multiple deaths stack, but the\
  \ bonuses to caster level and Strength do not. If multiple deaths are spent at the\
  \ same time, add their durations together."
