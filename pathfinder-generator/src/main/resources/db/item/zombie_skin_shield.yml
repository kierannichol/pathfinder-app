description: "This +1 light steel shield is wrapped in a layer of gray skin. Once\
  \ per day, the wearer can animate the skin as a human zombie under her control,\
  \ as if she had created it with animate dead, for a period of 5 minutes. When the\
  \ time expires, the zombie returns to the shield. If the zombie is destroyed or\
  \ cannot reach the shield by the time it expires, placing the shield on a Medium\
  \ humanoid corpse for 1 hour recreates the shield's skin."
