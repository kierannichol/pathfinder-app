description: "This potent alchemical serum is distilled from the body of an intelligent\
  \ corporeal undead who seeks to establish absolute control over his undead minions.\
  \ In a wicked ritual, the creator sloughs his own flesh into specially prepared\
  \ receptacles filled with mystic herbs, where it dissolves and ferments in fluids\
  \ siphoned from his body.\nWhen completed, the creator can then inject the fluids\
  \ into an undead creature, allowing him to control it for 7 days if under the effect\
  \ of a command undead spell."
