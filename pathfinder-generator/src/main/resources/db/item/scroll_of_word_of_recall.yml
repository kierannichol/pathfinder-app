name: "Scroll of Word of Recall"
description: "Word of recall teleports you instantly back to your sanctuary when the\
  \ word is uttered. You must designate the sanctuary when you prepare the spell,\
  \ and it must be a very familiar place. The actual point of arrival is a designated\
  \ area no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. You can be transported any distance within\
  \ a plane but cannot travel between planes. You can transport, in addition to yourself,\
  \ any objects you carry, as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load.\
  \ You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying\
  \ gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels.\
  \ A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two\
  \ Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact\
  \ with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with\
  \ you. Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail."
