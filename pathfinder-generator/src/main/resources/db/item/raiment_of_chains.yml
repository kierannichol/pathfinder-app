description: "While unattended, this +1 chain shirt takes the shape of a heap of rusty\
  \ chains, but when a creature picks up the armor, the shirt immediately starts to\
  \ assume its true form. The chains eagerly wrap or willingly loosen around the wearer's\
  \ body, allowing the wearer to don or remove the armor as a move action. A raiment\
  \ of chains can't be \"donned hastily.\"\nThree times per day as a standard action,\
  \ the wearer can command chains to shoot out from the raiment of chains and attempt\
  \ a reposition or trip combat maneuver check against a single target within 20 feet.\
  \ The wearer is considered proficient with the chains and uses her own CMB with\
  \ a +1 enhancement bonus on the check. The combat maneuver provokes attacks of opportunity\
  \ as normal. The chains immediately retract back into the armor once the combat\
  \ maneuver check has been attempted."
