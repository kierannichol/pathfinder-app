description: "When this iron medallion is placed between the palms of two persons\
  \ willingly entering into an agreement via handshake, the accord is enforced by\
  \ the brand's enchantment. If either person breaks the word of the agreement, a\
  \ hideous mark appears on the top of the unfaithful creature's hand. The brand marks\
  \ her as an oath breaker throughout the River Kingdoms, imposing upon her a â€“8 penalty\
  \ on Diplomacy and Bluff checks attempted anywhere in the region as long as the\
  \ brand is visible. This mark lasts for 1 year or until it is removed by break enchantment,\
  \ limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish, whichever comes first."
