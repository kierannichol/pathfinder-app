description: "A whip deals no damage to any creature with an armor bonus of +1 or\
  \ higher or a natural armor bonus of +3 or higher. The whip is treated as a melee\
  \ weapon with a 15-foot reach, though you don't threaten the area into which you\
  \ can make an attack. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, you can\
  \ use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes).\nUsing\
  \ a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just as if you had used a ranged weapon.\n\
  You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of\
  \ your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a whip sized for you, even though\
  \ it isn't a light weapon. You can't wield a whip in two hands in order to apply\
  \ 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier to damage rolls."
