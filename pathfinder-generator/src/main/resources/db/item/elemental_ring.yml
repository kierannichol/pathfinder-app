description: "This ornate ring has a thick iron band covered in sigils of calling,\
  \ and is set with a large glowing gemstone that appears to be an elemental gem.\
  \ The ring serves as a gateway for a specific elder elemental (25% chance each for\
  \ air, earth, fire, or water) that performs a narrow range of services when called.\n\
  When activated with a command word, the elemental is called (as by greater planar\
  \ ally) and demands to know what service it is to perform. It can only be commanded\
  \ to protect a specific creature or object, attack a specific creature, damage a\
  \ specific object, or answer questions about its home plane. The wearer of the ring\
  \ is able to communicate with the elder elemental as if they shared a common language.\
  \ The elder elemental serves for no more than 24 hours, after which it returns to\
  \ its home plane and the ring become a valueless hunk of lead."
