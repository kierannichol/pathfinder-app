description: "This crown of laurel leaves inspires its wearer to achieve mighty deeds.\
  \ She gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. If\
  \ she succeeds at a saving throw against a harmful mind-affecting effect, the surge\
  \ of confidence gives her a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, and weapon\
  \ damage rolls for 1 minute. If she fails such a saving throw, she is instead shaken\
  \ for 1 minute, though this condition doesn't stack with other fear effects to make\
  \ her frightened or panicked.\nA mythic creature wearing the wreath gains 2 temporary\
  \ hit points per tier at the start of each day. These temporary hit points are restored\
  \ whenever the wearer rests 8 hours or otherwise gains the equivalent of doing so."
