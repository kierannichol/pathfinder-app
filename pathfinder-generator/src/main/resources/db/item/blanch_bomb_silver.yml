description: "The nearly invisible gas contained in this fragile glass sphere temporarily\
  \ but drastically deteriorates the defenses—both manufactured and natural—of those\
  \ affected. A blanch bomb is effective only against a target that is vulnerable\
  \ to the type of blanch bomb employed against it. A blanch bomb is thrown as a splash\
  \ weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Upon contact with a hard surface, the\
  \ blanch bomb releases a hazy cloud of gas within a 10-foot-radius burst centered\
  \ on the point of impact. This cloud lasts for 1d4+1 rounds and can be dispersed\
  \ as fog cloud. If a creature whose damage reduction is overcome by the specified\
  \ substance begins its turn in the affected area, the subject's DR/adamantine, DR/cold\
  \ iron, or DR/silver (depending on the type of blanch bomb used) degrades at a rate\
  \ of 1 point per round for as long as the creature remains in the area (to a minimum\
  \ of DR 0). If the subject ends its turn outside the affected area, the creature's\
  \ damage reduction returns to its original amount at a rate of 1 point per round.\n\
  Mythic: You can expend one use of mythic power while throwing a blanch bomb to infuse\
  \ the item with mythic power. When the blanch bomb activates, creatures in the area\
  \ with the matching DR vulnerability must succeed at DC 16 Reflex saves or their\
  \ DR is immediately reduced by an amount equal to 1/2 your mythic tier. The gas\
  \ created by the blanch bomb lasts an additional number of rounds equal to your\
  \ mythic tier, and it cannot be dispersed by wind. Non-mythic subjects who leave\
  \ the affected area regain their DR at a rate of 1 point per minute."
