description: "Shears are used to quickly cut through items by snipping them between\
  \ two sharp blades fitted with a spring to allow the jaws to open again after closing.\
  \ Small shears can be used in one hand and are often used to trim hair, cut cloth,\
  \ or perform other delicate cutting work. Lopping shears are 3 feet long and must\
  \ be used in two hands; they are commonly used by farmers or gardeners to cut hedges\
  \ and branches.\nAdamantine shears are lopping shears with sharpened adamantine\
  \ blades that can snip through nearly any material. You can use adamantine shears\
  \ to cut through bars, chains, grates, or similar items, dealing damage to such\
  \ objects as though using a scimitar and bypassing hardness less than 20. On any\
  \ item the adamantine shears can fit around (such as a chain or iron bar, but not\
  \ an iron door), using adamantine shears provides a +10 bonus on your Strength check\
  \ to break or burst it."
