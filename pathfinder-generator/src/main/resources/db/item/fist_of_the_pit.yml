description: "This +1 spiked gauntlet is shaped like a skull studded with metal spikes.\
  \ Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can strike the ground with the gauntlet,\
  \ causing a 10-foot-square, 30-foot-deep extradimensional pit filled with spikes\
  \ to open within 30 feet, as per spiked pit (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide\
  \ 246). The gauntlet's enhancement bonus is added to the piercing damage caused\
  \ by the pit's spikes. If the wearer increases the gauntlet's enhancement bonus\
  \ (such as with greater magic weapon or a paladin's divine bond ability), the additional\
  \ weapon enhancement bonus is also added to the damage. Similarly, if the gauntlet\
  \ has any weapon special abilities that deal extra damage (such as flaming or wounding),\
  \ this extra damage is likewise added to the damage caused by the pit's spikes.\
  \ Weapon special abilities that don't deal extra damage, or that deal damage to\
  \ the wielder as well (such as vicious) do not affect the pit's spikes."
