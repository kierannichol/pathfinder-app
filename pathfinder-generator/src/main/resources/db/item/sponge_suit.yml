description: "Outwardly, this suit of clothing appears to be an ordinary traveler's\
  \ outfit, albeit cut from thicker-thannormal cloth. The suit's inner lining is made\
  \ of dozens of thin, flexible sponges. When soaked with water, these sponges can\
  \ be worn against the skin to maintain the wearer's moisture while traveling out\
  \ of the water.\nIt takes 10 minutes to fully saturate the suit, which increases\
  \ its weight from 2 pounds to 10 pounds.\nWhen worn, a sponge suit doubles the amount\
  \ of time a water-dependent creature can spend on dry land before it begins to take\
  \ damage or suffer other negative effects. When the sponges dry, wearers must submerge\
  \ themselves in water or resaturate the suit, or else they suffer the consequences\
  \ of being on dry land."
