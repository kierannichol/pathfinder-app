description: "Many half-elves live in large cities or communities where they find\
  \ it difficult to commune with nature. While some go on long sojourns to the wilderness,\
  \ others spend their evenings on high, lonely rooftops, gazing at the stars. These\
  \ lonely souls use star charts to track the movement of the stars and other celestial\
  \ bodies. Anyone referencing one of these charts on a clear night can attempt a\
  \ DC 20 Knowledge (geography) check to determine her approximate location and the\
  \ month. In addition, these charts grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks\
  \ made to avoid getting lost at night with a clear sky."
