description: "A chime of opening is a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot long. When\
  \ struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves,\
  \ and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains,\
  \ bolts, and so on. A chime of opening also automatically dispels a hold portal\
  \ spell or even an arcane lock cast by a spellcaster of lower than 15th level.\n\
  The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must\
  \ be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck and a clear tone rings\
  \ forth. The wielder can then make a caster level check against the lock or binding,\
  \ using the chime's caster level in place of her own. The DC of this check is equal\
  \ to the Disable Device DC to open the lock or binding. Each sounding only opens\
  \ one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and arcane locked,\
  \ it takes four successful uses of a chime of opening to get it open. A silence\
  \ spell negates the power of the device. A brand-new chime can be used a total of\
  \ 10 times before it cracks and becomes useless."
