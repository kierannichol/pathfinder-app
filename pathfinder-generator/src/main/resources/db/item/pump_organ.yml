description: "This large mobile keyboard instrument resembles a strange chair with\
  \ several brass tubes jutting from its back and small wheels on the feet for ease\
  \ of transportation. A pump organ can seat a single Medium creature, which can operate\
  \ the keyboard and pedals to create haunting melodies out of the brass pipework\
  \ along the organ's back frame. All pump organs function as masterwork instruments\
  \ for Perform (keyboard instruments) checks. With 10 minutes of work and a successful\
  \ DC 15 Perform (keyboard instruments) check, a user can manipulate the pump organ's\
  \ controls to create a 1-minue long performance that does not require an operatorâ€”\
  the pump organ can be set to activate after a preset duration via a timer (up to\
  \ 24 hours) or to begin when a remote trigger is activated. The trigger can be connected\
  \ to the pump organ via a set of pulleys and twine normally stored in a compartment\
  \ under the organ's seat cushion with a successful DC 15 Disable Device check. The\
  \ remote trigger can be placed up to 60 feet from the pump organ."
