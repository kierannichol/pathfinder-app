description: "These clips of alchemical cartridges hold three bullets and fit the\
  \ slot of either the dragoon musket or the dragoon pistol. They allow the wielder\
  \ of those firearms to fire up to three shots in quick succession without the need\
  \ to reload. Once the cartridge is spent, reloading another dragoon cartridge takes\
  \ a full-round action, no matter the type of dragoon firearm in question. Rapid\
  \ Reload can reduce the action time required, but abilities like the musket master's\
  \ fast musket have no effect. Unlike other alchemical cartridges, dragoon cartridges\
  \ don't increase a dragoon firearm's misfire chance by 1. Dragoon cartridges can\
  \ be used only with dragoon firearms.\nMagical bullets can be made in the form of\
  \ dragoon cartridges, but the price and cost are three times greater than the listed\
  \ value."
