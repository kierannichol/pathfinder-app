description: "This thick tome contains tips on health and fitness, but entwined within\
  \ the words is a powerful magical effect. If anyone reads this book, which takes\
  \ a total of 48 hours over a minimum of 6 days, he gains an inherent bonus from\
  \ +1 to +5 (depending on the type of manual) to his Constitution score. Once the\
  \ book is read, the magic disappears from the pages and it becomes a normal book."
