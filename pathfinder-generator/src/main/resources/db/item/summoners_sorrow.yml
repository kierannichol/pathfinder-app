description: "The summoner's sorrow is a +2 cold iron glaive that deals an extra 2d6\
  \ points of damage against summoned creatures, including eidolons. Once each round\
  \ when the summoner's sorrow damages a summoned or illusory creature, the wielder\
  \ can make a dispel check as a free action to send away or destroy the creature.\
  \ This is treated as a dispel magic spell targeted against the spell that created\
  \ the creature, except that the wielder's base attack bonus is used in place of\
  \ the wielder's or item's caster level. This ability has no effect on creatures\
  \ that are called rather than summoned, or on summoned creatures that cannot be\
  \ dispelled, such as a summoner's eidolon.\nOnce per day as a free action, the wielder\
  \ can attempt a dismissal against a creature damaged by the weapon instead of dispelling\
  \ it. This ability functions only against extraplanar creatures (whether summoned\
  \ or not), and works as the spell of the same name with a Will save DC of 17. The\
  \ wielder cannot both dispel and dismiss in the same round."
