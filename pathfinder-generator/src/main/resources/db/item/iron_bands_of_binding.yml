description: "This potent item is a 3-inch-diameter rusty iron sphere wrapped in iron\
  \ bands.\nWhen the proper command word is spoken and the spherical iron device is\
  \ hurled at an opponent, the bands expand and then contract to bind the target creature\
  \ on a successful ranged touch attack. A single Large or smaller creature can be\
  \ captured thus and held immobile (as if pinned) until the command word is spoken\
  \ to bring the bands into spherical form again. The creature can break (and destroy)\
  \ the bands with a DC 30 Strength check or escape them with a DC 30 combat maneuver\
  \ check or Escape Artist check. Iron bands of binding are usable once per day."
