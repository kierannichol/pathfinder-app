name: "Scroll of Share Senses"
description: "Spending a moment in meditation and conjuring an image of the creature\
  \ to mind, you reshape your link with your familiar, causing it to functions like\
  \ a scrying sensor. Upon casting this spell you can hear, see, or smell (any one,\
  \ your choice) what your familiar is experiencing. You gain the benefits of any\
  \ nonmagical special abilities your familiar has tied to the chosen sense (such\
  \ as low-light vision or scent), but use your own Perception skill. You don't need\
  \ line of sight or line of effect to your familiar, but you must have an active\
  \ empathic link. You may change the sense you are sharing as a standard action.\
  \ Unlike other scrying spells, share senses does not allow magically or supernaturally\
  \ enhanced senses to work through it, and you are unable to see in magical or natural\
  \ darkness unless your familiar possesses the ability to see in such conditions."
