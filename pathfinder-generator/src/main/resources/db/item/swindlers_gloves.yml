description: "When the wearer of these jet-black leather gloves reaches for an item\
  \ carried by another creature, inky strands of gloom swirl around the gloves, making\
  \ the wearer's hand movements difficult to follow. The wearer does not provoke an\
  \ attack of opportunity when attempting a disarm or steal combat maneuver check\
  \ while wearing a pair of swindler's gloves. She also ignores the penalty on her\
  \ combat maneuver check for attempting to disarm a foe while she is unarmed.\nOnce\
  \ per day as a swift action, upon using the swindler's gloves to steal from or disarm\
  \ a foe, the wearer can activate an illusion that causes the enemy to believe the\
  \ maneuver failed. The item taken via the maneuver becomes invisible and an illusory\
  \ duplicate of the item appears in the target's possession for 1 minute. This illusory\
  \ item looks and feels like the original, but the target can attempt a DC 14 Will\
  \ saving throw to realize the item he now holds is an illusory duplicate. In any\
  \ event, when the user drops the item or attempts to use it, the shadow item fades\
  \ away into shadows and is gone. The illusory duplicate is a shadow effect."
