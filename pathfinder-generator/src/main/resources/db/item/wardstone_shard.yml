description: "When the final fragment of the Kenabres wardstone shatters, a few tiny\
  \ shards of the stone remain behind. The magic remaining in these fragments is fleeting,\
  \ usable only once before the shard becomes an inert sliver of stone. As a standard\
  \ action, a wardstone shard may be rubbed along a weapon or a suit of armor to transfer\
  \ the shard's magic to the weapon or armor for 1 day.\nWeapon: A weapon enhanced\
  \ by a wardstone shard gains the evil outsider bane quality, and is treated as being\
  \ made of cold iron and as a good weapon for the purposes of overcoming a demon's\
  \ damage reduction. The shard cannot be used to enhance ammunition in this manner,\
  \ but can be used to enhance a weapon that fires ammunition; doing so causes the\
  \ weapon to impart these qualities to the ammunition as it is fired.\nArmor: A suit\
  \ of armor enhanced by a wardstone shard gains the spell resistance (13) armor special\
  \ ability, but only against evil outsiders. Against demons, this spell resistance\
  \ increases to 17. A nonmagical suit of armor also gains a +1 enhancement bonus\
  \ as well."
destruction: "A wardstone shard may be destroyed by simply crushing it—a shard has\
  \ hardness 16 and 12 hit points."
