description: "This tiny flake of dark, extraordinarily dense material is hung on a\
  \ simple wire chain and seems to absorb the light around it. When activated, streaks\
  \ of alien color play across its surface. Once per day, the wearer of a star cinder\
  \ can choose one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). Creatures\
  \ within 60 feet of the wearer with resistance or immunity to the selected energy\
  \ type have that resistance or immunity suppressed for 12 rounds. Creatures with\
  \ the elemental subtype are unaffected.\nAn affected creature of the outsider type\
  \ must succeed at a DC 17 Will save each round it remains within the area of effect\
  \ or be forced to return to its home plane (as per the dismissal spell). Even if\
  \ the outsider succeeds at its save, it is sickened for as long as it remains in\
  \ the area of effect."
