description: "These bejeweled and shining bracers initially appear to be bracers of\
  \ armor +5 and actually serve as such until the wearer is attacked in anger by an\
  \ enemy with a Challenge Rating equal to or greater than her level. At that moment\
  \ and thereafter, the bracers bestow a â€“5 penalty to AC. Once their curse is activated,\
  \ bracers of defenselessness can be removed only by means of a remove curse spell."
