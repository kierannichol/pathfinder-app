name: "Scroll of Time Stop"
description: "This spell seems to make time cease to flow for everyone but you. In\
  \ fact, you speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they\
  \ are actually still moving at their normal speeds. You are free to act for 1d4+1\
  \ rounds of apparent time. Normal and magical fire, cold, gas, and the like can\
  \ still harm you. While the time stop is in effect, other creatures are invulnerable\
  \ to your attacks and spells; you cannot target such creatures with any attack or\
  \ spell. A spell that affects an area and has a duration longer than the remaining\
  \ duration of the time stop have their normal effects on other creatures once the\
  \ time stop ends. Most spellcasters use the additional time to improve their defenses,\
  \ summon allies, or flee from combat."
