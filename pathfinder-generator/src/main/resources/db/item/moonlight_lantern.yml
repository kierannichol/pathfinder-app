description: "This intricate silver bullseye lantern filters its light through a stained-glass\
  \ image of a howling wolf silhouetted by the moon. The pale blue light it casts\
  \ does little to illuminate the surrounding area, casting dim light in a 60-foot\
  \ cone directed by the lantern's bearer. The lantern can remain lit for 30 minutes\
  \ per day. These minutes don't need to be used consecutively, but must be spent\
  \ in 5-minute increments.\nWhen the lantern's light falls on a creature that is\
  \ not in its true form or that has more than one form—such as a creature that has\
  \ been polymorphed, a doppelganger, or a lycanthrope—the light shows all of that\
  \ creature's forms. Anyone who can see the target perceives any additional forms\
  \ as semi-transparent illusions superimposed over the creature's current form. This\
  \ is a divination effect and otherwise works as per true seeing.\nOnce per day as\
  \ a standard action, the bearer can force a creature within the lantern's light\
  \ to assume another of its forms. If the creature is under the effects of a spell\
  \ with the polymorph descriptor, the bearer can attempt to dispel the effect (as\
  \ per dispel magic) using the lantern's caster level. If the creature has the shapechanger\
  \ subtype, it must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save to resist this effect. If it\
  \ fails this saving throw, the bearer of the moonlight lantern can choose another\
  \ of the target's forms and force it to transform immediately. The shapechanger\
  \ doesn't need to spend an action to do so. The target must remain in the chosen\
  \ form for at least 1 minute before it can shift again."
