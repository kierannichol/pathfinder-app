description: "This +1 flaming light mace has an iron shaft and a polished ruby-red\
  \ stone head, similar to a gemstone. Sometimes a diabolical eye or face is visible\
  \ for a moment within the stone. The stone is suitable for use as a scrying device\
  \ for spells such as scrying. Once per day as a swift action, the wielder can transform\
  \ the mace's flames to hellfire for 1 minute. This hellfire deals half fire damage\
  \ and half damage from unholy energy. Evil creatures and creatures with the evil\
  \ subtype take no damage from this unholy energy; good creatures and those with\
  \ the good subtype take double the usual damage from it. Protection from evil and\
  \ similar effects protect against the damage from unholy energy."
