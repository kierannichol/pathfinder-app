name: "Scroll of Shambler"
description: "The shambler spell creates 1d4+2 shambling mounds with the advanced\
  \ template. The creatures willingly aid you in combat or battle, perform a specific\
  \ mission, or serve as bodyguards. The creatures remain with you for 7 days unless\
  \ you dismiss them. If the shamblers are created only for guard duty, however, the\
  \ duration of the spell is 7 months. In this case, the shamblers can only be ordered\
  \ to guard a specific site or location. Shamblers summoned to guard duty cannot\
  \ move outside the spell's range, which is measured from the point where each first\
  \ appeared. You can only have one shambler spell in effect at one time. If you cast\
  \ this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled.\
  \ The shamblers have resistance to fire as normal shambling mounds do only if the\
  \ terrain where they are summoned is rainy, marshy, or damp."
