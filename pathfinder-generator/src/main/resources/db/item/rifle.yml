description: "This improvement on the musket features a grooved barrel that imparts\
  \ a twisting, spiral motion to the bullet as it exits, stabilizing it and preventing\
  \ the end-over-end tumbling common to projectiles from simpler firearms. As a result,\
  \ a rifle can fire significantly farther and with more accuracy than early long-bore\
  \ firearms.\nA rifle uses metal cartridges as ammunition. This is an advanced firearm."
