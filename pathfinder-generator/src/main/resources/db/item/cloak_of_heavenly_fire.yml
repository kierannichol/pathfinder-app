description: "This white silk cloak shimmers with divine energy. Once per day as an\
  \ immediate action, the wearer of a cloak of heavenly fire can cause it to flash\
  \ with flames as another creature touches the wearer or strikes the wearer with\
  \ a melee attack. These flames deal 1d8+5 points of fire damage to the creature\
  \ that touched the wearer. If the creature subjected to this damage is evil, it\
  \ takes an additional 1d8+5 points of damage as the fire glows with golden lightâ€”\
  this additional damage is divine in nature and not subject to energy resistance\
  \ or immunity. A target that succeeds at a DC 15 Reflex save takes half the total\
  \ damage. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer of a cloak of heavenly fire\
  \ can also use the magic to cure wounds, restoring 2d8+5 hit points to a touched\
  \ creature."
