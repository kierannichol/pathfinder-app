description: "This looking glass resembles a framed full-length mirror, 5 feet tall\
  \ and 2 feet wide. A creature that knows the proper commands can operate the mirror\
  \ in one of two modes.\nIn its first mode, the mirror stores the reflection of any\
  \ creature other than the user that comes within 20 feet of the device and sees\
  \ its own image. A creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its\
  \ own reflection. If the creature seeks to avert its gaze in order to avoid looking\
  \ at the mirror, the probability of a creature seeing its reflection drops to 50%.\
  \ This mode functions continually until another command word is spoken or until\
  \ 24 hours pass, whichever comes first.\nIn its second mode, the mirror can call\
  \ to its surface any reflection stored via the first mode of operation and bestow\
  \ that appearance on the activator, as per the veil spell, for 24 hours. The stored\
  \ reflection increases the bonus that its veil grants on Disguise checks from +10\
  \ to +20. The disguise is always the mirror image of the creature, however, which\
  \ might reveal to astute observers familiar with the creature that something is\
  \ wrong (for instance, a mole on the wrong side of the face); this increases the\
  \ bonus on Perception checks to see through the disguise for creatures intimately\
  \ familiar with the creature in question from +10 to +25. This mode can be activated\
  \ up to three times per day, though it can provide only one veil effect at a time,\
  \ so if anyone activates it again before the previous veil expires, the first effect\
  \ ends.\nA glass of veils can store up to 12 different reflections. If its capacity\
  \ is exceeded, the reflection that has been stored the longest is erased to accommodate\
  \ the latest one. With a separate command word, the user can protect an image from\
  \ being erased, or remove that protection. A glass of veils with all 12 reflections\
  \ protected from erasure can't store new images until he removes the protection\
  \ from at least one stored image."
