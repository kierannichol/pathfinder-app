description: "When the Worldwound destroyed the nation of Sarkoris, the faithful of\
  \ Iomedae seized upon the event as a balm against the horror of Aroden's death.\
  \ The invention of the first wardstones, giant menhirs infused with holy magic meant\
  \ to contain and repel demonic creatures, was perhaps the greatest result of the\
  \ crusader's initial response to Sarkoris's destruction. Today, dozens of wardstones\
  \ stand sentinel along the borders of the Worldwound. The primary purpose of the\
  \ wardstones is to contain the growing influence of the Worldwound itself, but they\
  \ also exude a powerful field similar to that generated by a forbiddance spell.\
  \ A single wardstone exerts this aura in a 300-foot radius, but when multiple wardstones\
  \ are linked (as in the case of those running along the border of the Worldwound),\
  \ they create a 300-footwide path of forbiddance, with the wardstones running down\
  \ the middle. The forbiddance area, be it a radius or path, deals 12d6 points of\
  \ damage per round to any demon within that area (DC 18 Will save half; spell resistance\
  \ applies). Teleportation effects do not function in this zone at all. The wardstones\
  \ that bolster the eastern and southern borders of the Worldwound have a further\
  \ effect as well—focused on the Worldwound as they are, they prevent demons from\
  \ teleporting into or out of the Worldwound and effectively contain the threat.\
  \ The arrangement of the wardstones along the Mendev, Numeria, and Ustalav borders\
  \ is such that even the unwarded borders to the west and north work to hamper demonic\
  \ incursions."
destruction: "If a wardstone misses its yearly maintenance ritual, it becomes vulnerable\
  \ to damage. At this point, a wardstone can be damaged by mortal attacks, but it\
  \ still has hardness 25 and 500 hit points. If a wardstone along a series of linked\
  \ wardstones is destroyed, the resulting \"hole\" in the path of the forbiddance\
  \ effect can be as narrow as a few dozen feet or as wide as several miles, depending\
  \ upon numerous other variables (such as the terrain, the strength of the other\
  \ wardstones, and other factors)."
