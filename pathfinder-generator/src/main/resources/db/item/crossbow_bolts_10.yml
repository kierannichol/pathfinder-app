description: "A crossbow bolt used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised\
  \ weapon (–4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical\
  \ multiplier ×2). Bolts come in a case or quiver that holds 10 bolts. All crossbows\
  \ except repeating crossbows use these kinds of crossbow bolts, which are sometimes\
  \ called \"quarrels.\""
