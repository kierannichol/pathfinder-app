description: "This wicked-looking +1 greatsword is engraved with glowing Ulfen runes\
  \ that spell out a Gorumite battle song. When wielded, the blade sheds light as\
  \ a candle. Once per day, the wielder can use rage (self only). The runes shine\
  \ with a murderous red light, equivalent to a torch, whenever the rage ability is\
  \ active and for 1 round whenever the weapon is used to deal damage to a living\
  \ creature."
