description: "This holy (or unholy) symbol is crafted from brilliantly polished clear\
  \ quartz with a facet that contains a small sapphire. When brandished, the symbol\
  \ catches and amplifies the surrounding light into a blinding flare. This has several\
  \ effects. When the bearer uses the holy symbol to channel energy (whether she channels\
  \ positive or negative energy), any creature that takes damage must succeed at a\
  \ DC 10 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1 round.\nIf the bearer casts a spell using\
  \ a brilliant flash symbol as a divine focus, she can force up to three creatures\
  \ affected by the spell to attempt a DC 10 Fortitude save; any who fail are dazzled\
  \ for 1 round in addition to any of the spell's other effects. The bearer can permanently\
  \ expend the magic inside the small sapphire to cause the creatures to instead be\
  \ blinded if they fail the save or dazzled if they succeed at it. This causes the\
  \ sapphire to crumble into fine powder.\nA brilliant flash symbol functions only\
  \ in areas with some kind of ambient light. It loses all of its powers in areas\
  \ of total darkness."
