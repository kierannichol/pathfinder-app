description: "This single, seamless glove of gray calfskin is fitted with silver finger\
  \ bones, covering the wearer's hand snugly yet stretching to accommodate movement.\
  \ Once per day, the wearer of a glove of strength-stealing may spend a free action\
  \ to activate a chill touch effect, as per the spell. Any Strength damage inflicted\
  \ by the wearer's touch for the 6 rounds it remains in effect is added to his Strength\
  \ score as an enhancement bonus (to a maximum of +6). This bonus fades 1 hour after\
  \ the glove is activated."
