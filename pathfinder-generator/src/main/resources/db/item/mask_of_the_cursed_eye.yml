description: "This mask is decorated with a staring, bloodshot eye. Anyone other than\
  \ an ally who observes the wearer using a scrying spell or pierces any of his magical\
  \ disguise (including invisibility and polymorph effects) with a divination spell\
  \ is blinded for 1d4 minutes (Fortitude DC 16 negates) and the wearer receives a\
  \ brief mental glimpse of the perpetrator. This is enough to enable scrying or teleportation\
  \ to investigate the perpetrator, but the wearer is considered to have no familiarity\
  \ with the subject. The mask can trigger only once per day, after which it falls\
  \ dormant until the next midnight."
