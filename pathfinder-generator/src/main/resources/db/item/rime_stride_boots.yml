description: "These fur-lined boots grant the wearer the ability to glide easily across\
  \ icy surfaces. While doing so, the wearer adds 15 feet to her speed, and she does\
  \ not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice. While fighting on\
  \ ice, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks and to\
  \ CMD.\nOnce per day, the wearer may cause all surfaces within a 30-foot radius\
  \ of himself to become covered in a thin sheet of ice for 10 rounds. A creature\
  \ can walk within or through this icy area at half normal speed with a successful\
  \ DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move in that round, while failure\
  \ by 5 or more means it falls. A creature using Acrobatics in this way is considered\
  \ flat-footed and loses its Dexterity bonus to AC."
