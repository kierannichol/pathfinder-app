description: "At first glance, there is nothing at all unique about this length of\
  \ woven brown wool; however, in the hands of a spellcaster it can be a devious resource.\
  \ The wearer of a diminishing sash can tear off a piece of the item and use it as\
  \ a substitute for spell components worth up to 50 gp. Each piece torn from a diminishing\
  \ sash (an action subsumed in the casting of a spell) provides components for one\
  \ spell, and multiple pieces cannot be combined to provide more expensive components.\
  \ After providing the components for 50 spells, a diminishing sash becomes a nonmagical\
  \ piece of cloth.\nIf the sash is used to generate material components for a spell\
  \ that normally uses no components or components that cost 1 gp or less, the wearer\
  \ casts the spell at +1 caster level."
