description: "This crystal retort was meticulously crafted from the hides of a dozen\
  \ shattered crysmals. When light is shone through the retort, the concoction within\
  \ glows like a golden torch. A retort of control can be used to perform spontaneous\
  \ alchemy (see pages 4–5) with speed and precision. Distillation and sublimation\
  \ can be carried out in merely 10 minutes when using this tool. In addition, if\
  \ the user speaks a command word while using spontaneous alchemy to create an alchemical\
  \ item with the retort as an additional crafting tool, she can designate one creature\
  \ type or creature subtype. The created alchemical item does not affect creatures\
  \ of the designated creature type or subtype—alchemical weapons do not harm such\
  \ creatures on a direct hit or with splash damage, alchemical remedies do not work\
  \ on such creatures, and so on."
