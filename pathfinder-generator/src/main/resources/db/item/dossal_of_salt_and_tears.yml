description: "When rolled out from the bolt, the dimensions of this banner are 3 yards\
  \ by 1-1/2 yards. It has the properties of a magic altar (Pathfinder Campaign Setting:\
  \ Inner Sea Gods 246) of Aroden. Praying at the altar grants a +2 competence bonus\
  \ on all Knowledge checks, or one of the following weapon special abilities (worshiper's\
  \ choice) to one magic weapon carried or wielded by the worshiper: axiomatic or\
  \ bane. This effect is suppressed if the weapon leaves the worshiper's grasp, but\
  \ resumes if the weapon is returned to the worshiper. Additionally, if a day's worth\
  \ of the water that drips from the dossal is collected, it acts as a vial of holy\
  \ water. These abilities function only for characters who worship Aroden or Iomedae,\
  \ and last for 24 hours. They are granted as a function of the magic of the altar\
  \ itself, not the power of the dead god.\nAs a result of Iomedae's blessing, when\
  \ the dossal is used as an altar, it also allows any cleric of Iomedae who prepares\
  \ his spells in its presence to prepare domain spells from one of the following\
  \ domains: Community, Knowledge, Law, or Protection. These are the four domains\
  \ once granted by Aroden that are not also granted by Iomedae. The cleric doesn't\
  \ gain any of the other abilities of the domain.\nWhile most altars lose their abilities\
  \ if moved, the dossal regains its power as an altar once it has been securely hung\
  \ for 24 hours. The dossal has hardness 30, 100 hp, and the ability to regain 5\
  \ hit points each round."
