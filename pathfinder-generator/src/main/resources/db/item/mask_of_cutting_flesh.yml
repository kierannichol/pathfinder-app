description: "This black leather mask is studded with bits of bone and metal, with\
  \ smooth-sewn holes for the wearer's eyes, mouth, and nostrils. It laces in the\
  \ back with long straps and covers the entire face, leaving only the ears and back\
  \ of the head exposed. The wearer gains a +2 resistance bonus on Fortitude saving\
  \ throws.\nIf Zon-Kuthon is the wearer's patron, once per day the wearer can whisper\
  \ a command word to lash out at a target within 100 feet, unerringly slashing the\
  \ target with an invisible blade of force that deals 2d4+2 points of force damage\
  \ (spell resistance applies). As a free action, the wearer can will the mask to\
  \ unlace and reshape itself into a leather cap on top of the wearer's head, or hide\
  \ itself within the wearer's shirt or helm."
