description: "Used as a replacement for the heel and sole of a shoe or boot, a puzzle\
  \ heel can be used to secret away items so you can retrieve them when needed. To\
  \ open the small compartment inside a puzzle heel, you must press, turn, and twist\
  \ the heel and sole in a particular pattern. The increased complexity of a puzzle\
  \ heel grants a circumstance bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal items, depending\
  \ on the complexity of the opening process. Opening the heel without knowing the\
  \ sequence requires a successful Disable Device check. A puzzle heel compartment\
  \ is roughly 5 cubic inches in volume."
