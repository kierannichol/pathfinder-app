description: "These sacks each include a 20-foot-long rope, from which they may be\
  \ easily suspended from a tree limb or similar anchor point. Placing foodstuffs\
  \ or fragile materials in hanging sacks is often considered a basic precaution when\
  \ camping in the wild, to prevent bears and other predators from rooting through\
  \ the sack's contents."
