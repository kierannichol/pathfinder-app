description: "This fine silver circlet typically has a carved moonstone inset on the\
  \ front or a crescent moon design. The wearer of a moon circlet gains darkvision\
  \ out to 60 feet (if she does not already possess it). Its other effects only benefit\
  \ a wearer capable of casting arcane spells.\nDuring the waxing moon, the wearer's\
  \ caster level is considered one higher for purposes of caster level checks and\
  \ spell effects; during the three nights of the full moon, this benefit increases\
  \ to two levels higher than normal. However, this additional power comes with a\
  \ price. During the waning moon, the wearer's caster level is considered one lower\
  \ for purposes of caster level checks and spell effects, and during the three nights\
  \ of the new moon, this penalty increases to two levels lower.\nRemoving a moon\
  \ circlet imposes 2 negative levels on the wearer until the next full moon (or until\
  \ the circlet is worn again, whichever comes first). These negative levels cannot\
  \ be restored by any means short of a limited wish, wish, or miracle."
