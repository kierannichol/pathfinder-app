description: "This miniature sword emblazoned with a sunburst functions as a holy\
  \ symbol of Iomedae. If Iomedae is the bearer's patron, when channeling positive\
  \ energy, the bearer can treat one die roll of a 1 as a 6 when determining the amount\
  \ of damage healed by living creatures or dealt to undead creatures. In addition,\
  \ once per day, the bearer can expend uses of his channel energy ability to dispel\
  \ a darkness spell of lower than 9th level within a 30-foot-radius burst. One use\
  \ of channel energy is consumed for every level of darkness spell dispelled this\
  \ way. If the bearer doesn't have enough uses of channel energy to match the level\
  \ of the spell, the spell is not dispelled."
