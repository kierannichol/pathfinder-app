description: "A ring of stony flesh gives the wearer's skin the appearance of flexible\
  \ stone. Once per day, the wearer can expend a charge as a standard action to gain\
  \ the benefits of stoneskin. While under this effect, the wearer gains the earth\
  \ glide ability, allowing her to move through unworked stone or earth as easily\
  \ as a fish swims through water. The wearer cannot move through stone composed of\
  \ multiple blocks—such as the walls of a tomb or castle—with this ability, only\
  \ through solid masses of stone. In addition, a ring of stony flesh automatically\
  \ nullifies any petrification effect that targets the wearer by expending 2 charges,\
  \ provided the ring has at least 2 charges remaining. The ring's protection effect\
  \ activates before the wearer attempts a saving throw against the petrification\
  \ attempt. A ring of stony flesh has 10 charges when created."
