description: "This exclusive perfume is produced using dragon musk, which is integral\
  \ to draconic mating rituals. Dragon musk is secreted in dragons' oil glands, and\
  \ harvesting it is a very delicate procedure. Though only mildly fragrant, dragon\
  \ musk can elicit a variety of effects when added to perfume. The effect depends\
  \ largely on the other ingredients in the perfume, but a single application of draconic\
  \ perfume lasts only 1 hour, regardless of its specific properties. Some of the\
  \ more common additives are listed below.\nRosewood and myrrh: This concoction is\
  \ an aphrodisiac, and any creature wearing this perfume gains a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus on Diplomacy checks and increases the DCs of any charm subschool spells\
  \ cast during this time by 2.\nSage, bergamot, and cedar ash: This pungent aroma\
  \ has an imposing effect. Any creature wearing this perfume gains a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus on Intimidate checks and does not take any penalties for attempting to Intimidate\
  \ a larger opponent.\nSulfur and honeycomb: This aroma is sometimes called \"Hell's\
  \ Smell.\" Any creature wearing this scent gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff\
  \ checks and increases the DC of any compulsion subschool spells cast during this\
  \ time by 2.\nEach vial of draconic perfume contains 1 application of the scent.\
  \ Producing draconic perfume requires 1 vial of musk, the Dragoncrafting feat, and\
  \ a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
