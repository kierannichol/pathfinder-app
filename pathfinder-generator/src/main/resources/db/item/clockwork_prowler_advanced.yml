description: "A more advanced version of the clockwork prowler, this device is more\
  \ metal than wood. It moves at a speed of 20 feet and can be programmed with up\
  \ to four right-angle turns. Each turn requires 1 round to program along with a\
  \ DC 15 Disable Device check. If this check is failed, roll d% each time the prowler\
  \ attempts to turn. On a result of 1–10, it fails to turn. On a result of 11–20,\
  \ it instead turns on the next round. An advanced clockwork prowler can carry up\
  \ to 60 pounds of weight at full speed, or up to 120 pounds at a speed of 10 feet.\
  \ It has hardness 10, 150 hit points, and when in motion has AC 15 (a motionless\
  \ advanced clockwork prowler has AC 8)."
