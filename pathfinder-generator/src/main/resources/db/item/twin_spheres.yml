description: "Rumored to have once been a single, normal sphere split in two through\
  \ a failed attempt to destroy it, these dual spheres of annihilation are linked,\
  \ such that objects devoured by one may be disgorged from the other. Anything devoured\
  \ by one of the twin spheres must make a Fortitude save (DC 25) or be utterly consumed\
  \ as by a normal sphere; anything that makes the save take 10d6 points of damage\
  \ in transit and is hurled, smoking and partially disintegrated, from the maw of\
  \ the other sphere. Anyone currently in mental control of one sphere may freely\
  \ pass through it to the location of its twin."
destruction: "The twin spheres can be destroyed by directing one sphere through the\
  \ other, causing an explosion that deals 20d6 damage to everything within 100 feet."
