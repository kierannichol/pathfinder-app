description: "This ring is made of black steel and is eerily cold to the touch. Once\
  \ per day as a swift action, when the wearer hits a living creature with an unarmed\
  \ attack, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or take 1d4\
  \ point of Strength damage in addition to the attack's normal damage. If the target\
  \ of the attack takes any Strength damage from this attack, the ring's wearer gains\
  \ a +2 enhancement bonus to her Strength for 1 minute."
