description: "This mechanical backpack is a mess of gears and cogs, with two large\
  \ canvas wings extending out from it to rise over the wearer's shoulders. When the\
  \ wearer touches the button on the pack's chest harness, the wings whir to life\
  \ and begin flapping rapidly, hauling the wearer awkwardly into the air.\nLesser\
  \ wings of flying grant the wearer a fly speed of 30 feet (poor maneuverability)."
