description: "Specifically constructed for samurai, katanas employ multiple types\
  \ of steel combined in a distinctive forging process. The result are swords noted\
  \ for their wickedly sharp yet slender, gently curved blades, designed to make graceful\
  \ hacking strokes capable of severing opponents' heads and limbs. Though finely\
  \ balanced, these blades are difficult to master. Characters can use a katana two-handed\
  \ as a martial weapon, but must take the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (katana) feat\
  \ to use it one-handed."
