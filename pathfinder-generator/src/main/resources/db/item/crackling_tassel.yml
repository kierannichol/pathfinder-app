description: "A common accoutrement often crafted by worshipers of Hei Feng, these\
  \ magical tassels are usually affixed to the pommels of bladed weapons, though they\
  \ can be fastened to other weapons as well. The tassel has no effect unless attached\
  \ to a weapon, and even then, it activates only under certain conditions.\nThe wielder\
  \ gains a +4 circumstance bonus on performance combat checks (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate\
  \ Combat 153). When the wielder takes a standard action to fight defensively, the\
  \ next attack that misses her before the start of her next round causes the attacker\
  \ to take 3d6 points of electricity damage. Once the electricity is discharged,\
  \ the crackling tassel can't be used again for 24 hours."
