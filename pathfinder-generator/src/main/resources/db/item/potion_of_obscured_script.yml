name: "Potion of Obscured Script"
description: "You create a latent illusion that clouds the judgment and reading ability\
  \ of any creature that examines a targeted text. While casting the spell, you can\
  \ designate up to one creature other than yourself per level to be immune to the\
  \ effects. All other creatures that read the text must succeed at a Will save or\
  \ find it difficult to properly parse and decipher the contents. This increases\
  \ the DC of Linguistics checks to decipher the text by an amount equal to your caster\
  \ level (maximum +10), and it increases the DC of the Wisdom check to avoid drawing\
  \ a false conclusion by an equal amount. Unaffected creatures gain a circumstance\
  \ bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +10) on Bluff checks to deceive affected\
  \ creatures about the text's contents. The spell obscures any magical glyphs, runes,\
  \ or symbols within the text, increasing the Perception DC to find such traps by\
  \ an amount equal to half your caster level (maximum +5). Obscured script can be\
  \ made permanent with a permanency spell by a caster of 10th level or higher for\
  \ the cost of 5,000 gp."
