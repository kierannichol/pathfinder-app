description: "This sheath is designed to be strapped around your forearm, but it is\
  \ too bulky to be hidden under a long sleeve. It can hold one forearm-length item,\
  \ such as a dagger, dart, potion, scroll containing a single spell, or wand. As\
  \ a swift action, you can bend your wrist to cause the sheathed item to drop into\
  \ your hand (provoking attacks of opportunity as normal for retrieving an item).\
  \ Placing an item in the sheath is a full-round action that provokes attacks of\
  \ opportunity. You can wear only one wrist sheath per arm that you have."
