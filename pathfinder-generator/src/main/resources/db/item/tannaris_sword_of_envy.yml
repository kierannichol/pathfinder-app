description: "A purely cosmetic magical effect causes the elegant blade of this sword\
  \ to cycle through distinctive colors and textures, making it appear to be crafted\
  \ from massive pieces of gemstone, coral, or precious metals. Tannaris is a +5 defending\
  \ bastard sword. When used to augment the wielder's Armor Class, the sword's enhancement\
  \ bonus continues to augment attacks and damage. Additionally, whenever Tannaris\
  \ hits a creature under the effects of a spell, the target must succeed at a DC\
  \ 20 Will saving throw or have the highest-level spell currently affecting it instantly\
  \ dispelled (as if by the spell dispel magic; no additional dispel check is required).\
  \ This ability has no special effect on summoned creatures or persistent spell effects.\
  \ If the attack is a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 25 Will saving\
  \ throw or have all of the spells currently affecting it dispelled (as per the spell\
  \ greater dispel magic; no additional dispel checks are required)."
destruction: "If Runelord Belimarius issues a command as a standard action, Tannaris\
  \ is destroyed."
