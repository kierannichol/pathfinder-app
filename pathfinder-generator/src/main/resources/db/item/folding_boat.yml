description: "A folding boat looks like a small wooden box about 12 inches long, 6\
  \ inches wide, and 6 inches deep when it is inactive. In this mode, it can be used\
  \ to store items just like any other box. Yet when the proper command word is given,\
  \ the box unfolds itself rapidly in the space of a single round to form a boat 10\
  \ feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. A second command word causes it to\
  \ unfold even further into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The\
  \ folding boat cannot unfold if there isn't enough open space for it to occupy once\
  \ unfolded. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside the boat or ship.\n\
  In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen\
  \ sail. In its larger form, the boat has a deck, single rowing seats, five sets\
  \ of oars, a rudder, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The\
  \ boat can hold four people comfortably, while the ship carries 15 with ease.\n\
  A third word of command causes the boat or ship to fold itself into a box once again,\
  \ but only when it is unoccupied."
