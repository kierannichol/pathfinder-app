description: "Fine plates of articulated steel reinforce these elbow-length leather\
  \ gloves, which are designed to allow animal handlers and animal hunters alike to\
  \ confront beasts with natural defenses like spines and quills. While wearing the\
  \ gloves, you gain DR 2/magic against attacks of opportunity provoked when you attempt\
  \ a combat maneuver check to grapple a creature. You also gain this damage reduction\
  \ and a +1 circumstance bonus on Reflex saves against defensive abilities that deal\
  \ damage when you strike a creature with a nonreach weapon, unarmed strike, or natural\
  \ attack. The thick gloves restrict your movement, imposing a â€“2 penalty on precision-based\
  \ skill checks that involve your hands (such as using Disable Device to pick a lock)"
