description: "These thick brass and leather gauntlets allow the wearer to tear through\
  \ bone and muscle like paper. Once per day, as part of a melee attack, the wearer\
  \ can activate the gauntlets to inflict a horrific injury on an opponent. If the\
  \ attack hits, the target must make a DC 14 Will save. If the save fails, the gauntlets\
  \ reduce the target's Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution (wearer's choice) by\
  \ â€“6. This penalty cannot reduce the target's ability score below 1. The injury\
  \ heals over time, reducing the penalty by 1 for each day that passes since the\
  \ time of the injury, and is immediately removed by heal, regenerate, restoration,\
  \ or any magic that can break a curse."
