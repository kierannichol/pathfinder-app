description: "These dense pebbles are sometimes used by drow skirmishers for both\
  \ offense and defense. If a stalagmite seed is thrown, it has a range increment\
  \ of 20 feet. If it's slung, treat it as a sling bullet. If the attack misses, roll\
  \ for misdirection as if it were a splash weapon.\nWhen a stalagmite seed strikes\
  \ a natural stone surface, a stone stalagmite immediately emerges where it landed,\
  \ filling the 5-foot square and growing to 10 feet in height. Any creature occupying\
  \ the square takes 5d6 points of piercing and bludgeoning damage and is knocked\
  \ prone. Any creature that succeeds at a DC 14 Reflex save takes half damage and\
  \ is not knocked prone."
