description: "This small, weathered journal contains 10,000 jokes that change to be\
  \ perfectly suited for particular audiences. The book grants its owner a +5 bonus\
  \ on any Diplomacy check to influence the attitude of a creature. Additionally,\
  \ up to three times per day the book can be used to cast hideous laughter (Will\
  \ DC 13 negates).\nBy expending one use of mythic power as a standard action, the\
  \ book's reader can make a brutal verbal tirade mocking a creature. The target creature\
  \ is enraged per the rage spell, and all other enemies within 30 feet of the target\
  \ begin laughing uncontrollably, as hideous laughter (Will DC 14 negates either\
  \ effect). The book contains only one perfect joke for any given creature, so attempting\
  \ to use the book on a creature a second time yields no effect."
