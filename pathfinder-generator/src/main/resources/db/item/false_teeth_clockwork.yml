description: "These prosthetics are used as a replacement for lost or missing teeth.\
  \ False teeth fashioned from wood or animal teeth are more common, while masterwork\
  \ varieties are sculpted from bone or porcelain. Clockwork false teeth are novelties\
  \ with mechanisms allowing the teeth to clatter and move on their own. Winding the\
  \ clockworks is a move action, and the teeth move forward over flat surfaces at\
  \ a rate of 5 feet per round for 10 rounds after one winding."
