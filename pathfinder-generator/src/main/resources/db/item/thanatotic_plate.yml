description: "This jet-black +3 unrighteous full plate is made in the image of the\
  \ armor worn by thanatotic titans and grants the wearer a fragment of their immense\
  \ power. The wearer of thanatotic plate gains SR 21 against divine spells. In addition,\
  \ the wearer can speak a command word to gain the benefits of air walk, break enchantment,\
  \ or spell turning once per day each. Once per week, the wearer can use greater\
  \ planar ally to call upon a tarry demodand.\nA newly created set of thanatotic\
  \ plate always includes a thanatotic visage; this is included in the price and weight.\
  \ A set of thanatotic plate missing its visage has its price reduced by that of\
  \ the visage.\nA nonevil character who dons thanatotic plate immediately gains 4\
  \ negative levels; these negative levels can't be removed or ignored, but they disappear\
  \ when the armor is removed."
