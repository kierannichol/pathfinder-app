description: "Applying this herbal salve to a bleeding wound cures 1 point of damage\
  \ and prevents additional damage from bleeding for 1 hour per application. After\
  \ an hour, if the bleed effect hasn't been properly treated, the injury resumes\
  \ bleeding and more salve must be applied. Though blood-clotter salve can be applied\
  \ successively to the same injury, applying multiple doses doesn't cure additional\
  \ damage."
