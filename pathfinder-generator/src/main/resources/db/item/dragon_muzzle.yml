description: "This large leather muzzle is reinforced with steel chains, and is specifically\
  \ shaped for a dragon's snout. The muzzle is also treated with one type of elemental\
  \ proofing (see below) to prevent it from being destroyed by the dragon's breath\
  \ weapon. The muzzle has hardness 10, 40 hp, and a break DC of 30. A dragon muzzle\
  \ can be fitted on a dragon using the rules to tie up a pinned creature. A standard\
  \ dragon muzzle can be resized to fit dragons from size Tiny to Large. For larger\
  \ versions, the weight increases by a factor of 4 and the price doubles for each\
  \ size increase."
