description: "Adapted from the weapons of the Clicking Caverns' mysterious clockwork\
  \ soldiers, this +1 keen short sword is modified with ticking clockwork components.\
  \ Technomagical internal mechanisms help the blade strike true when it would otherwise\
  \ deliver a glancing blow. Once per day, when the wielder deals sneak attack or\
  \ precision damage with this weapon, she can reroll the sneak attack or precision\
  \ damage dice after the damage is rolled, but before the damage is applied. When\
  \ the damage dice are rerolled with this ability, they are reduced by one step (for\
  \ example, d6s become d4s, and d8s become d6s)."
