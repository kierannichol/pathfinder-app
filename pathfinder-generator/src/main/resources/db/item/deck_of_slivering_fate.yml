description: "The 54 cards in this +1 limning harrow deck have more violent imagery\
  \ than a standard harrow deck, and each card has a thin metallic frill around its\
  \ edges. When the wielder uses a card from this deck with the Deadly Dealer feat\
  \ (see page 15), the metallic frills become taut and sharp. When they are used in\
  \ this way, the cards deal slashing damage instead of piercing, and the bonus damage\
  \ from the Arcane Strike feat is doubled."
