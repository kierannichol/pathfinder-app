description: "The first revelation quills were created by the followers of the Peacock\
  \ Spirit. Since the fall of Thassilon, the method for creating them has been lost.\
  \ The few revelation quills that remain today continue to function, drawing their\
  \ revelations, it is said, from the Peacock Spirit itself. The quill is fashioned\
  \ from a peacock's tail feather. Its nib is made of bone, and when held in one's\
  \ hand, the quill seems strangely heavy. If placed in an empty vial or other glass\
  \ container of similar size and left there for an hour, a revelation quill fills\
  \ that container with ink. The ink created is of a random color 50% of the time,\
  \ otherwise the ink is black.\nWhile a revelation quill can certainly function as\
  \ a standard writing implement, its true strength lies in its ability to answer\
  \ questions. Once per day, if the user concentrates on a specific future goal, event,\
  \ or activity occurring within the coming week, the revelation quill takes over\
  \ and writes out a short phrase in response, often in the form of a cryptic rhyme\
  \ or omen, much in the same way the divination spell functions. Once per week, the\
  \ user may use the quill in the same way to cast contact other plane instead, asking\
  \ up to 10 questions of the mysterious intellect that guides the revelation quill."
destruction: "The quill must be tricked into revealing the method of destroying itself\
  \ without asking it to reveal that method."
