description: "These unmarked bracers of oxidized steel slip easily onto the wrists.\
  \ As a swift action while submerged underwater, the wearer can tap the bracers together,\
  \ causing the bracers and any armor he wears to immediately be removed. Removed\
  \ armor is disassembled, becomes incredibly buoyant, and floats to the surface.\
  \ After 4 hours, if the items are still in the water, they lose their buoyancy and\
  \ sink."
