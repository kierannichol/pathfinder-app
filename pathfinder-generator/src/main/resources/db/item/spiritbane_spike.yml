description: "When you slash this alchemically treated iron spike against your flesh—\
  a move action that deals 1d6 points of damage— the spike extends and becomes a short\
  \ sword with the ghost touch weapon special ability. The spike reverts to its old\
  \ form after 10 minutes, corroded and useless. Should a spiritbane spike rematerialize\
  \ within a corporeal body, it is shunted to the nearest empty space without effect.\
  \ Crafting this item requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
