description: "This silver powder typically comes in a fist-sized leather bag. When\
  \ poured on the ground, the dust animates over the course of 1 round to scribble\
  \ silver thaumaturgic script and symbols in a circular pattern with a 20-foot radius.\
  \ This circle acts as the perfectly scribed special diagram of a magic circle against\
  \ chaos, evil, good, or law and bars extradimensional movement as if the user had\
  \ attached dimensional anchor to the magic circle. The scribed circle lasts 24 hours.\
  \ A bag of thaumaturgic powder can be used only once.\nAn extraplanar creature of\
  \ the appropriate alignment that is called or summoned into the circle can attempt\
  \ to break through the circle once during the circle's duration, just as if trying\
  \ to break free from a lesser planar binding spell with either its spell resistance\
  \ or a DC 26 Charisma check."
