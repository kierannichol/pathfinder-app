description: "You can mentally communicate with any other creature within 100 feet\
  \ that has a language. It is possible to address multiple creatures at once telepathically,\
  \ although maintaining a telepathic conversation with more than one creature at\
  \ a time is just as difficult as speaking and listening to multiple people simultaneously."
