description: "The following suit of armor is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThanks to the unusually light and fine links\
  \ of this halfling-made +2 chain shirt, it imposes no armor check penalty and the\
  \ wearer's maximum Dexterity bonus is +5. After a melee attack hits the wearer,\
  \ he can take a 5-foot step as an immediate action, even if he already took a 5-foot\
  \ step during his turn. Taking such a step does not interfere with the wearer's\
  \ movement during his next turn. A suit of mail of sly steps is usually sized for\
  \ Small creatures."
