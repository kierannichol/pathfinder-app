description: "This beautifully carved stone fountain is decorated with figures of\
  \ dancing fey creatures and holds pure, shimmering water that glows with silvery\
  \ light. The moon-goddess Acavna gave the Argental Font to the city of Saventh-Yhi\
  \ at its founding as a gift in gratitude for the heroine Savith's valor. Anyone\
  \ drinking from the fountain enjoys the combined benefits of greater restoration\
  \ and heal, and is immediately cured of all afflictions, including ability damage\
  \ or drain, negative levels, and insanities. The waters cannot return the dead to\
  \ life, though an undead creature immersed in the fountain is immediately destroyed\
  \ (no save). The fountain never runs dry, no matter how many times it is used or\
  \ how much water is taken from it, but the water retains its potency for only 1\
  \ round after being removed from the fountain, becoming normal water thereafter.\
  \ The font can only be moved from its location with a miracle or wish spell. An\
  \ individual creature can only benefit from the effects of the Argental Font once\
  \ per year."
destruction: "If a good celestial creature of at least 10 Hit Dice ever willingly\
  \ commits suicide while in the font's waters, the fountain ceases to flow and its\
  \ waters lose all special properties."
