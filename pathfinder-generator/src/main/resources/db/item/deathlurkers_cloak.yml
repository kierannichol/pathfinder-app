description: "This drab gray cloak billows about as if blown by an invisible wind.\
  \ Once per day, the wearer can use doom, which causes a deathlike shadow to fleetingly\
  \ cross the wearer's face.\nIf Groetus is the wearer's patron, once per day the\
  \ wearer can use false life. If the wearer successfully delivers a coup de grace\
  \ against a dying foe while false life is active, the wearer's temporary hit points\
  \ from the false life effect increase by 1 (to a maximum of 20 temporary hit points).\
  \ The dying creature must have at least as many Hit Dice as the wearer for this\
  \ effect to occur."
