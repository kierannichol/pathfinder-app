description: "This vial contains a large snowflake that melts only at temperatures\
  \ of 140 degrees Fahrenheit or above. Perfect ice is an alchemically engineered\
  \ form of water that briefly converts any moisture it touches into a similar state.\
  \ When a flask of perfect ice is opened or broken (such as by being thrown as a\
  \ splash weapon), the snowflake within expands rapidly, forming a layer of ice and\
  \ snow with a 60-foot radius along any nearby surface. Any living creature that\
  \ touches an area of perfect ice or starts its turn in a space of perfect ice takes\
  \ 4d6 points of damage from desiccation as some of the water in its body crystallizes\
  \ (Fortitude DC 18 half). Creatures with the water subtype take half again as much\
  \ damage (150%) and receive no saving throw. The ice crystals that form along flat\
  \ surfaces are large and strong, and are treated as caltrops. The ice persists for\
  \ 10 minutes, after which it vaporizes or reverts to a normal state for its temperature.\
  \ To avoid the hazards of its large area of effect, many users propel the vial from\
  \ a launching crossbow (Pathfinder Player Companion: Adventurer's Armory 4) or use\
  \ similar means to extend their throwing range."
