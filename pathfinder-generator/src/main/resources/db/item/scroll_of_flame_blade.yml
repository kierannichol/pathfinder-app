name: "Scroll of Flame Blade"
description: "A 3-foot-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your\
  \ hand. You wield this blade-like beam as if it were a scimitar. Attacks with the\
  \ flame blade are melee touch attacks. The blade deals 1d8 points of fire damage\
  \ + 1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). Since the blade is immaterial,\
  \ your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. A flame blade can ignite\
  \ combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth."
