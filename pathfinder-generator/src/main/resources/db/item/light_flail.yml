description: "A light flail consists of a weighted striking end connected to a handle\
  \ by a sturdy chain. Though often imagined as a ball, sometimes spiked like the\
  \ head of a morningstar, the head of a light flail can actually take many different\
  \ shapes, such as short bars. Military flails are sturdier evolutions of agricultural\
  \ flails, which are used for threshingâ€”beating stacks of grains to separate the\
  \ useful grains from their husks."
