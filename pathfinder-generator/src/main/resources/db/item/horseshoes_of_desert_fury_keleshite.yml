description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis set of horseshoes is inscribed with binding\
  \ runes to contain the essence of a minor spirit of fire. With a command word from\
  \ the wearer or the wearer's rider, the horseshoes burst into flames which do not\
  \ harm the wearer, but cause the wearer's hooves to function as +1 flaming weapons\
  \ for the duration of the effect. The flames can remain active for up to 80 minutes.\
  \ The duration need not be consecutive, but must be spent in 10-minute increments.\n\
  Three times per day, a Keleshite wearer or rider can speak another command word\
  \ to cause the horseshoes to kick up a cloud of choking sand similar to solid fog\
  \ centered on the wearer's current position; the sand builds up gradually and doesn't\
  \ impede movement until the wearer exits the affected area, at which point it immediately\
  \ takes effect. Creatures that begin their turn in the area of the sand must succeed\
  \ at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be sickened for as long as they remain in the area\
  \ and for 1d4 minutes thereafter."
