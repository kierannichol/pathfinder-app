description: "This multicolored headband with beaded tassels tips luck in the wearer's\
  \ favor. The wearer gains a +1 luck bonus on saving throws.\nAny effect that gives\
  \ the wearer a luck bonus (such as a divine favor or prayer spell) or explicitly\
  \ increases the wearer's good luck (such as a witch's fortune hex, the Luck domain's\
  \ bit of luck domain power, and so on) lasts for 1 round longer than normal on the\
  \ wearer. Abilities without a time-based duration (such as carrying a stone of good\
  \ luck) are unaffected by the headband."
