description: "The cubic spiral regulates the environment around it when directed by\
  \ a knowledgeable operator. Shallow gouges on one side of the block serve as a bed\
  \ in which up to 20 tiny clusters of cubic minerals blossom and grow. Plucking a\
  \ cluster is a standard action, and plucked clusters regrow on the relic in 1 month.\
  \ Plucked clusters have no powers of their own, but inserting a cluster into one\
  \ of the six holes in the cubic spiral as a standard action activates one of the\
  \ artifact's functions. Once a user activates a function of the cubic spiral, the\
  \ function remains active until complete (if a limitation is specified below), until\
  \ the user commands the artifact to cease its function, or until the user is no\
  \ longer within 1,000 feet. Except for the diminution function, the cubic spiral\
  \ can engage in only one function at a time.\nDiminution (front facing, smallest\
  \ hole): The cubic spiral shrinks to any size between its full size and 1 foot in\
  \ height, as commanded. The weight of the artifact decreases proportionally with\
  \ its height; at its smallest size, it weighs 150 pounds.\nDrill (front facing,\
  \ middle hole): This function activates only if the cubic spiral is at its smallest\
  \ size. The cubic spiral spins and pushes its way relentlessly in an indicated direction,\
  \ boring an 18-inch-diameter hole into solid objects at a rate of 10 feet per round.\
  \ The cubic spiral can bore through any material with a hardness of less than 20.\
  \ Creatures can move easily out of the way of the spinning artifact, but those that\
  \ don't take 20d6 points of slashing damage (no save). The user indicates a maximum\
  \ distance when this function is activated, up to 1,000 feet. Once it has reached\
  \ this distance, or if it cannot proceed to the full distance, the cubic spiral\
  \ returns to the user through the borehole.\nSlide (front facing, largest hole):\
  \ The cubic spiral slides rapidly in an indicated direction at a speed of 100 feet\
  \ per round. This movement need not be along the ground, as the artifact can slide\
  \ through the air or across water. The cubic spiral deals 20d6 points of bludgeoning\
  \ damage to creatures and objects in its path (Reflex DC 20 negates). If it's not\
  \ at its full size, reduce the damage dealt by 1d6 for each foot smaller than its\
  \ full size. The user indicates a maximum distance when this function is activated,\
  \ up to 1,000 feet. The cubic spiral's slide stops at the end of this distance or\
  \ if it encounters a wall or other impassable object. If airborne at the end of\
  \ its slide, it falls but takes no damage regardless of the distance fallen.\nTemperature\
  \ Regulation (rear facing, smallest hole): The cubic spiral radiates waves of heat\
  \ or cold to adjust the temperature within 1,000 feet. The user indicates a temperature\
  \ between -20˚ F and 140˚ F, and the artifact maintains that temperature within\
  \ the area.\nTornado (rear facing, middle hole): The cubic spiral spins quickly\
  \ in place, creating an effect like a stationary tornado (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook\
  \ 439) within 100 feet and creating severe winds within 1,000 feet.\nVacuum (rear\
  \ facing, largest hole): The cubic spiral destroys all air adjacent to it each round.\
  \ Creatures adjacent to the artifact can't speak, use breath weapons, cast spells\
  \ with verbal components, or do anything else that requires breathing. If the cubic\
  \ spiral is in a sealed chamber, air-breathing creatures in the chamber eventually\
  \ suffocate."
destruction: "The cubic spiral is destroyed if a mindless user directs it to use its\
  \ drill function on itself."
