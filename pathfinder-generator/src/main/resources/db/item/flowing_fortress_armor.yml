description: "This pale-blue +2 breastplate is made from flowing ocean water enchanted\
  \ to retain its shape. The armor check penalty of a suit of flowing fortress armor\
  \ doesn't apply to Swim checks. When the wearer speaks a command word, the armor\
  \ flows on or off the wearer, allowing it to be donned or removed with a single\
  \ move action from up to 10 feet away.\nA suit of flowing fortress armor has 3 charges,\
  \ which refresh automatically every day at sunrise. By spending 1 charge as a standard\
  \ action, the wearer transforms into water for one of two effects.\nGush: The wearer\
  \ transforms into water and bursts forward like a geyser up to 40 feet in any direction,\
  \ then returns to her normal form, allowing her to cross chasms or vault obstacles.\
  \ The wearer may attempt bull rush combat maneuvers against any creatures and moveable\
  \ objects along her path, regardless of size. The wearer rolls a single combat maneuver\
  \ check and applies the result to each creature within the area. This bull rush\
  \ does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the wearer encounters an immovable\
  \ object, she may attempt a Strength check to destroy that object as a free action.\
  \ On a failed bull rush combat maneuver check or Strength check, the wearer's progress\
  \ is stopped and she reforms next to the obstacle that blocked her path.\nMelt:\
  \ The wearer melts into a puddle, gaining a swim speed of 60 feet, the ability to\
  \ flow through any space a Tiny creature could squeeze through, and a +8 circumstance\
  \ bonus on Stealth checks. The wearer can see and hear normally, but can't speak,\
  \ attack, or cast spells in this form. This transformation lasts up to 10 minutes,\
  \ but may be dismissed as a free action."
