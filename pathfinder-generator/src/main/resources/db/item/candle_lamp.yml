description: "A candle lamp is a small lanternlike device with glass panels and a\
  \ slot to hold a candle. It protects the candle from drafts and catches wax drippings.\
  \ It provides the same light as a candle, but can be shuttered such that it only\
  \ illuminates 1 to 3 adjacent squares. You can use a candle lamp to keep your hands\
  \ warm."
