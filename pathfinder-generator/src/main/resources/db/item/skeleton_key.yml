description: "Many door locks have a similar design and thus can be unlocked by a\
  \ similar key. A skeleton key may be tried on any standard door lock that uses a\
  \ key, even if you don't have the Disable Device skill. You use the key's Disable\
  \ Device bonus of +10 rather than your own total; you cannot take 10 when using\
  \ a skeleton key. The key only gets one roll for any particular lock. If the roll\
  \ fails, the key is unable to open or close that lock. Inferior skeleton keys may\
  \ only have a +5 bonus."
