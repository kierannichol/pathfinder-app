description: "A creature wearing this thick necklace is automatically aware of all\
  \ constructs within 60 feet as per the lifesense ability but only sensing constructs.\
  \ Constructs can't see, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of the wearer, even\
  \ when using extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities such as blindsense,\
  \ blindsight, scent, or tremorsense. If the wearer touches a construct or attacks\
  \ any creature, this concealing ability ceases to function for 1 minute. Constructs\
  \ with an Intelligence score of 3 or greater can attempt a DC 18 Will save to detect\
  \ the wearer."
