description: "The cloak of moral refraction has long been a tool of the riftwardens—\
  \ mystics who charge themselves with maintaining cosmic balance and closing extraplanar\
  \ portals throughout the multiverse. The shimmering fabric of this light silver-and-red\
  \ cloak never dirties or wrinkles, and when laid out flat, the cloak reflects light\
  \ nearly as well as a mirror.\nA fully charged cloak of moral refraction has 3 charges—\
  \ charges used are automatically renewed at a rate of 1 charge per day at dawn.\
  \ The wearer may use the cloak to expend these charges and create the following\
  \ effects."
