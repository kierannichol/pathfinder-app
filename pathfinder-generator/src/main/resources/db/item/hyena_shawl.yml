description: "When wrapped around the neck and jaw, this swath of black cloth lets\
  \ its wearer see normally in a sandstorm (her vision isn't reduced, nor does she\
  \ take the –4 penalty on Perception checks) and avoid taking nonlethal damage from\
  \ the storm.\nOnce per day on command, the shawl's wearer can emit a strange cackling.\
  \ Enemies within 30 feet of the shawl's wearer who can hear the cackling must succeed\
  \ at a DC 16 Will saving throw or become frightened for 1 round. Those who succeed\
  \ at the saving throw are shaken for 1d4 rounds instead. Both of the cackle's effects\
  \ are sonic mind-affecting fear effects."
