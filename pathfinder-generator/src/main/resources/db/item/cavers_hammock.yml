description: "This soft, billowy hammock weighs next to nothing and folds up small\
  \ enough to fit into a pocket. Its magic renders the hammock both lightweight and\
  \ incredibly strong, able to support up to 500 pounds. With a command word, the\
  \ hammock affixes to any relatively flat, overhead surface or any two sturdy surfaces\
  \ up to 10 feet apart. The hammock refuses to adhere to surfaces not strong enough\
  \ to support the hammock at full capacity.\nOnce affixed, a caver's hammock takes\
  \ on a dark gray, pebbly appearance like that of a typical cavern wall. Anyone attempting\
  \ to spot the hammock in an underground or naturally rocky setting must make a DC\
  \ 30 Spot check. Creatures with darkvision gain no special bonus to notice a caver's\
  \ hammock, but creatures with blindsense or scent have no additional difficulty\
  \ in noticing an occupant of a caver's hammock."
