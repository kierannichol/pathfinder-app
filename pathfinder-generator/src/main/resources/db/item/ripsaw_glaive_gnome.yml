description: "The blade of this glaive is serrated and mounted on an axle, around\
  \ which a heavy cord is wrapped. When the cord is pulled as a move action, the blade\
  \ spins rapidly for a number of rounds equal to your Strength bonus. While the blade\
  \ is spinning, you gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls with the weapon. When the blade\
  \ is not spinning, treat this weapon as a glaive."
