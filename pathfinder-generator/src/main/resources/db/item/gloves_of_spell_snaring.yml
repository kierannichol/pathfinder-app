description: "These thin gloves are covered in reflective glyphs and sigils, and the\
  \ palms are slightly tacky. Like gloves of arrow snaring, twice per day the wearer\
  \ can act as if she had the Snatch Arrow feat, even if she doesn't meet the prerequisites\
  \ for that feat. In addition, the wearer can expend one of this item's uses per\
  \ day to use the Snatch Arrows feat on a projectile targeting an ally in a space\
  \ adjacent to her.\nAs an immediate action, the wearer can expend one use of mythic\
  \ power and one of this item's uses per day to block a spell targeting her or an\
  \ adjacent ally, as the parry spell guardian path ability (see page 30)."
