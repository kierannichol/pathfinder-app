description: "A holy symbol focuses positive energy and is used by good clerics and\
  \ paladins (or by neutral clerics who want to cast good spells or channel positive\
  \ energy). Each religion has its own holy symbol. The material used to make the\
  \ holy symbol has no effect on its powers, though a religion may place special significance\
  \ on a particular material.\nUnholy Symbols: An unholy symbol is like a holy symbol\
  \ except that it focuses negative energy and is used by evil clerics (or by neutral\
  \ clerics who want to cast evil spells or channel negative energy)."
