description: "Within a wheel of worlds lie all possibilities and none, and while those\
  \ who use them touch countless worlds, their journeys end the same way. A wheel\
  \ of worlds appears as a spherical astrolabe the size of a human skull. Rings of\
  \ bronze, dark adamantine, and steel form a shifting shell, and as each band moves\
  \ it reveals another below. These rings bear spidery symbols, marking and measuring\
  \ the location of celestial bodies. Many researchers who obsess over these devices\
  \ claim that within their shells lies the truth of the heavens and beyond. Most\
  \ realize too late, however, that the truth they seek is not one any mortal should\
  \ know.\nA wheel of worlds creates gates to other planes. Using it causes a portal\
  \ to open to a random plane for 1 minute (roll on the table below to determine the\
  \ destination). The portal is not transparent, thus preventing a view of the plane\
  \ beyond, though the artifact's user is given an impression of what lies beyond.\
  \ The user can then either travel to that plane or call through a creature native\
  \ to that realm. Doing either immediately closes the gate. If the bearer wishes,\
  \ she can attempt to open a portal to a specific plane by manipulating the rings\
  \ of the artifact, a complex series of adjustments requiring a successful DC 25\
  \ Wisdom check. Failing such a check by 5 or less still results in a destination\
  \ determined by a random roll on the table, but the artifact's user can select whether\
  \ the destination is that plane or the next or previous plane listed on the table,\
  \ exerting some influence over the gate.\nWithin a wheel of worlds lies a trap.\
  \ Every time a wielder uses the astrolabe, its rings collapse and reveal stranger,\
  \ more profane markings within. The GM should track each use of the artifact. After\
  \ every portal opened, there is a cumulative 1% chance that next time the portal\
  \ is used it opens not to the randomly generated plane, but to the corresponding\
  \ layer of Hell noted on the chart. Every attempt to manipulate the artifact to\
  \ reach a specific plane (whether successful or not) increases this chance by 3%.\
  \ When the Wheel of Worlds unexpectedly opens to Hell, the wielder is given a wrong\
  \ impression of the plane beyond, believing the gate has opened to the expected\
  \ plane (or to a different layer of Hell, if Hell was the expected plane) rather\
  \ than to the actual layer of Hell. If she attempts to summon a creature through\
  \ the gate that is not a native of Hell, a random devil is conjured. This devil\
  \ is not under the user's control and attempts to destroy the summoner.\nEvery creature\
  \ that uses a wheel of worlds has its own percent chance of this diabolical malfunction,\
  \ which can never be reduced. Should a creature ever reach a 100% chance of opening\
  \ a gate to a layer of Hell, a wheel of worlds instantly shifts both itself and\
  \ its wielder to a random layer of Hell upon its next use."
destruction: "Each wheel of worlds has coded into its workings an \"anathema location.\"\
  \ If the wheel is used to open a gate to that specific planar location, it instead\
  \ opens a portal into the heart of the Maelstrom and is drawn into the vortex along\
  \ with any creature that traverses the portal. This destroys the wheel of worlds\
  \ and the creature that activated it."
