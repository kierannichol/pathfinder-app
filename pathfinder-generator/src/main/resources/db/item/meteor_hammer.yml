description: "This weapon consists of one or two spherical weights attached by a 10-foot\
  \ chain. You whirl the weights and wrap them around an opponent's body. If you succeed\
  \ at a trip attempt with a meteor hammer, you can drag your opponent 5 feet closer\
  \ to you rather than knocking her prone. You may use this weapon in two different\
  \ ways: In meteor mode you use it as a double weapon, while in fortress mode you\
  \ cannot use it as a double weapon but gain reach and a +1 shield bonus to AC. Switching\
  \ between these two modes is a free action decided at the start of your turn."
