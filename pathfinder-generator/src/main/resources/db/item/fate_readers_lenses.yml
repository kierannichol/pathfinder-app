description: "Fate-reader's lenses consist of two specially crafted harrow decks.\
  \ The decks sport a stylized image of an eye on the back of each card—one deck's\
  \ eyes are red, and the deck's eyes are blue. Each card in the red deck is linked\
  \ to its corresponding card in the blue deck. The owner can peer through the eyes\
  \ of any card from the red deck to see whatever is in front of the corresponding\
  \ blueeyed card, as if using enter image (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide\
  \ 219).\nThe owner can peer through any red card at will; drawing a random card\
  \ and peering through it is a standard action, while going through the deck and\
  \ selecting a specific card is a fullround action. If the corresponding blue card\
  \ is still shuffled in with the rest of the blue deck, it is automatically moved\
  \ to the top of that deck, ready to be drawn by whoever bears it. Once a blue card\
  \ is drawn, it can be placed on a creature's person with a successful Sleight of\
  \ Hand check or stuck to any sturdy flat surface, where it remains until moved again\
  \ by either you or another creature.\nOnly a single pair of cards can have a visual\
  \ link between them at any time, and placing a red card at the bottom of its deck\
  \ causes the eye on the matching blue card to close, ending the visual link until\
  \ the red card is peered through again. While the blue cards can be meted out and\
  \ separated however the owner desires, the red cards lose their magic if separated\
  \ from the red-eyed harrow deck for more than 10 minutes. If a blue card or a red\
  \ card is destroyed, the matching card of the opposite deck loses its magic."
