description: "This 4-foot-by-8-foot oil-on-wood masterwork painting depicts an elegant\
  \ high-backed padded chair in the foreground of a gothic study with heavy curtains,\
  \ polished tables supporting decorative lamps, plush rugs, and hundreds of books\
  \ on shelves. The silver-andgold frame is equally elegant and etched with faintly\
  \ glowing arcane symbols.\nThe painting is a powerful minor artifact that can be\
  \ used to create one or more duplicates of any living creature that has a Charisma\
  \ score of at least 10. By touching the painting and uttering a command word, the\
  \ subject creature is drawn into the painting and appears seated in the chair. The\
  \ subject is under the effects of a binding spell.\nDelving into the subconscious\
  \ mind, the painting creates a duplicate of the subject that lasts for 1 day per\
  \ Hit Die the creature possesses. If the subject creature has a positive Charisma\
  \ modifier, additional duplicates equal to its Charisma modifier may be created.\
  \ Each of these duplicates represents an alter ego of the subject. Some beings may\
  \ have multiple alter egos. In this case, the subject creature determines exactly\
  \ how many id duplicates he wants the id portrait to create, up to a maximum determined\
  \ by his Charisma modifier.\nAn id duplicate can be of a different class from the\
  \ subject creature, and it has average hit points for that class, the same number\
  \ of Hit Dice as the subject creature, and the same basic knowledge and goals as\
  \ the subject creature (modified by any ability score changes). It is an average\
  \ member of its class, with appropriate skills and feats. Reallocate the subject\
  \ creature's ability scores to make them appropriate to the new class chosen.\n\
  A duplicate can carry out whatever tasks the original creature desires. If all duplicates\
  \ are destroyed, the original creature is ejected from the id portrait and permanently\
  \ loses 1 point of Charisma (this cannot be replaced by any means short of a miracle\
  \ or wish). In addition, he is under the effects of slow and dimensional anchor\
  \ for the following 24 hours. These effects cannot be dispelled. The portrait is\
  \ usually placed somewhere hidden and safe, or in the care of trusted guardians,\
  \ since the subject creature is significantly weakened until he recovers from the\
  \ magical effects. When a duplicate has lived out its allotted time, it simply dies.\
  \ Even if the duplicate is slain or dies before its duration expires, the body remains\
  \ and behaves as a normal corpse. Spells such as miracle, raise dead, and resurrection\
  \ fail to affect a duplicate corpse created by the id portrait.\nAn id duplicate\
  \ has a challenge rating equal to the base creature's CR –1."
destruction: "The id portrait can only be destroyed by painting a fresh portrait seated\
  \ in the chair with marvelous pigments. The subject of this painting must be the\
  \ original creator of the artifact."
