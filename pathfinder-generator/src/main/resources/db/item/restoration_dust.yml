description: "This silky red dust is pleasantly warm to the touch. When sprinkled\
  \ on a partially decomposed corpse or skeleton, it causes the dead flesh and bones\
  \ to mend and reform, allowing the corpse to be identified or raised as if it were\
  \ killed recently (effectively restarting the day count that limits raise dead).\
  \ If more than half of the bones are missing or the subject has been dead for more\
  \ than 100 years, the dust has no effect. One vial contains enough restoration dust\
  \ to restore a single Medium or smaller corpse. Larger corpses can be restored by\
  \ using multiple vials (two for Large creatures, four for Huge, eight for Gargantuan,\
  \ and 16 for Colossal)."
