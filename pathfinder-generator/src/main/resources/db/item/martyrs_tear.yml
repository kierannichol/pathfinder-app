description: "This imperfect, rose-tinted gemstone resembles a teardrop or a broken\
  \ heart depending on its orientation. Its pale facets are typically marred by a\
  \ single crack or chip near the gem's middle.\nOnce per day, the bearer may spend\
  \ a standard action to transfer 3d6 hit points from himself into the gem. This deepens\
  \ the gem's color, with a stronger color indicating more life energy stored in it.\
  \ The gem can store a maximum of 18 hit points. If any hit points are stored in\
  \ the gem, the bearer may touch it himself or another creature as a standard action,\
  \ transferring all the stored life energy from the gem to the target creature, healing\
  \ it a number of hit points equal to the amount stored in the gem. This returns\
  \ the gem to its normal color."
