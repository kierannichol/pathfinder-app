description: "A spell lattice is a block of transparent crystal, internally etched\
  \ with a three-dimensional representation of a spell. This spell is chosen when\
  \ the item is created (the contained spell determines the school of the lattice's\
  \ aura). When a spell lattice is wielded by a spontaneous spellcaster who has the\
  \ spell contained within it on her class spell list, she can use her spell slots\
  \ to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells known. When an arcanist holds\
  \ a spell lattice, as long as she has the contained spell on her class spell list,\
  \ she can use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells\
  \ currently prepared.\nA spellcaster who uses a spellbook or formula book can copy\
  \ the spell from a spell lattice as if it were a scroll. Doing so expends the spell\
  \ from the spell lattice."
