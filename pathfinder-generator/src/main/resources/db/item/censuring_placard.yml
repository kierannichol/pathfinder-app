description: "Most often appearing as a simple flattened board inscribed with a portion\
  \ of Cayden Cailean's holy text, a censuring placard is used to inflict just punishment\
  \ on offenders of church guidelines or to knock allies roughly back to their senses.\
  \ A censuring placard functions as a +1 club. As a swift action with a successful\
  \ melee attack, the wielder can use the placard to cast break enchantment on that\
  \ target. Whether this effort is successful or not, the break enchantment ability\
  \ cannot be used again for a week."
