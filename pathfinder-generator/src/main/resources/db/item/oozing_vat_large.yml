description: "These earthenware vats are made from a special clay sludge dredged from\
  \ Oenopion's central lake and infused with ooze distillates. After being fired in\
  \ a massive kiln, an oozing vat is typically embedded with glass-fiber tubing designed\
  \ to carry electrical charges to growing oozes. In order to craft an ooze creature\
  \ using the Craft Ooze feat (see page 22), a creator must have access to an oozing\
  \ vat large enough to contain the created ooze."
