description: "This stone tablet bears inscriptions detailing a notable being who fell\
  \ short of achieving godhood in the Test of the Starstone. As a move action, the\
  \ tablet's holder can break it to release a remnant of latent divinity. The resultant\
  \ burst of power imbues the user, granting a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon\
  \ damage rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws for 1 minute. In\
  \ addition, the user can attempt a new saving throw against one ongoing effect,\
  \ such as a disease."
