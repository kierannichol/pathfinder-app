description: "This unique, salty alchemical powder is crafted in Darklands communities\
  \ where fresh water is either scarce or guarded by dangerous predators. Consuming\
  \ 1 dose allows you to go without water for 3 days instead of 1, in growing discomfort\
  \ but without any negative effects. After this time, you must attempt a Constitution\
  \ check once every 6 hours instead of once per hour to avoid taking nonlethal damage.\
  \ One dose of drought powder functions for 1 week, after which penalties for thirst\
  \ accrue at their normal pace (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444)."
