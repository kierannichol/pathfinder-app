description: "This battered, well-used suit of +1 half-plate automatically resizes\
  \ itself to match the size of its wearer. Once per day on command, the armor can\
  \ bestow upon its wearer the effects of righteous might for 5 rounds. The wearer's\
  \ alignment determines the DR gained from this ability. A good wearer gains DR 5/evil,\
  \ an evil wearer gains DR 5/good, and a wearer who is neither good nor evil chooses\
  \ which DR to gain the first time she activates this abilityâ€”once chosen, it cannot\
  \ be changed."
