description: "A splendorous ring is composed of six white and yellow gemstones faceted\
  \ in a platinum band. Three times per day, the wearer of a splendorous ring can\
  \ twist the ring to cloak himself in an aura of glory. He appears both radiant and\
  \ terrible, glowing with the might of the heavens. Anyone within 10 feet of the\
  \ ring when it is activated must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be fascinated by\
  \ the wearer's form as if affected by hypnotic pattern. 2d4+3 Hit Dice worth of\
  \ creatures are affected in this way.\nThe fascinating effect of the ring lasts\
  \ for 3 rounds. During that time and for 5 rounds after, the ring's wearer gains\
  \ a +2 sacred bonus on any Charisma checks or Charisma-based skill checks to influence\
  \ any good-aligned creatures affected by the ring's hypnotic pattern effect, and\
  \ a –2 penalty on any Charisma checks or Charisma-based skill checks to influence\
  \ any evilaligned creatures affected by the hypnotic pattern effect."
