description: "This ornate pectoral necklace is crafted out of articulated gold plates\
  \ arranged in the shape of a falconâ€”the sacred animal of Horus, the Ancient Osirion\
  \ god of the sun and the sky.\nWhen outdoors and in an area with direct, natural\
  \ sunlight, the wearer of a sun falcon pectoral can call down dazzling beams of\
  \ sunlight from the sky once per day. As a standard action each round for 5 rounds,\
  \ the wearer can call down a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long vertical sunbeam anywhere\
  \ within 100 feet. A creature struck by a beam takes 3d6 points of damage and is\
  \ blinded (a successful DC 14 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the blindness).\
  \ The wearer does not need to call down a sunbeam each round, but once 5 rounds\
  \ have passed, no more beams can be called down.\nIndoors, underground, or in areas\
  \ of darkness, the wearer can instead create a daylight effect from the necklace\
  \ once per day. The daylight effect lasts up to 2 hours. Whether used to create\
  \ daylight or sunbeams, a sun falcon pectoral can only be used once per day."
