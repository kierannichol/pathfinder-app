  \ by physical contact, such as a dire rat's filth fever. The next time a creature\
  \ must save against the drinker's disease save DC, the DC for the initial infection\
  \ increases by +2. The tonic lasts for 10 minutes or until the next time a creature\
  \ must save against the drinker's disease DC, whichever comes first."
