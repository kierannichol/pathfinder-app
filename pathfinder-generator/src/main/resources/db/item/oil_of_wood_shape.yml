description: "Wood shape enables you to form one existing piece of wood into any shape\
  \ that suits your purpose. While it is possible to make crude coffers, doors, and\
  \ so forth, fine detail isn't possible. There is a 30% chance that any shape that\
  \ includes moving parts simply doesn't work."
