description: "This red +2 slick electricity resistance leather armor is crafted from\
  \ the skin of the crimson hagfish, more commonly known as the Shackles slime eel.\
  \ The armor exudes a slippery slime that grants its wearer a +5 competence bonus\
  \ on Escape Artist and Swim checks. In addition, as a standard action once per day,\
  \ the wearer can form an aura of electricity around himself that persists for 5\
  \ rounds. Creatures adjacent to the wearer when this power is activated and at the\
  \ start of the wearer's turn take 2d6 points of electricity damage and are staggered\
  \ for 1 round. A successful DC 14 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the\
  \ staggering effect. The aura persists for 5 rounds."
