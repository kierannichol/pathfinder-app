description: "A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite\
  \ ordinary. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold\
  \ about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a bag of holding and can actually\
  \ hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The\
  \ large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds\
  \ of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.\n\
  While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power. When the\
  \ wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus,\
  \ no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains.\
  \ Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not\
  \ provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does."
