description: "This whip has small caltrops or metal barbs woven into its length and\
  \ a quartet of metal whistles attached to the fall; when snapped, the whistle sounds\
  \ like screaming owlbear young. An owlbear's rider uses this noise to enrage the\
  \ monster, prodding it to attack the nearest creature. Anyone who attacks an owlbear\
  \ with such a whip draws its attack in preference to all other targets."
