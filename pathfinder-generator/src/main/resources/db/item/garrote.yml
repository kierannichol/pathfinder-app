description: "A garrote is a length of wire or thin rope with wooden handles at both\
  \ ends. The wire is placed across a victim's throat and crossed behind the neck;\
  \ when the handles are pulled tight, the garrote strangles him. In order for you\
  \ to use a garrote, your opponent must be helpless or unaware of you. You must make\
  \ a grapple check (though you avoid the â€“4 penalty for not having two hands free)\
  \ to successfully begin garroting your opponent. Sneak attack damage does not apply\
  \ to a garrote. Your garroted opponent must make a concentration check (DC 20 +\
  \ your CMB + level of the spell he's casting) to cast a spell with a verbal component,\
  \ use a command word item, or use any magic requiring speech. You gain the following\
  \ additional option when grappling with a garrote.\nChoke: You cut off your target's\
  \ air supply so he has to hold his breath (see Suffocation on page 445 of the Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Core Rulebook, and the Swim skill on page 108). Any round you do not maintain\
  \ the choke, your opponent can take a breath and restart when he has to begin making\
  \ Constitution checks."
