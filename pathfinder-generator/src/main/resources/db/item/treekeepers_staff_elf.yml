description: "The following weapon is generally available only to members of the indicated\
  \ race or ethnicity.\nElves live in communion with the landâ€”and the land can be\
  \ an effective ally. This +1/+1 quarterstaff is carved to look like it's covered\
  \ in ivy and vines. When the staff strikes a foe, the wielder can cause that creature\
  \ to be immediately enveloped in creeping vines from the staff and any nearby plants.\
  \ If the creature fails a DC 14 Reflex save, it is entangled for 1d4 rounds (though\
  \ the foe is not anchored to the staff). Once this ability has been used, the carvings\
  \ of vines and ivy on the staff disappear. The entanglement ability can't be used\
  \ again for 1d6 hours while the carvings regrow to their full size.\nOnce per week,\
  \ the owner can plant a treekeeper's staff in the ground overnight to create the\
  \ enrichment effect of plant growth. While holding the staff, the wielder can speak\
  \ with plants, as per the spell, with any plants that have their productivity increased\
  \ in this way."
