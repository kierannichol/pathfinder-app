description: "This jagged bone knife seems too thin and frail for combat but easily\
  \ cuts flesh. If used to perform a coup de grace on a helpless living creature and\
  \ the creature dies from the attack, the creature's flesh begins to peel off and\
  \ its bones animate as a skeleton under the command of the bearer of the razor.\
  \ The creature's flesh is not destroyed, but decays at a steady rate. The bearer\
  \ of the razor can spend 1 minute reattaching the flesh to the animate skeleton,\
  \ which ends the necromantic magic and results in a normal corpse (though a corpse\
  \ of a person killed or mutilated by knife wounds). If the bearer uses the razor\
  \ to flense and animate another creature's bones, the previous animate skeleton\
  \ is immediately destroyed."
