description: "This sight can be attached to a single two-handed firearm. When this\
  \ is done, the sight becomes part of the weapon, but can be removed from that weapon\
  \ with a full-round action. A firearm wielder can choose to spend a fullround action\
  \ to make a single shot with a firearm that has this sight. When she does, she can\
  \ resolve the attack against the touch AC of her target regardless of the range\
  \ increment."
