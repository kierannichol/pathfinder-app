description: "A draught of this pale blue liquid imposes a dull placidity upon the\
  \ imbiber, making him less quick to anger while not significantly impairing his\
  \ mental functions. A drinker with homicidal or other antisocial tendencies can\
  \ dull his more extreme urges with regular doses of this elixir, allowing him to\
  \ blend into society without resorting to murder, assault, or other actions that\
  \ might make day-to-day life difficult. Additionally, the elixir gives the imbiber\
  \ a +2 insight bonus on saving throws against any mind-affecting spell or effect.\
  \ As a side effect, the imbiber must succeed at a DC 13 Will save to benefit from\
  \ spells and effects that grant a morale bonus. An imbiber who is afflicted with\
  \ any form of madness receives a +4 insight bonus on any saving throws made to resist\
  \ the effects of that madness during the elixir's duration. A dose of elixir of\
  \ repression lasts for 12 hours."
