description: "This malty ale has a legendarily thick, creamy head. It creates a pleasant\
  \ buzz and sense of euphoria that dull the effects of pain and concussions, granting\
  \ the drinker a +1 alchemical bonus on saving throws to avoid becoming dazed, staggered,\
  \ or stunned, or against any effect with the pain descriptor (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate\
  \ Magic 138) for 1 hour. In addition, a dose of boulderhead bock grants the drinker\
  \ 1d6 temporary hit points that apply exclusively against nonlethal damage. Multiple\
  \ doses of boulderhead bock stack, to a maximum alchemical bonus of +5 and a maximum\
  \ of 20 temporary hit points."
