description: "Alaznist's runewell of wrath is located within the Eye of Fury, a demiplane\
  \ hidden within the uppermost reaches of the runelord's realm of Hollow Mountain.\
  \ The runewell's job of absorbing fragments of wrath from souls has already finished\
  \ and allowed Alaznist to emerge, but it retains a few additional powers of note,\
  \ beyond providing a portal between the Eye of Fury and Alaznist's Demesne. It grants\
  \ Alaznist the ability to cast scrying at will, although its range is limited to\
  \ Hollow Mountain and the surrounding environs of Rivenrake Island. It also allows\
  \ Alaznist to grant immunity to fire to anyone she chooses; this immunity is permanent\
  \ until she revokes it, but it functions only while a creature is in the Eye of\
  \ Fury. The runewell itself is 10 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep; the fiery liquid\
  \ it contains functions as magma for the purposes of objects or creatures placed\
  \ within it. Alaznist can extract up to 50,000 gp worth of material components (usually\
  \ gemstones for casting spells like wish or forcecage) per day from this liquid\
  \ fire; these material components fade if not used in 24 hours."
destruction: "The runewell of wrath is linked to Alaznist, and as long as she lives,\
  \ the runewell cannot be destroyed. If Alaznist is slain, the liquid fire within\
  \ the runewell immediately cools and becomes ordinary water, destroying the runewell\
  \ in the process (although it can still be used as a portal to travel to Alaznist's\
  \ Demesne, provided the anima focus at area E10 still functions)."
