description: "This elegant mithral sword bears a blooming rose on the crossguard,\
  \ with vines winding around the hilt. Filarina Grantsliem discovered the rose knight's\
  \ blade during her brief adventuring career, when she earned the blade as a reward\
  \ after freeing a trapped azata from an ancient magical prison. Scarlet Rose agents\
  \ have since been successful in creating new rose knight's blades, and the weapons\
  \ are increasingly seeing use among these Gray Maidens and their affiliates.\nA\
  \ rose knight's blade is a +1 benevolent mithral longsword. Along with its benevolence\
  \ special ability, this sword can also provide aid by metaphorically cutting through\
  \ certain debilitating effects. Three times per day, the wielder of a rose knight's\
  \ blade can attempt a new saving throw against one of the following conditions affecting\
  \ her: dazed, frightened, nauseated, panicked, paralyzed, shaken, staggered, or\
  \ stunnedâ€” but only if the condition was caused by a mind-affecting effect.\nAlternatively,\
  \ the wielder can expend one daily use and touch the blade to an adjacent creature\
  \ as a standard action to remove one of these mind-affecting conditions from the\
  \ ally."
