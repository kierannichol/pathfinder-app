description: "This engraved and filigreed silver diadem is fashioned with three tines\
  \ rising from the front of the circlet, the central one of which bears the encircled\
  \ cross emblem of Cheliax. The Crown of Infernal Majesty grants its wearer a suite\
  \ of abilities. Defensively, it provides immunity to fire and poison, immunity to\
  \ mind-affecting effects, immunity to mental ability score damage, acid and cold\
  \ resistance 10, and spell resistance equal to the wearer's CR + 11. In addition,\
  \ the wearer is immune to smite effects (including the smite evil ability of celestial\
  \ creatures and paladins, and the destructive smite ability of the Destruction domain).\
  \ A creature that attempts to smite the wearer of the crown gets no bonus on attack\
  \ rolls against the wearer, and the crown reflects any bonus damage from the smite\
  \ back against the attacker as evil-aligned damage that bypasses the corresponding\
  \ damage reduction.\nThe wearer gains the see in darkness universal monster ability,\
  \ and the ability to use discern lies, nondetection, and true seeing as constant\
  \ spell-like abilities. The crown also grants its wearer a +6 enhancement bonus\
  \ to her Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores (with ranks in Intimidate, Knowledge\
  \ [planes], and Sense Motive, as a headband of vast intelligence, as well as the\
  \ ability to speak and read Abyssal, Celestial, and Infernal). Lastly, the wearer\
  \ gains a +4 profane bonus on Charisma-based checks to bargain or deal with devils\
  \ (such as with planar ally or planar binding spells)."
destruction: "The Crown of Infernal Majesty can be destroyed only by tricking Asmodeus\
  \ into nullifying each of the Three Damnations written into the infernal contracts\
  \ between Hell and House Thrune."
