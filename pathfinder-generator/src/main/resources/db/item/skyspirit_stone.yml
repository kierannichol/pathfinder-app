description: "This object was naturally struck by lightning and imbued with a spirit\
  \ of the sky. Despite the name, this object does not have to be a stone, though\
  \ small objects made into skyspirit stones are the most common, convenient, and\
  \ prized. Once per day, the stone can be placed in liquor or milk for 1 minute to\
  \ infuse the liquid with the spirit's power. A kineticist with the air elemental\
  \ focus (aerokineticist) can drink this liquid as a move action to gain assistance\
  \ from the spirit's power. For 1 hour after drinking the liquid, the kineticist\
  \ can negate a single point of burn gained from using her kineticist abilities (this\
  \ does not heal the associated nonlethal damage from the point of burn). This effect\
  \ does not stack with itself."
