description: "This collar of bright red leather bears a small golden pendant and makes\
  \ the wearer much more biddable and compliant. The wearer takes a –4 penalty on\
  \ saving throws against mind-affecting effects used by the creature that placed\
  \ the collar on it, and that creature gains a +4 bonus on Handle Animal checks to\
  \ train or push the wearer. Any other creatures take a –4 penalty on Handle Animal\
  \ checks against the wearer, and the wearer gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving\
  \ throws against their mind-affecting effects.\nA collar of obedience can be placed\
  \ on any Small, Medium, or Large creature. Placing a collar of obedience on a creature\
  \ is a full-round action that requires a successful grapple maneuver. Removing the\
  \ collar is also a full-round action, and the creature removing it must have precise\
  \ digits capable of working the locking mechanism. A creature made helpful with\
  \ wild empathy does not resist having the collar equipped or removed."
