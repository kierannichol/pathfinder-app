description: "This crystalline carving looks like a hand-sized tree leaf. It is usually\
  \ worn around the neck on a strap so it is within easy reach, but can be affixed\
  \ to a belt or clothing just like a badge. While falling, the bearer can snap and\
  \ destroy the snapleaf as an immediate action to gain the benefits of feather fall\
  \ and invisibility. The duration of the two effects work independently; ending one\
  \ early does not affect the other. The item cannot be activated to provide just\
  \ one of these two effects; they are always activated simultaneously."
