description: "These gloves constantly project a very short-range silence spell, so\
  \ that anything touched or held by the wearer's hands makes no sound. Thus picking\
  \ a locked door wouldn't make a clicking noise audible to those on the other side,\
  \ and holding a hand over a victim's mouth would silence his scream. The silence\
  \ extends only a few inches, so knocking on a door produces no sound but hammering\
  \ it down still does.\nIf the wearer presses a finger to her lips and speaks, no\
  \ sound comes out, but the words are audible to anyone she chooses in her line of\
  \ sight (as the message spell)."
