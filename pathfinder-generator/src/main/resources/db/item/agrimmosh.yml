description: "Agrimmosh appears to be a simple stone blacksmith's hammer engraved\
  \ with Minderhal's holy symbol. It functions as a +2 impact warhammer that automatically\
  \ resizes itself to match the size of its wielder. Once per day as a full-round\
  \ action, the wielder of Agrimmosh can use the hammer to cast heightened enlarge\
  \ person (Fortitude DC 23 negates). This effect lasts for 20 minutes. Whenever the\
  \ wielder of Agrimmosh confirms a critical hit against a creature of the humanoid\
  \ type, the target creature must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or shrink by\
  \ one size category, as by heightened reduce person. This effect lasts for 20 minutes.\n\
  In addition, Agrimmosh has other powers that are currently dormant. When the Hammer\
  \ of Unmaking is struck against Minderhal's Forge in the Cathedral of Minderhal\
  \ (see Pathfinder Adventure Path #93: Forge of the Giant God), these powers are\
  \ reawakened, and Agrimmosh gains the following abilities.\nWhenever the wielder\
  \ of Agrimmosh successfully strikes a creature with the hammer, as an immediate\
  \ action he can attempt a targeted dispel check against the struck creature, as\
  \ dispel magic, to end a single ongoing transmutation effect that alters the target's\
  \ size. Other ongoing spells and effects are unaffected. The wielder uses the hammer's\
  \ caster level as his own when attempting such a dispel check.\nAgrimmosh also gains\
  \ 3 charges, which renew at the beginning of each day. The wielder can expend the\
  \ listed number of charges to activate one of the following spelllike abilities\
  \ as a full-round action; expending an extra charge to activate the spell-like ability\
  \ reduces the casting time to a swift action instead. Regardless, the wielder of\
  \ Agrimmosh can activate only one of the weapon's spell-like abilities per round."
destruction: "If Agrimmosh is heated in Minderhal's Forge at the Cathedral of Minderhal\
  \ for 10 years and then quenched in the blood of a slain rune giant, it loses all\
  \ of its magical abilities and is destroyed, shattering into a thousand pieces."
