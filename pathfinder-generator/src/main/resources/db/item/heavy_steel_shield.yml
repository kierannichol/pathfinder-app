description: "You strap a heavy steel shield to your forearm and grip it with your\
  \ hand. A heavy steel shield is so heavy that you can't use your shield hand for\
  \ anything else. Whether wooden or steel, a heavy shield offers the same basic protection\
  \ and attack benefits, though the two versions respond differently to some spells\
  \ and effects (such as rusting grasp). A druid can use a heavy wooden shield, but\
  \ not a heavy steel shield.\nShield Bash Attacks: You can bash an opponent with\
  \ a heavy shield. See \"heavy shield\" on Table 1â€“5: Martial Weapons for the damage\
  \ dealt by a shield bash with a heavy shield. Used this way, a heavy shield is a\
  \ martial bludgeoning weapon. For the purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat\
  \ a heavy shield as a one-handed weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you\
  \ lose its AC bonus until your next turn. An enhancement bonus on a shield does\
  \ not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but the shield can\
  \ be made into a magic weapon in its own right."
