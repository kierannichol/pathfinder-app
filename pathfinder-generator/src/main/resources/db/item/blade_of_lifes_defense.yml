description: "This khopesh has a silver blade polished to an almost blinding sheen\
  \ and etched with motifs of vines and leaves. Blades of life's defense can be bought\
  \ in Anuli's Sword Alley, and are becoming more popular as rumblings of an open\
  \ war with Geb continue to grow ever louder. Each blade is imbued with a shimmer\
  \ of nonmagical might against undead that grants the blade's bearer a +1 sacred\
  \ bonus on saving throws against the abilities of undead. It is otherwise treated\
  \ as a standard khopesh."
