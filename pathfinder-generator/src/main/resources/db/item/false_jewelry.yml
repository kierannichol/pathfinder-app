description: "Favored by rogues in statuesque Magnimar, these adornments hide tiny\
  \ secret compartments. False jewelry grants a +8 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks\
  \ to hide a tiny object on your person (does not stack with the bonus for hiding\
  \ very small objects) and negates the +4 bonuses searchers receive when frisking\
  \ you. False jewelry costs 20 gp in addition to the value of the ornament being\
  \ fitted with the secret compartment."
