description: "This 3-foot-long aspen rod bears glyphs of protection and abjuration.\
  \ Each end is capped with a smooth copper sphere. While holding the rod, the bearer\
  \ automatically perceives any spell cast (or spell-like ability used) within a 120-foot\
  \ radius, even if she can't otherwise perceive the caster. Spells cast from spell\
  \ completion and spell trigger items are automatically detected as well. The bearer\
  \ immediately knows the specific spell cast, whether or not it was from a magic\
  \ item, its level, the caster level, and whether the spell is arcane or divine.\n\
  When the bearer of the rod of spell sundering counters a spell, she can counterspell\
  \ with any spell of equal or greater level she's prepared, automatically countering\
  \ as if she'd cast the proper spell to counterspell. As an immediate action after\
  \ countering a spell, the rod's wielder can expend one use of mythic power to reflect\
  \ the spell back on the caster. The rod's bearer must have line of effect to reflect\
  \ a spell, unless the spell reflected doesn't require it. Treat the caster as the\
  \ target, center, or origin of the spell's effect, as appropriate. Treat the spell\
  \ as though cast by the rod's bearer on the caster. The power of the rod of spell\
  \ sundering augments the spell, increasing the DC of any saving throws by 2 and\
  \ the spell's caster level by the bearer's tier.\nWhen used as a weapon, the rod\
  \ of spell sundering functions as a masterwork light mace. On a successful attack,\
  \ it targets the creature struck with greater dispel magic, with a caster level\
  \ equal to its bearer's character level plus her mythic tier. This effect can also\
  \ be delivered with a successful melee touch attack made using the rod."
destruction: "A rod of spell sundering can be destroyed by leaving it within an area\
  \ devoid of all magic for a year and a day. After this, it must be broken across\
  \ the knee of a spellcaster formerly capable of casting at least 5th-level spells\
  \ who lost her powers by using mage's disjunction on an artifact."
