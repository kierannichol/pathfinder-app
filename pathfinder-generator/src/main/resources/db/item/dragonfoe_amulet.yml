description: "This amulet consists of a cracked dragon scale set in a disk of gold.\
  \ Most are slightly damaged, bearing the scars of draconic breath weapons. The dragonfoe\
  \ amulet is a powerful, specialized tool for those who oppose dragons, improving\
  \ the protection and attacks of the wearer in a number of ways.\nThe wearer of a\
  \ dragonfoe amulet ignores the damage reduction of dragons. This only affects actual\
  \ dragons, not all creatures of the dragon type. In addition, if the wearer casts\
  \ a spell against a dragon, she can roll twice to overcome any spell resistance\
  \ the dragon might possess, taking the higher result. Lastly, the wearer takes no\
  \ damage instead of half damage on a successful Reflex save against a dragon's breath\
  \ weapon (as the evasion ability)."
