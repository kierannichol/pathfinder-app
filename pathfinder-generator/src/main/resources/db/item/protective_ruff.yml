description: "This lace collar fits snugly around the wearer's neck. When an effect\
  \ would damage an item worn in any of the wearer's item slots, up to 10 points of\
  \ damage are redirected to the ruff. (Damaging effects that do not involve hit points,\
  \ such as rusting grasp, are not affected.) A protective ruff has 10 hit points\
  \ and hardness 5. When the ruff is reduced to 0 hit points, it stops functioning;\
  \ if reduced to less than 0 hit points, it is destroyed as normal. While worn, a\
  \ protective ruff with 1 or more hit points regenerates at the rate of 1 hit point\
  \ per hour."
