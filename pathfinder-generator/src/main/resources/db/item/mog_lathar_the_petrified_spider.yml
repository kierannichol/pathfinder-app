description: "Mog-Lathar is a well-preserved fossil of a gigantic Leng spider that\
  \ has achieved sentience. Since its discovery in the Mindspin Mountains and subsequent\
  \ arrival in Bridgefront, the petrified idol's cult has grown to over 300 supplicants.\
  \ The idol's holy days fall on the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, as well as on\
  \ the northern solstice. Sacrifices are typically in the form of fine goods and\
  \ deeply intoxicated, lucidly dreaming humanoids.\nDespite its imposing petrified\
  \ bulk, the fossil is relatively brittle for a stone object of its size, with hardness\
  \ 8, 78 hp, and break DC 35.\nThe Huge idol can animate at will, as the spell animate\
  \ object, and can grant divine spells to worshipers up to 5th level with access\
  \ to the Chaos, Evil, and Trickery domains as a result of selecting the divine source\
  \ idol ability twice. Its immortal promise ability grants a limited immortality\
  \ to up to 20 favored worshipers. They do not age; do not need to eat, drink, or\
  \ breathe; and do not suffer ill effects from extreme heat or cold."
destruction: "Mog-Lathar must be physically transported to the Dimension of Dreams\
  \ and encased in the webbing of its Leng spider brethren. Once cocooned, a single\
  \ blow from a silver hammer will turn the idol to dust."
