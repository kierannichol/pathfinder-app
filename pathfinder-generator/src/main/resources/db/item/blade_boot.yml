description: "Blade boots come with a spring-mounted knife that pops out when triggered\
  \ with the right combination of toe presses. You can use a blade boot as an off-hand\
  \ weapon. Releasing the knife is a swift action; rearming it is a full-round action.\
  \ When the blade is extended, you treat normal terrain as difficult and difficult\
  \ terrain as impassable."
