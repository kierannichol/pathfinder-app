description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis torch's magic tar retains the power of\
  \ goblin songs. Whenever the owner holds the torch in hand while in the area of\
  \ a bardic performance performed as a goblin song, it begins to emit a faint, whispered\
  \ version of that song (audible with a DC 20 Perception check). If the wielder lights\
  \ the torch at any time before the next dusk, its flame dances rhythmically to the\
  \ goblin song it most recently witnessed, and emanates a crackling mimicry of the\
  \ original singer's voice. The torch burns for 13 rounds or until it is no longer\
  \ held in the user's hand, whichever comes first, during which time it produces\
  \ the effect of the remembered bardic performance, using the torch's caster level\
  \ as the effective bard level, and the wielder's Charisma modifier if necessary.\
  \ If the torch's caster level would provide an insufficient bard level for the most\
  \ recent performance, the torch has no effect beyond shedding light. The magic tar\
  \ reforms after 1 week, allowing the torch to be used again. If the creature who\
  \ last lit the torch was a goblin, the tar instead reforms in 24 hours."
