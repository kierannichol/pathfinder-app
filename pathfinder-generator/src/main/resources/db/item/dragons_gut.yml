description: "A dragon's stomach contains highly corrosive acid that can be crafted\
  \ into an alchemical item called dragon's gut. When used as a thrown splash weapon,\
  \ dragon's gut deals 2d4 points of acid damage plus, on a direct hit, an additional\
  \ 1d4 points of acid damage the following round, and it deals 1 point of acid damage\
  \ to all creatures within 5 feet of the impact point as normal splash damage. Additionally,\
  \ dragon's gut has alternate effects when used in place of acid as an alchemical\
  \ power component (see Pathfinder Player Companion: Adventurer's Armory).\nAcid\
  \ arrow: The spell lasts 1d3 rounds longer than usual.\nAcid fog: The fog takes\
  \ on a sticky quality and clings to creatures within it. Any creature damaged by\
  \ the acid fog takes an additional 2d6 points of acid damage on the round after\
  \ leaving the fog's area of effect. The creature can negate this additional damage\
  \ by spending a standard action to wipe the clinging acid from its body.\nAcidic\
  \ spray: The spell deals 1d8 points of acid damage per caster level (maximum 15d8)\
  \ instead of the normal 1d6 per caster level on the round of its casting (Reflex\
  \ half). It still deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels on the following\
  \ round as normal.\nThe Dragoncrafting feat and a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy)\
  \ check are required to convert 1 vial of stomach acid into 1 vial of dragon's gut."
