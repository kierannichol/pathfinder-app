description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis clockwork chronometer can be activated\
  \ by winding a tiny key while casting a personal spell or a spell that can affect\
  \ a single target. A spell cast this way has no immediate effect. Instead, when\
  \ the wearer stops winding, the chronometer begins unwinding until it runs down,\
  \ at which time the spell takes effect from the item. Each round the user spends\
  \ winding the chronometer delays the spell for 1 minute, to a maximum of 10 minutes\
  \ with 10 rounds of winding. The clockwork is not precise enough for the user to\
  \ know exactly when it will wind down; the GM secretly rolls d% to determine when\
  \ it winds down and releases the spell (1–25 for 1 round early, 26–75 for the intended\
  \ duration, or 76–00 for 1 round late). The spell affects the creature in possession\
  \ of the item at the time the spell is triggered. If you cast a personal spell into\
  \ the chronometer and someone other than you has the item when it triggers, the\
  \ spell is wasted with no effect.\nSpell winders have different maximum spell levels.\
  \ The maximum spell level is also the maximum number of spell levels the spell winder\
  \ can hold per day, so a 4th-level spell winder could delay one 4th-level spell,\
  \ a 3rd-level spell plus a 1st-level spell, and so on. A 0-level spell counts as\
  \ 1st-level spell for this purpose. If the spell is too high a level, would exceed\
  \ the number of levels per day, or is cast while a spell is already in the chronometer,\
  \ it can't be stored and its casting is wasted."
