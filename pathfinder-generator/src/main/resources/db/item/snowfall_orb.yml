description: "On the borderlands between the Plane of Air and the Plane of Water,\
  \ vast sheets of glacial ice tip from one realm to the other, storms of boulder-sized\
  \ hail pulverize extant structures, and entire nations of snow swirl amid the dense\
  \ interplanar vapors. The snowfall orb is a relic of this harsh realm and is capable\
  \ of channeling its awesome elemental power in a variety of ways.\nFirst, anytime\
  \ the owner's equipment is targeted by heat metal, the effect is automatically countered\
  \ as if the snowfall orb had cast chill metal.\nSecond, once per day, the owner\
  \ can concentrate on the orb for 10 minutes to alter the weather in a 1-mile radius.\
  \ Doing so causes snow, heavy snow, sleet, or hail (user's choice) to fall within\
  \ that radius for 1d4 hours, regardless of the environment's predominant climate\
  \ or season. This ability otherwise functions as control weather.\nFinally, the\
  \ user can throw a snowfall orb at an opponent as a ranged touch attack with a range\
  \ increment of 20 feet. On a hit, the orb is destroyed and the target immediately\
  \ takes 5d6 points of cold damage. At the beginning of each round thereafter for\
  \ 4 rounds, the target takes an additional 1d6 points of cold damage and must succeed\
  \ at a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d2 points of Dexterity damage and become staggered\
  \ for 1 round. If the target takes 3 or more points of Dexterity damage in this\
  \ way, the creature becomes fatigued; if the target takes 5 or more points of Dexterity\
  \ damage, it becomes exhausted instead."
