description: "This +1 sling bullet contains a magical reservoir that can store a single\
  \ vial of any alchemical substance capable of being used as a splash weapon. If\
  \ the alchemist bullet hits, the splash weapon also strikes the target and causes\
  \ splash damage as normal. If the alchemist's bullet misses but is not destroyed,\
  \ the alchemical substance remains stored within, and the bullet does not explode\
  \ and can be reused. If it misses and is destroyed, the bullet is destroyed as well\
  \ without effect."
