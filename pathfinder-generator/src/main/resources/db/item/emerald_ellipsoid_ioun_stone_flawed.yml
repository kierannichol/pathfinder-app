description: "This stone grants the wearer 5 temporary hit points (stacking to 25\
  \ for multiple emerald ellipsoids of any kind), which are restored automatically\
  \ at a specif ic time of day unique to each stone (typically sunrise or sunset).\
  \ Each stone inf licts one negative level upon you (no known limit); these negative\
  \ levels remain as long as the stone is in use, and disappear when it is no longer\
  \ in use. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot\
  \ be overcome in any way while the stone is used.\nResonance: 5 additional temporary\
  \ hit points."
