description: "Great magical hailstones pound down upon casting this spell, dealing\
  \ 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of cold damage to every creature\
  \ in the area. This damage only occurs once, when the spell is cast. For the remaining\
  \ duration of the spell, heavy snow and sleet rains down in the area. Creatures\
  \ inside this area take a â€“4 penalty on Perception skill checks and the entire area\
  \ is treated as difficult terrain. At the end of the duration, the snow and hail\
  \ disappear, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage dealt)."
