description: "This dull brass ring is typically placed in the nose or muzzle, or elsewhere\
  \ on the head of an animal, and is used to attach a lead rope or bridle. The wearer\
  \ (and its rider, if any) gives off no scent and cannot be tracked or located by\
  \ scent. In addition, it gains the scent ability within 30 feet; if the wearer already\
  \ possesses scent, the range for this sense increases by 30 feet (to a maximum of\
  \ 60 feet)."
