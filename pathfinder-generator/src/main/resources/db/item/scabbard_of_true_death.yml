description: "Whenever an assassin draws a weapon from the scabbard of true death\
  \ and makes a successful death attack against her target, the DC of her true death\
  \ ability increases by 4. In addition, regardless of whether the wielder has levels\
  \ in the assassin class, the wielder gains the bleeding attack rogue talent as though\
  \ she had a sneak attack that dealt 1d6 points of damage (thus, attacks that qualify\
  \ as sneak attacks deal 1 point of bleed damage); if the wielder already has the\
  \ bleeding attack rogue talent, the bleed damage caused by that talent is increased\
  \ by 1."
