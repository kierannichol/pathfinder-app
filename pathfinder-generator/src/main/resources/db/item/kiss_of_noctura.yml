description: "This flap of leathery skin was flayed from the face of the succubus\
  \ Noctura. In order to attach the skin graft, the new user must make several lacerations\
  \ around his own mouth, cheeks, and chin, dealing 1d6 points of Constitution damage\
  \ to himself. Once the skin scrap is placed over this area, the user's blood revivifies\
  \ the flesh, causing it to fuse with his face. Once the scrap is attached, the user's\
  \ face looks identical to how it did before the graft, except that his lips constantly\
  \ appear plump and lush.\nThe wearer of the Kiss of Noctura inherits a measure of\
  \ Noctura's succubus abilities. Whenever the wearer kisses another creature, he\
  \ imposes 1 negative level on that creature. If the victim is unwilling, it must\
  \ be grappled first. Negative levels imposed by the Kiss of Noctura can be removed\
  \ with a successful DC 16 Fortitude saving throw after 24 hours. Any creature that\
  \ already has 1 negative level from the Kiss of Noctura does not take additional\
  \ negative levels from subsequent kisses.\nAdditionally, the wearer can communicate\
  \ telepathically with any creature he's kissed within the past 24 hours. This telepathic\
  \ link isn't limited by distance or planes, and can be terminated by the wearer\
  \ at any time. Unwilling creatures can prevent this link from forming by succeeding\
  \ at a Will save (DC = 10 + the wearer's Charisma modifier).\nThe Kiss of Noctura\
  \ can be removed by cutting the flap of skin away, which deals a further 1d6 points\
  \ of Constitution damage to the wearer and leaves the wearer's face permanently\
  \ scarred."
