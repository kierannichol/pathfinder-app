name: "Wand of Restful Sleep"
description: "You cast this spell immediately prior to resting. While under the effects\
  \ of this spell, you and your allies enjoy a restful night's sleep. If a subject\
  \ completes a full night's rest, it regains hit points as if it had undergone a\
  \ full day of bed rest (regaining twice its character level in hit points). If a\
  \ subject completes a full day's rest, it regains three times its character level\
  \ in hit points. Any significant interruption during the rest (such as being awoken)\
  \ prevents any healing that night and ends the effect of this spell on the awakened\
  \ subject. Any healing acquired while under the effects of restful sleepis considered\
  \ natural healing, and has no affect on effects requiring magical healing to cure."
