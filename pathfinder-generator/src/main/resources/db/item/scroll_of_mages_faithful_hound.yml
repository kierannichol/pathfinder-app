name: "Scroll of Mage's Faithful Hound"
description: "You conjure up a phantom watchdog that is invisible to everyone but\
  \ yourself. It then guards the area where it was conjured (it does not move). The\
  \ hound immediately starts barking loudly if any Small or larger creature approaches\
  \ within 30 feet of it. (Those within 30 feet of the hound when it is conjured may\
  \ move about in the area, but if they leave and return, they activate the barking.)\
  \ The hound sees invisible and ethereal creatures. It does not react to figments,\
  \ but it does react to shadow illusions."
