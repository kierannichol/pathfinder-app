description: "These stylized wooden masks are carved to resemble a common type of\
  \ wasteland vermin, such as a giant ant, scorpion, or spider. While using wild shape\
  \ or a vermin shape spell to assume the form of a vermin that corresponds with the\
  \ mask's design, the wearer gains the following benefits. First, the wearer can\
  \ speak normally despite the limitations of the form's anatomy. Furthermore, the\
  \ effect of the wearer's wild shape ability (if any) lasts for 3 additional hours,\
  \ and when the wearer is under the effects of a vermin shape spell, the spell lasts\
  \ for 7 additional minutes."
