description: "Troll styptic is used as a field treatment for wounds and bleeding,\
  \ particularly where magical healing is not available. When applied directly to\
  \ wounds, this jar of paste grants a living creature fast healing 2 for 2d4 rounds.\
  \ While active, the styptic also closes any open wounds the subject receives, negating\
  \ any bleed effects that would affect the target. This is a painful cure, and the\
  \ target must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for the styptic's\
  \ duration."
