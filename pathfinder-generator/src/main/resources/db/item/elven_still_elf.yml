description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis tall, slim crystal retort is designed to\
  \ ferment a small amount of liquid or foodstuff into alcohol. Any suitable sugary\
  \ food or drink left in the retort for 24 hours ferments into sweet elven wine,\
  \ although the wine's quality varies according to the quality of the ingredients.\
  \ If a potion is added to an elven still, the retort consumes it over a period of\
  \ 24 hours, destroying the potion. During this fermenting process, an elven user\
  \ can cast any spell suitable for making into a potion into the elven still, imbuing\
  \ the final wine as if it were a potion of the spell cast. This new potion must\
  \ have a gp value equal to or less than the potion originally consumed by the elven\
  \ still.\nWine fermented in an elven still spoils 24 hours after its completion,\
  \ destroying any magical properties."
