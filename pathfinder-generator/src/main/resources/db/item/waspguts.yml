description: "This golden, oily alchemical reagent can be applied to any surface or\
  \ delivered as a touch attack (the wielder exposes herself unless she uses a glove\
  \ and disposes of it afterward). A creature or object marked with waspguts attracts\
  \ angry insects. Vermin within 30 feet attack the target over other available creatures.\
  \ Wasps are affected at a range of up to 1 mile; in most environments where wasps\
  \ live, the target is stung by at least one wild wasp per hour. The effect lasts\
  \ 8 hours or until washed or scraped off (a full-round action). Waspguts can also\
  \ be thrown as a splash weapon. A direct hit deals no damage, but exposes the target\
  \ to the waspguts' effects. Crafting waspguts requires a successful DC 20 Craft\
  \ (alchemy) check."
