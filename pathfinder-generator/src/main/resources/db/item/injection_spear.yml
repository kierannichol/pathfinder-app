description: "This exotic two-handed weapon allows the user to inject targets with\
  \ liquid on a hit. The spear's reservoir can hold up to 5 doses of a single fluidâ€”\
  a single dose is automatically injected when the spear hits a target. A non-proficient\
  \ user can wield an injection spear as a standard spear but cannot trigger the injection.\
  \ An injection spear is otherwise identical to a normal spear, save that it cannot\
  \ be thrown, weighs 8 pounds, cannot be used to brace, and costs 60 gp."
