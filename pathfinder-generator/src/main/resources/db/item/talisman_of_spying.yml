description: "This small decorative object can take almost any form but is always\
  \ small and seemingly valuable. The item seems so intriguing and delightful that\
  \ any creature holding it—including while examining it with Appraise or Spellcraft\
  \ checks—becomes infatuated with the object and compelled to keep it (Will DC 13\
  \ negates).\nEach talisman of spying is linked to a ring when created. Any creature\
  \ within 30 feet of a talisman of spying takes a –5 penalty on saving throws against\
  \ divinations used by the ring's wearer. The ring's wearer is always aware of the\
  \ direction and distance to the talisman and can discern the general condition of\
  \ a creature carrying the talisman as if using status. Once per day, the creature\
  \ wearing the talisman's ring can use scry upon the talisman. This functions as\
  \ scrying if the talisman is carried by a creature, or as clairaudience/clairvoyance\
  \ if the talisman is unattended."
