description: "The head of this bronze scepter is shaped like a roaring lion leaping\
  \ forward. When held by a creature with no ranks in the Handle Animal skill, this\
  \ rod allows the wielder to teach tricks to any animal with an Intelligence score\
  \ of 1 or 2 as though the wielder were trained in the use of that skill. Regardless\
  \ of whether the wielder of a rod of animal training has ranks in Handle Animal,\
  \ she gains a +5 competence bonus on Handle Animal checks to teach a trick to an\
  \ animal or to train an animal for a general purpose, and the wielder can use charm\
  \ animal (DC 11) as a spell-like ability three times per day."
