description: "These Large gauntlets are bulky, and the palms and fingers are studded\
  \ with wickedly serrated spikes. The wearer gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls with\
  \ its claw attacks; the wearer adds this bonus damage once for each claw attack\
  \ used in a rend. The crude construction and thick metal used in the gauntlets make\
  \ it difficult for the wearer to perform fine manipulation. Consequently, the wearer\
  \ takes a â€“4 penalty on all Dexterity-based checks involving her hands."
