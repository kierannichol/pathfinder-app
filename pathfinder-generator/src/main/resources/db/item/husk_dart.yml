description: "This thick metal +2 wushu dart has a ring at its base tied with a short\
  \ ribbon of green silk. If the wielder confirms a critical hit against a living\
  \ creature with the husk dart, the creature is stricken with an insatiable hunger,\
  \ as feast of ashes (Fortitude DC 16 negates). If the creature fails its saving\
  \ throw, the husk dart's wielder gains 2d6 temporary hit points that last up to\
  \ 24 hours and is nourished as though he had just eaten a normal meal; a wielder\
  \ with the ki pool class feature also regains 1 ki point."
