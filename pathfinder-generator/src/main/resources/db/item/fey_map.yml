description: "This stylized and labeled map of the First World constantly shifts to\
  \ reflect the relative locations of dozens of major geographical features, settlements,\
  \ and other key locations. In addition, a tiny icon of whoever is currently holding\
  \ the map appears at the user's current location, moving to track the bearer's progress\
  \ as he travels. The map's scale is very large, covering thousands of square miles\
  \ of territory, and has little detail outside of the artistic representations of\
  \ key locations. Once per day, the user can fold the map so that his icon touches\
  \ the icon of one of the named locations; rubbing them together allows the user\
  \ to instantly transport himself and up to three other touched creatures to a point\
  \ just outside that location, as per teleport. Most fey maps acquired by residents\
  \ of Golarion show only the region of the First World closest to their world on\
  \ the Material Plane, but reports of those who have traveled beyond this region\
  \ suggest that some maps are capable of recalibrating to show new locations unknown\
  \ even to their creators. It's also not unheard of for strange new locations to\
  \ appear spontaneously in familiar territory as the First World shifts."
