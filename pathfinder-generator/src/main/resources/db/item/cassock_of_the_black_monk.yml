description: "This ankle-length black robe, cut in the style favored by Orthodox priests,\
  \ bears little outward ornamentation beyond its gold buttons, though subtle occult\
  \ symbols embroidered in black thread decorate the skirt's hem. The cassock of the\
  \ Black Monk grants a +4 luck bonus to the wearer's touch AC. In addition, while\
  \ wearing the cassock, an oracle of the occult mystery (see page 68) gains access\
  \ to the spectral spells revelation (see page 69) and may use it as if he had it\
  \ as a normal class feature. If the wearer already has that revelation, he can use\
  \ that ability one additional time per day. This ability has no effect if worn by\
  \ a non-oracle. If the wearer is an oracle but does not have the occult mystery,\
  \ once per day he can cast a spell with the Ectoplasmic Spell feat (Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Advanced Player's Guide 158) as a standard action that does not increase the level\
  \ of the spell. This ability has no effect if the wearer is a non-oracle."
