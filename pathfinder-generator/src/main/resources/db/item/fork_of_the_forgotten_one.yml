description: "This +5 flaming wounding unholy ranseur was once the weapon of a powerful\
  \ archdevil who they say controlled an entire layer of Hell. When he attempted to\
  \ defy the Prince of Darkness, he was overthrown and banished into some cold and\
  \ remote prison at the edge of the multiverse. Still bearing some infernal vestige\
  \ of the forgotten fiend's power, the fork grants the bearer a +10 bonus on Diplomacy\
  \ and Intimidate checks and the power to use scorching ray three times per day.\n\
  Any nonevil creature who touches the Fork of the Forgotten One is given a choice:\
  \ become lawful evil immediately, or die. Those who choose death are instantly slain\
  \ (Fortitude DC 30 negates). Those who choose to become lawful evil change alignment\
  \ immediately (no saving throw) and are subject to a demand spell (Will DC 25) requiring\
  \ that they find the Forgotten One and free him from his icy prison—presumably thereafter\
  \ he will press them into service for his plans of revenge against those who imprisoned\
  \ him."
destruction: "The Fork of the Forgotten One is destroyed when a paladin of 19th level\
  \ or higher touches it and chooses death rather than becoming lawful evil. This\
  \ sacrifice still kills the paladin, though she can be raised from the dead."
