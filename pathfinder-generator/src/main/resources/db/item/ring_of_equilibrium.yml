description: "A ring of equilibrium is a wooden ring carefully carved from core of\
  \ an oak tree, decorated with delicate runes, and sanded and finished to be perfectly\
  \ round, smooth, and symmetrical. When slipped on a finger, it sizes itself appropriately.\n\
  It's said the ring has a will of its own, but if it does, it evinces no obvious\
  \ agenda. It favors wearers who possess strong personality traits—either those with\
  \ strong morals, who exemplify goodness and honor, or those utterly devoid of morals,\
  \ with the vilest and blackest souls imaginable. The ring especially favors mythic\
  \ creatures, and often refuses to slip onto the finger of a creature that lacks\
  \ strong personality traits or isn't mythic.\nThe ring has no special power over\
  \ the living, but when its wearer dies or it's placed on the finger of a dead creature\
  \ it deems worthy, the corpse and equipment of the wearer remain where they are\
  \ but the ring vanishes entirely. Within 24 hours, a tree grows in a location that's\
  \ as close as possible to where the wearer died. The next day, the tree splits along\
  \ the middle, revealing a cavity where the wearer has been resurrected whole and\
  \ uninjured, with the ring still adorning her finger. If the wearer died in an unsafe\
  \ place, the tree appears as close to that location as possible while still being\
  \ relatively safe for the wearer.\nThis rebirth comes at a price. The wearer receives\
  \ certain knowledge that somewhere in the world, another being has been resurrected\
  \ along with her—an individual of an opposite alignment who is every bit as wretched\
  \ as the wearer is good, or vice versa. The opposite has roughly the same level\
  \ and power as the wearer. The wearer has no knowledge of this other party whatsoever,\
  \ other than that it exists and is free to do whatever it wishes—perpetrate any\
  \ crime or perform any good deed— thanks to the wearer. This opposite is always\
  \ brought back a considerable distance from the wearer. If the wearer dies again\
  \ but the opposite doesn't, the wearer is resurrected again, along with another\
  \ creature of an opposed nature. This cycle continues indefinitely until the ring\
  \ is discarded or it moves on."
destruction: "A ring of equilibrium is destroyed if the wearer commits suicide while\
  \ wearing it and while her opposite is still alive and healthy."
