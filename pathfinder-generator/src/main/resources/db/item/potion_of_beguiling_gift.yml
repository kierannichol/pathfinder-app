name: "Potion of Beguiling Gift"
description: "You offer an object to an adjacent creature, and entice it into using\
  \ or consuming the proffered item. If the target fails its Will save, it immediately\
  \ takes the offered object, dropping an already held object if necessary. On its\
  \ next turn, it consumes or dons the object, as appropriate for the item in question.\
  \ For example, an apple would be eaten, a potion consumed, a ring put on a finger,\
  \ and a sword wielded in a free hand. If the target is physically unable to accept\
  \ the object, the spell fails. The subject is under no obligation to continue consuming\
  \ or using the item once the spell's duration has expired, although it may find\
  \ a cursed item difficult to be rid of."
