description: "This ammunition is specifically crafted from silver, and though nonmagical,\
  \ it is particularly detrimental to lycanthropes, automatically confirming any critical\
  \ threats against such creatures. A firearm that is shooting a silver bullet takes\
  \ a –1 penalty on damage rolls (with a minimum of 1 point of damage)."
