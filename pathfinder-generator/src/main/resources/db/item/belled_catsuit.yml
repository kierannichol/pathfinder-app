description: "This form-fitting garment is strung all around with dozens of small\
  \ bells. You can practice your sneaking technique by donning a belled catsuit and\
  \ then attempting to move without letting any of the bells ring. Old thieves sometimes\
  \ call a belled catsuit a Billy-Jacket. Training with a belled catsuit requires\
  \ 1 hour of practice and a DC 25 Stealth check. If you succeed at the check, you\
  \ gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks to hide. This bonus lasts for 24\
  \ hours or until you fail a Stealth check."
