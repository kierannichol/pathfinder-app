description: "This vicious weapon is often used in gladiatorial events due to its\
  \ versatility. The body of the weapon is a standard short spear, primarily used\
  \ for thrusting. The butt of the spear is fitted with a length of chain, often spiked,\
  \ with a hook at the end. The hook and chain may be used to make trip attacks. If\
  \ your trip attack fails by 10 or more, you may drop the chain spear to avoid being\
  \ knocked prone."
