description: "One half of this rod is made of gray, semisolid fog, while the other\
  \ half glows from within as if filled with flickering embers. A rod of gripping\
  \ smoke acts as a +1 ghost touch light mace. Three times per day, as the wielder\
  \ casts a spell that creates fog or smoke, it can make the effect particularly cloying,\
  \ causing the area of the spell to count as difficult terrain. This ability can't\
  \ modify fog or smoke spells that already specifically impede movement (like solid\
  \ fog).\nAdditionally, three times per day as a move action, the wielder of a rod\
  \ of gripping smoke can point the rod at any single target within an area of fog,\
  \ mist, smoke, or similar vapor within 60 feet (including the area of foglike spells\
  \ such as cloudkill or incendiary cloud) and cause the vapor to tighten around that\
  \ target. The wielder attempts a disarm, grapple, or steal combat maneuver at a\
  \ +16 bonus against the target's CMD. This combat maneuver doesn't provoke an attack\
  \ of opportunity. If the check to disarm succeeds, the disarmed weapon falls in\
  \ a random square adjacent to the target. If the check to grapple succeeds, the\
  \ target gains the grappled condition for 1 round. While grappled in this way, the\
  \ victim can't move without first breaking the grapple (CMD 26). If the check to\
  \ steal succeeds, the stolen item lands in a random square adjacent to the target;\
  \ unless the target succeeds at a DC 20 Perception check at the time the item is\
  \ stolen, it doesn't realize the item is missing until it either leaves the affected\
  \ area or attempts to use or retrieve the item."
