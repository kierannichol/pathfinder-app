description: "Rising from the floor of the heart chamber is a well of arcane power.\
  \ Filling the well to within a couple inches of the top is an inky black liquid\
  \ that drinks in the light. Within this liquid, shadowy landscapes rise and fall\
  \ sprinkled with dozens of tiny red blips. Evenly spaced around the side of the\
  \ well are three niches, each containing a bone fragment within an ornate reliquary.\n\
  The Demonscope serves three crucial functions. First, it serves as a potent scrying\
  \ device focused solely on demons. It automatically senses the location of any demon\
  \ in a 5-mile radius, bypassing any spell resistance they possess. Second, it focuses\
  \ divine energy to power the wardstones, a series of smaller artifacts that together\
  \ create a physical barrier against demons (see below). Finally, the Demonscope\
  \ creates a massive dimensional lock effect that extends in a 250-mile radius around\
  \ clydwell Keep. Although this effect does not prevent demons from entering the\
  \ Worldwound from the abyss, it does prevent them from teleporting from the Worldwound\
  \ out into the surrounding lands, and it prevents anyone from teleporting into Mendev.\
  \ The Demonscope serves a vital role in containing the demons in the Worldwound,\
  \ and preventing them from overrunning Mendev.\nTo safeguard the Demonscope, its\
  \ care passed into the able hands of St. clywell's three most powerful disciples.\
  \ along the pedestal, three celestial glyphs allowed them to focus their own power\
  \ to control the device, each representing the sentinel's personal virtue. Only\
  \ when all three sentinels were present could the artifact function properly.\n\
  When the first of the sentinels died, arcane artificers took the bone from his right\
  \ forearm and forged it into a magical key to assure the continued activation of\
  \ the Demonscope. Each of the Sentinels passed in turn and from their forearms were\
  \ carved two more shards. Shards were then passed to new protectors dedicated to\
  \ safeguarding the people and protecting the Demonscope. For years, the shards have\
  \ been passed down through the order, bestowed upon generations of successors. Each\
  \ shard is a 6-inch fragment of magically petrified bone, burnished black and polished\
  \ to a high sheen, and placed within a crystal reliquary. The surface is intricately\
  \ scrimshawed with sacred blessings dedicated to a specific sentinel. Along the\
  \ rim of the Demonscope pedestal are three sacred glyphs set before three sockets.\
  \ Carved in celestial, the three glyphs represent Truth, Valor, and Sacrifice; one\
  \ for each of the virtues for which the original Holy Sentinels stood: niamar for\
  \ Truth, Guenarog for Valor, and arymril for Sacrifice."
destruction: "The Demonscope requires constant attention and maintenance in order\
  \ to function. Powered by a combination of intrinsic magical power and the magical\
  \ potency of the demon that is imprisoned within it, the artifact requires that\
  \ a careful balance of power be maintained at all times, and the demon kept in check.\
  \ It takes the combined efforts of three strong-willed paladins to maintain control\
  \ over the demon. If one of them fails, the demon eventually overpowers the other\
  \ two and begin to corrupt the artifact itself, although this takes several days.\
  \ The easiest way to destroy the artifact, however, is to remove the bone shards.\
  \ Without the shards, the paladins are unable to control the demon, and it only\
  \ takes a few hours for it to break free from its prison."
