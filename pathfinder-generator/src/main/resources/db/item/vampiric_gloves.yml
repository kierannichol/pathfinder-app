description: "These pale, elegant-looking leather gloves have bloodred stitching on\
  \ the fingers—which bears a startling resemblance to blood-encrusted fingernails.\
  \ Three times per day, the wearer can use vampiric touch and bleed. If the wearer\
  \ uses vampiric touch and holds the charge, the charge dissipates if the gloves\
  \ are removed.\nThough vampiric touch is normally a touch attack, the wearer may\
  \ instead use that ability as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet, but\
  \ only against a dying target or a target suffering from a bleed effect. When using\
  \ vampiric touch in this way, the wearer may hold the charge on a missed ranged\
  \ touch attack.\nIf the wearer is suffering from a bleed effect, he may expend one\
  \ use of vampiric touch to end the bleed effect."
