name: "Scroll of Epidemic"
description: "The target contracts one of the following diseases: blinding sickness,\
  \ bubonic plague, cackle fever, filth fever, leprosy, mindfire, red ache, shakes,\
  \ or slimy doom, as the spell contagion. However, the disease is highly contagious,\
  \ and any creature that touches the infected target, is touched by the target, or\
  \ spends more than an hour in a confined space with the target must make a save\
  \ against the disease's normal DC (not the spell DC) or contract the disease. If\
  \ the initial target overcomes the disease by making the required number of saving\
  \ throws, it remains a carrier of the disease for a length of time equal to the\
  \ disease's frequency, and can continue to infect others during this time."
