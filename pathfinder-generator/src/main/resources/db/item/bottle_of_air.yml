description: "This item appears to be a normal glass bottle with a cork. When taken\
  \ to any airless environment, it retains air within it at all times, continually\
  \ renewing its contents. This means that a character can draw air out of the bottle\
  \ to breathe. The bottle can even be shared by multiple characters who pass it around.\
  \ Breathing out of the bottle is a standard action, but a character so doing can\
  \ then act for as long as she can hold her breath."
