description: "These runes may be carved from wood or cast in silver and are worn on\
  \ a leather cord. When a witch prepares her spells, she may also choose to use the\
  \ hexing runes to augment one hex she can use. The save DC of this hex increases\
  \ by 1 for 24 hours. Additionally, once per day when she speaks the command word,\
  \ the wearer gains the benefits of the ward hex as if cast by an 8th level witch."
