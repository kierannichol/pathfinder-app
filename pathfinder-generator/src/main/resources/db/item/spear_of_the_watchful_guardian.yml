description: "This magically strengthened bronze-tipped +1 spear enables its wielder\
  \ to better face a variety of foes. Originally created by priests of Nethys for\
  \ use by their temple guards, a spear of the watchful guardian also grants its wielder\
  \ arcane aid to strike true. Once per day as a standard action, the wielder of a\
  \ spear of the watchful guardian can alter the physical properties of the weapon,\
  \ allowing it to bypass damage reduction of one of the following types: bludgeoning,\
  \ cold iron, silver, or slashing. This change lasts for 5 minutes.\nIn addition,\
  \ if the wielder of a spear of the watchful guardian fails an attack roll, as an\
  \ immediate action once per day, she can retroactively add a +1 competence bonus\
  \ on that roll. If this bonus is enough to make the failure a success, the attack\
  \ roll succeeds.\nFinally, a spear of the watchful guardian sharpens the senses\
  \ of its wielder, granting her a +2 insight bonus on Perception checks."
