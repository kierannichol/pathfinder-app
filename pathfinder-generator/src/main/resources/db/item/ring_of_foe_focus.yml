description: "This ring of jagged steel gives the impression that it was salvaged\
  \ from a suit of armor and then crudely bent into a circle. The wearer of the ring\
  \ can, at will, designate any one opponent she can see as a particularly dangerous\
  \ foe. She gains a +2 bonus to her AC and saving throws against attacks made by\
  \ that opponent until she designates a new enemy."
