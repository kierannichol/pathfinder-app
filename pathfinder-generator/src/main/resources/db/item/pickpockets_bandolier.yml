description: "Carefully embroidered black leather makes up this stylish bandolier,\
  \ which can hold as many as 12 daggers, vials, or similarly shaped items. The wearer\
  \ of a pickpocket's bandolier opposes Sleight of Hand checks attempt against her\
  \ with her own Sleight of Hand checks (instead of Perception). Additionally, as\
  \ a swift action after succeeding at a Sleight of Hand check, the wearer can stuff\
  \ stolen goods (of size Tiny or smaller) into one of the slots on the pickpocket's\
  \ bandolier, making the purloined object appear to be a simple dagger. Only a careful\
  \ examination of the bandolier reveals the true nature of items concealed in this\
  \ manner."
