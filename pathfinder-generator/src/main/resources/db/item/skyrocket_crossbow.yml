description: "The stock and bow of this +1 distance hand crossbow are decorated with\
  \ the golden head of an osprey, sea eagle, or other avian creature. Three times\
  \ per day, a skyrocket crossbow can imbue one of two special abilities on its ammunition.\n\
  The first causes a bolt fired from the crossbow to explode in a dazzling burst of\
  \ colored light when it hits a creature or object, or if it reaches its maximum\
  \ range increment (600 feet). Creatures within a 10-foot radius of the target point\
  \ are blinded for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful DC 13 Will save means a creature is\
  \ dazzled for 1 minute instead. Sightless creatures, or those without line of sight\
  \ to the target point, are unaffected.\nThe second ability causes a bolt fired from\
  \ the crossbow to function as a screaming bolt (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 475)."
