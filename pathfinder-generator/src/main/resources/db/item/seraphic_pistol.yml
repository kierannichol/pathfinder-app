description: "The gold-washed barrel of this elegant +2 double-barreled pistol always\
  \ catches the light, and its maple grip feels pleasantly warm to the touch. When\
  \ its wielder successfully bypasses an evil creature's damage reduction with a single\
  \ attack, the creature's skin cracks into fissures of golden light. This light negates\
  \ the creature's DR for the gunslinger and her allies, fading away after 1 minute."
