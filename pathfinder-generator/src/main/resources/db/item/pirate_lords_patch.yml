description: "This eye patch is woven entirely from gold cloth and features a skull\
  \ and crossbones embroidered in black stitching. A pair of small sapphires is sewn\
  \ into the cloth within the skull's eye sockets, making them appear as gleaming\
  \ pinpricks of blue light. The wearer can see as if the eye patch were not there.\n\
  The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on Appraise and Intimidate checks. Once per\
  \ day, the wearer can activate the patch in order to gain the benefits of see invisibility\
  \ for 5 minutes. Additionally, once per day, he can activate the patch in order\
  \ to see through solid objects for 1 minute, as though with a ring of x-ray vision."
