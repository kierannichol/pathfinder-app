description: "When this worn leather strap is tied around the grip of a weapon, the\
  \ weapon becomes immune to the harmful environmental effects of a plane, such as\
  \ heat or acidity. This does not protect the weapon against non-environmental energy\
  \ effects; although it would apply to the ambient fire damage caused by being on\
  \ the Plane of Fire, it would not apply to damage caused by a fireball spell. If\
  \ the weapon is destroyed, the planar strap is destroyed with it. It is a full-round\
  \ action to tie or untie a strap. You can only have one planar strap applied to\
  \ a weapon at a time."
