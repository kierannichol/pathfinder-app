description: "This +1 returning light hammer can strike multiple foes with a single\
  \ throw. If the wielder has multiple attacks from a high base attack bonus, he may\
  \ throw the hammer so it rebounds off the first target to strike at a second target,\
  \ and so on for each of the wielder's additional attacks. The distance to each target\
  \ adds to the total range of the weapon, and range penalties apply. For example,\
  \ a 6th-level dwarf fighter can throw the hammer using his +6 BAB at a target 20\
  \ feet away (within one range increment, no range penalty); if it hits, he ricochets\
  \ it to attack using his +1 BAB at a second target 40 feet away from the first target\
  \ (within three range increments for a â€“4 range penalty). The hammer can only ricochet\
  \ if it successfully hits a target; if it misses, it stops ricocheting, has no further\
  \ attacks that round, and returns as normal for a weapon with the returning property.\
  \ Because ricocheting attacks are treated as separate attacks, modifiers that only\
  \ apply to one attack roll (such as true strike) only apply to the first attack\
  \ and not the others. The ricochet attacks count as the wielder's additional attacks\
  \ for that round."
