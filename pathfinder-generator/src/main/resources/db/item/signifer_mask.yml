description: "The menacing, eyeless masks of Hellknight signifers were first created\
  \ by members of the Order of the Gate and are semitransparent on the inside. Those\
  \ who wear them are treated as if they were wearing smoked goggles (Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Ultimate Equipment 72). A character with the Hellknight signifer prestige class\
  \ (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Paths of Prestige 28) can see through the mask as\
  \ normal, but can also adjust her mask as a standard action to function as a pair\
  \ of smoked goggles once more. Signifer masks are often enhanced, becoming variants\
  \ of items that take up the head item slot. Additionally, when a character takes\
  \ levels in the Hellknight signifer prestige class, this mask grants the benefits\
  \ and capabilities of the signifer mask supernatural ability."
