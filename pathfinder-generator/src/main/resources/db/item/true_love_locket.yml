description: "These gold, heart-shaped pendants, which open to reveal small hollows\
  \ inside, always come in pairs and must be on the same plane of existence to function.\
  \ When two people with a strong emotional bond (such as good friends, family members,\
  \ or lovers) each wear one of the lockets containing a keepsake from the other person\
  \ (usually a lock of hair or small picture), the lockets' magic becomes evident.\
  \ After 24 hours of wearing a linked locket, each wearer knows the condition of\
  \ the other, as a constant status spell. In addition, when either wearer uses the\
  \ aid another action to assist the wearer of the linked locket, the bonus gained\
  \ is increased by 1. Lastly, once per day, each wearer may use one of the known\
  \ skills of the wearer of the linked locket, as borrow skill (Pathfinder RPG Advanced\
  \ Player's Guide 207). If either wearer of a linked true love locket takes the pendant\
  \ off, has it forcefully removed, is killed, or travels to another plane, both lockets\
  \ cease to function until re-attuned after 24 hours."
