description: "These grim orbs swirl hypnotically with shades of crimson and the color\
  \ of the draconic breed whose minds they can ensnare. The bearer of an Orb of Dragon\
  \ Mastery can, as a standard action, dominate dragons of the orb's particular variety\
  \ within 250 feet (as dominate monster), the target dragon being forced to make\
  \ a DC 23 Will save to resist. Spell resistance is not useful against this effect.\
  \ By steeping the orb for 1 hour in the blood of a true dragon that has been dead\
  \ for no more than a day, the DC to resist the orb's dominate monster effect can\
  \ be increased by an amount equal to the slain dragon's age category. (Thus, steeping\
  \ the orb in the blood of an old dragon would increase the DC by +8.) This bonus\
  \ decreases by –1 every day until the orb returns to its normal DC or is again steeped\
  \ in a dragon's blood. An Orb of Dragon Mastery cannot be steeped in the blood of\
  \ multiple dragons for an increased benefit. The blood may come from any breed of\
  \ true dragon, not just dragons of the orb's color."
destruction: "A dragon of the color the Orb of Dragon Mastery controls must willingly\
  \ swallow the orb, an act that kills the dragon but also shatters the artifact."
