description: "This rod is made of polished gold, and features three blownglass onion\
  \ domes at one end. It functions as a +1 light mace. Up to three times per day,\
  \ with a successful hit in combat, the wearer may attempt to put the target of the\
  \ attack asleep (DC 14 Will save negates). This functions as sleep, but there is\
  \ no limit to the number of Hit Dice that may be affected.\nIn addition, the wielder\
  \ may create an opaque sphere of force to protect himself from the elements once\
  \ per day, as a tiny hut spell with a 5-foot radius. If the wielder goes to sleep\
  \ with the rod in his possession, 8 hours of sleep provides healing equivalent to\
  \ a full day of bed rest. Upon waking, the wielder enjoys the benefits of a good\
  \ hope spell for 1 hour."
