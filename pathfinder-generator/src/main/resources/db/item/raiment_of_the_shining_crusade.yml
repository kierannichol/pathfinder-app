  \ under General Arnisant. The wearer of raiment of the shining crusade gains a +2\
  \ sacred bonus on saving throws against channeled negative energy and to resist\
  \ negative levels. When worn by a character with the smite evil class feature, the\

  \ feature can expend one use of this ability as an immediate action to create a\
  \ defensive ward around an adjacent creature, granting the target a deflection bonus\
  \ to AC and a resistance bonus on saves equal to the wearer's Charisma bonus against\
  \ attacks and effects originating from creatures with an evil alignment. This effect\
  \ lasts for 1 round."
