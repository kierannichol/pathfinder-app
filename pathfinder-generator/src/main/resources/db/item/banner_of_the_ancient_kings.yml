description: "This tattered white canvas banner looks like an old piece of sailcloth,\
  \ or perhaps a winding shroud—a 4-foot-by-6-foot rectangle with loops that can fit\
  \ over a spear haft or pole running up one side. If mounted on a longspear or pole\
  \ at least 8 feet in length, the banner shifts in appearance to match the heraldry\
  \ or coat of arms of the person who attached it. If that person has no device, the\
  \ flag instead displays a device that echoes the owner's personality (such as a\
  \ favorite animal, favored weapon, or holy symbol of the wielder's deity).\nWhen\
  \ carried into battle, a banner of the ancient kings confers several benefits. As\
  \ long as the longspear or pole to which the banner is attached is firmly wielded\
  \ in two hands, its carrier gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Initiative checks.\
  \ In addition, when so wielded, it grants the wielder and all allies within 30 feet\
  \ a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects. If\
  \ the carrier of the banner fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect,\
  \ he may attempt a new saving throw against that effect every round he continues\
  \ to wield the banner of the ancient kings — once he releases his firm grip on the\
  \ banner's haft, though, he no longer gets this benefit, even if he wields the banner\
  \ properly at a later point while still under the effects of the mind-affecting\
  \ effect.\nIf the banner's carrier possesses the Flagbearer feat (Pathfinder Campaign\
  \ Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 286), the banner of the ancient kings doubles\
  \ the morale bonuses granted by that feat. A bard who carries a longspear or pole\
  \ to which a banner of the ancient kings has been attached is treated as four levels\
  \ higher than his actual bard level for the purposes of determining the bonuses\
  \ granted by his inspire courage bardic performance ability."
