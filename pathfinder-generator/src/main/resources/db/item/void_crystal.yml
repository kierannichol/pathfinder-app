description: "The void crystal crackled into existence through interplanetary feedback\
  \ between a device on Golarion—one of two linked magical rings—and a facility on\
  \ Eox. The ring that's buried deep beneath the Dim Gate sits at the center of this\
  \ great crystal, which shudders and expands in the collection chamber each time\
  \ the proper alignment of celestial bodies comes to pass.\nThe void crystal is attuned\
  \ to the creature that wears its control ring, which is inherently linked to the\
  \ ring at the center of the crystal. As a move action, a creature wearing the ring\
  \ can trigger the crystal to discharge negative energy. This discharge fills the\
  \ chamber, and deals 150 points of negative energy damage (Will DC 20 half). Undead\
  \ creatures in the area of the discharge are healed of 150 points of damage. The\
  \ reservoirs in the Dim Gate usually contain enough energy to power this discharge\
  \ three times per week.\nAlso, a creature in control of the void crystal can use\
  \ its necromantic energy to raise any creature killed by the discharge as an undead\
  \ creature as if using animate dead, create undead, or create greater undead. The\
  \ creature in control of the void crystal can control up to 30 HD of undead created\
  \ in this manner.\nFinally, a creature in control of the void crystal can use dimension\
  \ door at will to travel to the collection chamber or the Dim Gate's control room."
destruction: "The void crystal can be destroyed by subjecting it to 16 continual hours\
  \ of true sunlight without removing it from its receptacle in the collection chamber."
