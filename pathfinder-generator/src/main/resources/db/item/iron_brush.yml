description: "This is an ironhandled version of a scholar's brush with a sharpened\
  \ handle. Though it does little damage, it is easily concealed (you gain a +2 bonus\
  \ on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal an iron brush on your body) and can\
  \ be thrown short distances, or used to jab at key nerve clusters and acupuncture\
  \ points to surprisingly devastating effect."
