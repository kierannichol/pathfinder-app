description: "Holy water damages undead creatures and evil outsiders almost as if\
  \ it were acid. A flask of holy water can be thrown as a splash weapon.\nTreat this\
  \ attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks\
  \ if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal\
  \ creature, you must open the flask and pour the holy water out onto the target.\
  \ Thus, you can douse an incorporeal creature with holy water only if you are adjacent\
  \ to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\n\
  A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points of damage to an undead creature\
  \ or an evil outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask\
  \ hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash.\nTemples to good deities sell holy\
  \ water at cost (making no profit). Holy water is made using the bless water spell."
