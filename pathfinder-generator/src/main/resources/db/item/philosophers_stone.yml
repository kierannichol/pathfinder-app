description: "This rare substance appears to be an ordinary, sooty piece of blackish\
  \ rock. If the stone is broken open (break DC 20), a cavity is revealed at the stone's\
  \ heart. This cavity is lined with a magical type of quicksilver that enables any\
  \ character with at least 10 ranks in Craft (alchemy) to transmute base metals (iron\
  \ and lead) into silver and gold. A single philosopher's stone can turn up to 5,000\
  \ pounds of iron into silver (worth 25,000 gp), or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into\
  \ gold (worth 50,000 gp). However, the quicksilver becomes unstable once the stone\
  \ is opened and loses its potency within 24 hours, so all transmutations must take\
  \ place within that period.\nThe quicksilver found in the center of the stone may\
  \ also be put to another use. If mixed with any cure potion while the substance\
  \ is still potent, it creates a special oil of life that acts as a true resurrection\
  \ spell for any dead body it is sprinkled upon."
destruction: "The philosopher's stone can be destroyed by being placed in the heel\
  \ of a titan's boot for at least 1 entire week."
