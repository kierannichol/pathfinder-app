description: "This simple, hollow tube roughly as long as the user's forearm is typically\
  \ made to resemble a specific type of aquatic foliage, so that its user remains\
  \ inconspicuous while underwater. Using a breathing tube, an air-breathing creature\
  \ can stay fully submerged under water indefinitely, as long as it remains near\
  \ enough to the surface of the water for the tube to reach the air."
