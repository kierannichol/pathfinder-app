description: "Favored by the grave-wardens of sites known to be infested with the\
  \ spirits of the dead, this pendant is an iron ring strung on a necklace made from\
  \ polished and discolored bones, nails, and teeth. A faint blue light limns the\
  \ wearer, protecting him from attack. Undead creatures are repulsed by this light\
  \ and take a –2 penalty on all attack rolls against the wearer of a gravewatch pendant.\
  \ Incorporeal undead creatures are further repulsed and instead take a –4 penalty\
  \ on all attack rolls against the wearer. Undead creatures can sense this light\
  \ easily, however, and receive a +4 circumstance bonus on Perception checks to detect\
  \ a creature wearing this pendant."
