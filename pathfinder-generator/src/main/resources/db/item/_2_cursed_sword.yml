description: "This longsword performs well against targets in practice, but when used\
  \ in combat its wielder takes a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls.\nAll damage dealt is\
  \ also reduced by 2 points, but never below a minimum of 1 point of damage on any\
  \ successful hit. The sword always forces that character to employ it rather than\
  \ another weapon. The sword's owner automatically draws it and fights with it even\
  \ when she meant to draw or ready some other weapon."
