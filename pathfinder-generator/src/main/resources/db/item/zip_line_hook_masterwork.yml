description: "This blunt iron hook secures to the user's forearm with a sturdy strap.\
  \ When this item is hooked onto a rope or a similar object that has been fastened\
  \ at a downward angle, the owner can use it to climb down the rope at a speed of\
  \ 30 feet as a move action instead of climbing at her normal speed, but the user\
  \ must take at least one move action doing so each round or she falls. Using a zip-line\
  \ hook in this way requires a successful DC 5 Climb check for declinations of 90\
  \ degrees (straight down), increasing by 5 for every 15 degrees off that baseline\
  \ in either direction, to a maximum DC of 30 at a 15- or 165-degree declination.\
  \ It is impossible to utilize a zip-line hook on a rope without a slope, or to ascend\
  \ an upward-sloping one.\nZip-line hooks are designed for use with two hands. A\
  \ character can use a zip-line hook one-handed, but if she does so, she takes a\
  \ –8 penalty on her Climb checks. Moving via a zip line is considered rigorous motion\
  \ for the purpose of casting spells. If a zip line or its rope becomes broken while\
  \ in use, the character using the zip line falls.\nA zip-line hook can be improvised\
  \ from cloth, leather, or any flexible hook-shaped object. Each time the character\
  \ uses a move action to move with an improvised zip-line hook, the hook takes 1d6\
  \ points of damage from friction. A masterwork zip-line hook grants a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus on Climb checks to descend a rope."
