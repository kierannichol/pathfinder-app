description: "Often crafted by the people of Riverton and sold to traveling river-goers,\
  \ this small stone disk is etched with the symbol of waves and affixed to a silver\
  \ chain. If the wearer falls unconscious from drowning while wearing a drowning\
  \ medallion, she can remain unconscious for up to 10 minutes before she must start\
  \ attempting Constitution checks to avoid asphyxiation. One round after emerging\
  \ from the substance that caused the wearer to drown (usually water), the wearer\
  \ regains consciousness at 0 hit points and the medallion crumbles to dust."
