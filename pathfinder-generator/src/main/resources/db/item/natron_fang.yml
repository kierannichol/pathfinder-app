description: "Carved from a single chunk of magically strengthened mineral salts,\
  \ a natron fang is a +1 khopesh (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 30) forged to\
  \ combat the undead, specifically mummies and incorporeal undead. A natron fang\
  \ overcomes the damage reduction of mummies, mummified creatures, and other mummy-like\
  \ creatures at the GM's discretion. Once per day on a successful strike against\
  \ an incorporeal undead creature, a natron fang also deals 1d6 points of Charisma\
  \ damage (Will DC 13 half) in addition to the weapon's normal damage."
