description: "This simple iron amulet is in the shape of an eye within a helm. It\
  \ must be worn in plain sight to have any effect. When activated, an iron eye allows\
  \ its wielder to expend its power to gain a sacred (if activated with positive energy)\
  \ or profane (if activated with negative energy) bonus on her next Intimidate check.\
  \ This bonus is equal to the number of dice of the activating cleric's channel energy\
  \ ability. The amulet remains charged until its magic is used or 1 hour passes."
