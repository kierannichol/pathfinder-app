description: "This carved cacodaemon skull bears dozens of sharp teeth and is strung\
  \ on a thin iron chain adorned with vertebrae. Once per day as a full-round action,\
  \ the wearer can use the skull to draw forth the life essence of a dying or recently\
  \ dead creature to cast create soul gem. The wearer can ingest this soul gem as\
  \ a standard action. This frees the soul within the gem, which can be raised from\
  \ the dead normally. The wearer then gains fast healing 2 for a number of rounds\
  \ equal to the consumed soul's Hit Dice when it was still living. Draining a soul\
  \ with the necklace or consuming a soul gem is an evil act."
