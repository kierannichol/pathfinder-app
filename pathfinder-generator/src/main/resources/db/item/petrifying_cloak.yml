description: "This gray magical cloak seems to be a protective cloak, but when it\
  \ is donned, the wearer must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be instantly petrified.\
  \ If the initial saving throw succeeds, the creature wearing the cloak must make\
  \ further checks at the start of each of its turns. On any failed saving throw the\
  \ creature becomes petrified. A remove curse or stone to flesh transforms the wearer\
  \ back, at least long enough for someone to take the cloak off the wearer."
