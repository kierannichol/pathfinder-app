description: "This shining white cloak is trimmed with golden sunbursts and continuously\
  \ radiates light (as per the light spell, but only in a 10-foot radius). Twice per\
  \ day, the wearer can command the cape to erupt in a burst of light, blinding all\
  \ creatures other than the wearer within 20 feet for 1d4 rounds (Reflex DC 14 negates).\
  \ After triggering this burst, the wearer becomes invisible (as the invisibility\
  \ spell, with a duration of 1 minute) and the cape's light is extinguished as long\
  \ as the wearer is invisible."
