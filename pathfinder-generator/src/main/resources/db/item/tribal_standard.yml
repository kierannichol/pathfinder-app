description: "Mounted on a sturdy 15-foot pole, this flag inspires all orcs belonging\
  \ to the tribe it represents. As long as they are within 60 feet and can see the\
  \ standard, they gain a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. The\
  \ standard must be carried in one hand by a member of the tribe to have any effect\
  \ (it provides no bonus if hung on a wall, draped over a throne, and so on). If\
  \ the standard is brought low (such as by its bearer dropping it in the mud), defiled,\
  \ destroyed, or captured, the tribe's members take a â€“1 penalty on attack rolls\
  \ and saving throws versus fear effects for the next hour. If the orcs reclaim a\
  \ captured standard, the penalties end and the bonus is restored."
