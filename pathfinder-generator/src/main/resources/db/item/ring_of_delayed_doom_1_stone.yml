description: "This band has nine garnets embedded along its exterior. Whenever the\
  \ wearer's mind or body first becomes subject to any harmful effect that allows\
  \ a saving throw to resist or mitigate it, he may, as an immediate action, choose\
  \ to delay the onset of that effect for 1 minute, after he fails the saving throw\
  \ but before its effects occur. This activation causes one of the garnets to turn\
  \ to powder. When that minute passes, the wearer may continue to delay the onset\
  \ of this harmful effect an additional minute as an immediate action by willing\
  \ the ring to do so, which destroys another garnet, thus repeating the cycle for\
  \ another minute. The delayed harmful effect occurs when the wearer falls unconscious,\
  \ when the ring is removed, or 1 minute after the last time the ring's power activated;\
  \ rounds spent delaying the effect do not count toward the effect's duration (for\
  \ example, a curse that lasts 5 rounds takes effect for a full 5 rounds, even if\
  \ the wearer delayed its effect several minutes). Effects that protect against or\
  \ negate the harmful effect work normally while it is delayed, for example, neutralize\
  \ poison cast on the wearer while he delays the effect of a poisonous bite removes\
  \ the poison effect."
