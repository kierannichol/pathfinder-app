name: "Oil of Bone Flense"
description: "Choose a creature that you can see. When that creature is struck by\
  \ a weapon wielded by a member of the Red Mantis, a sawtooth sabre, or by the claw\
  \ of a giant mantis, the bone nearest to the wound instantly sprouts jagged, razor-sharp\
  \ spurs that flense the muscle and flesh from the inside out unless the target succeeds\
  \ at a Fortitude save. The creature takes 1d6 points of piercing damage per caster\
  \ level. While the bone returns to normal immediately after dealing damage, the\
  \ creature takes 1d4 points of bleed damage for 1 round per 2 caster levels. The\
  \ victim is sickened by the pain for the duration of the bleeding. If the target\
  \ creature has no bones, this spell has no effect."
