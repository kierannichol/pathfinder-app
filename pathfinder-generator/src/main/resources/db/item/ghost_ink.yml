description: "Pale blue when wet, ghost ink dries to near-transparency 1 minute after\
  \ application. Ghost ink is used to subtly mark trails and locations. The pigment\
  \ glows red under the light shed by fire beetle glands and sunrods; otherwise, a\
  \ successful DC 25 Perception check is required to notice a mark in ghost ink. One\
  \ vial of ghost ink is sufficient for writing a page's worth of characters."
