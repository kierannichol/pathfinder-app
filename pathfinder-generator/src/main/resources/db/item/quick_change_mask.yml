description: "A wearer can remove this mask as a move action to change his appearance\
  \ as if using disguise self. The effect persists for 10 minutes. A vigilante can\
  \ instead remove a quick-change mask to switch his identity as a move action. If\
  \ the mask is used in this way, the effect functions just like changing identities\
  \ normally (except faster), and doesn't have a limited duration. Regardless of which\
  \ way he is using a quick-change mask, the user can attempt a Bluff check to create\
  \ a diversion so he can use Stealth as part of the same move action he uses to activate\
  \ the mask. The mask dissolves when used."
