description: "The following weapon is generally available only to members of the indicated\
  \ race or ethnicity.\nThis +1 short sword parts shadows in its wake, allowing its\
  \ wielder to ignore the miss chance associated with concealment due to darkness\
  \ or shadows, and to deal precision damage, such as sneak attack, against targets\
  \ benefiting from concealment. This ability applies only on strikes made with this\
  \ weapon, and does not affect the miss chance resulting from total concealment or\
  \ any other source of concealment (such as the blur spell)."
