name: "Wand of Debilitating Portent"
description: "The target is surrounded by a glowing green aura of ill fate. Each time\
  \ the spell's subject makes an attack or casts a spell, it must succeed at a Will\
  \ saving throw with a DC = 10 + 1/2 caster level + Charisma (in the case of oracles),\
  \ Intelligence (in the case of witches), or Wisdom (in the case of clerics). If\
  \ it fails the saving throw, it deals half damage with the attack or spell. You\
  \ can dismiss this spell as an immediate action when the target confirms a critical\
  \ hit; doing so negates the critical hit. The attack that you negated still hits,\
  \ but only deals half damage."
