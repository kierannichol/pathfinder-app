description: "This large bell appears to be cast from pure polished silver. It is\
  \ engraved with delicate runes around the bottom lip, and measures 3 feet from lip\
  \ to crown and 5 feet in circumference around the bottom. Sacred to the faith of\
  \ Desna, seven such bells are believed to have existed at one point, each housed\
  \ in a separate tower throughout the Inner Sea region. While these seven bell towers\
  \ were separated by great distance, they represented the Seven Towers of Desna's\
  \ palace, and pilgrimages to all seven were often undertaken by her faithful. Six\
  \ towers are located in the western Mierani Forest of Varisia, the Hungry Mountains\
  \ of Ustalav, the ruined city of Kokutang in the Sodden Lands, the eastern reaches\
  \ of Tanglebriar in Kyonin, a hidden cove on Warlock Island in Cheliax, and somewhere\
  \ in the hills south of White Canyon in Katapesh—over time, some of these locations\
  \ have become quite dangerous. Each location presents its own dangers, and in some\
  \ cases the bells themselves have gone missing. The seventh bell still hangs in\
  \ its tower in an old fort in the eastern Stonewilds of the Worldwound.\nA Bell\
  \ of Mercy's magic works only once per year, though it can be rung more often as\
  \ a normal bell. When activated, the bell sanctifies the area around it with the\
  \ effects of hallow with a 120-foot radius, and with the additional effects of protection\
  \ from evil for every good-aligned creature within the area. Within a 60-foot radius,\
  \ this also includes a chaotic good maximized forbiddance effect. Creatures whose\
  \ alignments are not chaotic or not good take 36 points of damage (Will DC 19 half)\
  \ upon entering this area, while creatures whose alignments are neither chaotic\
  \ nor good take 72 points of damage. All evil extraplanar creature within 60 feet\
  \ when the bell is rung must succeed at DC 20 Will save or be banished to their\
  \ plane of origin—evil outsiders who resist this are still staggered in this area\
  \ as a result of the bell's power. Finally, the immediate structure surrounding\
  \ the bell becomes infused with magic, causing doors and walls within its forbiddance\
  \ area to be magically treated (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 411) and repairing\
  \ damage at the rate of 5 points of damage per round. These repairs cannot repair\
  \ damage to a structure incurred before the bell was rung. A Bell of Mercy is constantly\
  \ under the effect of a dimensional lock, so it cannot be transported via teleportation."
destruction: "A Bell of Mercy may be destroyed by transporting it to the Abyss, where\
  \ it must be struck by an adamantine unholy longsword wielded by a balor lord."
