description: "Contrary to the name, a blasphemous chalice takes the form of an enchanted\
  \ box, usually sumptuously decorated, with a lump of unidentifiable tissue inside.\
  \ This tissue seems to somehow be alive and bleeds a watery, greenish-black blood.\n\
  To benefit from the chalice's power, a character must bite the tissue and drink\
  \ the blood as a full-round action. The alien blood twists and rearranges the character's\
  \ organs. For the next hour, when the affected creature is hit by a critical hit\
  \ or a sneak attack, there is a 50% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack\
  \ is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. A blasphemous chalice produces\
  \ enough blood for a single use per day."
