description: "These strange books are fashioned from a metallic alloy, the crafting\
  \ of which is known only to yithians and a very few others. Supposedly taken from\
  \ the same collection as the fabled Pnakotic Manuscripts and traded throughout the\
  \ multiverse, these books are collections of notes recorded by visitors to the yithians'\
  \ cities. Each book is written in multiple languages and provides a vast array of\
  \ information on a specifc topic, but the information it contains is often oddly\
  \ specifc and lacks context. A single Pnakotic record focuses on a single subject\
  \ within the confnes of a single Knowledge skill, such as a presentation on the\
  \ nature of deep one religious practices in worshiping Cthulhu (Knowledge [religion]),\
  \ the mechanics of a shoggoth's biology (Knowledge [dungeoneering]), or the methods\
  \ of creating portals between worlds (Knowledge [arcana]). By studying a Pnakotic\
  \ record for 8 hours, a reader can attempt a single Knowledge check of the appropriate\
  \ type when researching the book's corresponding subject to gain a +10 circumstance\
  \ bonus on the check."
