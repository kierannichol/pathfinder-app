description: "A green copper comb holds this pink-hued alabaster headpiece in its\
  \ wearer's hair, subtly infusing her skin with strength. In addition to providing\
  \ an air of loveliness to its wearer, a roseskin comb grants a +2 enhancement bonus\
  \ to its wearer's natural armor. In addition, three times per day as a standard\
  \ action, the wearer of a roseskin comb can command barbs to protrude from her skin,\
  \ as per thorn body, for 7 rounds."
