description: "This amulet can be worn by both corporeal and incorporeal creatures.\
  \ If worn by a corporeal creature, it confers the ghost touch special ability on\
  \ her natural attacks and weapons she wields (even thrown weapons and projectiles).\
  \ Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can make the next spell she casts affect\
  \ incorporeal creatures as though she were using the Ectoplasmic Spell metamagic\
  \ feat but without increasing the spell level.\nWhen an incorporeal creature wears\
  \ the amulet, it can interact with it surroundings. Any item in its possession becomes\
  \ incorporeal, allowing the incorporeal creature to take items and phase through\
  \ objects with them. An incorporeal creature without a Strength score uses its Charisma\
  \ score to determine how much it can carry."
