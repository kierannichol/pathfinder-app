description: "This heavy gold neck ring resembles a braided rope. When the wearer\
  \ performs a raging song or benefits from an ally's raging song, she gains the Diehard\
  \ feat for the duration of the song. In addition, she benefits from any helpful\
  \ raging song or bardic performance for 1 round after the performance ends or would\
  \ normally cease affecting the wearer. This does not stack with other means of prolonging\
  \ the effects of a performance that has ended."
