description: "Comprising several chunks of magnetized ore connected by twine, a clatterstone\
  \ creates an intense racket when it strikes a solid surface. The combination of\
  \ magnetic disturbances, noise, and vibrations interferes with blindsight. A creature\
  \ using blindsight perceives a detonated clatterstone as a Medium target until it\
  \ attempts to interact with the perceived \"creature\" or identifies it with some\
  \ other sense, such as darkvision. You can throw a clatterstone as a ranged attack\
  \ with a range increment of 20 feet, and it remains active for 1d4+1 rounds before\
  \ becoming inert."
