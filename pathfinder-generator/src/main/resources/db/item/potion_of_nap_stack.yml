name: "Potion of Nap Stack"
description: "You reduce the amount of uninterrupted sleep or rest creatures within\
  \ the spell's area need in order to recover from injuries, regain spells, or other\
  \ special abilities to 2 hours instead of the normal eight. In addition, if creatures\
  \ continue to sleep or rest beyond the initial 2 hours, every additional 2 hours\
  \ counts as a day of rest for the purpose of recovering hit points, ability damage,\
  \ as well as for enduring diseases, poisons, or other afflictions. This means 8\
  \ total hours of sleep counts as 4 days for natural healing and for saving throws\
  \ as diseases or similar afflictions run their course. When suffering from diseases,\
  \ poison, or other afflictions, sleepers experience vivid dreams that help them\
  \ track their recovery. If things go poorly they can, at any time, wake themselves\
  \ up in order to seek a better alternative. If awoken or otherwise disturbed during\
  \ this 8-hour period, creatures may return to sleep but they no longer enjoy the\
  \ benefits of the accelerated recovery time. Creatures can only enjoy the benefits\
  \ of this spell once in any 1-week period."
