description: "This drinking gourd has a slender neck capped with a tethered cork,\
  \ as well as a leather strap so it can be hung from a belt or pack. Once per day,\
  \ the gossiper's gourd can be filled with water from a village well or other local\
  \ water source, becoming attuned to that source as long as the gourd is full of\
  \ water. The bearer gains a +2 insight bonus on any Knowledge (local) checks she\
  \ attempts within a 1-mile radius of the water source, and can speak and understand\
  \ (though not read or write) the dominant local language in that area. These effects\
  \ persist as long as the attuned gourd is full.\nBy drinking all the local water\
  \ from a gossiper's gourd, the imbiber gains a +5 insight bonus on all Bluff, Diplomacy,\
  \ Knowledge (local), and Sense Motive checks within a 1-mile radius of the water\
  \ source for 1 hour. In addition, during that hour, the user can plant an idea or\
  \ suspicion in the mind of one local person within 30 feet by whispering the idea\
  \ into the empty gourd. This effect functions as sow thought, except the target\
  \ must be from the local area. A successful DC 12 Will save negates the effect.\n\
  A gossiper's gourd can't become attuned to a water source more than once per day.\
  \ For example, if the owner fills the gourd from a well at the beginning of the\
  \ day, then drinks the water, she must wait until the beginning of the next day\
  \ to benefit from the gourd again."
