description: "This horn is bound with fittings of gold and decorated with ornate carvings\
  \ depicting scenes of glorious battle. A fully charged horn has 3 charges—charges\
  \ used are automatically renewed each day. So long as the horn has at least one\
  \ charge remaining, it's owner can command it to fill with mead or a similar alcoholic\
  \ drink. A creature can spend one or more charges while drinking from the horn to\
  \ gain the following benefits:\n1 charge: The drinker gains 1d8 temporary hit points\
  \ (as if from an aid spell), which last for 1 minute.\n2 charges: The drinker gains\
  \ 1d8+5 temporary hit points and is enlarged, as the spell enlarge person, for 5\
  \ minutes.\n3 charges: The drinker gains 1d8+10 temporary hit points, is enlarged\
  \ for 10 minutes, and gains the benefit of a heroism spell for as long as she is\
  \ enlarged.\nA creature must drink deeply from the horn to receive its full benefit.\
  \ Using 1 charge is similar to drinking a potion—it takes a standard action and\
  \ provokes an attack of opportunity (though certain abilities can reduce the action\
  \ required). To use 2 charges, the drinker must spend a full round drinking from\
  \ the horn, which always provokes and attack of opportunity. To use all 3 charges,\
  \ the drinker must spend 2 full-round actions drinking from the horn."
