description: "This collection of coarsely ground spices, seeds, musk, and alchemical\
  \ reagents are meant to be rubbed into your skin and clothes in order to override\
  \ your scent, increasing the DC of tracking you by scent by +10 for 24 hours. Because\
  \ you still have a smell, creatures with scent can still detect and pinpoint you\
  \ if you are cloaked; they just can't identify your smell as something unique. Washing\
  \ for 1 full round removes the scent cloak."
