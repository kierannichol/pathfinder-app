name: "Wand of Nauseating Trail"
description: "The target exudes stinking vapors that fill its space. The vapors do\
  \ not obscure sight, but it nauseates creatures as stinking cloud. The target is\
  \ immune to these vapors. These vapors persist as the creature moves, filling every\
  \ square it passes through until it has filled a number of squares equal to 4 Ã—\
  \ your caster level--if you move through more squares than that, the squares over\
  \ that amount at not filled with the vapors. Each creature that enters or ends its\
  \ turn in the area filled with these vapors must succeed at a Fortitude save or\
  \ become nauseated as long as it remains in the square and for 1d4+1 rounds after\
  \ it leaves."
