description: "This garment is intended for a horse or similar quadruped, but it can\
  \ change size and shape to fit any four-legged creature ranging from Small to Huge\
  \ in size. When worn, a caparison of resistance offers the wearer magic protection\
  \ in the form of a +1 to +5 resistance bonus on all saving throws (Fortitude, Reflex,\
  \ and Will). This bonus on saving throws also applies to a single rider who is mounted\
  \ on the creature (in the case of multiple riders, the resistance bonus is not shared\
  \ at all and applies only to the mount)."
