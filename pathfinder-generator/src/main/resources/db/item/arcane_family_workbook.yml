description: "The elven predilection for becoming wizards and the social benefits\
  \ that elven wizards enjoy often encourages families to dedicate themselves to wizardly\
  \ studies for multiple generations. Older elven wizards take note of their own insights\
  \ into the secrets of arcane magic and compile these thoughts with the ideas of\
  \ earlier generations to form family workbooks. When used as a reference (an action\
  \ that typically takes 1d4 full rounds of searching the text), an arcane family\
  \ workbook grants a +2 circumstance bonus on a Spellcraft checks. This bonus increases\
  \ to +4 if 1d4 hours are spent referencing the book."
