description: "The artistic scrawls on the dark surface of this small bronze cauldron\
  \ depict an array of exotic animals, legendary beasts, leering fiends, and hosts\
  \ of elementals. Once per day, if used as the focus or divine focus for a summon\
  \ monster or summon nature's ally spell, the cauldron automatically conjures 1d3\
  \ additional creatures of the same kind from the next lower level list. For example,\
  \ if a user casts summon monster III to summon 1d3 wolves, he could also summon\
  \ 1d3 additional wolves (or other creatures from the 2nd-level list)."
