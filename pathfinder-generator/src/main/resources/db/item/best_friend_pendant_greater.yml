description: "Made of finely wrought platinum, this neckpiece is an improved version\
  \ of a best friend pendant. In addition to the regular abilities of a best friend\
  \ pendant, this version can absorb Medium and Large animals as well as Tiny or Small\
  \ elementals, magical beasts, and outsiders. Elementals, magical beasts, and outsiders\
  \ don't require Handle Animal checks to be made willing to enter the necklace, but\
  \ might require other forms of coercion at the GM's discretion."
