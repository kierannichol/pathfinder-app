description: "If this small scarab brooch is held for more than 1 round or carried\
  \ in a living creature's possessions for 1 minute, it changes into a horrible, burrowing,\
  \ beetlelike creature. The thing tears through any leather or cloth, burrows into\
  \ flesh, and reaches the victim's heart in 1 round, causing death. A DC 25 Reflex\
  \ save allows the wearer to tear the scarab away before it burrows out of sight,\
  \ but she still takes 3d6 points of damage. The beetle then returns to its scarab\
  \ form. Placing the scarab in a container of wood, ceramic, bone, ivory, or metal\
  \ prevents it from coming to life and allows for long-term storage of the item."
