description: "This golden ring is set with a large, almost gaudy onyx that can open\
  \ to reveal a hidden compartment with just enough room for a single dose of powdered\
  \ poison. This ring provides a +2 competence bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to\
  \ conceal this poison on the wearer's body. In addition, the ring contains four\
  \ charges that recharge each day. When drawing a poison from the band of efficacious\
  \ death, the wearer can tap the onyx up to four times to increase the frequency\
  \ of the poison by 1 increment per tap. For example, if the poison's frequency were\
  \ 1/round for 2 rounds, by touching the onyx once, the frequency would become 1/round\
  \ for 3 rounds."
