description: "This intricate glass and metal jug vibrates gently, and contains a light\
  \ cloud of white vapor and crackling blue electricity. Djinn of the Plane of Air\
  \ use thunder kettles to capture the essence of air and lightning elementals within\
  \ planar super storms. When uncorked as a standard action, a thunder kettle releases\
  \ a rumbling cacophony of thunder in a 10-foot-radius burst. Creatures in the area\
  \ must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of sonic damage and\
  \ become staggered for 1 round. A successful save halves the damage and negates\
  \ the staggered condition. This item can be crafted with a successful DC 25 Craft\
  \ (alchemy) check."
