description: "This spongy, mottled brown vest is several inches thick and composed\
  \ of woven strips of preserved fungus. The vest feels soft to the touch and springs\
  \ back into shape no matter how badly compressed. Its magic keeps the vest fresh\
  \ and whole despite constant wear and abuse.\nA mushroom vest protects you from\
  \ impact trauma. When wearing the vest, you treat any fall as if it were 20 feet\
  \ less when calculating damage."
