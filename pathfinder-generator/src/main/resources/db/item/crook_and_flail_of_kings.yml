description: "Crafted by the fabled thaumaturge Sekhmenathes of An for Hakotep's grandfather,\
  \ these two symbols of rulership were passed down to the Sky Pharaoh by his father\
  \ and buried with Hakotep in his crypt when his successor Djederet II ascended the\
  \ throne.\nThe crook is an 18-inch-long cane with a hooked head made of gold reinforced\
  \ with blue copper bands. It functions as a greater empower metamagic rod.\nThe\
  \ flail is a 2-foot-long rod of gold, ending with three beaded strands of semi-precious\
  \ stones. It functions as both a greater reach metamagic rod and a +2 thundering\
  \ flail.\nWhen the crook and flail are held simultaneously, one in each hand, the\
  \ wielder can cast spells without providing somatic components (as Still Spell,\
  \ but this doesn't use a higher level spell slot or increase casting time). Furthermore,\
  \ once per day as an immediate action, the wielder can reflect spells cast against\
  \ him for 1 round (as spell turning) up to a total of 9 spell levels. If the wielder\
  \ is a spellcaster, he can expend a prepared spell or spell slot to use this ability\
  \ again; he can reflect a total number of spell levels equal to the level of the\
  \ expended spell."
destruction: "If the rightful ruler of Osirion strikes the crook and flail together\
  \ with the intent to break them, both items shatter and turn instantly to sand."
