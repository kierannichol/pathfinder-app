description: "A tar bomb is an easy weapon to make, and devastating in use. A head-sized\
  \ lump of tar is wrapped around a rope and set on fire. You use the rope to lob\
  \ the burning tar onto an enemy's deck, where it sticks and sets the ship alight.\
  \ In many ways, a tar bomb functions as a less potent version of alchemist's fire,\
  \ as it deals less damage and lacks the splash damage of the more expensive substance.\
  \ Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.\
  \ Lighting a tar bomb is a move action.\nA hit with a tar bomb deals 1d4 points\
  \ of fire damage and has the potential to set the struck object or creature on fire,\
  \ causing an additional 1d6 points of fire damage each round unless the target or\
  \ an adjacent creature makes a DC 15 Reflex save to extinguish the flames as a full-round\
  \ action. Knocking the tar bomb or the burning creature or object into a body of\
  \ water or magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the fire."
