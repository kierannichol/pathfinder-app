description: "This heavy pastel candle is carved and painted to look like its outer\
  \ surface is covered with butterflies. A creature can use the candle to create a\
  \ dream effect conveying a message of no longer than 10 minutes. Alternatively,\
  \ the candle can be used to send up to 10 shorter messages, so long as the total\
  \ time is no longer than 10 minutes. The user must light the candle, identify the\
  \ intended recipient, speak the message, then snuff the candle; the next time the\
  \ recipient sleeps, she receives the message."
