description: "This finger-length crystal is a pale, opaque pink color when worn by\
  \ a living creature, but slowly changes to a deep, translucent violet when carried\
  \ by an undead. The wearer can consume spoiled food or drink as if it were fresh\
  \ and wholesome, tasting as good as it did before it spoiled. Any person with the\
  \ Profession (cook) skill can use the crystal to season a meal with the flavor of\
  \ salt, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, or pepper (or the equivalent spices for the undead\
  \ palate—fear's breath, nightfog, bloodroot, thileu bark, or hatefinger).\nIf Urgathoa\
  \ is the wearer's patron, the wearer can use death knell once per day. Both cure\
  \ and inflict spells heal the wearer, whether the wearer is living or undead; the\
  \ crystal flares with black or white energy when it converts these spells into a\
  \ form that does not harm the wearer. The crystal does not affect any other uses\
  \ of positive or negative energy, just cure and inflict spells (and effects that\
  \ duplicate those spells)."
