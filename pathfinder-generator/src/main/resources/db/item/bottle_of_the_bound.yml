description: "The Bottle of the Bound is an ancient brass bottle with a narrow neck\
  \ and a rounded belly, slightly flattened on the bottom so it stands upright when\
  \ resting on a table. The bottle's tight-fitting stopper is engraved with sigils\
  \ of binding and sealed with lead. Legends say a wizard of tremendous power and\
  \ wisdom enchanted a fiendish army and trapped it within the bottle for all time.\
  \ The Legion of the Bound may be called forth from the bottle by its wielder and\
  \ forced to serve, as they were once commanded to build a fantastic ancient city,\
  \ long since buried beneath the dust of the ages. But the bottle endures, its inhabitants\
  \ still bound.\nA would-be wielder of the Bottle of the Bound must know three secret\
  \ commands: the Word of Opening, to unseal the bottle so the stopper can be removed;\
  \ the Word of Binding, to call forth and command its denizens; and the Word of Banishment,\
  \ to return the Bound Ones to the bottle. A holder who knows the words may use the\
  \ bottle like a summon monster IX spell at will, except only creatures of the evil\
  \ subtype can be summoned. The summoned creatures remain until the sun next rises\
  \ or sets, and no new creatures can be summoned from the bottle until the initial\
  \ summoned creatures' destruction or return.\nNo known force can open the bottle\
  \ without the Word of Opening. If the bottle is opened without the use of the Word\
  \ of Binding, its 666 inhabitants are freed, one each minute starting from 1st-level\
  \ creatures and moving on to higherlevel ones, until they all escape. If one of\
  \ the Bound is called forth and commanded without the Word of Banishment being uttered,\
  \ it is free after it performs the task for which it was summoned. The Words to\
  \ use the Bottle of the Bound have been lost for uncounted years, although some\
  \ sages believe they know at least one or two of them."
destruction: "The Bottle of the Bound can be destroyed only if every creature bound\
  \ within is slain or banished, and the empty container is then smashed with a holy\
  \ weapon."
