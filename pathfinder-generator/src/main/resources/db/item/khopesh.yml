description: "This heavy blade has a convex curve near the end, making its overall\
  \ shape similar to that of a battleaxe. A typical khopesh is 20 to 24 inches in\
  \ length. Its curved shape allows the wielder to hook around defenses and trip foes.\
  \ The elegant shape of a khopesh leads some artisans to cover them in ornate decorations."
