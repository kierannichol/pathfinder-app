description: "The sacred weapon known as Dawnflower's Kiss is said to have been one\
  \ of a dozen identical weapons created long ago when Sarenrae split open the world\
  \ while fighting Rovagug. When she did this, fragments of the world turned molten\
  \ by her blade flew from the battle, landing in remote parts of Golarion where they\
  \ cooled and transformed into these potent scimitars. The weapons were sought out\
  \ by her church and were entrusted to her greatest champions. Over time, though,\
  \ those champions fell and the blades were lost.\nA Dawnflower's Kiss is a +4 holy\
  \ flaming scimitar. Once per round as a standard action, the wielder can slash at\
  \ the air with a Dawnflower's Kiss to fire a single bolt of searing light from the\
  \ weapon. Once per day, the wielder may instead unleash a sunbeam with this standard\
  \ action. In the hands of a worshiper of Sarenrae, the scimitar becomes a +5 holy\
  \ flaming burst scimitar that functions as a divine focus for spellcasting. If used\
  \ as a divine focus, the scimitar increases the save DC for the spell cast by 1.\
  \ Finally, by expending one use of mythic power, a worshiper of Sarenrae can as\
  \ a standard action throw the sword to make a single attack against up to eight\
  \ targets within 60 feet of her—these attacks resolve as melee attacks made at the\
  \ worshiper's highest attack bonus.\nThe Dawnflower's Kiss found in this adventure\
  \ was claimed long ago by Baphomet from a paladin of Sarenrae after her husband\
  \ betrayed her to the Horned Lord. The blade has been corrupted—it now functions\
  \ as a +4 unholy flaming scimitar, and none of its other powers function at all\
  \ until it is cleansed, such as through the redeemed corruption forge back in Drezen\
  \ or a miracle spell, or by bringing the scimitar to the unquiet shade of Lady Cessily\
  \ Mantiel in area H2. When handed the weapon, she sighs in relief and infuses the\
  \ blade with her spirit, restoring it to full functionality while simultaneously\
  \ releasing her spirit from the prison."
destruction: "A Dawnflower's Kiss must be thrown into the Pit of Gormuz at midnight\
  \ on the winter solstice. If the blade remains in the pit for 1 year, during which\
  \ time the light of the sun never strikes it, the weapon crumbles to corruption."
