description: "Common across the length and breadth of Golarion, secure sheaths take\
  \ a hundred different forms, from simple loops to richly engraved scabbards. A secure\
  \ sheath can be attuned to a new owner by that character wearing it continuously\
  \ for 24 hours. If anyone other than the owner attempts to draw a weapon from a\
  \ secure sheath, he finds that the weapon is stuck and must succeed at a DC 20 Strength\
  \ check to pull it out."
