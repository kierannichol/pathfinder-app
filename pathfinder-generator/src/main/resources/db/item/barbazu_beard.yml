description: "Popular in Egorian but rarely seen elsewhere, a barbazu beard is an\
  \ intimidating helm with a full facemask wrought to look like a snarling barbazu's\
  \ head. Extending from the chin area of the face guard is a razor-sharp blade much\
  \ like an actual barbazu's beard, usually 8 inches long but sometimes longer. A\
  \ barbazu beard can be used as an off-hand weapon that requires no hands to use;\
  \ thus, a warrior could combine use of a barbazu beard with a two-handed weapon.\
  \ It otherwise follows all rules for using an off-hand weapon. Attacking with a\
  \ barbazu beard provokes an attack of opportunity. Because it is so close to the\
  \ wearer's face, using a barbazu beard against creatures harmful to touch (such\
  \ as fire elementals and acidic oozes) has the same risks as using a natural weapon\
  \ or unarmed strike against these creatures.\nA barbazu beard is a light melee exotic\
  \ weapon."
