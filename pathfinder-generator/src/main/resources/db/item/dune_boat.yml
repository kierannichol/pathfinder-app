description: "Fashioned from bound reeds in traditional Osirian style, a dune boat\
  \ is a wondrous variant of the more common folding boat. Like that item, a dune\
  \ boat appears as a wooden box about 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches\
  \ deep when inactive, save that each surface is emblazoned with Ancient Osiriani\
  \ hieroglyphs. A dune boat functions identically to a folding boat, save that it\
  \ can move across sandy terrain as if it were moving across water. In boat form,\
  \ it can hold 6 people comfortably, while the ship form carries 20 with ease."
