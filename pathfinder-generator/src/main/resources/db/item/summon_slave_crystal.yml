description: "This thumb-sized crystalline skull is carved with necromantic runes.\
  \ Once per day, a spellcaster can grasp the stone while casting a summoning spell.\
  \ When the spellcasting is finished, the caster may immediately attempt to possess\
  \ the summoned creature, as if using magic jar, except as a free action. The creature\
  \ does not get a saving throw to resist, though spell resistance still applies.\
  \ If successful, the caster possesses the creatures' body until the duration of\
  \ the summoning spell ends, at which time his mind returns to his body, the creature's\
  \ mind returns to its body, and the creature disappears."
