description: "This +2 light crossbow is made of silver that never needs to be polished.\
  \ A mage's crossbow is especially effective against creatures with spell resistance.\
  \ Against such creatures, the weapon's effective enhancement bonus increases to\
  \ +3, and it deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. Whenever the wielder casts\
  \ a spell that requires him to make a ranged touch attack (such as a ray) while\
  \ he has the crossbow in hand, he gains a bonus on his ranged attack roll equal\
  \ to the crossbow's enhancement bonus against the target creature. If the spell\
  \ hits, the caster also applies this bonus to the caster level check to overcome\
  \ the target's spell resistance (if any) and on the spell's damage roll (if any)."
