description: "This simple bowl-shaped bell made of either cold iron or silver is played\
  \ by rubbing a leather mallet along its rim, creating a ringing sound. By playing\
  \ the bell while meditating or resting to regain ki, the bearer may attune his ki\
  \ points to the instrument. Once attuned, the bearer's ki strikes count as cold\
  \ iron (if the bell is cold iron) or silver (if the bell is silver) instead of magic\
  \ for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This lasts until the next time\
  \ the bearer rests or meditates to regain ki points. A creature can only be attuned\
  \ to one singing bell at a time, and a singing bell can only be attuned to one person\
  \ at a time. Only creatures whose ki strikes normally act as magic weapons can use\
  \ a singing bell of striking."
