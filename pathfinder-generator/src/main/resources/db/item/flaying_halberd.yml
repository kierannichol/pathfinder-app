description: "A flaying halberd is a +1 halberd that can be used to slice off large\
  \ swaths of a creature's skin. In combat, a character can denote a maximum of one\
  \ attack per round to be a flaying strike. This attack deals normal damage, but\
  \ the resulting wound is particularly painful as skin is torn away from the target's\
  \ body. This causes an additional 1d6 points of bleed damage, and as long as a victim\
  \ suffers from this bleed damage, it is staggered. A successful DC 15 Fortitude\
  \ save made at the time the flaying strike occurs negates the bleed damage and staggered\
  \ condition. The bleed effect can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal check or\
  \ any spell that cures hit point damage. A flaying strike that results in a critical\
  \ hit also deals 1d4 points of Charisma damage (no save) to the victim. Creatures\
  \ immune to ability damage and critical hits are immune to flaying strikes."
