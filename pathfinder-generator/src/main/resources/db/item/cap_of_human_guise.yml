description: "This threadbare hat allows its wearer to alter her appearance at will\
  \ as with a disguise self spell, except she can only appear as a plainly dressed\
  \ Small human child, adult halfling, or adult gnome, such as a peasant, blacksmith,\
  \ or shopkeeper. The wearer can slightly alter the cap's appearance as part of the\
  \ disguise, but otherwise must match the overall unremarkable look of the illusory\
  \ form.\nThough invented and primarily used by Small humanoids, it can be used by\
  \ any Small or Medium humanoid creature."
