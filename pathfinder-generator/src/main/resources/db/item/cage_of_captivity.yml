description: "This miniature cage of golden wire can be used to capture a weakened\
  \ outsider once per day. The target outsider must be called or otherwise physically\
  \ present; a cage of captivity has no effect on summoned outsiders. The target also\
  \ must be unable to take actions continually throughout the entire process, whether\
  \ cowering, dazed, dying, helpless, stunned, or unconscious.\nThe user can attempt\
  \ to draw a subdued outsider into the cage of captivity by placing gemstones within\
  \ and concentrating for 1 minute. These gems must be worth at least 100 gp per Hit\
  \ Dice of the target. If the target fails a DC 20 Will save—this increases to DC\
  \ 25 if the user speaks the target's true name (Ultimate Magic 101)—the target shrinks\
  \ to a height of 1 inch and is drawn into the cage, as the minimum containment option\
  \ of the binding spell. Any creature holding the cage can converse with the trapped\
  \ outsider. The planar being cannot use any supernatural or spell-like abilities\
  \ while trapped, but it can still interact with, lie to, and manipulate captors\
  \ using appropriate skill checks.\nAnyone holding the cage of captivity may attempt\
  \ to open it as a standard action. If an outsider is trapped within, doing so requires\
  \ a DC 22 Will save. If a creature fails this save, they cannot open the cage and\
  \ are repulsed by it for 24 hours as per the antipathy spell. The user who originally\
  \ captured the imprisoned outsider gains a +5 morale bonus on this save.\nAny creature\
  \ opening a cage of captivity can compel the trapped outsider to perform a service\
  \ in exchange for its release. The trapped creature is compelled to fulfill this\
  \ request as geas/quest if the creature opening the cage of captivity knows the\
  \ creature's true name. If not, this request functions as lesser geas if the trapped\
  \ outsider has 7 or fewer Hit Dice, or as suggestion if it has more than 7 Hit Dice.\
  \ These requests ignore any spell resistance of the trapped outsider, but a successful\
  \ DC 20 Will save negates this effect. Once it performs this service, an outsider\
  \ can never again be trapped by the same cage of captivity.\nVariant cages of captivity\
  \ may take the form of lamps, bowls, bottles, and similar containers."
