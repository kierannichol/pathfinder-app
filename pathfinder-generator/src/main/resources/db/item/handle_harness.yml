description: "This wood-and-leather harness fits over clothing or armor and provides\
  \ small handles and footrests across your back and along the sides of your legs\
  \ and arms. While wearing a handle harness, you automatically succeed at checks\
  \ to aid an adjacent ally of your size or smaller with Climb or Ride checks, or\
  \ Acrobatics checks to balance on narrow surfaces or uneven ground. A handle harness's\
  \ ungainly construction gives you a â€“2 penalty on Escape Artist checks."
