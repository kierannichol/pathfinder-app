description: "This item is typically fashioned of brass or bronze, with a lead stopper\
  \ bearing special seals. Periodically, a thin stream of bittersmelling smoke issues\
  \ from the bottle's top. The bottle can be opened once per day. When opened, the\
  \ efreeti imprisoned within issues from the bottle instantly amid a cloud of noxious\
  \ smoke. There is a 10% chance (01–10 on d%) that the efreeti is insane and attacks\
  \ immediately upon being released. There is also a 10% chance (91–100) that the\
  \ efreeti of the bottle grants three wishes. In either case, afterward the efreeti\
  \ disappears forever, and the bottle becomes nonmagical. The other 80% of the time\
  \ (11–90), the inhabitant of the bottle loyally serves the character for up to 10\
  \ minutes per day (or until the efreeti's death), doing as she commands. Roll each\
  \ day the bottle is opened for that day's effect."
