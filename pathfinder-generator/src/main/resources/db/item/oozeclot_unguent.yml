description: "A single dose of oozeclot unguent can be applied to a 5-foot-square\
  \ surface, whereupon it remains potent for 24 hours or until an ooze comes in contact\
  \ with it. An ooze that crawls onto a surface treated with oozeclot unguent must\
  \ succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or become immobile as its amorphous body grows\
  \ rigid. As long as it is thus affected, the ooze can take no physical actions.\
  \ Any amount of damage causes the hardened shell surrounding the ooze to crack,\
  \ allowing the creature to slither out and resume attacks; otherwise it remains\
  \ immobile for an extended period of time. An ooze of CR 3 or less is immobile for\
  \ 1 week, while an ooze of CR 4 to CR 6 remains immobile for only 1d6 days. A CR\
  \ 7 to CR 11 ooze is rendered immobile only for 1d6 rounds, and it can attempt a\
  \ new saving throw at the end of each round to end the effect early. Oozes of CR\
  \ 12 or higher are immune to the effects of oozeclot unguent entirely."
