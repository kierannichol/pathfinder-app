  \ water. This weapon must be a simple weapon or your deity's favored weapon. The\
  \ weapon deals normal damage for a weapon of that type, plus 1 point of cold damage\
  \ per caster level (maximum 10). In addition, any creature struck by the weapon\
  \ is also hit by holy water, dealing 1d4 points of damage if the creature is susceptible\
  \ to holy water. If the weapon leaves your hands for more than 1 round, it melts\
  \ and the spell ends."
