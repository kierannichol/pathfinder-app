description: "A sanctified shield may be any type of shield (including bucklers, tower\
  \ shields, and even magical shields). When activated, a sacred shield adds a +1\
  \ sacred (if positive energy) or profane (if negative energy) bonus to the wearer's\
  \ Armor Class. This bonus lasts for 24 hours or until the wearer is struck in combat,\
  \ whichever comes first. Creatures other than the cleric are able to use the charged\
  \ shield and this ability."
