description: "This black band of silk grants its wearer spectacular senses within\
  \ a limited range. Some believe these items were made to grant lesser swordmasters\
  \ the illusion of skill. When the wearer places the blindfold over her eyes, she\
  \ becomes blinded, but gains blindsight (Bestiary 298) within the reach of her melee\
  \ weapon, or 5 feet if the wearer is not wielding a melee weapon. Furthermore, the\
  \ wearer is under the effect of a constant locate weakness (Ultimate Combat 236)\
  \ spell, but only when making melee attacks."
