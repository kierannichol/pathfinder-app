description: "This +5 heavy shield, emblazoned with the symbol of the sun, allows\
  \ the wielder to cast spells as if she were a 20th-level paladin with a Charisma\
  \ of 20. The spells gained are cumulative with any existing spells per day the character\
  \ might have, even from paladin class levels. The Shield of the Sun also grants\
  \ its wielder spell resistance 15. It absorbs the first 10 points of damage from\
  \ any energy attack (fire, cold, acid, electricity, or sonic). In return for all\
  \ this, once per year the shield's owner must undertake a quest at the behest of\
  \ a lawful good deity (no saving throw to avoid).\nA chaotic or evil character gains\
  \ four negative levels when wielding the Shield of the Sun. The negative levels\
  \ persist as long as the shield is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including\
  \ restoration spells). The negative levels disappear when the shield is stowed or\
  \ leaves the wearer's possession."
destruction: "The Shield of the Sun may be destroyed if a good-aligned character casts\
  \ it into the Well of Eternal Night, its light fading into the inky depths before\
  \ it finally disappears. If a nongood character does the deed, the shield is not\
  \ destroyed, merely lost, and a quest to the Plane of Shadow may recover it."
