description: "The warden of the woods is a suit of +3 greenwood splint mail made of\
  \ strips of laminated greenwood that flex with the wearer's movement but stiffen\
  \ when struck in battle. (The greenwood special material is described on page 50.)\
  \ This armor is treated in all ways like medium armor, including when determining\
  \ proficiency. The armor has an arcane spell failure chance of 25%, a maximum Dexterity\
  \ bonus of +2, and an armor check penalty of â€“4.\nAs a move action, the wearer can\
  \ snap a strip of wood loose from the armor. The strip lengthens into a weapon of\
  \ a type chosen by the armor's wearer. It can become a +1 greenwood club, a +1/+1\
  \ greenwood quarterstaff, or a +1 keen greenwood wooden stake. If the wearer creates\
  \ a club or quarterstaff in this way, it gains the benefits of the shillelagh spell\
  \ with a duration of 1 minute. Each weapon removed from the warden of the woods\
  \ reduces the armor's enhancement bonus by 1. Consequently, a maximum of three such\
  \ weapons can be separated from the armor at any given time. The greenwood weapons\
  \ keep their enhancement bonuses only while they're in the wearer's hands, though\
  \ they remain masterwork weapons for other wielders.\nThe wearer can reintegrate\
  \ a weapon back into the warden of the woods as a move action and restore the lost\
  \ enhancement bonus. Each day at dawn, the armor regenerates any missing strips\
  \ (regaining its full enhancement bonus), and any weapons still detached from the\
  \ armor crumble into dust."
