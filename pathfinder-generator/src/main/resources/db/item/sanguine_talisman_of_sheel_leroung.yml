description: "This crimson devil talisman once belonged to the diabolist Sheel Leroung,\
  \ a conjurer who aided Daidian Ruel in investigating the ways of Hell. The wearer\
  \ of this talisman gains a +3 profane bonus to Armor Class and a telepathic bond\
  \ with the bearded devil bound within. Once per day, the wearer can attempt an opposed\
  \ Charisma check against the barbazu's +0 modifier to summon him forth for 8 rounds,\
  \ as per the spell summon monster. The barbazu bound within this talisman is known\
  \ as Lodveyn the Wizened. Rather than Weapon Focus (glaive), Lodveyn has Throw Anything—\
  preferring to fling his polearm, then following it into the fray with his vicious\
  \ claws. He claims to have been a servant of both Leroung and the ice devil Voulgarghas,\
  \ and remembers much of the early days of the Hellknights' founding."
