description: "This set of bulky wooden rings is the key to a substitution code set\
  \ at the rings' creation. A base set comes with two identical rings. Additional\
  \ rings can be made for 4 gp apiece. Using the cipher rings' code enables you to\
  \ create or decode a written message (no check required). Deciphering the message\
  \ without the correct ring requires a DC 25 Linguistics check."
