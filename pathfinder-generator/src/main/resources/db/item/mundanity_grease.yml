description: "This slippery, jet-black goo has a consistency comparable to warm lard.\
  \ A bottle of mundanity grease can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment\
  \ of 10 feet.\nWhen an animal companion, a familiar, or another bonded creature\
  \ is struck by mundanity grease, the bond to its master is temporarily suspended.\
  \ The creature and its master lose any of the following abilities they have from\
  \ the companion or familiar bond: deliver touch spells, devotion, empathic link,\
  \ evasion, improved evasion, link, scry on familiar, share spells, speak with animals\
  \ of its kind, spell resistance, and speak with master. For the duration of the\
  \ effect, a familiar originally of the animal type is treated as an animal (rather\
  \ than a magical beast) for the purposes of determining which spells affect it.\
  \ This effect lasts for 1d4 minutes or until the grease is washed off the affected\
  \ creature by magical means."
