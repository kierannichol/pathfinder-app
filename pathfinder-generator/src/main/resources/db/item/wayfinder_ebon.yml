description: "Favored by Pathfinders exploring dark and dangerous locales, the exterior\
  \ of this wayfinder is constructed of panels of darkwood with ebony inlays. The\
  \ panels slide apart to reveal platinum meshwork capable of holding one or two ioun\
  \ stones. An ebon wayfinder grants the bearer darkvision with a range of 60 feet,\
  \ and with a command word it can create darkness (as per the spell) once per day,\
  \ centered on itself.\nWhen one ioun stone is slotted into the device, its darkness\
  \ ability no longer functions. When a second stone is placed in it, the darkvision\
  \ ability no longer functions."
