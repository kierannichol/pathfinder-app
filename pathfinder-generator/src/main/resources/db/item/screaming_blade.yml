description: "This +2 longsword contains the hideous captured screams of a torture\
  \ victim. The blade howls these blasphemies and profanities whenever it is drawn.\
  \ This discordant noise grants the wielder a +5 competence bonus on Intimidate checks,\
  \ but any creature can hear the howls with a Perception DC of –10, regardless of\
  \ the wielder's Stealth.\nThe disturbing noise makes it difficult for nearby creatures\
  \ to concentrate. Any creature other than the wielder within 60 feet attempting\
  \ to cast a spell must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + spell level)\
  \ or the spell fails. Creatures within 60 feet take a –2 penalty on skill checks\
  \ that require concentration and are unable to take 10 (unless they have an ability\
  \ that enables them to take 10 while distracted or threatened). If the wielder is\
  \ evil and has the bardic performance ability, she can use the screams as a masterwork\
  \ instrument for either Perform (sing) or Perform (wind) and the DCs of her bardic\
  \ performances that are fear effects increase by 1.\nSilence and similar effects\
  \ suppress all the blade's magical abilities except its enhancement bonus."
