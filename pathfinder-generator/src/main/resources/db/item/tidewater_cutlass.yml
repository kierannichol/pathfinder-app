description: "The blade of this +1 cutlass (Pirates of the Inner Sea 18) is spotted\
  \ with rust, and its basket hilt is cast in the likeness of a grinning skull. Once\
  \ per day, a tidewater cutlass can be used to cast hydraulic push.\nTidewater cutlasses\
  \ are not uncommon weapons among the pirates of the Shackles, at least for those\
  \ who can afford to buy one or who manage to loot one from someone who can. Mr.\
  \ Plugg acquired his cutlass from a seasoned old tar aboard the Wormwood who had\
  \ the temerity to point out the first mate's insecurities, and was beaten to death\
  \ for his impudence. When more traditional discipline techniques prove ineffective,\
  \ Mr. Plugg has been know to use his tidewater cutlass to \"accidentally\" push\
  \ impertinent sailors overboard to drown in the Wormwood's wake."
