name: "Wand of Mirror Hideaway"
description: "You transform a mirror into a portal to an extradimensional space. The\
  \ space can hold as many as eight Medium creatures. Creatures that enter this space\
  \ are hidden and beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those\
  \ spells work across planes. If the mirror is covered (such as by a cloth, or by\
  \ being placed face down or against a wall), the portal becomes inactive. If the\
  \ mirror is broken or moved more than 5 feet from where it was when you cast the\
  \ spell, the spell ends; any creatures within the extradimensional space are expelled\
  \ from it (see below) and become nauseated for 1d6 rounds."
