description: "As a move action, the wearer of these fine leather gloves can pick up\
  \ an unattended object (weighing no more than 20 pounds) that is up to 30 feet away,\
  \ and move it up to 30 feet. The object falls to the ground at the end of the movement\
  \ unless the wearer of the gloves moves it into his hand. This action doesn't provoke\
  \ attacks of opportunity.\nBy expending one use of mythic power as a free action\
  \ on his turn, the wearer can focus the power of the gloves, allowing him to make\
  \ unarmed strikes and combat maneuvers to bull rush, disarm, or trip against foes\
  \ up to 30 feet away until the end of his turn. Treat these attacks as though the\
  \ wearer had 30 feet of reach. When attacking a non-adjacent target in this manner,\
  \ the wearer can't be affected by feats and abilities like Strike Back or fire shield\
  \ that require touching or coming near the target. The gloves don't increase the\
  \ wearer's threatened area."
