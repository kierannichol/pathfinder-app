description: "These iron bracers are covered in hooks and small claws. They strap\
  \ firmly to the wearer's forearms and can be used to make attacks as spiked gauntlets.\n\
  Three times per day, the bracers' wearer can telekinetically anchor herself to a\
  \ foe within 190 feet as a full-round action. This requires a combat maneuver check,\
  \ which doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The wearer gains a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus on this check for every size category by which her target is larger than\
  \ she.\nOn a successful check, either the wearer or the target (whichever weighs\
  \ less) moves to be adjacent to the other (moving to the closest free adjacent space).\
  \ This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. For 1 minute, the wearer\
  \ and target are kept adjacent by the power of the bracers. Each is able to move\
  \ only by succeeding at an opposed Strength check, and always takes the other along\
  \ even if successful.\nAdditionally, both the wearer and the target are unable to\
  \ engage in dimensional travel for this duration, as if under the effect of a dimensional\
  \ anchor spell. The wearer of the anchoring bracers can dismiss the anchoring effect\
  \ before the end of its duration as a standard action."
