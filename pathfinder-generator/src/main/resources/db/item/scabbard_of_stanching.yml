description: "This fine, red leather sheath is decorated with gold filigree. It fits\
  \ any bladed slashing weapon. While worn, a scabbard of stanching protects against\
  \ bleed damage. Anytime the wearer suffers a bleed effect, the scabbard automatically\
  \ stanches it. It has no effect on bleed damage from effects that require a DC 16\
  \ or higher caster level or Heal check."
