description: "A spell-capturing gem appears as a small chunk of azurite, lapis lazuli,\
  \ or turquoise. This small blue gem is imbued with the power to capture a spell\
  \ and make it available for later use. Once activated, a spell-capturing gem waits\
  \ indefinitely for its owner to successfully counterspell a spell by using either\
  \ dispel magic or other means. The gem's owner may then choose to capture the foiled\
  \ spell in the gem, where it remains for a number of days equal to the owner's caster\
  \ level minus the spell's spell level, minimum 1 day. (For example, if a 10th-level\
  \ spellcaster successfully dispels and captures a fireball spell with this item,\
  \ the spell could remain in the gem for up to 7 days.) At any time during that period,\
  \ the wielder of the gem may use it to cast the captured spell, regardless of whether\
  \ she would normally be able to do so. A spell cast in this way uses the minimum\
  \ caster level necessary to determine all level-dependent effects.\nA spell-capturing\
  \ gem is a single-use item. Once the captured spell has been released or once the\
  \ storage duration of the gem is reached, the gem loses its sheen and turns gray,\
  \ becoming a worthless pebble."
