description: "When magic scrolls are stored inside this electrum scroll case, glowing\
  \ blue runes appear on the surface of the tube, indicating what spells are on the\
  \ scrolls currently stored within. If the user has the spells on her spell list,\
  \ she can read the runes while holding the scroll case in hand to cast spells from\
  \ a scroll within the case as though it were in her hand. Casting spells from the\
  \ scrolls in the case otherwise works as normal, and the scrolls inside the case\
  \ are depleted as normal. The scroll case holds a maximum of five magic scrolls,\
  \ and scrolls stored within are protected against fire, water, and other damage."
