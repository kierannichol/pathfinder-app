description: "This white, dry powder mixes with water to form a paste, which hardens\
  \ over the course of an hour to create a solid material. It can be used to make\
  \ casts of footprints or carvings, fill in gaps or cracks in walls, or (if applied\
  \ over a cloth wrapping) create a cast for a broken bone. Hardened plaster has hardness\
  \ 1 and 5 hit points per inch of thickness. A 5-pound clay pot of plaster can cover\
  \ about 5 square feet of flat space to a depth of 1 inch, five Medium forearm or\
  \ lower-leg casts, two Medium full-arm or full-leg casts, or twice as many casts\
  \ for a Small creature."
