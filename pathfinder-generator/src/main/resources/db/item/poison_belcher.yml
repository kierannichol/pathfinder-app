description: "Loading this long bronze tube with a dose of ingested poison and 10\
  \ gp worth of gold dust is a standard action. When you blow on a poison belcher\
  \ like a blowgun, it sprays the poison out the other end. The poison belcher is\
  \ a simple weapon that strikes as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of\
  \ 10 feet and a maximum range of 30 feet. If hit, the target must save against the\
  \ poison as if it had been ingested."
