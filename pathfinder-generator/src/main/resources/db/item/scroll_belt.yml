description: "This garment is specially designed to have a single spell scribed on\
  \ the inside of its surface, hidden from prying eyes. Infiltrators and spies often\
  \ use scroll belts to secure extra magical means of escape when the remainder of\
  \ their equipment is taken during capture. The belt is reusable, though the normal\
  \ costs and time required to scribe a spell on the belt for each new spell apply.\
  \ You must remove the belt and hold it in a free hand in order to use the scroll."
