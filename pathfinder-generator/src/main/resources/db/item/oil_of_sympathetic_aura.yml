name: "Oil of Sympathetic Aura"
description: "This spell functions like magic aura, except it extends its altered\
  \ aura to similar items in a 5-foot radius. For this purpose, similar items must\
  \ be alike in approximate shape, composition, and function, so a potion of cure\
  \ light wounds targeted by this spell to appear nonmagical would also obscure the\
  \ auras of nearby potions, elixirs, and oils, as well as flasks. Items other than\
  \ the targeted item retain their altered aura for 1 round per caster level after\
  \ being removed from the spell's area."
