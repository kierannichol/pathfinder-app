description: "This single earring consists of a prismatic crystal set into a platinum\
  \ bezel. A traveler's translator provides its owner a basic and limited ability\
  \ to communicate with intelligent creatures that speak unfamiliar languages.\nWhen\
  \ created, a traveler's translator is imprinted with a single base language chosen\
  \ by its creator (typically Common), and is capable of learning one additional language.\
  \ When its owner speaks the command word, the traveler's translator begins listening\
  \ to all spoken conversations and speech within 30 feet. After 1 minute of exposure\
  \ to a language other than its base language, the translator learns the new language.\
  \ Thereafter, the item automatically translates speech of the newly learned language\
  \ into the translator's base language, telepathically imparting the translated words\
  \ to its owner. A traveler's translator can store only one learned language at a\
  \ time and can learn only one language per day—speaking the command word again after\
  \ at least 24 hours causes the translator to erase the previously learned language\
  \ (but not its base language) to make room for a new language.\nAs a standard action,\
  \ the owner of the stone can designate a single creature within 30 feet. When the\
  \ owner speaks aloud to that creature in the translator's base language, the traveler's\
  \ translator telepathically transmits the owner's meaning to the target, using the\
  \ learned language. A traveler's translator does not grant its owner the ability\
  \ to read or write in either the base or the learned language."
