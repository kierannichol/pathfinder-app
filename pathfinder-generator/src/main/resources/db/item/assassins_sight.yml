description: "This black telescopic sight is made of lusterless metal and features\
  \ a thick glass lens. It can be mounted on the stock of a light or heavy crossbow,\
  \ but not a hand crossbow. An assassin's sight allows the wielder to make ranged\
  \ sneak attacks from greater distances than normal. This sight has two settings:\
  \ 0–30 feet and 30–60 feet. A character using a crossbow equipped with an assassin's\
  \ sight can make sneak attacks against foes within the selected range. For example,\
  \ by setting the range to 30–60 feet, a character can make sneak attacks against\
  \ creatures only if they are between 30 and 60 feet of the wielder; attacks against\
  \ targets closer than 30 feet or farther than 60 feet would not count as sneak attacks,\
  \ even if they met all the other requirements for making a sneak attack. Setting\
  \ the range on an assassin's sight is a full-round action that provokes attacks\
  \ of opportunity."
