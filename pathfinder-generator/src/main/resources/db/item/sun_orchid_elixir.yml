description: "Thuvia's sun orchid elixir is a nearly perfect solution for those who\
  \ seek eternal life. A single dose of sun orchid elixir cannot stop the aging process,\
  \ but it does the next-best thing—it restores youth. A creature that drinks the\
  \ elixir is restored to its starting age as a young adult. The drinker's new age\
  \ is randomly determined using Table 7–1 on page 169 of the Pathfinder RPG Core\
  \ Rulebook. All penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution the drinker may\
  \ have suffered as a result of advanced age are removed, but all bonuses to Intelligence,\
  \ Wisdom, and Charisma that result from advanced age remain (although as the character\
  \ ages again into middle age and beyond, he does not gain any of these bonuses a\
  \ second time).\nVanity-seekers go to nearly any length to acquire the elixir, resorting\
  \ to bribery, extortion, and murder. To curtail such troubles in the land of its\
  \ creation, the use of the elixir is outlawed in Thuvia (except by the formula's\
  \ creator). Each vial of sun orchid elixir requires six mature sun orchids and 1\
  \ month's time to ferment, although the exact formula used is a secret known only\
  \ to the denizen of Alchemist's Keep in Thuvia. Prices for a dose of the elixir\
  \ vary wildly since the elixir is sold at auction, but no dose has ever sold for\
  \ less than 50,000 gp."
destruction: "A dose of sun orchid elixir is simple to destroy—merely pouring the\
  \ elixir out and allowing the fluid to evaporate or be absorbed into the ground\
  \ is enough to ruin it, as is mixing it with any other fluid or solvent. Of course,\
  \ if word gets out of this fantastic waste of powerful magic, any number of enraged\
  \ or scandalized organizations might seek out the character responsible for the\
  \ elixir's waste to extract bloody vengeance."
