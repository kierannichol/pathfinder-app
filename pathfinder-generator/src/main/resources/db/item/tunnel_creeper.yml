description: "This fist-sized cluster of aggressive fungus grows rapidly when placed\
  \ against a solid surface and exposed to water, and can quietly bore a 5-foot-tall,\
  \ 10-foot-deep tunnel in a straight line. The tunnel is supported by sturdy fungal\
  \ tubes. A tunnel creeper cannot eat through metal or any material denser than common\
  \ stone. A tunnel creeper takes 10 minutes to carve a tunnel through stone, or 5\
  \ minutes to carve through wood, after which the fungus withers and falls to the\
  \ ground."
