description: "Three times per day on command, the phylactery's wearer can determine\
  \ the current health and overall well-being of any one ally within 30 feet. This\
  \ effect acts as the status spell. If the wearer has the ability to channel energy\
  \ or lay on hands, he can as a swift action choose to apply the effects of that\
  \ class feature to an ally he is currently evaluating so long as that ally is within\
  \ 30 feet of him, but doing so ends the effect of the phylactery's status."
