description: "Popular among Riverfolk who prefer to work their waterway unarmed, this\
  \ simple bronze band can transform into a handy weapon in a pinch. When the wearer\
  \ of a riverclub ring plunges her hand into at least 1 gallon of water as a move\
  \ action, she can pull forth a club made of animated water. The weapon maintains\
  \ the shape, solidity, and statistics of a masterwork club of the wielder's size\
  \ so long as she holds it, dealing damage as normal, except that it deals 1 additional\
  \ point of damage against creatures with the fire subtype. The club turns back into\
  \ a puddle of water again as soon as the wielder loosens her grip around it."
