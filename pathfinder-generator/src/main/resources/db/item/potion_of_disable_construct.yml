name: "Potion of Disable Construct"
description: "You can make a melee touch attack to send a pulse into the target, interfering\
  \ with the magic that endows it with life. If the construct fails its saving throw,\
  \ it becomes helpless, but it receives a new save each round at the end of its turn\
  \ to shake off the effect. If the construct is normally immune to magic, the pulse\
  \ is less effective and the construct receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw."
