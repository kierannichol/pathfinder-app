description: "Bestowed as rewards for unwavering loyalty to Hellknight paravicars\
  \ of great renown, these filigreed +2 greatswords pulse with a sickening carmine\
  \ light in rhythm with the heartbeats of their bearers. Prized trophies, these weapons\
  \ are brandished eagerly by staunch champions of Cheliax.\nOnce per day as a standard\
  \ action, you may strike the blade against the ground to create a one-way rift from\
  \ Phlegethon (the fieriest layer of Hell) centered where the sword hits. The rift\
  \ spews magical flames upward in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder. All creatures\
  \ in this area (including you) take 9d6 points of damage (Reflex half DC 17). Half\
  \ the damage is fire, but the other half results directly from divine power and\
  \ is therefore not subject to fire resistance or immunity."
