description: "Created by dwarves after the Quest for Sky, this faintly glowing collection\
  \ of minerals allows photosynthetic plants to grow in underground environments without\
  \ sunlight. Sunsoil has since spread to a handful of agricultural communities throughout\
  \ the Darklands, particularly among duergar plantations and svirfneblin enclaves.\
  \ One pound of sunsoil covers a 20-footby- 20-foot area of regular earth and takes\
  \ 1 minute to distribute evenly. A treated area allows plants to grow without sunlight\
  \ for 4 months. Light-based spells and magical effects trigger an alchemical reaction\
  \ in sunsoil. Any spell with the light descriptor cast on a pound of sunsoil causes\
  \ all areas covered in the soil to be treated as areas of bright light for 1 round.\
  \ This light counts as natural sunlight for creatures vulnerable to such effects.\
  \ After being subjected to such an effect, sunsoil immediately becomes normal dirt."
