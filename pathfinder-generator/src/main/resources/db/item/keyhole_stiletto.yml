description: "This sturdy +1 ghost touch adamantine dagger can be used as a punch\
  \ to destroy the workings of a lock or other mechanical device, granting a +2 bonus\
  \ to Disable Device checks for that purpose, but leaving obvious signs of tampering.\
  \ Its true usefulness becomes evident when wielded against force magic. The wielder\
  \ of a keyhole stiletto ignores armor bonuses granted by a force effect (such as\
  \ the mage armor spell or bracers of armor). Once per day, the user may whisper\
  \ a command word to allow the stiletto to cut a single small hole in a force effect\
  \ such as a wall of force or resilient sphere. The hole can be any shape, but the\
  \ blade cannot cut a line longer than 3 feet or carve a circle wider than 1 foot."
