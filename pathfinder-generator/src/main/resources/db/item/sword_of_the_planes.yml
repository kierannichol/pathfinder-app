description: "This longsword has an enhancement bonus of +1 on the Material Plane,\
  \ but on any elemental planes its enhancement bonus increases to +2. The +2 enhancement\
  \ bonus also applies whenever the weapon is used against creatures native to the\
  \ elemental planes. It operates as a +3 longsword on the Astral Plane and the Ethereal\
  \ Plane, or when used against opponents native to either of those planes. On any\
  \ other plane, or against any outsider, it functions as a +4 longsword."
