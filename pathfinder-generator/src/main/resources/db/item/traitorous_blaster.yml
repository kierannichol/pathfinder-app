description: "This +1 double-barreled pistol has an oversized stock to compensate\
  \ for the massive recoil the weapon produces, though even with this attachment the\
  \ kickback is strong enough to throw the pistol completely backward after firing.\
  \ When both barrels of a traitorous blaster are loaded and the wielder is being\
  \ flanked, the wielder can fire both barrels as a single action, with each shot\
  \ targeting one of the enemies flanking the wielder. The wielder takes only a –\
  2 penalty on these attack rolls (rather than the –4 penalty normally associated\
  \ with firing both barrels of a double-barreled pistol as a single action)."
