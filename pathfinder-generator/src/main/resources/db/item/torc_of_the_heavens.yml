description: "This simple neck ring consists of a silver braid with matching ivory\
  \ ends sculpted to resemble wolf's heads. The torc allows itself to be worn by only\
  \ a mythic character who swears absolute service to his deity. Thereafter, the torc\
  \ cannot be removed until its wearer dies. The wearer gains an enhancement bonus\
  \ to his Charisma score equal to half his tier (minimum 1). Once per day, he can\
  \ use the torc to cast commune for the purpose of contacting his deity. Lastly,\
  \ he can expend one use of his mythic power to cast legend lore.\nIf the wearer\
  \ violates his deity's code of ethics, the torc constricts and begins suffocating\
  \ him until he dies or receives an atonement spell."
destruction: "Melting a torc of the heavens in a cauldron filled with the boiling\
  \ blood of an ancient red dragon destroys it."
