description: "This +1 bolas is favored in the southern Mwangi Expanse, where it is\
  \ commonly crafted from assassin vines and used as a means of escape from the likes\
  \ of derhii and jungle-dwelling giants. Once per day, the wielder of a grasping\
  \ bolas can attempt a special ranged trip combat maneuver check that ignores any\
  \ size modifiers to CMD the target may possess. If the attempt succeeds, the target\
  \ falls prone and becomes entangled for 1 round as a mass of animated vines bursts\
  \ out from within the bolas. For every 5 by which the combat maneuver check exceeds\
  \ the target's modified CMD, the duration of this condition increases by 1 round.\
  \ An entangled creature can break free with a successful DC 20 Strength or Escape\
  \ Artist check.\nThe animated ropes employed by a grasping bolas have AC 22, hardness\
  \ 10, and damage reduction 5/slashing. If a grasping bolas is severed (all 12 hit\
  \ points are lost to damage), it is destroyed."
