description: "In addition to hiding the face, this fine lace veil protects the wearer\
  \ against gaze attacks. The wearer has a 50% chance to avoid making a saving throw\
  \ against a gaze attack even when not averting her eyes. If the wearer averts her\
  \ eyes, she rolls twice (once for the veil, once for averting her eyes) and uses\
  \ the more favorable result.\nAgainst patterns, visual figments, and other vision-based\
  \ effects and attacks that cannot affect blind creatures, the veil grants the wearer\
  \ a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws. The veil does not otherwise impede the\
  \ wearer's vision in any way."
