description: "A creature that drinks this elixir becomes particularly pliable mentally\
  \ and emotionally for 10 minutes (Will DC 16 negates). Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate\
  \ checks automatically succeed against a pliable creature, except for Diplomacy\
  \ checks to improve a pliable creature's attitude, which have the normal DC. This\
  \ does not allow characters to whom the pliable creature is unfriendly or hostile\
  \ to make requests of the pliable creature using Diplomacy. After 1 minute, the\
  \ effects of pliability elixir are noticeable with a successful DC 25 Sense Motive\
  \ check. The GM can apply circumstance bonuses to this check based on factors that\
  \ make the effect more obvious, such as if the affected creature contradicts itself\
  \ or agrees to something that doesn't make sense. A vial of pliability elixir appears\
  \ to be an elixir of truth unless the check made to identify it succeeds by 10 or\
  \ more."
