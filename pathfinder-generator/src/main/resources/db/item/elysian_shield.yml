description: "This +2 ghost touch tower shield is engraved with funerary runes depicting\
  \ the peaceful rest of the contented dead. The wielder of an elysian shield is immune\
  \ to the create spawn ability of undead, and once per day as an immediate action\
  \ can negate a single energy drain, ability drain, or ability damage attack by an\
  \ undead creature. In addition, once per day as a standard action, the wielder can\
  \ release a wave of positive energy that panics undead, as the Turn Undead feat\
  \ (Will DC 20 negates)."
