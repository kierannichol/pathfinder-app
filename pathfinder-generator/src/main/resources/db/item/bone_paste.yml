description: "Typically stored in an airtight leather wineskin cured with rare preservative\
  \ unguents, bone paste is a powerful alchemical sealant with special deteriorative\
  \ properties. When squeezed out of its container and exposed to air, bone paste\
  \ quickly hardens, so in order to apply it to a surface or object one must typically\
  \ squeeze the paste directly onto the material to be affected. Once applied, bone\
  \ paste cements itself to the object in just seconds, and hardens into a flaky cast.\
  \ If applied to any unattended organic material or surface (such as wood, paper,\
  \ hide, or rope), after 1 hour, bone paste undergoes another alchemical reaction\
  \ and begins to eat away at the material, dealing 1d4 points of damage each round\
  \ for 1d6+1 rounds, eating away first at the part of the object to which it was\
  \ applied and spreading briefly to other parts of the object before dissipating\
  \ and leaving a small amount of residual dust. Bone paste ignores an organic object's\
  \ hardness, and does not deal damage to inorganic objects or surfaces (such as metal,\
  \ stone, or ceramic). One pouch of bone paste is enough to cover 1 square foot of\
  \ surface, or (because of waste and spills) up to 20 smaller applications of approximately\
  \ 2 square inches each."
