description: "This thin, specially treated wire can be used to attach barding to creatures\
  \ whose body types cannot normally accommodate armor, such as piscine, serpentine,\
  \ and verminous animals (see the inside front cover), by delicately and thoroughly\
  \ sewing the equipment directly to the creature's flesh. Equipping a creature with\
  \ barding using barding stitches takes 10 times as long as the figures shown on\
  \ page 153 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook, and a successful DC 25 Heal check\
  \ is required to attach or remove the stitches. The creature must be helpless or\
  \ willing to be equipped with barding stitches, and must have at least a +1 natural\
  \ armor bonus to AC. An armored creature with barding stitches takes a -2 penalty\
  \ on Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks (in addition to any penalties from\
  \ the barding itself), Fortitude and Reflex saves, and saves against effects with\
  \ the pain descriptor (these penalties stack). These penalties persist for as long\
  \ as the creature is equipped with barding stitches."
