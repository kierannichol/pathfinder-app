description: "You change the target's head into that of a bull. The creature's Intelligence\
  \ becomes 2, and it gains a gore melee attack that it can use as a primary or secondary\
  \ attack. The gore attack uses the creature's base attack bonus, and the creature\
  \ gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the gore attack. The gore attack\
  \ deals a number of points of damage equal to 1d6 + Strength modifier if the target\
  \ is Small, 1d8 + Strength modifier if the target is Medium, and 2d6 + Strength\
  \ modifier if the target is Large or larger."
