description: "This slender light blade lies within a wooden container that serves\
  \ as both its scabbard and hiding place. You can draw the blade as a swift action\
  \ (or a free action if you have the Quick Draw feat). An observer must succeed at\
  \ a DC 20 Perception check to realize an undrawn sword cane is a weapon rather than\
  \ a walking stick; the DC decreases to 10 if the observer is able to handle the\
  \ weapon. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead\
  \ of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a sword cane sized for you, even\
  \ though it isn't a light weapon. You can't wield a sword cane in two hands in order\
  \ to apply 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier to damage."
