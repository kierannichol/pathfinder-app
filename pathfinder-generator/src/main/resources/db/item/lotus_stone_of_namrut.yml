description: "The Lotus Stone of Namrut is a sizable limestone tablet over an inch\
  \ thick and slightly smaller than a human head. It is carved into the shape of a\
  \ highly stylized, blossoming lotus. The stone's greatest power lies in its ability\
  \ to restore life to any individual that has been deceased for fewer than 48 hours.\
  \ To perform the resurrection ritual, the tablet must be placed the upon the individual's\
  \ chest at dusk; when the first rays of the rising sun to touch the deceased individual's\
  \ face, he awakens.\nDuring the ritual, the deceased person experiences a powerful\
  \ vision in which he enters the divine court of Namrut, a blue-skinned Osirian man\
  \ with lotus flowers blossoming from his head and palms. Hundreds of white and blue\
  \ lotus flowers float in the pools that line the stone pathways of Namrut's courtyard.\
  \ Namrut offers the individual the blessing of life; in return he asks that he not\
  \ be forgotten. If the individual accepts, Namrut graciously returns him to life\
  \ per resurrection. When the individual wakes, he discovers that the back of his\
  \ neck has been marked with the symbol of Namrut's white lotus. The marking is permanent\
  \ and cannot be removed by any means short of a miracle or wish. Thereafter, provided\
  \ the individual keeps his promise to remember Namrut, the lotus grants the marked\
  \ character a number of spell-like abilities.\nA number of times per day equal to\
  \ 1 + the marked character's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), the marked character can\
  \ perform a lotus ritual to simulate the effects of one of the following spells:\
  \ cure critical wounds, neutralize poison, remove blindness/deafness, remove disease,\
  \ or restoration. Performing the lotus ritual requires a full 10 minutes of prayer,\
  \ during which the marked individual can not be interrupted. In addition to prayers,\
  \ the ritual requires the consumption of lotus tea."
destruction: "The Lotus Stone of Namrut can be destroyed by grinding it to dust upon\
  \ the altar in Namrut's palace, and then scattering the dust into the lotus-petal-shaped\
  \ lakes that surround Shiman-Sekh."
