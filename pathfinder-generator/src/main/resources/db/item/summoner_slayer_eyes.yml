description: "Crafted by the Arclords of Nex, these golden-white lenses rest in crystal\
  \ frames that fit comfortably over the eyes. Any creatures conjured by summon monster\
  \ or a similar spell in the wearer's field of vision appear to the wearer as though\
  \ they were surrounded by a shimmering, purple glow. The wearer sees non-native\
  \ creatures that have been called by other forms of magic (such as planar ally or\
  \ gate) outlined in a blue glow. This affects only creatures of which the wearer\
  \ is already aware. It doesn't bypass concealment or stealth, nor does it work if\
  \ the target is under the effect of an illusion spell that the wearer hasn't seen\
  \ through.\nOnce per day when the wearer hits a summoned or called creature with\
  \ a weapon, the wearer can concentrate on that target, attempting to banish it back\
  \ to its place of origin. This is treated as a dismissal spell targeting the creature,\
  \ which must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be sent back to its home plane."
