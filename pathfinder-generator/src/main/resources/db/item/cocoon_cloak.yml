description: "This ruffled silk cloak is incredibly durable despite its soft, delicate\
  \ construction. Anytime the wearer falls asleep (whether the sleep is natural or\
  \ brought on by a magical effect), the cloak immediately transforms into sticky\
  \ strands that envelop the wearer's body, hardening into a solid silk cocoon. While\
  \ wrapped in the cocoon the wearer gains a +4 enhancement bonus to natural armor\
  \ and is protected from critical hits and sneak attacks as if subject to the light\
  \ fortification armor ability (25% chance for normal damage on a critical hit).\
  \ The cocoon opens and transforms back into a cloak once the wearer awakens."
