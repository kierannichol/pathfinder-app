description: "This plain but heavy iron helmet covers the entire head and fastens\
  \ around the neck and shoulders. The wearer becomes difficult to identify, as the\
  \ mask obscures all facial features. A creature wearing an iron mask is always treated\
  \ as having made an involuntary Disguise skill check with a result of 10 (with no\
  \ further modifiers). Additionally, the creature can only apply half its Dexterity\
  \ modifier to Dexterity checks, Dexterity- based skill checks, initiative checks,\
  \ and Reflex saving throws. The creature adds only half of its Dexterity modifier\
  \ to its Armor Class and CMD, and to attack rolls, if applicable. The creature treats\
  \ all other creatures as if they had concealment against it.\nA creature wearing\
  \ an iron mask can use the Escape Artist skill to slip free (DC 35, or DC 40 for\
  \ a masterwork iron mask). Breaking the mask requires a Strength check (DC 30, or\
  \ DC 32 for a masterwork iron mask). An iron mask has hardness 10 and 30 hit points.\
  \ Half the damage dealt to an iron mask applies to the creature wearing it.\nIron\
  \ masks are typically designed for Medium creatures, but Small ones can be bought\
  \ for the same price, or larger ones can be bought for higher prices (the price\
  \ is calculated the same way as buying larger-sized manacles; see page 68 of Ultimate\
  \ Equipment). Most iron masks have locks; add the cost of the desired lock to the\
  \ price of the mask. Masterwork masks also often feature frightening or demeaning\
  \ sculpted visages."
