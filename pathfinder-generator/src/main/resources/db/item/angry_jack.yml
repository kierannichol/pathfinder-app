description: "Named after a common children's toy, this metal box, typically no larger\
  \ than 1 cubic foot in volume, possesses a secret compartment large enough to store\
  \ one flask or vial. When loaded with a splash weapon or a vial of poison (contact\
  \ or inhaled poisons only) and armed as a full-round action, an angry jack attacks\
  \ the next creature to open the box, using its spring-loaded interior to launch\
  \ that item at the target as a ranged touch attack (attack bonus +0). A creature\
  \ struck by a contact poison in this way is exposed to the poison as normal, but\
  \ a creature is automatically exposed to a loaded inhalation poison with no attack\
  \ roll needed. Identifying an angry jack requires a successful a DC 20 Perception\
  \ check. A character who is trained in the Disable Device skill can spend 10 minutes\
  \ disguising an armed angry jack, allowing her to roll a Disable Device check and\
  \ use the result as the Perception DC for others to detect the true nature of the\
  \ angry jack. The user can't take 10 or 20 on the Disable Device check."
