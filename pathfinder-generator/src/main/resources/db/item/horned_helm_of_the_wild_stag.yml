description: "Numerous antlers protrude from this ornate leather helm, creating an\
  \ impressive array of bony points that jut out in several directions. When the horned\
  \ helm of the wild stag is donned, the wearer's facial structure subtly elongates\
  \ in a manner reminiscent of a stag's head. He gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC against\
  \ attacks of opportunity.\nOnce per day when the wearer charges an enemy or attempts\
  \ an overrun combat maneuver, he can as part of his action activate the helm to\
  \ summon dozens of spectral stags to accompany him during his movement. These ghostly\
  \ stags gallop around him in a frenzy, with the unmistakable sound of pounding hooves,\
  \ and stampede through any creature within 5 feet of the wearer at any point during\
  \ his movement. Although this stampede causes no physical damage, each affected\
  \ creature must attempt a DC 16 Will save to avoid being overcome by the frenzy\
  \ of the rampaging herd. A creature that fails this save must use its next turn\
  \ to charge the nearest valid target (including its allies), if possible. Creatures\
  \ that are unable to charge must instead move away from the wearer of the helm as\
  \ quickly as possible on their next turn. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect."
