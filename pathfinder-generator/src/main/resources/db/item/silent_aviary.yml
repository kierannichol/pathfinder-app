description: "The Silent Aviary is a unique harrow deck that features beautiful artwork\
  \ of songbirds on each card. Anyone who counts the cards while looking at the illustrated\
  \ fronts sees that the deck has 54 cards. Counting the cards while looking at their\
  \ backs, however, always produces a card count of 55. The mysterious 55th card is\
  \ the accursed Cage.\nThe Silent Aviary functions identically to a standard Harrow\
  \ Deck of Many Things (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Artifacts and Legends 24), except\
  \ only a single character can draw from it each day, and only a single card can\
  \ be drawn (although cards that allow or require redraws still function normally).\
  \ The deck of many things from Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment can be used to\
  \ model it instead if preferred (though its total card count is 22 rather than 54).\
  \ However, unlike most harrow decks, the Silent Aviary offers its user a unique\
  \ advantage: at any time during the drawing process, the user of the Silent Aviary\
  \ may choose to immediately replace a drawn card. To do so, the user must simply\
  \ utter a command phrase, put the rejected card back in the deck, and draw a new\
  \ card to replace it. Only the effects of the replacement card are realized. However,\
  \ every time a user rejects a card, he risks replacing it with the Cage card.\n\
  Every time a user utters the command phrase, he must attempt a DC 20 Will saving\
  \ throw. If successful, the user replaces the rejected card as detailed above. However,\
  \ if he fails the Will saving throw, the replacement card automatically comes up\
  \ as the Cage. In this instance, the user is sucked into the card, as if she had\
  \ fallen into a bag of holding. The user is then trapped in an extradimensional\
  \ space that contains 250 cubic feet of space, 24 hours worth of breathable air,\
  \ and over a dozen corpses.\nA creature trapped in the Cage can escape by using\
  \ either plane shift or freedom. If the Silent Aviary is destroyed or disenchanted\
  \ while a creature is trapped in the Cage, the extradimensional space is immediately\
  \ and permanently sealed, and becomes impossible to escape except with a miracle\
  \ or wish."
