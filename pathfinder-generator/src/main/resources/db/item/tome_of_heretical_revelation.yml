description: "This thick book appears to be an educational treatise filled with philosophical\
  \ insights. Anyone who reads from this cursed book and has a patron deity must make\
  \ a DC 20 Will save or be overcome by a crushing sense of doubt and hopelessness\
  \ as she loses all faith in her deity's teachings. Anyone who fails this save loses\
  \ all divine spellcasting ability, as well as class abilities from classes that\
  \ grant divine spells, and she can't gain additional levels in those classes. She\
  \ can regain her abilities and advancement potential if she atones (see the atonement\
  \ spell description). Succeeding at the Will save still leaves the reader shaken\
  \ for 10 minutes."
