name: "Scroll of Whirlwind"
description: "This spell creates a powerful cyclone of raging wind that moves through\
  \ the air, along the ground, or over water at a speed of 60 feet per round. You\
  \ can concentrate on controlling the cyclone's every movement or specify a simple\
  \ program. Directing the cyclone's movement or changing its programmed movement\
  \ is a standard action for you. The cyclone always moves during your turn. If the\
  \ cyclone exceeds the spell's range, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion\
  \ for 1d3 rounds and then dissipates. (You can't regain control of the cyclone,\
  \ even if it comes back within range.)"
