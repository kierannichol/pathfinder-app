description: "The wielder may throw this small, dense iron sphere as a ranged touch\
  \ attack (with a 10-foot range increment) or use it as a sling bullet. Upon striking\
  \ a solid object, a caltrop bead explodes into caltrops in a 10-foot-radius burst.\
  \ A creature directly hit by a caltrop bead takes 2d4 points of piercing damage,\
  \ and adjacent creatures take 1d4 points of damage as the bead suddenly bursts.\
  \ Caltrops created by a caltrop bead remain for 1 hour before disappearing."
