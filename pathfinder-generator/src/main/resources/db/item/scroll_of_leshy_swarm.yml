description: "You call out to nearby nature spirits and grant them temporary plant\
  \ bodies. These creatures are similar to leshys, except they are Tiny and far more\
  \ simpleminded. The swarm uses the statistics for a rat swarm, except it does not\
  \ carry a disease or have scent. The leshy swarm has darkvision with a range of\
  \ 60 feet and is immune to electricity, mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poison,\
  \ polymorph, sleep effects, sonic, and stunning."
