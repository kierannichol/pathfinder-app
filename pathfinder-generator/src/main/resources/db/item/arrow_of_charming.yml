description: "When this +3 arrow strikes a creature, it explodes in a small cloud\
  \ of red dust and deals nonlethal damage. The creature struck must succeed at a\
  \ DC 16 Will save or be charmed by the wielder as charm monster. Alternatively,\
  \ the user can inscribe the name of another creature into the arrow shaft; in this\
  \ case, the arrow's victim instead becomes charmed by the named creature on a failed\
  \ save. Inscribing the arrow takes 10 minutes."
