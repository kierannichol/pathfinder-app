description: "Each elemental metamagic rod is built with the power to control and\
  \ transform a specific energy type (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). The wielder\
  \ can cast up to three spells per day that deal damage of the rod's energy type\
  \ instead of the spell's normal damage type, as though using the Elemental Spell\
  \ feat (Advanced Player's Guide). For example, an elemental metamagic rod (cold)\
  \ always makes spells deal cold damage."
