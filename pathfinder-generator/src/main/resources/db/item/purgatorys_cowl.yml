  \ hood attached to the neck. Although the face of the hood is open and doesn't impair\
  \ the wearer's senses, the wearer's face is always hidden in deep shadow regardless\
  \ of the ambient light level. Once per day as an immediate action, when the wearer\
  \ reduces an undead creature to 0 or fewer hit points, the wearer can draw upon\
  \ the departed creature's essence to gain treat her level as 2 higher spells and\
  \ spell-like abilities with the death descriptor and spells and spell-like abilities\
  \ from the Death and Repose domains. This effect lasts for 1 hour."
