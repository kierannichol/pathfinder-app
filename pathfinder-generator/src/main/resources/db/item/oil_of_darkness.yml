name: "Oil of Darkness"
description: "This spell causes an object to radiate darkness out to a 20-foot radius.\
  \ This darkness causes the illumination level in the area to drop one step, from\
  \ bright light to normal light, from normal light to dim light, or from dim light\
  \ to darkness. This spell has no effect in an area that is already dark. Creatures\
  \ with light vulnerability or sensitivity take no penalties in normal light. All\
  \ creatures gain concealment (20% miss chance) in dim light. All creatures gain\
  \ total concealment (50% miss chance) in darkness. Creatures with darkvision can\
  \ see in an area of dim light or darkness without penalty. Nonmagical sources of\
  \ light, such as torches and lanterns, do not increase the light level in an area\
  \ of darkness. Magical light sources only increase the light level in an area if\
  \ they are of a higher spell level than darkness."
