name: "Scroll of Levitate"
description: "Levitate allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object\
  \ up and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object\
  \ must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can mentally direct\
  \ the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a\
  \ move action. You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could\
  \ clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move\
  \ laterally (generally at half its base land speed)."
