name: "Scroll of Hidden Spring"
description: "You spend 1 hour in quiet meditation, holding the focus component in\
  \ both hands and walking around a natural area. You are simultaneously drawn to\
  \ areas of natural moisture while drawing that moisture closer. As the spell's casting\
  \ time concludes, you thrust the focus component into the ground. From that point,\
  \ a fresh, clean water trickles forth at a rate of 1 gallon every 10 minutes. You\
  \ cannot cast this spell inside a building or in an area of worked stone, but you\
  \ can cast it underground. You cannot cast this spell within 1 mile of an existing\
  \ hidden spring."
