description: "This padded cloth jacket is often worn alone or with mail or plate armor\
  \ and is favored by hunters, guards, and soldiers. A gambeson fitted with leather\
  \ loops to more easily attach armor is called an arming doublet. Although sufficient\
  \ to protect you against casual scrapes, it is not as thick as padded armor."
