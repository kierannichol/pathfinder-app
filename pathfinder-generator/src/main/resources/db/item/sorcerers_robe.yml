description: "This dapper robe enables a sorcerer to add the effects of her 1st-level\
  \ bloodline power to spells she casts. As a swift action before casting a spell,\
  \ the wearer expends one use of her 1st-level bloodline power and selects one target\
  \ of the spell to be affected by that bloodline power. If the spell allows a saving\
  \ throw, a successful save against the spell means the bloodline power deals half\
  \ damage (if it normally deals hit point damage) or is negated (if it does not).\
  \ The robe can be used up to three times per day."
