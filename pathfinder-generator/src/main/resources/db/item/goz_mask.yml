description: "Shortly after the Eye of Abendego began, the Storm Kindlers created\
  \ enchanted masks to aid in the navigation of the often storm-lashed swamps. Today,\
  \ many of these distinctive masks remain, now worn by humanoid chieftains and Koboto\
  \ witch doctors. The masks are often defaced, with their original appearance twisted\
  \ into monstrous or demonic visages. Their new owners refer to them as goz masks.\n\
  A goz mask allows the wearer to see through fog, smoke, and other obscuring vapors\
  \ as if they did not exist. This ability functions underwater as well, allowing\
  \ the wearer to see through thick silt and other aquatic precipitates. Additionally,\
  \ the wearer is treated as one size category larger and gains a +4 bonus on all\
  \ saving throws made to resist the effects of wind. A goz mask allows its wearer\
  \ to breathe water for 60 minutes per dayâ€”these minutes need not be consecutive,\
  \ but must be expended in 10-minute increments."
