description: "This plush hooded robe is finely trimmed with gold accents. When the\
  \ wearer casts a spell, the robe scintillates with color and produces ostentatious\
  \ magical effects, such as bright lights and loud hums, increasing the DC of Spellcraft\
  \ checks to identify the spell by 10. In addition, once per day as a move action,\
  \ the wearer can trigger these effects with a dramatic flourish; each creature within\
  \ 30 feet that can see the wearer must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be blinded\
  \ for 1d4+1 rounds."
