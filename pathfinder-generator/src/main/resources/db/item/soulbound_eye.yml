description: "Appearing at first like an expensive, masochistic adornment, this almond-sized\
  \ star ruby is set in a gold clasp, one side of which is festooned with several\
  \ long spikes. A soulbound eye is not an item that most creatures would voluntarily\
  \ wear— they are instead crafted by powerful creatures who wish to use another creature\
  \ as a sort of remote-viewing slave. A soulbound eye must be attached to a willing\
  \ or helpless creature by pressing the spike-covered surface to the creature's brow—\
  the gem swiftly and painfully embeds itself in the victim's forehead, immediately\
  \ activating to forge a shared link between the wearer and the creature who placed\
  \ the item on its head (the \"master\").\nOnce implanted, the soulbound eye allows\
  \ the master to observe the world around the wearer through the wearer's senses.\
  \ It also allows for telepathic communication between the wearer and the master.\
  \ Neither of these features function across planar boundaries.\nThe soulbound eye's\
  \ wearer is not compelled to obey its master's telepathic commands, but the master\
  \ can use the soulbound eye as a conduit for hold monster, modify memory, pain strike\
  \ (Advanced Player's Guide), and suggestion spells, treating the wearer as the target\
  \ of the spell no matter the distance between master and wearer. The victim is allowed\
  \ any normal saving throws or spell resistance against spells cast through the soulbound\
  \ eye.\nAn implanted soulbound eye functions like a cursed item once it is in place—\
  it can only be removed if the curse is first lifted via an effect like remove curse\
  \ or break enchantment. Once removed, a soulbound eye crumbles to fragments."
