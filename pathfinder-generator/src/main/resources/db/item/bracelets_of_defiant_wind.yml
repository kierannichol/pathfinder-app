description: "These azure-and-white marbled bracelets feel smooth and perpetually\
  \ cool to the touch. When worn, they activate once per day as an immediate action\
  \ to safeguard against sudden airborne attacks and effects by automatically surrounding\
  \ their wearer in a cylinder of pure wind and elemental air. This effect functions\
  \ simultaneously as both air bubble and wind wall, protecting against missile weapons,\
  \ gases, and most gaseous breath weapons. It also activates underwater if the wearer\
  \ begins to drown. Once activated, the effect lasts for 10 rounds."
