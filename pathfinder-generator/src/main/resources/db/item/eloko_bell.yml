description: "This small, rusty iron bell contains great magic. When the bell is rung\
  \ as a standard action, all creatures within 60 feet who can hear the bell must\
  \ make a DC 14 Will save or be compelled to seek out the source of the sound for\
  \ 7 rounds, moving at their normal speeds. If the sound leads its subjects into\
  \ a dangerous area, each affected creature gets a second save. This is a mindaffecting\
  \ compulsion effect. The bell affects a maximum of 24 HD of creatures. A bell can\
  \ be used 5 times before it crumbles away into rusty flakes and becomes useless."
