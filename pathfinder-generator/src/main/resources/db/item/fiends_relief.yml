description: "A creature wielding one of these +1 longspears —which are favored gifts\
  \ of House Thrune—gains a +3 bonus on attack rolls when flanking with an evil-aligned\
  \ outsider, instead of +2. A creature using the longspear's reach to attack through\
  \ a square occupied by an allied evil-aligned outsider ignores any cover bonus the\
  \ fiend would grant to the target."
