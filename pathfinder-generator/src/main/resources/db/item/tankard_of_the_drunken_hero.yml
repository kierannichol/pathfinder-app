description: "This simple battered tankard is usually made of copper or tin. Its handle\
  \ is not attached at the bottom so the bearer can hook it on his belt for easy carrying.\
  \ The bearer gains a +1 resistance bonus on Fortitude and Will saves. Once per day,\
  \ the bearer can fill the tankard with wine, ale, or other alcohol and drink from\
  \ it to gain the benefits of a remove fear spell.\nIf Cayden Cailean is the bearer's\
  \ patron, the tankard counts as a holy symbol. Once per day, the bearer can drink\
  \ an alcoholic beverage from the tankard to gain the benefits of heroism. Once per\
  \ day, the tankard automatically unties ropes that bind the bearer or unlocks locks\
  \ that hinder him. This occurs about 5 minutes after the tying or unlocking and\
  \ affects only bindings directly on the bearer's person (for example, it won't unlock\
  \ a door to the bearer's prison cell, but will unlock the bearer's manacles). This\
  \ power is subtle enough that it is unnoticeable unless someone checks the bindings\
  \ to make sure they are secureâ€”ropes loosen but still appear to be tightly bound,\
  \ manacles unlock and loosen but do not automatically fall off. The tankard can\
  \ untie or unlock only bindings with an Escape Artist or Disable Device DC of 25\
  \ or lower, though more powerful tankards may exist."
