description: "This black grimoire's pages are mostly blank, but a few contain rough\
  \ watercolor silhouettes. The Book of Night without Moon is a repository for trapped\
  \ shadows. To sever a shadow from its owner and add it to the book, the user must\
  \ speak a command word and snap the book shut on the shadow. The shadow must be\
  \ very still when it is severed, so the victim must be either willing or helpless.\
  \ The book has 40 pages; a shadow takes up a number of pages equal to the Hit Dice\
  \ of the creature that cast it.\nA creature whose shadow is stolen must succeed\
  \ at a DC 18 Will save or be sickened by a nameless melancholy until its shadow\
  \ is returned (in the meantime, the creature casts no shadow). Losing its shadow\
  \ has no adverse effect on a creature that cannot be sickened. A remove curse spell\
  \ cast on the creature ends the effect and retrieves the shadow from the book.\n\
  As a standard action, the book's bearer may release a shadow from the book, conjuring\
  \ an illusory duplicate of the shadow's owner as if with the spell shadow conjuration\
  \ (DC 18 Will save to recognize that the conjuration is an illusion). The shadow\
  \ is intelligent and can follow complex commands, but cannot speak and lacks the\
  \ memories or personality of the creature that cast it. The shadow serves the character\
  \ who released it for 1 hour or until destroyed, whichever comes first. The shadow\
  \ then returns instantly and permanently to its original owner, wherever he or she\
  \ may be. It cannot be commanded to return to the book and cannot be stolen again.\
  \ The book's magic can sustain up to five active shadows at a time.\nA Book of Night\
  \ without Moon purchased or found as treasure contains 2d6 shadows, chosen by the\
  \ GM."
