name: "Scroll of Baleful Shadow Transmutation"
description: "You infuse a target's shadow with energies from the Shadow Plane, shaping\
  \ the shadow into one that appears to belong to a different creature, and tricking\
  \ the target into believing it actually is that creature. When you cast this spell,\
  \ choose one Huge or smaller creature of the animal type or one Medium or Small\
  \ creature of the humanoid type. If the chosen creature is ill suited to the target's\
  \ current environment, such as an aquatic creature not in water, the subject gains\
  \ a +4 bonus on all saving throws against baleful shadow transmutation. If the subject\
  \ fails its Will save, it believes that it is the chosen creature, causing it to\
  \ lose its extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities, lose its ability\
  \ to cast spells (if it had the ability), and gain the alignment, special abilities,\
  \ and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of its new form in place of its\
  \ own. It retains any class features (other than spellcasting) that aren't extraordinary,\
  \ supernatural, or spell-like abilities."
