description: "These +1 gauntlets are made of snakeskin and grant a +1 enhancement\
  \ bonus on grapple checks.\nOnce per day as a standard action, the wielder of a\
  \ pair of constrictor's gauntlets can target a single creature wearing medium or\
  \ heavy armor within 30 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 16 Will saving throw\
  \ or its armor shrinks and constricts, dealing 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage\
  \ to the target if it's wearing medium armor or 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage\
  \ if it's wearing heavy armor. The armor deals this damage each round for 3 rounds,\
  \ and then returns to its normal size. The armor's armor bonus, maximum Dexterity\
  \ bonus, armor check penalty, and other attributes do not change while it is shrunken."
