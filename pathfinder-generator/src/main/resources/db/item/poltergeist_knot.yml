description: "This hopelessly knotted ball of golden twine defies any efforts to untangle\
  \ it, forming new snarls out of nowhere just when it appears to be nearly unraveled.\n\
  On command, the twine unrolls and snakes out through the air toward a target within\
  \ 50 feet. Unless the target succeeds at a DC 13 Reflex save to avoid the poltergeist\
  \ knot, at the twine's touch, the bindings of any containers the target is carrying\
  \ (packs, pouches, sheaths, quivers, and so on) come undone and all their contents\
  \ are swept up in a whirlwind, performing a madcap dance around the target's head.\n\
  Anyone can grab an item as it spins by succeeding at a steal combat maneuver (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Advanced Player's Guide 322) against a CMD of 12. In addition, the spinning\
  \ objects obstruct the target's sight; other creatures gain concealment against\
  \ attacks made by the target. The equipment moves with the victim, whirling around\
  \ her head for 3 rounds before falling to the ground.\nA poltergeist knot affects\
  \ laces and buckles only on exterior containersâ€”bottles in a pouch or a bag of caltrops\
  \ in a backpack, for example, are swept into the whirlwind but don't spill their\
  \ contents. The poltergeist knot works on inanimate objects, but can't open locks.\
  \ A creature who isn't carrying a significant amount of gear may be immune to the\
  \ poltergeist knot 's effect, at the GM's discretion.\nOnce used, the knot loses\
  \ its magic and becomes 50 feet of tangle, mundane twine."
