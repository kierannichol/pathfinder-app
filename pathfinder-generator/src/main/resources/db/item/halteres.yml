description: "These paired stone or metal weights look like a pair of curved stones\
  \ with handles. An athlete can take one weight in each hand and swing them back\
  \ and forth before jumping, using the momentum to gain greater distance when taking\
  \ off. Training with halteres requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 16 Acrobatics\
  \ check. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics\
  \ checks to make long jumps. This bonus lasts for 24 hours or until you fail an\
  \ Acrobatics check."
