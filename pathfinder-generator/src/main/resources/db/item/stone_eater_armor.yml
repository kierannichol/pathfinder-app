description: "This suit of +1 stoneplate bears a horned gorgon's head on each shoulder\
  \ and the screaming face of a medusa on its breastplate. The first suits of stone-eater\
  \ armor found in the Inner Sea region were brought by explorers from faraway Casmaron,\
  \ along with wild tales of a lost city destroyed by a powerful medusa.\nWhenever\
  \ the wearer of stone-eater armor is subject to a petrifying effect, such as that\
  \ caused by a flesh to stone spell, the effect is negated and the stone-eater armor's\
  \ enhancement bonus increases by 1 for 1 minute as the armor grows thicker and bulkier,\
  \ covering more of the wearer's body without hindering her movement."
