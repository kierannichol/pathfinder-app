description: "This headband has three swirling patterns of red, green, and blue crystals\
  \ arching across its length. Three times per day, its wearer can sacrifice an arcane\
  \ spell to create an offensive blast or defensive shield. The blast is a ranged\
  \ touch attack with a range of 30 feet, which deals 1d6 points of energy damage\
  \ (cold, electricity, or fire) per spell level sacrificed. The shield creates a\
  \ swirling band of energy that lasts 1 round and gives the wearer a deflection bonus\
  \ to AC equal to 2 + the level of the spell sacrificed."
