description: "The rune of Baphomet emblazons this slim, leather-bound volume. Taken\
  \ from a larger work, the Fasciculus Labyrinthum details many of the rituals of\
  \ Baphomet worship. Included in its pages are details of how to operate the imago\
  \ lens and incomplete instructions to constructing one. As long as the book is carried\
  \ (even if carried in an extradimensional space like a bag of holding), it grants\
  \ its carrier immunity to maze spells and a +4 profane bonus on all saving throws\
  \ against insanity and confusion effects."
destruction: "The Fasciculus Labyrinthum must be carried into a maze that has never\
  \ been solved. The book must remain in the possession of a person lost in the maze\
  \ for 666 days. If on the 666th day the carrier of the book solves the maze, the\
  \ pages of the Fasciculus Labyrinthum turn blank and nonmagical."
