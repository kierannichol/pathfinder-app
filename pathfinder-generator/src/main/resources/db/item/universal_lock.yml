description: "This intricate padlock (hardness 10, hp 10, break DC 28, Disable Device\
  \ DC 35) is crafted from pure gold and etched with depictions of the First Vault\
  \ along its face. The lock can be placed onto any object that can open and close\
  \ (such as a chest, pouch, door, window, or even a folded napkin, as well as magic\
  \ items such as bags of holding and portable holes). The lock cannot be placed on\
  \ a creature. Upon command, the lock merges with the item, becoming an inked image\
  \ of the lock that covers half of the item being locked. If the item's hardness\
  \ and normal hit points are lower than those of the universal lock, the item's hardness\
  \ and hit points are increased to match those of the lock. The universal lock remains\
  \ in place until the owner commands it to unlock or it is successfully picked; it\
  \ then reverts back to its original form. If the object it is locking is broken\
  \ open, the universal lock is destroyed. A knock spell does not open an object sealed\
  \ with a universal lock, but it reduces the lock's Disable Device DC by 5 for 10\
  \ minutes."
