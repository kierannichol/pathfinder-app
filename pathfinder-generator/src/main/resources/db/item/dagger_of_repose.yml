description: "This short, curved dagger shimmers with folded layers of iron and steel.\
  \ It acts as a +1 undead-bane dagger. Once per day when the dagger of repose is\
  \ used to perform a coup de grace to slay a living creature, the wielder can bless\
  \ the victim's corpse, preventing the victim from rising as an undead because of\
  \ ongoing diseases or curse effects. This protection also prevents the victim's\
  \ corpse from being animated by necromancy magic such as animate dead or create\
  \ undead for 24 hours."
