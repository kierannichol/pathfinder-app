description: "The anima focus is an immense artifact created by Karzoug in the final\
  \ years of Thassilon, based upon the research and notes of the Lords of Greed in\
  \ Runeforge. This artifact maintains the link between the Material Plane and the\
  \ Eye of Avarice, and siphons fragments of greedy souls that have been prepared\
  \ by a special ritual through the soul lens found within the Eye of Avarice into\
  \ the runewell itself. The anima focus has other powers as well, linked to the Pinnacle\
  \ of Avarice—see page 359 for details."
destruction: "The soul lens to which the anima focus is linked must be destroyed,\
  \ after which the anima focus can be destroyed by physical damage or magic (hardness\
  \ 20; hp 800; Break DC 50)."
