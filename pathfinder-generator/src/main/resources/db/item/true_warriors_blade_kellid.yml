description: "The following weapon is generally available only to members of the indicated\
  \ race or ethnicity.\nThis +3 greatsword appears to be roughly forged and has scrawls\
  \ of Hallit engraved about the hilt. The wielder gains extra power against arcane\
  \ spellcasters, such as witches. The blade counts as a bane weapon against any creature\
  \ that has the ability to cast arcane spells (spell-like abilities don't count,\
  \ but a dragon's ability to cast as a sorcerer does, for example)."
