description: "These knee-high black leather boots have prominent and irregularly shaped\
  \ heels which seem to bulge from the rest of the shoe. As a swift action, the boots'\
  \ wearer can cause the boots to let loose a spray of caltrops through the back of\
  \ the heels as he moves during the remainder of his round. These caltrops fill each\
  \ square the wearer moves into during that round. Any creature, including the wearer,\
  \ occupying or who steps into one of these squares suffers the normal effects of\
  \ coming into contact with caltrops (Core Rulebook 155). Once produced, these caltrops\
  \ remain in existence until removed from their square, at which point they immediately\
  \ disappear. The shoes can be used for 10 rounds per day. These rounds need not\
  \ be consecutive."
