description: "This curved, snake-headed scepter is cool and moist to the touch. When\
  \ you hold the rod aloft and speak the command word, tiny blue-tinged vipers pour\
  \ out of your eyes, ears, and mouth until you collapse and vanish into a writhing\
  \ mass of intertwined snakes. Treat this effect as the polymorph spell, but use\
  \ the stats for a centipede swarm, except that the swarm is considered to have a\
  \ hive mind. The disturbing transformation can be performed once per day and lasts\
  \ up to 10 minutes or until you discontinue it (as a free action)."
