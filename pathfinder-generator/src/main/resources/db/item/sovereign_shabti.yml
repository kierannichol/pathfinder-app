description: "During its creation, a sovereign shabti is bound to a single member\
  \ of royalty who willingly donates 3 drops of her blood and writes her own name\
  \ upon a strip of parchment. These are placed within a hollow figurine typically\
  \ made of gold, jade, or gemstone that, when completed, has hardness 5 and 5 hit\
  \ points.\nIf the sovereign shabti still exists when the bound individual dies,\
  \ its magic takes effect. The figurine's power speeds the spirit along the River\
  \ of Souls, assuring it safely reaches the Boneyard. The soul is judged 2d12 hours\
  \ after dying, at which point the figurine expels its power to create a new being,\
  \ a living 1st-level shabti duplicate of the bound individual. If the soul was condemned\
  \ to torment or labor, the shabti goes in its place—the bound individual's spirit\
  \ traveling to some favorable corner of a plane matching her alignment. If the soul\
  \ was to be rewarded, the shabti appears on to the fringes of Axis. Once the shabti\
  \ has been created, the bound individual cannot be returned to life by any means\
  \ short of divine intervention. The sovereign shabti —which does not travel with\
  \ the bound soul—crumbles as soon as it creates a shabti."
