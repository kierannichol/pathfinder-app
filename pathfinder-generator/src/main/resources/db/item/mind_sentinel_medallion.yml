description: "The surface of this silver medallion is covered in angular geometric\
  \ shapes that refract light randomly. The medallion grants a continuous +2 resistance\
  \ bonus on saves versus mind-affecting spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural\
  \ abilities. If the wearer fails a save to avoid becoming dominated or confused,\
  \ the amulet immediately grants the wearer a second saving throw to resist the effect.\
  \ If this second save is successful, the medallion's power fades away entirely and\
  \ it becomes a simple piece of silver jewelry."
