description: "For some unknown reason, this finely crafted but mundane monkey statue\
  \ repulses oni. Any creature with the oni subtype (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 307)\
  \ that is within 30 feet of a monkey statue takes a â€“1 penalty on all d20 rolls.\
  \ The monkey statue can be unattended or presented by its wielder as a swift action\
  \ to cause this effect; the statue has no effect on oni if it is simply stored on\
  \ a wielder's person. A wielder must have a free hand available to present the statue\
  \ and gain its effect. This penalty does not stack with that from other monkey statues."
