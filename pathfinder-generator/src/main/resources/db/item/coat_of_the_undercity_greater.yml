description: "This coat functions much like the coat of the undercity, except the\
  \ wearer can transform into a venomroach (Bestiary 2 58) as if using vermin shape\
  \ II.\nAlternatively, the wearer can take the form of a giant cockroach swarm. This\
  \ swarm of Tiny vermin has a number of hit points equal to the wearer, uses the\
  \ wearer's mental ability scores, skills, and saving throws, and gains a +2 resistance\
  \ bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects instead of being immune\
  \ to them. The swarm otherwise has the same movement, Armor Class, swarm traits,\
  \ swarm damage, distraction and disease abilities as a typical rat swarm (including\
  \ the abilities having a DC of 12). While in swarm form, the wearer can't use any\
  \ of her activated abilities (extraordinary, supernatural, spell-like, or otherwise),\
  \ cast spells, or use items, although she can end the effect as a standard action.\n\
  Either of these transformations can occur only in an urban environment. The wearer\
  \ can remain transformed for up to 9 minutes per day. This duration doesn't need\
  \ to be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments."
