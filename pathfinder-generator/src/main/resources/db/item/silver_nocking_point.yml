description: "This small silver cylinder is no bigger than a pinhead and is engraved\
  \ with an Elven aphorism that roughly translates to \"unhindered flight.\" A silver\
  \ nocking point can be attached to the string of any bow or crossbow. When using\
  \ a weapon equipped with a silver nocking point, a character can treat penalties\
  \ for wind conditions as though they were one step less severe. For example, a character\
  \ firing a ranged projectile in severe wind conditions would fire at a ranged penalty\
  \ of –2 instead of –4. Magical wind effects that would normally deflect the projectile\
  \ (such as fickle winds) instead impose only a –8 penalty on the attack roll."
