description: "Each different type of amulet of the blooded grants its wearer powers\
  \ from one sorcerer bloodline, but makes him vulnerable to attacks and effects that\
  \ target creatures with the appropriate bloodline (such as a blood-hunting weapon).\
  \ If a creature that already has the associated bloodline wears the amulet, the\
  \ wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level\
  \ of his bloodline powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other\
  \ abilities that increase the effective level of bloodline powers.\nAberrant: This\
  \ chunk of pitch-black onyx is suspended on a chain of silver. Strange whorls and\
  \ tentacle-like shapes are etched upon its surface. The wearer gains a 25% chance\
  \ to negate any critical hit or sneak attack (as the light fortification armor special\
  \ ability). When making a melee touch attack, the wearer's reach increases by 5\
  \ feet. Moderate illusion; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, blur, enlarge person.\n\
  Abyssal: This amulet is a chunk of bright red garnet in which fire seems to dance\
  \ when light plays across its surface. It hangs from a chain of brass. The wearer\
  \ gains electricity resistance 5 and a +2 bonus on saving throws against poison.\
  \ In addition, the wearer can grow claws as a free action. The claws are treated\
  \ as natural weapons, and allows the wearer to make two claw attacks as a full attack\
  \ action using his full base attack bonus. The claws deal 1d4 points of damage each\
  \ (1d3 if the wearer is Small) plus the wearer's Strength modifier. Moderate abjuration;\
  \ CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, delay poison, magic fang, resist energy.\nAccursed:\
  \ This swirling green malachite hangs from a chain of oxidized copper. Sinister,\
  \ unblinking eyes are etched upon its surface. The wearer gains a +2 bonus on saving\
  \ throws against charm, cold, fear, fire, and sleep effects. Three times per day\
  \ as a standard action, the wearer can fix his gaze on any one creature within 60\
  \ feet. The target becomes staggered for 4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Will saving\
  \ throw (DC 18). Only one target can be affected by the wearer's gaze at a time;\
  \ if the wearer attempts to stagger a new opponent, the previous target immediately\
  \ recovers whether the new attempt is successful or not. Moderate necromancy; CL\
  \ 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, bestow curse, resist energy, resistance.\nCelestial:\
  \ This large, polished opal hangs from a chain of smoky gray steel. The wearer gains\
  \ acid resistance 5 and cold resistance 5. Three times per day as a standard action,\
  \ the wearer can unleash a ray of heavenly fire as a ranged touch attack, targeting\
  \ any foe within 30 feet. Against evil creatures, the ray deals 1d4+4 points of\
  \ damage. The damage is divine and not subject to energy resistance or immunity.\
  \ The ray heals good creatures of 1d4+4 points of damage, but a good creature cannot\
  \ benefit from the heavenly fire more than once per day. Neutral creatures are unaffected\
  \ by the ray. Moderate abjuration and evocation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, resist\
  \ energy, scorching ray.\nDestined: This chunk of uncut quartz hangs on a platinum\
  \ chain. The wearer gains a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws and to AC during\
  \ surprise rounds or any time he is otherwise unaware of an attack. Once per day,\
  \ the wearer can reroll one attack roll, critical hit confirmation roll, or caster\
  \ level check to overcome spell resistance. He must decide to use this ability after\
  \ the first roll is made but before the result is revealed. He must take the second\
  \ result, even if it's lower. Moderate enchantment; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item,\
  \ aid.\nDraconic: This amulet comes in a variety of minerals depending on its powers,\
  \ as shown in the table below, and is formed into the shape of a dragon's scale.\
  \ The wearer gains resistance 5 against the energy type shown in the table, as well\
  \ as a +1 natural armor bonus to AC. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer\
  \ can produce a breath weapon. This breath weapon deals 4d6 points of damage of\
  \ the energy type and shape listed (Reflex DC 13 half). Moderate abjuration and\
  \ evocation; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, fire breath, resist energy.\n"
