description: "Ruined scraps of various constructs were repurposed and combined to\
  \ form this ornate iron helmet. Though the helmet is not intelligent, it has a brute\
  \ mechanical cunning that allows it to assert control whenever the wearer's mind\
  \ is overwhelmed. The helmet takes control of the wearer's body anytime he is dazed\
  \ or stunned. Whenever the wearer would be dazed, he is instead confused. Whenever\
  \ the wearer would be stunned, he is instead confused and staggered.\nTime spent\
  \ under the cap's influence counts against the duration of the daze or stun effect.\
  \ The cap functions for up to 5 rounds per day. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.\
  \ The cap stops asserting control over its wearer when the duration of the daze\
  \ or stun effect ends, or when the cap's 5 rounds of duration are expended."
