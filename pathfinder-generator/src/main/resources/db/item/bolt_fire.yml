description: "These carefully crafted wooden bolts have a hollow core filled with\
  \ alchemist's fire. On a successful hit, they deal normal damage plus 1d4 points\
  \ of fire damage. Alchemical fire bolts do not cause any splash damage, and the\
  \ fire burst isn't enough to ignite targets (unless they are particularly flammable)."
