description: "This ornate glass jar is filled with greenish fluid and the slick, writhing\
  \ forms of many large black leeches. Though bloatmages often use leeches to help\
  \ them regulate their overloaded circulatory systems, this particular batch adds\
  \ additional benefits usable by anyone. To attach this jar's leeches, the user merely\
  \ needs to open the jar and upend the contents over his head and torso as a standard\
  \ action—the leeches do the rest, attaching to the user's body almost instantaneously.\
  \ These leeches impart a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution, but also a –4 penalty\
  \ on Diplomacy checks against creatures that might find such a practice grotesque\
  \ (such as most civilized races). Once applied, the leeches persist for 8 hours\
  \ before they die. The leeches are immediately destroyed if the wearer takes more\
  \ than 20 points of damage from any area-effect energy damage. The jar automatically\
  \ refills with a new batch of fortifying leeches after 24 hours.\nWhile the fortifying\
  \ leeches are applied, a bloatmage immediately regains 2 bonus points to her blood\
  \ pool—this cannot increase her blood points to higher than her normal maximum.\
  \ In addition, whenever the bloatmage uses her bloat ability to gain extra blood\
  \ points, she may roll her bloat dice twice and take the more favorable result."
