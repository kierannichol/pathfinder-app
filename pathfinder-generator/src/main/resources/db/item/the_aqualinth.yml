description: "A strange statue of some unknown dark material resembling unnaturally\
  \ slippery stone, this idol is carved in the shape of something at once unrecognizable\
  \ and terrifyingly organic, and possesses a number of unique abilities when touching\
  \ liquid.\nGeyser: If four or more levels' worth of spells are cast upon the Aqualinth,\
  \ the artifact is capable of causing the water surrounding it to purify and multiply,\
  \ generating thousands of gallons of water. At the same time, it creates an effect\
  \ mimicking reverse gravity upon the water, causing it to shoot up in a geyser capable\
  \ of reaching a thousand feet high. Moments later, the effect passes; the water\
  \ comes crashing down, and can be captured or diverted in the process, though the\
  \ water level of the original supply remains unchanged.\nBath of the God-Kings:\
  \ Bathing in a pool infested by the Aqualinth instantly refreshes the bather, removing\
  \ any fatigued or exhausted conditions. In addition, the bather is treated as though\
  \ he were wearing a ring of sustenance for the next 4 months. Regular bathing for\
  \ 56 days results in a +1 increase to a single ability score of the bather's choice—\
  a creature can receive this bonus only once, but can continue to receive the other\
  \ benefits of bathing in the pool.\nLiquid Ones: Anyone who spies her own reflection\
  \ in a pool infested by the Aqualinth and who is not completely loyal to the Four\
  \ Pharaohs of Ascension is treated as though she had gazed into the reflective surface\
  \ of a mirror of opposition. The duplicates created by the Aqualinth are not truly\
  \ identical to their originals. A duplicate has vulnerability to fire, losing any\
  \ fire resistance or immunity the original may have, and also gains the water subtype.\
  \ A duplicate can be distinguished from the original with a DC 30 Perception check,\
  \ as the duplicate has a faint watery texture to its skin.\nWhispering Water: Possessed\
  \ of a malign and alien intellect, the Aqualinth has an unknown agenda of its own,\
  \ and is capable of casting suggestion (save DC 31) upon anyone who drinks at least\
  \ half a gallon of water it has touched or produced."
destruction: "The Aqualinth may be evaporated into nothingness by transporting it\
  \ to the heart of a sun or star."
