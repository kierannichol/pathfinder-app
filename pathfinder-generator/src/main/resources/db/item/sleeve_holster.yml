description: "When worn inside voluminous sleeves, this leather holster allows you\
  \ to draw a concealed hand crossbow or coat pistol as a move action. The weapon\
  \ sits on sliders and is drawn directly into the hand. Unlike a wrist sheath, a\
  \ sleeve holster is bulky enough that it is obvious on close inspection, though\
  \ under a loose enough garment it might not provoke a reactive Perception check.\
  \ An individual sleeve holster fits for either a hand crossbow or a coat pistol,\
  \ but not both."
