description: "A ring of immolation is made of pumice and hardened ash but is as strong\
  \ as metal. As a free action, the wearer can activate the ring to create a fire\
  \ shield (warm) on himself. The wearer of a ring of immolation can activate a fire\
  \ shield on himself for up to 10 rounds each day (these rounds need not be used\
  \ consecutively). If the wearer would take magical cold damage and any rounds of\
  \ duration remain, the ring automatically activates for 1 round and protects the\
  \ wearer from the cold damage as per fire shield."
