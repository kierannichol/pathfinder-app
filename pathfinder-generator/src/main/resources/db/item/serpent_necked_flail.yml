description: "The head of this weapon resembles a knot of entwined serpents. In this\
  \ form, it can be used as a masterwork heavy mace. Upon command, the head separates\
  \ into three individual snakes joined to the weapon's handle by their tails, and\
  \ the weapon acts as a +1 speed heavy flail. Speaking the command word again makes\
  \ the weapon revert to its mace form."
