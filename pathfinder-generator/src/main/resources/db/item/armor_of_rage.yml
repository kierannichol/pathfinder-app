description: "This armor is similar in appearance to armor of command and functions\
  \ as a suit of +1 full plate. However, when it is worn, the armor causes the character\
  \ to take a â€“4 penalty to Charisma. All unfriendly creatures within 300 feet gain\
  \ a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against her. The effect is not noticeable to\
  \ the wearer or those affected. In other words, the wearer does not immediately\
  \ notice that donning the armor is the cause of her problems, nor do foes understand\
  \ the reason for the depth of their enmity."
