description: "Bound in bloodstained leather, this heavy tome is scarred like the flesh\
  \ of a seasoned warrior and contains many generations of martial knowledge. Once\
  \ per day, after studying the manual for 1 hour, a fighter may exchange one of her\
  \ fighter bonus feats for another combat feat. She must meet the prerequisites for\
  \ this new feat and she cannot alter a feat she is using as a prerequisite for another\
  \ feat, prestige class, or other ability. This change persists for 24 hours, after\
  \ which time the fighter's feats return to normal. The fighter may spend 10 minutes\
  \ studying the manual to end its effects early."
