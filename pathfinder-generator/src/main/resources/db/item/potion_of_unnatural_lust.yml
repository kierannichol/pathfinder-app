name: "Potion of Unnatural Lust"
description: "Your target is filled with lust and desire for a single creature or\
  \ object as designated by you at the time of casting. That creature or object must\
  \ be within the spell's range and perceivable by the target of the spell. The target\
  \ is filled with the compulsion to rush to the subject of its lust and passionately\
  \ kiss or caress that subject on its next turn, taking no other actions. If the\
  \ target would not normally have lustful feelings toward the designated creature\
  \ or object, it receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw."
