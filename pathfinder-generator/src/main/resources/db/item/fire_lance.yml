description: "This primitive firearm is merely a long tube that, when ignited, propels\
  \ forth a short gout of flame and a javelin. Unlike other firearms, the fire lance\
  \ is wildly imprecise, and targets AC rather than touch AC. A fire lance is always\
  \ treated as having the broken condition for the purpose of determining the effects\
  \ of a misfire. A fire lance uses a javelin and 2 doses of black powder as ammunition.\
  \ This is an early firearm."
