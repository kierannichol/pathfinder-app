description: "This simple leather mask depicts an earless catlike creature. When worn,\
  \ it melds into its wearer's face and vanishes, leaving the wearer's face just as\
  \ it looked before. Three times per day the wearer can command the mask to appear\
  \ to retract the wearer's skin, revealing an illusion of the wearer's glistening\
  \ skull and musculature. Creatures within 100 feet who see this display must succeed\
  \ at a DC 13 Will save or become frightened (if the target has 6 or fewer Hit Dice)\
  \ or shaken (if the target has more than 6 HD) for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting\
  \ fear effect and a glamer. Anyone who can see through illusions (such as by true\
  \ seeing) is unaffected."
