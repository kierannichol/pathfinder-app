description: "Crafted from the scaled hide of a black dragon and lined with wolliped\
  \ fur for warmth, this suit of +1 bolstering (Ultimate Equipment) black dragonhide\
  \ armor was designed to protect and aid dragonriders of the Dragon Legion in their\
  \ battles against the evil dragons of the Drakelands. Hide of the dragonrider grants\
  \ its wearer a +5 competence bonus on Ride checks, and the wearer does not take\
  \ an armor penalty from the armor on Ride checks. In addition, when mounted, the\
  \ wearer can transfer some or all of the armor's armor bonus (including its enhancement\
  \ bonus) to his mount as a bonus that stacks with all others. As a free action at\
  \ the start of his turn, the wearer chooses how to allocate the armor's armor bonus,\
  \ and that allocation lasts until the wearer's next turn. Once per day, the wearer\
  \ can imbue hide of the dragonrider with resistance against one type of energy,\
  \ as the energy resistance armor special ability. This resistance lasts for 10 minutes.\
  \ Hide of the dragonrider functions as a cold weather outfit, granting its wearer\
  \ a +5 circumstance bonus on Fortitude saves against the effects of cold weather."
