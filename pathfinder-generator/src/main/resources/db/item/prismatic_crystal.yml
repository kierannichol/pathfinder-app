description: "This chunk of crystal shines with the colors of the rainbow. A prismatic\
  \ crystal can be used as a focus for the read aura occult skill unlock to reduce\
  \ the time needed to read an aura from 10 minutes to 5 minutes. When held by psychic\
  \ creatures, these crystals also emit light in a small area, increasing the light\
  \ level in a 10-foot radius by one step (darkness becomes dim light, and dim light\
  \ becomes normal light). A prismatic crystal can't increase the light level above\
  \ normal light."
