description: "Only one end of this iron-shod +3 quarterstaff has an enhancement bonus.\
  \ The enhanced end acts as a bane weapon against any creature with the ability to\
  \ cast spells or use spelllike abilities. As a standard action, the wielder can\
  \ strike the unenhanced end against the ground while expending one use of mythic\
  \ power to produce an antimagic field centered on the staff. This effect has a duration\
  \ of 2 hours. Anyone striking the staff against the ground a second time dismisses\
  \ the effect. The antimagic field remains in effect if the staff is dropped or disarmed.\
  \ The staff retains its enhancement bonus and extra damage against spellcasters\
  \ inside any antimagic field."
