description: "The grip of this greatsword has a series of deep notches, and its jagged\
  \ blade is a deep crimson. A bloodbite is awakened by bloodlust, and its appetite\
  \ must be sated. When the wielder makes a successful attack with the bloodbite,\
  \ it inflicts a wound that deals 1d4 points of bleed damage (in addition to its\
  \ normal damage), but it also deals 1d4 points of bleed damage to the wielder as\
  \ the hilt grows teeth that dig into the wielder's hands. Once used, the bloodbite\
  \ must be used as its wielder's primary melee weapon, and it can be discarded only\
  \ after the owner benefits from a remove curse spell or similar effect."
