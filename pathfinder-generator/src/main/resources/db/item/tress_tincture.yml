description: "This tincture is used to counteract hair loss and guarantee luxurious\
  \ locks, but alchemists have developed a concentrated form for use in combat. You\
  \ can throw tress tincture as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10\
  \ feet. On a hit, the target's hair grows long and thick, partly blocking the target's\
  \ vision. The affected creature treats all other creatures as if they had concealment.\
  \ As a swift action, the affected creature can brush or toss its hair aside, negating\
  \ this concealment for 1 round. As a full-round action that provokes an attack of\
  \ opportunity, the affected creature can hack off enough hair to end the concealment\
  \ effect; this requires a light or one-handed slashing weapon. Creatures incapable\
  \ of growing hair are unaffected by tress tincture."
