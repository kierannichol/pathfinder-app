description: "This thin black liquid is stored in airtight flasks because it evaporates\
  \ quickly when exposed to air. Its cloying vapors cling to a target, obscuring vision\
  \ for a short period of time. You can throw a shadowcloy flask as a splash weapon\
  \ with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit means the target treats the ambient\
  \ light as one category darker than normal, with a creature already in natural darkness\
  \ treating it as supernatural darkness. This effect lasts for 1 round. A thrown\
  \ shadowcloy flask has no effect on adjacent creatures or if it misses."
