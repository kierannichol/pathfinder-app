  \ her hands to twice normal size and harden to the consistency of hardwood. This\
  \ transformation lasts for up to 20 rounds per day, though they need not be consecutive\
  \ rounds. If the wearer hits with an unarmed strike or natural attack using her\
  \ enlarged hands, she may attempt to bull rush her opponent as a free action."
