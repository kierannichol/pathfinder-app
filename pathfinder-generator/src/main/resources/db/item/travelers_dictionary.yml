description: "Each of these books references a specific language and has two sections.\
  \ The first presents a wide variety of useful phrases and words in Common (arranged\
  \ by category) followed by a phonetic representation of the same in the language\
  \ that the book deals with. The second section provides an alphabetical (by phonetic\
  \ spelling) collection of words and phrases in the second language and their approximate\
  \ Common translation. Using this book does not grant a bonus on rolls to communicate,\
  \ but at the GM's discretion it can negate or reduce a penalty if the other creature\
  \ is patient enough to wait for the translation."
