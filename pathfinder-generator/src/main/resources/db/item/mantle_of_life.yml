description: "This short cape shimmers faintly under light. The wearer is immune to\
  \ the energy drain attacks made by undead creatures. She still suffers any other\
  \ effects of the attack, but ignores the energy drain. If a corpse is wearing the\
  \ mantle, it can't rise as an undead creature for any reason. This doesn't prevent\
  \ creatures that were already undead from using abilities like rejuvenation to return\
  \ to unlife."
