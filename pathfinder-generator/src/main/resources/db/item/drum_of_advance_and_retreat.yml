description: "When played, this sturdy snare drum increases the run speed of allied\
  \ creatures within 120 feet as if they had the Run feat. Activating the drum is\
  \ a standard action that requires a DC 20 Perform (percussion) check; maintaining\
  \ the playing is a free action if the player is running. If the bearer stops playing\
  \ the drum, the enhanced running speed ends. The drum may be used for up to 1 hour\
  \ per day. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be used in 10-minute\
  \ increments."
