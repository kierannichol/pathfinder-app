description: "When applied to a homunculus's skin (which takes 1 minute), this ointment\
  \ causes the creature's flesh to shift color and pattern reflexively to match its\
  \ surroundings. The homunculus gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks for\
  \ 24 hours. The ointment can also be applied to other creatures as long as they\
  \ are Medium or smaller and wear no clothing or armor to obstruct their skin, but\
  \ the bonus is reduced to +2."
