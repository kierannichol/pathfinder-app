description: "This alchemically concocted black ink can be attuned to a standard sheet\
  \ of parchment. Anything inscribed using the ink (anywhere on the same plane of\
  \ existence) appears on the attuned parchment in a sparkling blue script that lasts\
  \ 1 hour. There is enough ink in one vial to fill one sheet of parchment. The ink\
  \ cannot duplicate any written magical effects, such as a symbol of death (as per\
  \ the spell of the same name). Crafting a vial of ink of stolen secrets requires\
  \ a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check."
