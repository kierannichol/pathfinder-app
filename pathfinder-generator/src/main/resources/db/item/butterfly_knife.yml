description: "This weapon has a blade concealed between the two halves of the handle\
  \ that can be brought to bear quickly. If you are proficient with it (or have the\
  \ Quick Draw feat), you may open it as a free action; a nonproficient user must\
  \ spend a move action to open it. Otherwise, treat it as a dagger. When it's closed,\
  \ you gain a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal it on your body."
