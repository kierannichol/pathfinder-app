description: "There are instances where wearing full plate armor can jeopardize a\
  \ Hellknight's life. Primarily worn by Hellknight sailors, this studded leather\
  \ armor includes heavy gloves and a helm of sculpted leather designed to look like\
  \ a skullâ€” either a human's or that of some aquatic creature. Hellknight leather's\
  \ statistics are identical to those of studded leather, except it costs 5 gp more\
  \ and weighs 5 pounds more."
