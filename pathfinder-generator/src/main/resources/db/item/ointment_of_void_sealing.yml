description: "Ointment of void sealing comes in a 4-gallon tub, typically made out\
  \ of brass or some other durable metal. When a Medium or smaller character dunks\
  \ his head into the tub of sticky, viscous goo as a standard action, the ointment\
  \ flows over and around him with surprising alacrity until it has coated him in\
  \ a thin but flexible layer that looks like translucent amber. Ointment of void\
  \ sealing creates a perfect seal around the user, protecting him from the extreme\
  \ cold and vacuum of outer space, and provides breathable air for the user, as planetary\
  \ adaptation (see page 28). After 3 hours, a coating of ointment of void sealing\
  \ deteriorates and its effects end. A newly created tub of ointment of void sealing\
  \ contains enough ointment to cover four Medium creatures. Large creatures require\
  \ 2 doses to gain the benefits of the ointment, while two Small creatures can share\
  \ a single dose between them."
