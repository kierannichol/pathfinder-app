description: "When worn by a kineticist, these bracers develop finely inscribed patterns\
  \ on their once-plain surfaces that reflect the wearer's elemental connection. As\
  \ a full-round action, a kineticist wearing the bracers can accept 3 points of burn\
  \ to tear open a brief rift between her current location and the Material Plane,\
  \ Ethereal Plane, or an Elemental Plane; this behaves as per plane shift, but the\
  \ rift is able to transport only her. By accepting an additional point of burn,\
  \ she can allow up to 8 willing creatures to travel with her. When traveling to\
  \ or from the plane that corresponds to her elemental focus, the total burn cost\
  \ required to activate the bracers is reduced by 1.\nRift-rending bracers must be\
  \ worn for 24 hours before a kineticist can activate them."
