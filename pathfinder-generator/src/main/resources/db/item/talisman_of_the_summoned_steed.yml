description: "This onyx talisman resembles a majestic black stallion covered in carved\
  \ wavy lines and bearing a tiny twine bridle. When the command word is spoken, it\
  \ transforms into a saddled and thoroughbred light horse that serves you willingly.\
  \ The command word also returns it to talisman form. If slain, the horse reverts\
  \ to talisman form and cannot be activated again for 24 hours.\nEach talisman's\
  \ horse form has a specific color (black, brown, gray, pinto, and so on) and markings\
  \ (blazes, stars, stockings, etc.), chosen by the creator when the item is crafted."
