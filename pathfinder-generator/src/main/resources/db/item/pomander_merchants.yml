description: "A pomander is a waxy concoction of resin, flower essence, powdered spices,\
  \ musk, and ambergris in a walnut-sized cage and hung by a chain from the neck,\
  \ a belt, or a bracelet. Merchants and adventurers often use pomanders caged in\
  \ wood or lead, while nobles use ones cased in precious metals and enamel set with\
  \ gems. When the pomander is carried openly, its powerful scent (Perception DC 0\
  \ to notice) fortifies the senses against unpleasant sensations. Anyone within 10\
  \ feet of a pomander gains a +2 resistance bonus on Fortitude saves against effects\
  \ that nauseate or sicken, but suffers a â€“4 penalty on Perception checks made to\
  \ detect scents other than the pomander's.\nA noble's pomander also overpowers the\
  \ wearer's own scent; the DC to track him by his own odor increases by 5, but attempts\
  \ to track him by the pomander's odor have the DC reduced by 5. Regardless of the\
  \ type, a pomander becomes ineffective after 1d4 weeks of exposure to air, although\
  \ storing it in an airtight container can extend its lifespan."
