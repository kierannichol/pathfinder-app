description: "The alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites\
  \ when struck against a rough surface (a move action). Creating a flame with a tindertwig\
  \ is much faster than creating a flame with tinder and a flint and steel or magnifying\
  \ glass. Lighting a torch with a tindertwig is a standard action rather than a full-round\
  \ action, and lighting any other fire with one is at least a standard action. A\
  \ tindertwig burns for 1d2 rounds and sheds light as a candle. Tindertwigs are waterproof,\
  \ but must be dried before you can strike them."
