description: "This 2-foot-tall, vase-shaped object is inspired by the huge warka towers\
  \ found in inland areas of Senghor and other parts of the Mwangi Expanse. The warka\
  \ jar is made of lightweight and elastic juncus stalks woven into a crisscross pattern.\
  \ A fine mesh hangs inside and collects water condensation. Placing a warka jar\
  \ outside overnight collects enough fresh water for a single creature to survive\
  \ for one day. When not in use, the warka jar can be collapsed into a pocket-sized\
  \ cube for easy transportation."
