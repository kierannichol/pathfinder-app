name: "Scroll of Winds of Vengeance"
description: "You surround yourself with a buffeting shroud of supernatural, tornado-force\
  \ winds. These winds grant you a fly speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability.\
  \ Neither your armor nor your load affects this fly speed. The winds shield you\
  \ from any other wind effects, and form a shell of breathable air around you, allowing\
  \ you to fly and breathe underwater or in outer space. Ranged weapons (including\
  \ giant-thrown boulders, siege weapon projectiles, and other massive ranged weapons)\
  \ passing through the winds are deflected by the winds and automatically miss you.\
  \ Gases and most gaseous breath weapons cannot pass though the winds."
