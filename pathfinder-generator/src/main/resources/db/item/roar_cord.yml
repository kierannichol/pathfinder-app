description: "This thin length of rope has many oddly shaped bits of hollow metal\
  \ fixed along its length. As a standard action, a creature can swing a roar cord\
  \ over its head to generate a variety of eerie noises. For the next round, any creature\
  \ within 60 feet of the roar cord takes a –2 penalty on Perception checks that rely\
  \ on sound and a –1 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. The roar cord\
  \ can be used as a bardic instrument (string instrument) that grants the bard a\
  \ +2 bonus on Perform checks when using the countersong bardic performance."
