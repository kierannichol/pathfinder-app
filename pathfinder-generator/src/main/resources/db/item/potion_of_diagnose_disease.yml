name: "Potion of Diagnose Disease"
description: "You determine whether a creature, object, or area carries any sort of\
  \ disease or infestation (including molds, slimes, and similar hazards), or any\
  \ exceptional or supernatural effects causing the sickened or nauseated effects.\
  \ If there is disease present, you know what disease it is and its effects. If the\
  \ target is a creature, you gain a +4 bonus on Heal checks to treat the creature's\
  \ disease. The spell can penetrate many barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of\
  \ common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it."
