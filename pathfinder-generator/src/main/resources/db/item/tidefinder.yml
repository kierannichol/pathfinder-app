description: "This delicate spherical blood coral compass has a longer outer needle\
  \ and a shorter inner needle. When the holder activates it, the outer needle points\
  \ in the direction of the nearest tide or current within 1 mile, changing color\
  \ from red to violet to indicate the relative distance (red meaning within 30 feet\
  \ and violet meaning almost 1 mile away) and the inner needle points in the direction\
  \ of the tide or current, changing color from red to violet based on the relative\
  \ speed (red meaning extremely turbulent, up to 200 feet per round, and violet meaning\
  \ less than 5 feet per round)."
