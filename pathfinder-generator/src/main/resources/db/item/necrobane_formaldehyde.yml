description: "This form of the common embalming agent comes in a glass beaker with\
  \ a thick rubber stopper, and is employed in regions such as Ustalav, where alchemy\
  \ is prized as a viable defense against the depredations of necromancers. When introduced\
  \ into a dead body, necrobane formaldehyde slows the process of decay, keeping the\
  \ corpse from stinking and rotting for 1d6 days after death. Treating a body with\
  \ necrobane formaldehyde takes 1 hour and requires a successful DC 25 Heal check.\
  \ A corpse injected with necrobane formaldehyde is more difficult to resurrect as\
  \ an undead creature for 1d6 days after injection. Anyone attempting to seed unlife\
  \ in a corpse treated in this substance must succeed at a DC 14 caster level check\
  \ to complete the process or the spell fails and its components are wasted. This\
  \ is also the case for creatures that ingest necrobane formaldehyde and subsequently\
  \ die before the effect's duration has expired.\nIf an undead creature ingests necrobane\
  \ formaldehyde (perhaps by eating part of an embalmed corpse), the undead creature\
  \ becomes fatigued for 2d6 rounds.\nWhen ingested by a living creature, necrobane\
  \ formaldehyde nauseates the imbiber for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d4 points of Constitution\
  \ damage. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save reduces the nauseated effect to sickened\
  \ and halves the Constitution damage (minimum 1). This is a poison effect, though\
  \ the pungent aroma and unmistakably toxic taste of necrobane formaldehyde makes\
  \ it difficult to use as a surreptitious weapon.\nCrafting necrobane formaldehyde\
  \ requires a successful DC 23 Craft (alchemy) check."
