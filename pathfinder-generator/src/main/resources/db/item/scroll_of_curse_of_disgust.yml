name: "Scroll of Curse of Disgust"
description: "You place a curse upon a creature, causing it to avoid the sight of\
  \ a specific trigger, which is a kind of creature, object, or condition designated\
  \ by you. When the target is within 30 feet of a trigger and is aware of the trigger,\
  \ it gains the sickened condition and feels an urge to leave. A successful Will\
  \ save negates the urge to leave, but the sickened condition persists as long as\
  \ the target is within 30 feet of a trigger and aware of it. Example triggers include\
  \ beggars, filthy clothing, diseased creatures, the king, blood, spiders, rats,\
  \ corpses, and sewage."
