description: "Often used by spies and arcane scholars to steal important texts without\
  \ alerting their owners, a book thief's satchel contains enough room to hold a single\
  \ tome of no more than 1,000 pages and no larger than 12 by 18 inches in size. Prior\
  \ to using the satchel, its bearer must place a blank book in the satchel and utter\
  \ a command word. This blank book is sequestered in an extradimensional space accessible\
  \ only upon command. (A typical blank, 50-page journal costs 10 gp.)\nOnce per day,\
  \ when another book, folio, scroll, or other text is placed within the satchel while\
  \ a blank book is hidden within the extradimensional space, the pages of the newly\
  \ added book are wiped blank (though the covers and bindings remain unchanged).\
  \ The entire contents of this book or scroll appear on the pages of the blank book\
  \ in the satchel's extradimensional pocket. The transfer takes 1 full round, and\
  \ if the process is interrupted, such as by either book being removed or the satchel\
  \ being significantly damaged, the text being copied is lost forever. If the blank\
  \ book is smaller in size (in number of pages for a book or number of inches for\
  \ a scroll) than the book to be stolen, the satchel doesn't transfer the contents,\
  \ and the text being copied is lost forever.\nA book thief's satchel can't transfer\
  \ magical writing (such as the pages of a wizard's spellbook, a magical scroll,\
  \ or a wondrous item). Attempts to do so fail immediately, neither erasing the book\
  \ to be copied nor copying any of the pages to the blank book."
