description: "This viscous, translucent green fluid is typically stored in a large\
  \ syringe. When injected into a mostly intact corpse of a Medium or smaller creature\
  \ that has been dead for no more than 1 day (time spent under effects like gentle\
  \ repose don't count against this time), the fluid gives the corpse a rudimentary\
  \ semblance of life, reactivating its nerves and muscle tissue. This causes the\
  \ corpse to reanimate and shamble around erratically for 1 minute. The result is\
  \ not an undead creature, nor is it a construct. The reanimated corpse remains utterly\
  \ lifeless and is driven only by muscular spasms that cause it shuffle 20 feet in\
  \ a random direction each round, gasping and blinking eerily as it goes. When the\
  \ corpse hits a solid barrier or is attacked, it stops moving. On its next turn,\
  \ roll 1d8 to determine where it goes next. On a 1, it continues forward in the\
  \ same direction it had been previously moving (or runs up against the same barrier).\
  \ On a 2, it turns 45º clockwise and heads in that direction; on a 3, it turns 90º\
  \ clockwise and heads in that direction; and so on. The corpse can't attack, doesn't\
  \ defend itself, and—as an object—has AC 10 and 12 hit points. Crafting a syringe\
  \ of reanimating fluid requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
