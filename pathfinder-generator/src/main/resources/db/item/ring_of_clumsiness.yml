description: "This ring operates exactly like a ring of feather falling. However,\
  \ it also makes the wearer clumsy. She takes a –4 penalty to Dexterity and has a\
  \ 20% chance of spell failure when trying to cast any arcane spell that has a somatic\
  \ component. (This chance of spell failure stacks with other arcane spell failure\
  \ chances.)"
