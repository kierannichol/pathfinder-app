description: "This brass timepiece can be wound with a small key, causing it to count\
  \ down until it reaches the end of its duration, at which point it emits a small\
  \ chime. Most dials have a maximum duration of 60 minutes, with each turn of a key\
  \ adding 10 minutes, though some are crafted with longer or shorter durations and\
  \ intervals."
