description: "These faintly glowing lozenges often come in a discrete brown pouch.\
  \ A single venombane lozenge lasts for 5 minutes after being placed in a creature's\
  \ mouth. During this time, the user gains a cumulative +1 alchemical bonus on saving\
  \ throws against poisons every minute for 5 minutes. At the end of the 5 minutes,\
  \ the lozenge dissolves and its effects end. If at any time the user becomes poisoned\
  \ while under the effects of a lozenge that has not dissolved, she can crush the\
  \ lozenge to immediately gain the benefits for 1 round as if it had lasted its full\
  \ duration. Using a lozenge in this way immediately ends the effect."
