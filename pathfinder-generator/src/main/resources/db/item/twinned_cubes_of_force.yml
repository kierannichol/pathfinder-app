description: "These cubes function as two cubes of force, except that when a face\
  \ on one cube is pressed, its counterpart creates the appropriate wall instead as\
  \ long as the distance between the cubes does not exceed 100 feet. Both cubes can\
  \ remain active even after being set down on the ground and abandoned."
