name: "Scroll of Hypnotic Pattern"
description: "A twisting pattern of subtle, shifting colors weaves through the air,\
  \ fascinating creatures within it. Roll 2d4 and add your caster level (maximum 10)\
  \ to determine the total number of HD of creatures affected. Creatures with the\
  \ fewest HD are affected first; and, among creatures with equal HD, those who are\
  \ closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient\
  \ to affect a creature are wasted. Affected creatures become fascinated by the pattern\
  \ of colors. Sightless creatures are not affected."
