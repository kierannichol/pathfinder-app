description: "This bag appears to be an ordinary sack. Detection for magical properties\
  \ makes it seem as if it were a bag of holding. The sack, however, is something\
  \ entirely different and more insidiousâ€”one of the feeding orifices of an extradimensional\
  \ creature.\nAny substance of animal or vegetable nature is subject to \"swallowing''\
  \ if thrust within the bag. The bag of devouring is 90% likely to ignore any initial\
  \ intrusion, but anytime thereafter that it senses living flesh within (such as\
  \ if someone reaches into the bag to pull something out), it is 60% likely to close\
  \ around the offending appendage and attempt to draw the whole victim in. The bag\
  \ has a +8 bonus on combat maneuver checks made to grapple. If it pins a creature,\
  \ it pulls the victim inside as a free action. The bag has a CMD of 18 for those\
  \ attempting to break free.\nThe bag can hold up to 30 cubic feet of matter. It\
  \ acts as a bag of holding type I, but each hour it has a 5% cumulative chance of\
  \ swallowing the contents and then spitting the stuff out in some nonspace or on\
  \ some other plane. Creatures drawn within are consumed in 1 round. The bag destroys\
  \ the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires\
  \ part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a wish, miracle, or true resurrection\
  \ spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature.\
  \ If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic."
