description: "A premium hookah is similar to a standard hookah, except it sports enough\
  \ hoses for up to eight adjacent creatures to use, and the bowl has three separate\
  \ compartments, each of which can store a different type of inhalable drug, alchemical\
  \ powder, or alchemical liquid. Each compartment can hold up to 3 doses of an inhalable\
  \ substance (so a premium hookah can hold up to 9 doses total). Consuming these\
  \ contents is still a move action. You can reload a single compartment as a move\
  \ action, or you can reload all three compartments as a full-round action."
