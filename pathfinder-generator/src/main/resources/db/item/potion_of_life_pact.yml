name: "Potion of Life Pact"
description: "You bind the life forces of the targets into a mystical pact. If any\
  \ target is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, that target automatically triggers\
  \ the power of the pact. The triggering target drains 1 hit point from all other\
  \ targets who have at least 1 hit point and are within 30 feet of the triggering\
  \ target; these hit points are applied to the triggering target as magical healing.\
  \ This healing can prevent the triggering creature from dying, if the attack would\
  \ cause the target's to have an amount of negative hit points equal to its Constitution\
  \ score. This healing cannot raise the triggering creature above 1 hit point; any\
  \ excess hit points drained from other targets are wasted."
