description: "A summoner wearing a ring of ectoplasmic invigoration can use his maker's\
  \ call class feature to absorb his eidolon (dismissing it in the process) instead\
  \ of bringing it to his side. He gains 2 temporary hit points per Hit Die of the\
  \ eidolon and the benefits of a lesser restoration spell. T he eidolon must still\
  \ be within range of his maker's call ability. Any temporary hit points gained fade\
  \ after 1 hour or when the eidolon is summoned again. A wearer with the transposition\
  \ ability can transport himself to the eidolon's square (still absorbing and dismissing\
  \ it) rather than calling the eidolon to him."
