description: "The Shard of Envy is made of shimmering green noqual. As long as the\
  \ Shard of Envy is carried, its owner can use dispel magic as a spell-like ability\
  \ once per day, gains a +2 insight bonus on saves versus abjuration spells and spell-like\
  \ abilities, and gains a +1 insight bonus to AC.\nCurse: The owner covets the success,\
  \ wealth, and appearance of all other creatures, and becomes sickened whenever she\
  \ is within 30 feet of any creature of the same race or character class as herself.\
  \ Physical contact with such a creature nauseates the owner for 2d6 rounds if she\
  \ fails a DC 20 Fortitude save."
destruction: "A shard of the Sihedron cannot be destroyed individually. Only by recombining\
  \ them into the Sihedron and then using that artifact's method of destruction can\
  \ one destroy the shards."
