description: "This small brass device is shaped like a compass or clock, and is designed\
  \ for travel on planes without magnetic poles or set geography. When activated via\
  \ a mechanical trigger, its geared arms rotate around to point toward the stronghold\
  \ of either the plane's ruler or the three closest approximations, as per planar\
  \ orientation, with the name or holy symbol of the entity in question appearing\
  \ on the arm. In addition, pressing a lever on the back side can cause the device\
  \ to switch over to a portal-finding function that acts as per locate portal, with\
  \ a range of 3 miles.\nPlanar guides are notoriously tricky to make, and most have\
  \ a 5% chance each time they're consulted of having their magic twisted to lead\
  \ the user astray, usually pointing toward a hazard (such as the lair of a dangerous\
  \ creature). This chance is cumulative each time the guide is consulted, but resets\
  \ to 5% as soon as the user encounters such a hazard. Planar guides without this\
  \ flaw are rare and can easily cost twice as much as the standard model. At the\
  \ same time, those with a higher percentage can be significantly cheaper, and are\
  \ sometimes even given away freely to Material Plane travelers by localsâ€”these last\
  \ generally direct the user to a specific hazard known by the giver."
