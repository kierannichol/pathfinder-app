description: "This broad-bladed +1 ghost touch nine-ring broadsword (Ultimate Combat\
  \ 131, or use longsword) is crafted of silvery-gray steel, with nine golden rings\
  \ threaded through its spine that glow with magical power. Streamers of blue and\
  \ purple silk hang from the sword's pommel.\nThe nine-fold spirit sword has 9 charges,\
  \ represented by its nine rings. As a swift action, the wielder can discharge the\
  \ energy in these rings to create one of three effects.\nBy expending 1 charge,\
  \ the wielder can add the undead bane special ability to the sword for 1 minute.\n\
  By expending 2 charges, the wielder can attempt to banish a creature possessing\
  \ another creature (such as a ghost possessing a creature with its malevolence ability)\
  \ with a successful hit on the possessed creature. The possessing creature must\
  \ succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be driven out of the body of the creature it is\
  \ possessing.\nBy expending 3 charges, the wielder can attempt to destroy a single\
  \ undead creature with a successful hit. The creature must succeed at a DC 17 Will\
  \ save or be utterly destroyed. Spell resistance does not apply against either the\
  \ banishing or destruction effect.\nEach ring holds 1 charge; when a charge is expended,\
  \ one ring stops glowing. The sword recharges 1 charge per week."
