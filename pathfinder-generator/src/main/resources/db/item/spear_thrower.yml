description: "This is little more than a handle with a cup, loop, or spur to hold\
  \ the butt of a dart, javelin, or shortspear. Using a spear-thrower to throw such\
  \ a weapon doubles the projectile's range increment. Setting a weapon into a spear-thrower\
  \ is a move action; by taking the Rapid Reload (spear-thrower) feat, you reduce\
  \ this to a free action."
