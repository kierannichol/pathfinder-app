description: "Often etched with images of spider webs or swampy vines, this sickly\
  \ green +1 seeking bolt transforms into sticky goo when it hits, entangling its\
  \ target and becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. In addition to the\
  \ bolt's damage, the target is entangled as if it had been hit by a tanglefoot bag."
