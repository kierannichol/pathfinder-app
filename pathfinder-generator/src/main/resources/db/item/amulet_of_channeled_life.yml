description: "This amulet consists of a pale translucent gem in a dull gray metal\
  \ setting etched with ancient runes. When worn by an individual with the negative\
  \ energy affinity racial trait, it alters the effects of positive energy on his\
  \ body. When targeted by positive energy that heals living creatures, the wearer\
  \ instead gains half the hit points the positive energy heals as temporary hit points.\
  \ These temporary hit points go away after 10 minutes. This effect does not stack\
  \ with life channel (see below) or other effects that convert healing positive energy\
  \ to temporary hit points.\nThis item does not actually transpose positive energy\
  \ into negative energy, it just affects the way the wearer's body reacts to positive\
  \ energy. Only a living creature can benefit from this amulet; it provides no benefit\
  \ to undead."
