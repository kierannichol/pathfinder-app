description: "This large, vermin-shaped medallion can crawl free from its setting\
  \ to heal the wearer's ills. On command, the vermin can animate to perform any function\
  \ allowable by the Heal skill on the wearer only. The vermin has a +12 bonus on\
  \ Heal checks for these purposes and acts as if it had unlimited uses of a healer's\
  \ kit (the circumstance bonus for using a healer's kit is factored into the vermin's\
  \ bonus on Heal checks). Alternatively, the vermin can aid a healer working to treat\
  \ the wearer. In this case, the vermin grants the healer a +10 circumstance bonus\
  \ on Heal checks for this purpose.\nBased on its type, the vermin also grants additional\
  \ benefits to the necklace that might affect creatures other than the wearer, as\
  \ described below.\nAnt: If the wearer's hit point total is negative, the vermin\
  \ automatically activates and, on the wearer's next turn, performs first aid (even\
  \ if the wearer is unconscious).\nCentipede: On command, the vermin can use the\
  \ Heal skill to provide long-term care for up to six creatures (which may or may\
  \ not include the wearer), as long as the targets remain within 30 feet of the wearer\
  \ for the duration of their rest. (This does not count as the wearer performing\
  \ long-term care on herself; therefore the vermin can include her in the long-term\
  \ care given.)\nLeech: Once per day on command, the vermin can suck impurities from\
  \ the blood. This ends any ongoing poison effect if the vermin succeeds at a Heal\
  \ skill check with a DC equal to the poison's saving throw DC. On a failure, the\
  \ wearer still receives a +4 competence bonus on her next saving throw against the\
  \ poison.\nMosquito: Once per day on command, the vermin can neutralize disease\
  \ in the blood. This ends any ongoing disease if the vermin succeeds at a Heal skill\
  \ check with a DC equal to the disease's saving throw DC. On a failure, the wearer\
  \ still receives a +4 competence bonus on her next saving throw against the disease.\n\
  Spider: Three times per day on command, the vermin can fire silk webbing over the\
  \ wounds of a creature within 30 feet. This allows the vermin to attempt a Heal\
  \ check to stabilize the creature or stop bleed damage at range."
