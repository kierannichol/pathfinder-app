description: "This pungent, tar-black armor polish comes in a small, circular tin.\
  \ The 1 dose contained in the tin is enough to apply to a single Medium suit of\
  \ armor or two Small suits of armor. Applying the polish takes 10 minutes, during\
  \ which time the user must visualize an alternative appearance for the armor to\
  \ take on, such as a normal set of clothes or another set of armor. After the polish\
  \ is applied, its noxious scent dissipates and the armor appears the way the user\
  \ visualized, as the glamered magic armor special ability. The armor maintains all\
  \ properties other than its physical appearance, including weight, armor check penalty,\
  \ and maximum Dexterity bonus. This effect remains for 24 hours before wearing off."
