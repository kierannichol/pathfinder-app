description: "This piece of technology is fashioned from the eye of a robot. Once\
  \ per hour as a standard action, a creature holding an oculus of magnetic fury can\
  \ target a single robot within 60 feet with a devastating electromagnetic pulse.\
  \ The robot takes 10d6 points of electricity damage and becomes helpless for 1 minute.\
  \ If the target succeeds at a DC 18 Will save, it takes half this damage and negates\
  \ the helpless effect. A robot rendered helpless by the pulse receives a new Will\
  \ save each round at the end of its turn to shake off the effect."
