description: "This thin vial of viscous purple fluid can be thrown at an ooze creature\
  \ as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. On a direct hit, the solution\
  \ causes an ooze creature to become bloated and turgid, suppressing its compression\
  \ ability and reducing the save DC of any constrict, engulf, and entrap attacks\
  \ made by the ooze by 2. Bloating solution also reduces an ooze creature's reach\
  \ by 5 feet for the purpose of determining when the ooze can make attacks of opportunity\
  \ (to a minimum reach of 0 feet). The effects of bloating solution last 1 minute.\
  \ An affected intelligent ooze creature can attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save as a\
  \ full-round action to end the effect early."
