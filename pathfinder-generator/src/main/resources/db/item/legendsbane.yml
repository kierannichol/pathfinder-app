description: "This +6 keen speed adamantine dagger was constructed in defiance of\
  \ the gods and their chosen mortal champions, for Legendsbane was created to slay\
  \ mythic creatures. Legendsbane bypasses all types of damage reduction, and deals\
  \ an additional 3d6 points of damage to mythic creatures and to non-mythic creatures\
  \ that have epic DR. This additional damage is multiplied for critical hits.\nNon-mythic\
  \ characters can wield Legendsbane normally. However, when a mythic character first\
  \ attempts to wield the dagger, she must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or suffer\
  \ the effects of a destruction spell. If the mythic character survives, she can\
  \ wield the dagger normally.\nLegendsbane imparts upon its wielder the ability to\
  \ track down mythic creatures she has hunted before. At will, the wielder can cast\
  \ locate creature to find a specific mythic creature known to the wielder."
destruction: "Legendsbane can be destroyed if it's anointed in the blood of a slain\
  \ 10th-rank mythic creature and then struck three times by a vorpal weapon. This\
  \ act also destroys the vorpal weapon."
