description: "This wayfinder is made of magically hardened glass, through which the\
  \ complex inner matrix of the compass can be seen. Once per day, the wielder of\
  \ a wayfinder of the planes can choose one of the following alignments: chaotic,\
  \ evil, good, or lawful. For 1 hour thereafter, the wayfinder of the planes creates\
  \ a magic circle effect against the chosen alignment, centered on the wayfinder.\
  \ Once selected, the alignment of the magic circle effect can't be changed until\
  \ the effect recharges the next day."
