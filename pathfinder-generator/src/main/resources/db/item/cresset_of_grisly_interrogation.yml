description: "This small iron cage is engraved with dozens of ancient funerary runes.\
  \ On opposing sides of the cage frame, two large bolts can be adjusted to hold a\
  \ humanoid head in a stationary position within. When a head is placed inside and\
  \ the command word is spoken, you can sequester information from it as if it were\
  \ under the effect of a speak with dead spell. The cage can coerce three answers\
  \ per day, which do not need to be from the same head or asked in a limited period\
  \ of time (for example, you could ask a kobold's head a question in the morning,\
  \ an orc's head a question in the afternoon, and an ogre's head a question in the\
  \ evening)."
