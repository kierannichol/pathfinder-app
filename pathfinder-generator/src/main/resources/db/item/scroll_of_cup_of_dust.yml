name: "Scroll of Cup of Dust"
description: "You curse the target with a thirst no drink can quench. On a failed\
  \ saving throw, the target begins to dehydrate. The effects of this spell cannot\
  \ inflict more nonlethal damage than the target has hit points. No amount of drinking\
  \ can counter this effect, although the target still experiences the other normal\
  \ effects of any liquid imbibed (such as poisons or potions). Cup of dustcan be\
  \ removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wishspell,\
  \ but effects suffered as a result of dehydration must be healed by normal means."
