description: "This simple white candle gives off a pleasing aroma of moonflowers.\
  \ Any creature within 10 feet of the candle's flame begins to feel drowsy, gradually\
  \ growing sleepier. Every 10 minutes, each such creature must succeed at a DC 14\
  \ Will save or fall into a normal sleep. On each check after the first, a creature\
  \ takes a cumulative –2 penalty. Even with a successful saving throw, a creature\
  \ is not aware that it succeeded at its saving throw, though it can potentially\
  \ deduce the presence of a soporific effect—for instance, if its allies start falling\
  \ asleep.\nExtinguishing the flame ends the magical effect but does not wake sleeping\
  \ creatures. The candle can burn for a total of 3 hours; this duration doesn't need\
  \ to be consecutive, but must be used in 1-hour increments. Once all 3 hours are\
  \ used, the candle is destroyed."
