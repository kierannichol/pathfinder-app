description: "Crystal baubles that resemble insect wings line the edge of this luxurious\
  \ but fraying cloak. The garment was once a cloak of displacement, but the harbinger\
  \ spirit trapped within has warped and twisted it—now it offers false hope rather\
  \ than security. The Shroud of Flies grants its wearer a +2 profane bonus to Constitution\
  \ and +4 resistance bonus on Reflex and Will saves, but imposes a –6 penalty on\
  \ Fortitude saves against disease.\nThree times per day, the wearer can brush another\
  \ creature with the shawl to remove all lingering effects caused by a disease, poison,\
  \ or curse, as per break enchantment, remove curse, or remove disease. These effects\
  \ are not eliminated, and return immediately with all accrued penalties after 24\
  \ hours. Any creature embraced in this way must immediately succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude\
  \ save or be infected with one of the following diseases: blinding sickness, cackle\
  \ fever, devil chills, or leprosy. Any creature the wearer touches while offering\
  \ medical aid, such as casting cure spells, administering a potion, or using the\
  \ Heal skill, must likewise succeed at this Fortitude save or become infected.\n\
  The Shroud of Flies can be wielded as a net as well, but only against daemons. Any\
  \ creature that has worn the shroud for at least 24 hours is considered proficient\
  \ in its use as a weapon."
destruction: "While wearing the Shroud of Flies, a creature must infect itself with\
  \ seven distinct plagues, then bathe in the cosmic fires of creation on the Positive\
  \ Energy Plane."
