description: "Each Godclaw gauntlet is a +2 axiomatic spiked gauntlet. Once per day,\
  \ the left Godclaw gauntlet can be used to cast a quickened order's wrath spell,\
  \ while the right Godclaw gauntlet can be used to cast a quickened dismissal spell.\n\
  If a character wears both Godclaw gauntlets, he gains the benefit of Two-Weapon\
  \ Fighting while attacking with the gauntlets (but not with other weapons he might\
  \ wield). In addition, once per day, the wearer can request the aid of one of five\
  \ deities and cast a specific spell, as detailed below. Note that calling upon the\
  \ aid of a deity of a different alignment than your own or the aid of a deity other\
  \ than the one you worship (if you are a divine spellcaster who worships a specific\
  \ deity) may have alignment- or class-based repercussions.\nAbadar: The wearer gains\
  \ the benefit of discern lies.\nAsmodeus: The wearer creates a wall of fire.\nIomedae:\
  \ The wearer gains the benefit of divine power.\nIrori: The wearer gains the benefit\
  \ of freedom of movement.\nTorag: The wearer gains the benefit of stoneskin."
destruction: "A Godclaw gauntlet must be brought to the Worldwound or the Abyss by\
  \ a Hellknight of the Godclaw, who must then allow a demon of at least CR 15 or\
  \ higher to bite off and consume both gauntlet and hand alike."
