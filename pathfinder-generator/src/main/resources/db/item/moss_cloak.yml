description: "A tangled layer of green moss grown on a thin, damp sheet of sod, this\
  \ heavy cloak can be wrapped around the wearer to provide a measure of camouflage.\
  \ When donned in forest or jungle terrain, a moss cloak gives its wearer a +10 competence\
  \ bonus on Stealth checks. In any terrain, the wearer can remove a single poison\
  \ currently affecting him once per day as a standard action. This causes the moss\
  \ to turn a sickly shade of brown as it draws the toxins from the wearer's body,\
  \ negating the Stealth bonus until the cloak heals itself 24 hours later."
