description: "A lesser version of the elixir of fire breath, a gourd of fire burping\
  \ can be imbibed as a normal elixir or, in the case of a user with a large enough\
  \ mouth and low enough standards, be completely consumed in one crunchy gulp. Once\
  \ the user has consumed the gourd, she can immediately expel a belch of fire in\
  \ a 15-foot cone, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage to all creatures in the area.\
  \ A successful DC 12 Reflex save halves the damage. If the user elects not to use\
  \ the fire breath at once, she can store the breath for up to an hour before it\
  \ dissipates."
