description: "This suit of +1 spiked half-plate armor is crafted from the hide and\
  \ carapace of a xill (Bestiary 283) and includes a xill-skull helmet complete with\
  \ insectlike mandibles, giving the wearer an otherworldly, buglike appearance. Once\
  \ per day, the wearer can shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane and\
  \ back again, as the etherealness magic armor special ability. Unlike with standard\
  \ etherealness armor, however, the transitions to and from planes function exactly\
  \ like a xill's planewalk ability, save that the wearer cannot take any creatures\
  \ with it when it switches planes.\nAdditionally, the spikes along the armor's back,\
  \ torso, arms, and upper legs are laced with a natural paralytic. The target of\
  \ a successful critical hit made with these armor spikes is paralyzed for 1d4 rounds\
  \ (Fortitude DC 16 negates)."
