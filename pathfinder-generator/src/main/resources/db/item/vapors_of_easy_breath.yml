description: "This waxy ball of resin and herbs is stored in a large glass jar or\
  \ other airtight container. When the jar is opened, it instantly evaporates into\
  \ a soothing vapor that renders the lungs of any adjacent creatures resistant to\
  \ inhaled poisons, diseases, and irritants such as choking smoke. Each creature\
  \ within 5 feet of the jar when it is opened gains a +5 alchemical bonus on saving\
  \ throws against such effects for the next 10 minutes. If already affected by an\
  \ airborne affliction, an affected creature can immediately attempt another saving\
  \ throw against the effect (with the +5 bonus); a creature can attempt only one\
  \ such additional saving throw in a 24-hour period."
