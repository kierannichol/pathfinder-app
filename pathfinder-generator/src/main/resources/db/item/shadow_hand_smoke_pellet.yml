description: "This delicate metallic shell contains two sets of volatile alchemical\
  \ substances, similar to those used in smoke pellets. When the sphere is broken,\
  \ the substances mingle and fill a 10-foot cube with a cloud of dark gray smoke\
  \ that lasts for 1 minute. The user can throw the pellet as a ranged touch attack\
  \ with an increment of 10 feet. Partially tangible hands of smoke accost creatures\
  \ in the cloud. These hands attempt to grapple anyone moving through the smoke (CMB\
  \ +7). Upon successfully grappling an opponent, the hands attempt to maintain the\
  \ grapple every round until the smoke dissipates."
