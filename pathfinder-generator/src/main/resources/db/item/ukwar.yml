description: "Ukwar is a +1 conductive battleaxe infused with the angry spirit of\
  \ a Deadwatcher orc leader named Ukwar. After perishing in Scarwall and rising soon\
  \ thereafter as a fext, Ukwar spent decades longing to be free of her curse. When\
  \ she is permanently slain, her spirit enters her axe. As long as the PCs continue\
  \ to adventure in Scarwall, she doesn't attempt to exert influence over her wielder—\
  she wants to see each and every one of Scarwall's denizens suffer. If her wielder\
  \ spends more than 1 day outside of Scarwall (and the castle remains cursed), she\
  \ attempts to take control and force her wielder to return and finish this job.\n\
  As long as Ukwar remains intelligent, the blade grants weapon proficiency with the\
  \ battleaxe to her wielder. If the wielder is already proficient with battleaxes,\
  \ he instead gains a +1 bonus on all attack rolls and damage rolls made with Ukwar.\
  \ She imposes negative levels on nonchaotic evil wielders only when they are outside\
  \ of Scarwall. She can cast rage once per day, and does so on her wielder the first\
  \ time each day he attacks one of the spirit anchors or the chained spirit—she can\
  \ be convinced to cast rage on her wielder at another time with a successful DC\
  \ 20 Diplomacy or Intimidate check (a standard action)."
