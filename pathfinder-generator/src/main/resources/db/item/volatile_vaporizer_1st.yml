description: "This lime green pill is inedible but turns a potion into a cloud of\
  \ mist that can be shared by multiple creatures. When placed inside a potion flask,\
  \ the potion bubbles and froths itself into a pungent 10-foot-radius cloud. Any\
  \ creature within the cloud when it appears gains the full effect of the potion.\
  \ The cloud has no effect on creatures that cannot breathe. A creature may automatically\
  \ resist the effects of the potion cloud by momentarily holding its breath. Using\
  \ the pill destroys it and the potion. Each pill can only be used on potions of\
  \ a particular spell level; using it on a potion of a different spell level has\
  \ no effect (neither the potion nor the pill are consumed). The vaporizer also works\
  \ on alchemist infusions, but not mutagens, extracts, or magical oils."
