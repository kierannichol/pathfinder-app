description: "Blackaxe is a Huge +5 plant bane greataxe which is considered epic and\
  \ can penetrate epic damage reduction. Virulent acid constantly seeps from its blade,\
  \ dealing +1d6 points of acid damage on a successful hit. On a successful critical\
  \ hit, Blackaxe deals an additional +2d10 points of acid damage. Once per minute,\
  \ the weapon's wielder can use heal on herself by striking a living and nonmagical\
  \ tree with Blackaxe, causing the tree to wither to ash. The artifact is inexorably\
  \ tied to the nascent demon lord Treerazer, who can call Blackaxe to his hand as\
  \ a free action, despite any intervening distance, so long as Blackaxe is not kept\
  \ in an area that prevents teleportation effects from occurring. While Blackaxe\
  \ is wielded by another creature, Treerazer always knows that creature's location\
  \ and condition (as via the discern location and status spells), and by concentrating\
  \ can observe the world around the wielder as if using that wielder's senses. While\
  \ in this state, Treerazer may use any of his spell-like abilities through the link,\
  \ treating Blackaxe as if it were the source of the spelllike ability. Each time\
  \ Treerazer does so, Blackaxe's wielder must make a successful DC 25 Will save to\
  \ avoid being staggered for 1 round from the flow of power. These spelllike abilities\
  \ trigger during the wielder's turn in initiative, but do not consume any of the\
  \ wielder's actions in that round."
destruction: "In order to destroy Blackaxe, the weapon must be used against a powerful\
  \ magical tree, and while the sap on the blade is still fresh it must then be used\
  \ to sever one of the demon lord Cyth-V'sug's many fungoid limbs. Doing so causes\
  \ Blackaxe to explode in a burst of obsidian shrapnel and acid that deals 20d6 points\
  \ of acid damage and 20d6 points of piercing damage to all within a 60-foot burst\
  \ (DC 30 Reflex save for half)."
