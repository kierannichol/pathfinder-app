description: "This appears to be a typical arrow container capable of holding about\
  \ 20 arrows. It has three distinct portions, each with a nondimensional space allowing\
  \ it to store far more than would normally be possible. The first and smallest one\
  \ can contain up to 60 objects of the same general size and shape as an arrow. The\
  \ second slightly longer compartment holds up to 18 objects of the same general\
  \ size and shape as a javelin. The third and longest portion of the case contains\
  \ as many as 6 objects of the same general size and shape as a bow (spears, staffs,\
  \ or the like). Once the owner has filled it, the quiver can quickly produce any\
  \ item she wishes that is within the quiver, as if from a regular quiver or scabbard.\
  \ The efficient quiver weighs the same no matter what's placed inside it."
