description: "This immense bag is always full of hefty, good-sized rocks and can be\
  \ carried over the shoulder or on the belt of a Large or larger creature, though\
  \ doing so does not take up an item slot. On command as a swift action, a Large\
  \ or larger creature wearing the boulder bag can reach into the bag and pull out\
  \ a rock two size categories smaller than itself that is suitable for use of the\
  \ rock throwing ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 303). No matter how many rocks\
  \ are taken out, the bag never empties. Furthermore, if a boulder-shaped alchemical\
  \ item (such as the fiery boulder presented in this article) is placed in the bag,\
  \ it takes up no weight within the bag, and can also be drawn on command as a swift\
  \ action, as if it were one of the rocks the bag normally produces."
