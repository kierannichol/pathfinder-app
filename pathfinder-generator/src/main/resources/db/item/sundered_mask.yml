description: "This mask is a representation of Nethys's own. Activating the mask charges\
  \ it with healing power. If a member of Nethys' faith wears the mask when it is\
  \ activated, the first time the wearer takes damage, the mask releases the stored\
  \ energy into the wearer, healing a number of hit points equal to the number of\
  \ dice of the activating cleric's channel energy ability. The mask heals its wearer\
  \ regardless of the type of channeled energy used and whether the target is living\
  \ or undead. This healing does not prevent the wearer from dying because of hit\
  \ point damage, and is mainly used to provide instant healing when a cleric is occupied\
  \ or can only channel a harmful kind of energy. The mask remains charged until it\
  \ heals someone or 24 hours pass."
