description: "This turbid blue, teardrop-shaped devil talisman binds a particular\
  \ devil to a specific location, trapping the fiend in a manner similar to planar\
  \ binding but without the need for a magic circle and with no chance of the devil\
  \ escaping. Once bound, the devil cannot move farther than 100 feet from the location\
  \ it is bound to, and the devil is considered helpful toward the talisman's wearer\
  \ for the purposes of any request related to the location it is bound to (thus negating\
  \ the need for an opposed Charisma check to convince the bound devil to perform\
  \ such a service). A creature must be wearing the phlegmatic talisman to make requests\
  \ of the bound devil.\nWhen within 100 feet of each other, the wearer of the phlegmatic\
  \ talisman and the devil bound to it cannot attack or take offensive actions against\
  \ one another, even if magically influenced (such as by charm monster or dominate\
  \ monster). In addition, when within 100 feet of each other, the wearer and the\
  \ bound devil each gain a +4 profane bonus on Will saves against spells and effects\
  \ that possess or exercise mental control over a creature (including effects with\
  \ the charm or compulsion descriptors).\nA phlegmatic talisman is crafted to bind\
  \ a specific devil, and is not capable of binding any other creature. Any mortal\
  \ who meets the construction requirements can craft a phlegmatic talisman as long\
  \ as she knows the true name of the devil to be bound to the talisman, which must\
  \ be spoken during the item's creation. In order to finally bind the devil to the\
  \ talisman, the wearer of the talisman must touch the talisman to the devil in the\
  \ location the devil will be bound to (so the wearer and the devil must both be\
  \ physically present in the binding location) and speak the devil's true name. If\
  \ the devil bound to a phlegmatic talisman is destroyed on the same plane as the\
  \ talisman, the talisman breaks and loses its magic. Conversely, if the phlegmatic\
  \ talisman binding the devil is destroyed, the devil is freed.\nArchbaron Fex's\
  \ phlegmatic talisman is tied to the heresy devil Visperthul (see page 53) and was\
  \ crafted to bind Visperthul to the Inferno Gate (see area Q16)."
