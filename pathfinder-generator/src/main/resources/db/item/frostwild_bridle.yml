description: "When this bridle of crystal-studded white leather is placed on a horse\
  \ or similar mount, the animal's eyes emit a bright azure glow and its hair glistens\
  \ with magical frost. A frostwild bridle provides cold resistance 20 to its wearer.\
  \ Also, three times per day on the rider's command, the animal wearing a frostwild\
  \ bridle can breathe a 60-foot cone of frost that deals 9d6 points of cold damage\
  \ to all creatures in the area. A successful DC 17 Reflex save halves the damage."
