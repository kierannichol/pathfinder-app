name: "Scroll of Conjure Black Pudding"
description: "You summon a black pudding that immediately attacks creatures near it.\
  \ You have no control over the creature, and it may attack you if there are no more\
  \ obvious opponents. The black pudding is treated as a summoned creature and has\
  \ the extraplanar subtype. The black pudding's split ability works normally, but\
  \ all puddings derived from the summoned one disappear when the spell ends."
