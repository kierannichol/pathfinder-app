description: "This yellowish gray powder is composed of grave dirt and ground snakeskin.\
  \ The user spreads the dust in two 5-foot squares, typically across doorways frequented\
  \ by the intended victims—this takes 1d4 rounds to accomplish.\nA creature stepping\
  \ into an area warded by desiccating dust must make a DC 19 Fortitude save to avoid\
  \ suddenly becoming horrifically thirsty and wracked with pain, taking 5d6 points\
  \ of nonlethal damage, and immediately becoming fatigued. The nonlethal damage caused\
  \ by this effect cannot be healed until the creature can drink some water. A creature\
  \ that remains in an area warded by desiccating dust need not make additional saves\
  \ to avoid the effect, but if it steps out of the area, it must save again as soon\
  \ as it reenters the warded area. A creature already taking nonlethal damage or\
  \ fatigue from desiccating dust suffers no additional ill effect from passing through\
  \ an area protected by this magical dust. Once a dose of desiccating dust is applied\
  \ to an area, that area remains warded by the effect for 24 hours."
