description: "A scintillating garment can become either a tight-fitting tunic of any\
  \ style or a long, tight dress of any cut. It appears to be made of mist and shimmering\
  \ silks, hinting at the form and color of the skin beneath without revealing it.\
  \ When worn, it gives any successful Diplomacy check made by the wearer the chance\
  \ to increase one target's attitude by one additional step. The wearer chooses a\
  \ single target affected by her Diplomacy check to make a DC 13 Will save. If the\
  \ target fails, his attitude improves by one step above the attitude indicated by\
  \ the check. If the target succeeds, he is unaffected by the garment but his attitude\
  \ is still adjusted by the successful Diplomacy check as normal. Any target that\
  \ successfully saves against the garment's effects is immune to its magic for 24\
  \ hours. A scintillating garment has no affect on a failed Diplomacy check."
