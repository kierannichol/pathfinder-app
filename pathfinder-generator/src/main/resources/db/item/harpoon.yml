description: "A harpoon is a barbed spear with an attached rope 50 feet or less in\
  \ length. Most harpoons have metal points, but some use ivory or are made entirely\
  \ of wood. If you are proficient with the harpoon, it is a grappling weapon. A harpoon's\
  \ weight includes 10 pounds for the weight of 50 feet of hemp rope. The weight can\
  \ be reduced by using shorter or lighter rope. If you are not proficient with a\
  \ harpoon, treat it like a spear."
