description: "These fine dresses are delicately woven with magically preserved and\
  \ layered leaves. The dresses were originally commissioned for elven diplomats who\
  \ often interacted with gnomes and other members of Small races, but their use has\
  \ spread across Avistan. A Medium humanoid who takes 1 interrupted minute to don\
  \ a gown of graceful petitenes is, at the end of that time, immediately reduced\
  \ to Small size. This acts as reduce person, except that it does not grant a size\
  \ bonus to Dexterity or resize items on the wearer's person other than the gown\
  \ itself. Taking off the gown also requires 1 interrupted minute and returns the\
  \ gown and its wearer to their original sizes."
