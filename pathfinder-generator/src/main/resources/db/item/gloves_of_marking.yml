description: "These ruddy leather gloves enhance the precision of the wearer. When\
  \ wielding a piercing or slashing weapon and using Weapon Finesse, the wearer can\
  \ mark a creature when confirming a critical hit instead of dealing additional damage.\
  \ The mark consists of a simple symbol, such as a single letter.\nThe wielder and\
  \ her allies gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and melee damage rolls against\
  \ the marked creature for 1 minute. In addition, the marked creature must succeed\
  \ at a Will saving throw (DC 10 + one-half the wielder's level + the wielder's Dexterity\
  \ modifier) or be shaken for 1 minute. The bonuses and condition persist even if\
  \ the damage caused by the mark is healed."
