description: "This wreath weaves garlic, wolfsbane, silver, and mandrake together\
  \ to create a fetish capable of blocking nearly any type of creature.\nOnce placed\
  \ over a doorway or other entrance, a threshold guardian prevents access by a specified\
  \ type of creature. The user placing the wreath must spend 10 minutes concentrating\
  \ on one creature type (or subtype in the case of humanoids and outsiders) from\
  \ the list of ranger favored enemies. Afterward, any creature of the chosen type\
  \ or subtype trying to pass through the doorway (or another opening within 10 feet\
  \ of the wreath) must attempt a DC 19 Will save. If the creature succeeds, it can\
  \ move in and out without hindrance, but if it fails, it can't move through the\
  \ guarded threshold while the threshold guardian remains.\nWhen a user places the\
  \ threshold guardian, she can choose whether to block the chosen creature type or\
  \ subtype in one direction or in both directions. A creature that attempts to cross\
  \ the threshold several times doesn't receive additional saving throws; the results\
  \ of the first saving throw stand as long as the threshold guardian is undisturbed,\
  \ with no other limit on duration. Removing or destroying the threshold guardian\
  \ (hardness 5, 10 hp) removes the effect. Creatures other than the one that placed\
  \ a threshold guardian can't touch the threshold guardian, even with another held\
  \ object, unless they succeed at a DC 19 Will save. Creatures can still attack the\
  \ wreath with ranged attacks, though if placed cleverly, the wreath could have total\
  \ cover from such attacks. Destroying the doorway on which it hangs causes the threshold\
  \ guardian to cease functioning immediately."
