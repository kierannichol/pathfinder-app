description: "This exquisitely crafted wayfinder bears the design of a halfclosed\
  \ eye in platinum and mithral. The eye is a socket for an ioun stone; when filled,\
  \ you may activate the wayfinder when you sleep or meditate to create a mobile illusory\
  \ image of yourself that is partly real.\nYou control the image as if it were your\
  \ own body and perceive things through it as if it had all of your normal senses\
  \ plus darkvision with a range of 60 feet. You do not need to maintain line of sight\
  \ to the image. The image is visible but transparent, and it cannot perform any\
  \ action that an unseen servant is unable to perform. The image has 40% of your\
  \ hit points at the time it was created. Its AC is 10 + your size modifier + your\
  \ Dexterity modifier. It uses your current Will saving throw bonus but automatically\
  \ fails Fortitude and Reflex saves. It is destroyed if brought to 0 hit points,\
  \ which deals you 2d4 points of Charisma damage. It can be dispelled, and cannot\
  \ enter areas warded against summoned creatures, your alignment, illusions, or incorporeal\
  \ creatures. You may end this ability as a free action, and it ends automatically\
  \ if you are awakened, your body is attacked, or 8 hours pass; ending the image\
  \ in this manner does not deal you Charisma damage.\nUsing this ability drains energy\
  \ from the slotted ioun stone, rendering it dull gray and powerless for 24 hours.\
  \ A dull gray ioun stone cannot power the projection ability of this wayfinder.\
  \ The wayfinder can still have synergistic powers granted by an ioun stone, though\
  \ they do not function while the slotted stone is powerless."
