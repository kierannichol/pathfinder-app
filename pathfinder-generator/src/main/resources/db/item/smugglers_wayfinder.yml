description: "This time-weathered wayfinder lacks any notable features. Despite its\
  \ routine appearance, a smuggler's wayfinder has an additional ability generally\
  \ known only to the person using it. When a command word is spoken, the compass's\
  \ interior is replaced with a small extradimensional space that can hold up to 10\
  \ pounds of material occupying no more than 1 cubic foot of space. This material\
  \ must be able to fit through the 3-inch-diameter opening in the compass's face\
  \ (such as a thin glass vial, coins, small jewelry, or a rolled-up piece of paper).\
  \ While the extradimensional space is accessible, all other properties of the wayfinder\
  \ cease to function, including any resonant ioun stone powers. While the extradimensional\
  \ space is hidden, the smuggler's wayfinder emits an aura of faint evocation, as\
  \ a standard wayfinder."
