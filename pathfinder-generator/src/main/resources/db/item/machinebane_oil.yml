description: "This vial of shimmering violet unguent is an effective weapon against\
  \ constructs crafted from metal. A creature can throw the vial at a construct as\
  \ a ranged touch attack with a range of 20 feet. On a hit, the oil immediately penetrates\
  \ the metal construct and wreaks havoc on its inner workings. The construct must\
  \ succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or become staggered for the next 5 rounds. If the\
  \ construct fails the initial save, it must attempt an additional save at the beginning\
  \ of its turn for the next 5 rounds, taking 2 points of Dexterity damage on each\
  \ failure. A construct struck by machinebane oil immediately loses the benefits\
  \ of energizing salve."
