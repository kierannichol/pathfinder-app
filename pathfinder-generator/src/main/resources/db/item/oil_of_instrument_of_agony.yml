description: "You cause a weapon to exude a palpable aura of divine fury. While wielding\
  \ this weapon, a creature gains a +2 morale bonus on Intimidate checks. When an\
  \ attack made using the targeted weapon hits, the wielder can spend a free action\
  \ to discharge the effect to inflict agony on the creature the weapon hit. If that\
  \ creature has spell resistance, it applies against this effect. If the creature\
  \ fails a Will save, it is nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds. If it succeeds at the saving\
  \ throw, the creature is instead sickened for 1 round. The sickened condition created\
  \ by the instrument is a mind-affecting effect."
