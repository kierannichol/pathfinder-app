description: "While in the hands of a non-mythic creature, a witherfang functions\
  \ as a +3 kukri. However, over time it begins to consume the life essence of its\
  \ wielder. If the wielder is nonmythic, each week he must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude\
  \ save or take 1d4 points of Constitution drain that can't be healed until 1 week\
  \ after he stops wielding the weapon. The witherfang then converts the stolen life\
  \ essence into mythic power. A witherfang can hold a maximum of 20 uses of mythic\
  \ power.\nA mythic character can use a witherfang's stolen mythic power to activate\
  \ her own mythic abilities or to enhance the blade with the following abilities:\
  \ bane, dancing, speed, and wounding. Each ability lasts for 24 hours, and only\
  \ one can be applied to the blade within each 24-hour period. The wielder can increase\
  \ the witherfang's enhancement bonus by 1 for each use of mythic power she expends.\
  \ Alternately, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to imbue the blade\
  \ with the bane special ability, two uses to imbue it with the wounding special\
  \ ability, three uses to imbue it with the speed special ability, or four uses to\
  \ imbue it with the dancing special ability."
destruction: "A witherfang permanently loses its magical properties if plunged deep\
  \ into the heart of a non-mythic humanoid that no longer possesses a soul."
