description: "Three faces representing the threefold aspect of womanhood—maiden, mother,\
  \ and crone—adorn this solid silver ring. Baba Yaga crafted the Artrosa Ring for\
  \ her chosen warden of the sacred site of Artrosa, and it functions as a ring of\
  \ protection +2 and a ring of regeneration.\nWithin 15 miles of Artrosa's towering\
  \ figures, the Artrosa Ring also grants its wearer the following abilities.\nQuicksilver:\
  \ The wearer can teleport to any location inside Artrosa's dungeons or within a\
  \ 15-mile radius of Artrosa. Any location in this area is considered \"very familiar.\"\
  \nSeer: By concentrating for 10 minutes, the wearer can see and hear everything\
  \ that transpires in a single chamber inside Artrosa, as if using clairaudience/clairvoyance.\n\
  Shroud: Three times per day, the wearer can alter the appearance of a single room\
  \ within one of Artrosa's dungeons, as well as the appearance of any creatures inside\
  \ the room, as with mirage arcana and veil. The wearer must be present in the room\
  \ to use this ability, and the illusions fade as soon as the wearer leaves the room.\n\
  Threefold Aspect: Whenever the wearer enters one of Artrosa's dungeons, her age\
  \ and appearance shift to match that of the corresponding dungeon (maiden, mother,\
  \ or crone) as if affected by the threefold aspect spell. If the wearer moves to\
  \ a different dungeon, her age and appearance change accordingly. The wearer doesn't\
  \ gain additional skill ranks, and a spellcaster doesn't gain any additional bonus\
  \ spells for her increased ability scores, but the save DCs for her spells do increase.\
  \ Outside these dungeons, the wearer returns to her natural age and appearance.\
  \ The wearer has no control over this ability—it automatically takes effect whenever\
  \ the wearer enters one of Artrosa's dungeons.\nVision: If the wearer is a witch\
  \ of at least 10th level, she gains access to the vision major hex and can use it\
  \ as if she had it as a normal class feature.\nOutside of Artrosa, the Artrosa Ring\
  \ loses all of the above abilities except its function as a ring of protection +2\
  \ and a ring of regeneration. In addition, the wearer can use the ring to cast threefold\
  \ aspect once per day."
destruction: "The Artrosa Ring must be bathed in the light of Golarion's moon for\
  \ 3 separate nights—once during the waxing moon, once during the full moon, and\
  \ once during the waning moon. If the ring is then struck with Kostchtchie's adamantine\
  \ warhammer in the Eon Pit in Artrosa on the night of the new moon, the Artrosa\
  \ Ring is destroyed."
