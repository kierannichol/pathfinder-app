description: "This thick hide cloak grants its wearer the divided mind of a skeltercat.\
  \ While worn, the cloak imparts a +1 resistance bonus on Fortitude and Reflex saves\
  \ and a +2 resistance bonus on Will saves. In addition, once per round, the wearer\
  \ can reroll the percentile dice when determining her actions while confused and\
  \ choose the desired result. Once the cloak is donned, the wearer cannot speak or\
  \ write; she can communicate only in unintelligible growls. The wearer still understands\
  \ language as normal.\nIf the wearer suffers from one or more permanent mental afflictions\
  \ that alter her behavior, such as insanity or the effects of a helm of opposite\
  \ alignment, for 15 minutes per day she can function as if unaffected by these conditions.\
  \ This time does not need to be used all at once, but must be used in 1-minute increments."
