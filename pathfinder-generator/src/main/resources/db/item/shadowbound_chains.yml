description: "Jagged and spiked, this +1 vicious viridium spiked chain shifts between\
  \ hues of muted green and deep violet. Wielders who are devout followers of Zon-Kuthon\
  \ are immune to the disease imparted by the viridium.\nWhen the wielder reduces\
  \ a creature's hit points below 0 using the chain but doesn't kill it, she can call\
  \ a shadowy duplicate of the target as a free action. This duplicate is treated\
  \ as a shadow (Bestiary 245) without the create spawn ability. The duplicate is\
  \ friendly to the wielder and attacks her enemies, but ignores its host body. The\
  \ host can't benefit from any healing that would bring it above â€“1 hit points until\
  \ the shadow is destroyed or disappears. The shadow fades away when the host body\
  \ dies or after 10 rounds, whichever comes first. The wielder of the shadowbound\
  \ chains can summon forth only one shadow at a time."
