description: "This bronze +2 scimitar bears an eagle motif on its pommel, and allows\
  \ the user to soar through the air to deliver his attacks. As a free action, the\
  \ wielder can fly without having to maintain concentration, as if affected by the\
  \ fly spell for up to 20 rounds each day, with a +5 bonus on Fly checks. These rounds\
  \ need not be consecutive. In addition, as long as the scimitar is in hand, the\
  \ wielder can use feather fall at will."
