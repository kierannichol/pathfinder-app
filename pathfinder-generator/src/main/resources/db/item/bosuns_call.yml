  \ while opening and closing one's hand over the hole to modify the pitch. The whistle\
  \ has 3 charges, which are automatically restored at sunrise each day. As a standard\
  \ action, the user can attempt a Perform (wind) check and expend the indicated number\
  \ of charges to produce one of the following effects.\n0 charges: Wake all allies\
  \ within 30 feet (DC 15).\n1 charge: Wake all allies aboard the same ship (DC 20).\n\
  1 charge: Convey a secret message to all allies within 60 feet, as the Bluff skill\
  \ (DC 20).\n1 charge: Perform a countersong as the bardic performance ability, with\
  \ a +2 bonus on the Perform (wind) check (DC 20).\n2 charges: Grant up to six allies,\
  \ no two of whom can be more than 30 feet apart, climb and swim speeds of 20 feet\
  \ each for 4 rounds (DC 20).\n2 charges: Grant all allies within 60 feet a +5 morale\
  \ bonus on Swim checks for 10 minutes (DC 25).\nThe charge is expended even if the\
  \ Perform check fails.\nA user of the bosun's call who has the bardic performance\
  \ class feature can, as a swift action, expend a number of rounds of bardic performance\
  \ equal to the number of charges needed to produce the effect instead of expending\
  \ those charges."
