description: "This wooden atlatl resembles a handheld, lever-controlled catapult.\
  \ One end sports a shaft covered in carvings of alchemical formulae, and the other\
  \ is a roughly carved bowl. The user can place an alchemical splash weapon, such\
  \ as a flask of acid or alchemist's fire, in the bowl. This is a move action that\
  \ provokes an attack of opportunity. When the splash weapon is launched from the\
  \ atlatl, its range is doubled. Magic items (including an alchemist's bombs) aren't\
  \ affected by an alchemist's atlatl."
