description: "This waterproof wooden tube has a curved end with a mouthpiece. When\
  \ you hold the mouthpiece in your mouth, the tube extends past your face and toward\
  \ the back of your head, allowing you to breathe indefinitely when swimming facedown\
  \ or barely submerged. If you submerge the tip of the snorkel, it floods with water\
  \ and can't be used to breathe until you clear the water from it (requiring a move\
  \ action and full access to air). A typical snorkel's length is about 15 inches;\
  \ any shorter than this and it tends to fill with water when you swim, but any longer\
  \ and you're not moving enough fresh air through the snorkel to be effective.\n\
  Masterwork Snorkel: This snorkel has a valve at the top to keep out of the water,\
  \ keeping it from being flooded from splashes or when you submerge. It also has\
  \ a sump and valve near your mouth, preventing water from reaching your mouth and\
  \ automatically draining excess water when you surface."
