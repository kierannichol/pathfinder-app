description: "This 8-inch-diameter skillet has a long handle and feet so you can rest\
  \ it on a fire or hot coals. Adventurers prefer models with a hinged handle that\
  \ folds over the top of the skillet for easier storage and transport. A mithral\
  \ skillet is lighter and food rarely sticks to it."
