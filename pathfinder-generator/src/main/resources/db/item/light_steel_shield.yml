description: "You strap a light steel shield to your forearm and grip it with your\
  \ hand. A light steel shield's weight lets you carry other items in that hand, although\
  \ you cannot use weapons with it. Whether wooden or steel, a light shield offers\
  \ the same basic protection and attack benefits, though the two varieties respond\
  \ differently to some spells and effects (such as rusting grasp). A druid can use\
  \ a light wooden shield, but not a light steel shield.\nShield Bash Attacks: You\
  \ can bash an opponent with a light shield. See \"light shield\" on Table 1â€“5: Martial\
  \ Weapons for the damage dealt by a shield bash with a light shield. Used this way,\
  \ a light shield is a martial bludgeoning weapon. For the purpose of penalties on\
  \ attack rolls, treat a light shield as a light weapon. If you use your shield as\
  \ a weapon, you lose its AC bonus until your next turn. An enhancement bonus on\
  \ a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but\
  \ the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right."
