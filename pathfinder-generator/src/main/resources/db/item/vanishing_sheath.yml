description: "This small sheath attaches to the wrist with a leather strap. The sheath\
  \ can accommodate any single light weapon, wand, or piece of ammunition weighing\
  \ no more than 5 pounds. While sheathed, the weapon is hidden in an extradimensional\
  \ space and is weightless. As a swift action, the wearer can flex her wrist, ejecting\
  \ the weapon into her hand. If her hand is not empty, the weapon remains sheathed.\
  \ Stowing a weapon in the sheath requires a move action. The wearer gains a +4 bonus\
  \ on any Sleight of Hand check to oppose the Perception check of someone observing\
  \ or frisking the wearer in search of a weapon in the sheath.\nVanishing sheaths\
  \ can be worn in pairsâ€”one on each arm. A person wearing two vanishing sheaths can\
  \ eject either or both weapons with a single swift action."
