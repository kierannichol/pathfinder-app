description: "This humble pad of woven river reeds allows its owner to recover his\
  \ mental fortitude and ki pool by practicing breathing exercises and other forms\
  \ of meditation. Each hour its owner spends sitting on the mat without taking any\
  \ other action, he can attempt to center himself by making a Wisdom check with a\
  \ DC of 10 + the monk's current number of ki points (note that ability checks, like\
  \ skill checks, do not automatically succeed on a 20). If the check is successful,\
  \ the monk regains 1 ki point."
