description: "This small stone figurine depicts a mummiform servant holding carved\
  \ tools in its crossed arms. It appears similar to the funerary figurines called\
  \ ushabti frequently found buried with the deceased in Osirian tombs.\nUpon command,\
  \ an ushabti of the willing servant conjures a ghostly attendant that performs simple\
  \ duties or manual labor at its owner's behest, as an unseen servant. The ghostly\
  \ attendant remains for 1 hour at a time, and cannot move farther than 30 feet from\
  \ its ushabti.\nIf the ushabti's owner inscribes his or her own name on the figurine\
  \ (which requires a successful DC 10 Craft [sculpture] or [stonecarving] check),\
  \ the ushabti of the willing servant gains an additional power. While it can still\
  \ summon an unseen servant, the owner can command the ushabti to instead summon\
  \ a ghostly warrior to fight and defend its owner. This warrior functions as a spiritual\
  \ ally (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 246) armed with a flail for 7 rounds.\
  \ Once an ushabti of the willing servant has been used to conjure a spiritual ally\
  \ in this way, the ushabti loses all of its magic, becoming only a mundane figurine."
