description: "Shelana the Mother Deck operates as an intelligent deck of many things,\
  \ save that all her benefits and penalties are doubled (for example, the Star card\
  \ grants a +4 bonus to ability stats instead of +2, the Skull card summons two dread\
  \ wraiths at a time, and so on). Shelana can cast teleport once per day, transporting\
  \ herself and her puzzle box only."
destruction: "Shelana can only be destroyed by using her own Moon card to wish for\
  \ her destruction."
