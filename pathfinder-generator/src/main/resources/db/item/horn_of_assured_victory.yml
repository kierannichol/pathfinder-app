  \ clarion call can be heard clearly up to a range of 2 miles, cutting through any\
  \ weather condition short of a windstorm. Once per day, the commander of an army\
  \ can blow the horn to bolster the troops. This grants the army a +2 bonus on OM\
  \ checks and Morale checks. The army also gains an additional number of hit points\
  \ equal to its ACR for that battle."
