description: "Runic engravings adorn this charred rib bone pulled from a slain troll.\
  \ When the bone is tossed up to 20 feet away, it can grow into a fullsized troll\
  \ (Bestiary 268) under the user's control on command. The troll normally remains\
  \ for 2d4 rounds, but if the user is maintaining a bardic performance when the item\
  \ is activated, the duration is extended until the end of the performance. When\
  \ the troll is slain or the duration ends, it turns back into a bone that then crumbles\
  \ into dust."
