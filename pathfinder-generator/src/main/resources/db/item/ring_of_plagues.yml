description: "This silver ring is set with a black opal. Once per day, when the wearer\
  \ is reduced to half or fewer of her maximum hit point total, whoever dealt the\
  \ activating blow to the wearer is immediately subjected to a major curse with unlimited\
  \ range. A successful DC 19 Will saving throw is needed to negate the spell. Rather\
  \ than one of the listed curse effects, the curse imposes a –4 penalty on the victim's\
  \ saving throws and causes the victim to contract a disease chosen by the wearer\
  \ from the contagion list without a save. The cursed disease has no onset time,\
  \ but the attacker is allowed the normal saving throw to avoid its effects. It can\
  \ be cured only by successfully casting both remove curse and remove disease within\
  \ 1 minute of each other. Those exposed to the cursed attacker thereafter must save\
  \ against the mundane version of the disease or become infected (though they are\
  \ not cursed).\nOnce per day, if the wearer is killed or reduced to negative hit\
  \ points, a plague of curses is unleashed. The attacker and the attacker's five\
  \ nearest allies or immediate blood relatives become the targets of the curse described\
  \ above. If the wearer is restored to at least 1 hit point, these curses end, allowing\
  \ surviving victims to recover naturally."
