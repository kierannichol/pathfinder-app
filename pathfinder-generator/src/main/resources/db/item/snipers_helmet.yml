description: "A sniper's helmet looks like the simple steel soldier's helmet common\
  \ to the European trenches of the First World War, with the addition of a steel\
  \ eye shield. Once per day, the wearer of a sniper's helmet can, as a standard action,\
  \ denote one creature within her line of sight as her target. The wearer can perceive\
  \ the target when it is invisible or ethereal as though using the see invisibility\
  \ spell, and gains a +20 competence bonus on Perception checks to locate the target.\
  \ The wearer ignores concealment provided by fog or mist, blur, displacement, invisibility,\
  \ and similar effects affecting the target, but not concealment provided by darkness.\
  \ These bonuses last for 5 minutes or until the target creature is dead. The sniper's\
  \ helmet provides no benefits to the wearer's allies, and the wearer gains no benefits\
  \ against creatures other than her chosen target.\nIn addition, once per day, the\
  \ wearer of a sniper's helmet can create a magical sensor up to 600 feet above her\
  \ that gives her a full 360-degree viewpoint as if she were actually there. The\
  \ wearer perceives with her normal visual senses, and though the sensor cannot penetrate\
  \ solid surfaces, it is unaffected by foliage and the like."
