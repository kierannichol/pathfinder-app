description: "This small, innocuous, black wooden box appears randomly throughout\
  \ the multiverse, drawn to great heroes, greedy rulers, and desperate (and often\
  \ morally ambiguous) mortals. The Apocalypse Box appears subtly, sometimes as a\
  \ dusty old box on a shelf or a forgotten heirloom in a grandparent's attic. A creature\
  \ looking upon the Apocalypse Box is struck with a sensation of nearly overwhelming\
  \ avarice, and must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be compelled to touch the box.\
  \ This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. If a creature touches the Apocalypse\
  \ Box, she must succeed at another DC 30 Will save or fall under the box's curse.\
  \ Cursed creatures are compelled to use any available means—including fleeing from\
  \ or murdering friends and loved ones—to keep the box out of the hands of others.\
  \ This curse can't be broken until the cursed creature dies or the box is destroyed.\
  \ Additionally, if the cursed creature moves more than 10 feet away from the box,\
  \ she immediately takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage plus 1d4 points of Wisdom damage\
  \ each subsequent day until she and the Apocalypse Box are reunited.\nOnly a creature\
  \ bearing the Apocalypse Box's curse can open it. Once per day, the cursed creature\
  \ can open the box and draw forth a single item her heart desires. The item must\
  \ be nonmagical, weigh no more than 50 pounds, and be worth no more than 50,000\
  \ gp, but is otherwise limited only by the parameters of the wish spell. A mythic\
  \ character can expend two uses of mythic power to draw forth a second such item\
  \ each day. Each time the Apocalypse Box is opened, there is a 50% chance that instead\
  \ of granting a wish, the box summons a number of horrific monsters that immediately\
  \ attack anyone in sight and remain to wreak havoc on the Material Plane for 1 week\
  \ before returning to their plane of origin. Roll on Table 5–1 below to determine\
  \ the monsters that appear.\nThe Apocalypse Box is quite tenacious in its desire\
  \ for someone to open it. Each day, the cursed creature must succeed at a Will save\
  \ or be compelled to open it. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save\
  \ DC is initially 20, but increases by 2 each subsequent day the box isn't opened\
  \ until the cursed creature fails the Will save, at which point she opens the box\
  \ and the save DC resets to 20."
destruction: "The Apocalypse Box can be destroyed by being crushed under the claw\
  \ of an ancient gold dragon after a creature cursed by the box defeats three groups\
  \ of Apocalypse Box monsters in a single day. The act of crushing the box immediately\
  \ slays the gold dragon, who can't be returned to life short of divine intervention."
