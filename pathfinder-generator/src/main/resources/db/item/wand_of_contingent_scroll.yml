description: "You transfer the power of a scroll to the target so that it comes into\
  \ effect under some condition you dictate. Casting this spell destroys the scroll,\
  \ but allows the spell in it to be triggered in a manner similar to the contingencyspell.\
  \ The spell on the scroll must be a spell on your spell list, it must affect the\
  \ target of this spell (the target of this spell is considered the caster of the\
  \ scroll), and its level must be no higher than onefourth your caster level (maximum\
  \ 5th level)."
