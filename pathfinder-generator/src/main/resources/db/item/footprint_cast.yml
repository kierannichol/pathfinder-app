description: "This quick-drying cast is perfect for preserving a set of footprints\
  \ in order to examine them later. By spending 1 minute setting the cast and waiting\
  \ for it to dry, you can copy footprints, allowing others to examine them without\
  \ traveling to the scene, and preventing the DC of the Survival check to analyze\
  \ them from increasing because of time or weather."
