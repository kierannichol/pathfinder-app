name: "Scroll of Climbing Beanstalk"
description: "You cause a thick, sturdy beanstalk to sprout from the ground and grow\
  \ upward to a height of 10 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels. The growing stalk\
  \ anchors itself to sturdy objects such as walls or ceilings, and grows around objects\
  \ that do not fully obstruct its square (such as tree branches), but is stopped\
  \ by solid obstacles. The beanstalk provides numerous hand- and footholds; its climb\
  \ DC 5. The beanstalk can support up to 200 pounds plus 50 pounds per caster level,\
  \ or double that amount if anchored on its upper end. If it anchors itself to a\
  \ sturdy mobile object (such as a ship or a siege engine), breaking the object free\
  \ requires a DC 23 Strength check or cutting through the beanstalk (hardness 2,\
  \ 40 hp)."
