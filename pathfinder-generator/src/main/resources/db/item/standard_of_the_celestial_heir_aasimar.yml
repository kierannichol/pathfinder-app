description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nA command word causes this bright white flag\
  \ to change its emblem to match the deity worshiped by the bearer. Creatures loyal\
  \ to that deity gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and\
  \ saving throws against fear and charm effects as long as they can see the standard,\
  \ which must be held by an ally within 60 feet. This bonus is increased by 1 if\
  \ the bearer has the Flagbearer feat (The Inner Sea World Guide 286).\nAs long as\
  \ the standard of the celestial heir is held by an aasimar bearer, evil foes within\
  \ 60 feet that see the standard are dazzled while in the area and must succeed at\
  \ a DC 14 Will saving throw or become shaken for as long as they remain in the area.\
  \ Once a foe succeeds at her save against the standard, she is immune to being shaken\
  \ by that standard for 1 day."
