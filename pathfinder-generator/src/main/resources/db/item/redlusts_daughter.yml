description: "This +1 flaming falchion is engraved with leering, long-tongued demonic\
  \ faces. As a standard action, the bearer can will the weapon to transform into\
  \ a +1 flaming kukri or back to its larger form. The weapon has an affinity for\
  \ humanoid blood and remains slick and wet with it long after it would normally\
  \ dry. If the wielder kills a humanoid with Redlust's Daughter, she can lick clean\
  \ this blood as a move action to heal 1d4 hit points. Lamashtu's church also creates\
  \ a similar weapon called Chillheart's Daughter, which is a +1 frost falchion that\
  \ otherwise has the same properties as this weapon."
