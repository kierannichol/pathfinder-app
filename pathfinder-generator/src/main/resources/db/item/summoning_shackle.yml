description: "This small silver shackle is carved with conjuration runes. When used\
  \ as a focus as part of a summoning spell of 3rd level or less, it creates a faintly-glowing\
  \ intangible magical chain from the caster to the summoned creature or creatures.\
  \ The duration of that summoning spell is extended as if using the Extend Spell\
  \ feat, with no increase in casting time. The chain prevents the creature from moving\
  \ more than 30 feet from the caster, even when using teleportation (though the caster\
  \ can use these effects to exceed this distance, which ends the shackling effect\
  \ immediately). The chain does not otherwise obstruct or interfere with any object\
  \ or creature other than the summoned creature. The shackle may be used up to five\
  \ times per day. If the shackle or the chain is dispelled, the range limitation\
  \ and increased duration ends; if the spell's unmodified duration would already\
  \ have ended by then, the spell ends immediately."
