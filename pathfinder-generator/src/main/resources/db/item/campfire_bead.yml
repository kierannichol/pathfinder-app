description: "This tiny glass bead transforms itself into a small (2-foot-tall) pile\
  \ of burning logs whenever its command word is spoken. The fire burns for 8 hours\
  \ or until extinguished, at which point it turns back into a bead. The owner of\
  \ the item must wait twice as long as the fire burned before he can order the bead\
  \ to become a campfire again."
