  \ patches. The staff is a mere 3 feet long and balanced for use as a masterwork\
  \ club.\nWhen casting produce flame from the staff, its wielder can choose to set\
  \ the end of the staff alight instead of producing the flame in her hand. This does\
  \ not damage the staff, and the spell's damage is added to any melee attacks made\
  \ with the staff."
