description: "This ring is a thick loop of mirrorlike metal. Whenever the wearer of\
  \ this ring takes the withdraw action or becomes helpless (including falling unconscious),\
  \ it instantly makes her invisible for 3 rounds and creates four illusory duplicates\
  \ that either run off in opposite directions or perform other plausible actions\
  \ that could draw enemy attention away from her. The duplicates last for 3 rounds\
  \ before disappearing, but they instantly pop out of existence if struck by an attack\
  \ (AC 10) and can be disbelieved (Will DC 19). Allies of the wearer always know\
  \ her true location and can freely provide aid or assistance to her."
