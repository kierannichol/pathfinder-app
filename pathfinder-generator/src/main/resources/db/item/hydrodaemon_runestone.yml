description: "This water-polished stone is carved in the shape of a frog-like head\
  \ and decorated with evil runes. It feels lighter than it should, as if hollow and\
  \ partially filled with liquid. When a hydrodaemon runestone is crushed, smashed,\
  \ or broken (a standard action), a hydrodaemon appears as if summoned by a summon\
  \ monster VI spell. Normally, the daemon is under the control of the creature that\
  \ broke the runestone, but there is a 25% chance that the daemon is uncontrolled\
  \ and attacks its summoner."
