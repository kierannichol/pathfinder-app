description: "This thin sheet of opaque black stone is polished to a reflective sheen,\
  \ but the center of the material drinks all light, becoming a pool of total darkness.\n\
  A nightglass can be used three times per day to summon various creatures from the\
  \ Shadow Plane. Any effort to summon a creature requires a successful DC 15 Will\
  \ save. On a failed save, the user takes 1d4 points of Strength damage and must\
  \ attempt another save on his next turn. On a successful save, a shadow is summoned.\
  \ This acts as summon monster IV, except it can be used only to summon a single\
  \ shadow, and the shadow remains for 1 hour or until destroyed. If the user took\
  \ Strength damage during the summoning effort, the shadow remains for 1 additional\
  \ hour per point of Strength lost. Any Strength damage that is restored no longer\
  \ adds to the duration of the summoned shadow.\nIf a user's Strength is reduced\
  \ to 0 by the nightglass while attempting to summon a shadow, the user is trapped\
  \ within the nightglass as if by a trap the soul spell, except breaking the nightglass\
  \ does not free the trapped soul (which can be released only through a miracle,\
  \ a wish, or similar powerful magic). Additionally, a creature from the Plane of\
  \ Shadow emerges from the nightglass. This creature takes the form of the user drained\
  \ to 0 Strength. It uses the same stat block as the trapped soul, but also has the\
  \ shadow creature template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 238). The shadow creature\
  \ has the memories, class levels, and abilities of the user it replaces, but is\
  \ always of neutral evil alignment. A successful DC 20 Sense Motive check allows\
  \ anyone familiar with the original character to realize the shadow creature is\
  \ not actually the person it resembles. The shadow creature is not bound or controlled\
  \ by the nightglass and has its own dark agenda, but may work with groups able to\
  \ provide it with security and aid. Should the original user somehow manage to escape\
  \ the nightglass, the shadow creature replacement is immediately sent back to the\
  \ Plane of Shadow.\nA nightglass can also be used once per day to communicate with\
  \ creatures with the evil subtype on other planes of existence. To use a nightglass\
  \ in this way, the user must know the true name of the creature she is trying to\
  \ contact. Communication works two ways, and the mirrored surface of the nightglass\
  \ hazily shows the creature being contacted."
