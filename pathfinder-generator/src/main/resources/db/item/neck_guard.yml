description: "Made from hardened leather reinforced with a band of metal, this collar\
  \ protects the wearer against vampire bites when worn around the throat. It provides\
  \ a +1 armor bonus to AC against vampire bites or similar attacks that specifically\
  \ target the wearer's throat. Unlike most armor bonuses, the neck guard's +1 bonus\
  \ stacks with the armor bonus of light or medium armor, but it provides no additional\
  \ bonus when worn with heavy armor."
