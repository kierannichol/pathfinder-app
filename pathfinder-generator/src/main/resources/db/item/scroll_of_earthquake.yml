name: "Scroll of Earthquake"
description: "When you cast earthquake, an intense but highly localized tremor rips\
  \ the ground. The powerful shockwave created by this spell knocks creatures down,\
  \ collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for\
  \ 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack. A spellcaster\
  \ on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any\
  \ spell he or she tries to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation,\
  \ structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an earthquake spell\
  \ depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast."
