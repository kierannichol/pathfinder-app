description: "This M1914 concussion grenade (see page 66) can be thrown up to 680\
  \ feet away, as it teleports itself directly to the target location when thrown.\
  \ This allows a dimensional grenade to be thrown even at targets behind cover, including\
  \ total cover. The wielder does not need to attempt an attack roll; the dimensional\
  \ grenade simply appears in the target location and detonates at the beginning the\
  \ wielder's next turn. A dimensional grenade deals 3d6 points of force damage in\
  \ a 15-foot radius (Reflex DC 15 for half). In addition, any creature damaged by\
  \ the grenade's blast must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be dazed for 1 round.\
  \ The grenade is consumed in the attack."
