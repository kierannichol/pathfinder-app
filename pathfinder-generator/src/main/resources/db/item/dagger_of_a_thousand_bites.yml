description: "This +1 keen returning mithral dagger is bleached pale white like some\
  \ sort of giant tooth. The wielder can expend one use of mythic power when throwing\
  \ the dagger. When the dagger is thrown in this fashion and hits its target, it\
  \ can be directed to strike a different target within 30 feet of the first. The\
  \ new target must still be within the attacker's line of sight. This additional\
  \ attack is made using the same attack bonus as the first, though range penalties\
  \ apply based on the total distance the dagger flies.\nThe dagger's wielder can\
  \ continue selecting additional targets within his line of sight until the dagger\
  \ misses, though no creature can be targeted by the dagger more than once in the\
  \ same round."
