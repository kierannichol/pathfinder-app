description: "This charm is typically spherical in shape and a mottled amber in color.\
  \ A natural inclusion in this amber charm gives it the appearance of an eye. When\
  \ activated as a swift action, the lynx eye charm grants its wearer low-light vision\
  \ for 3 minutes. If activated as a standard action, the charm instead grants its\
  \ wearer the benefits of darkvision or see invisibility for 3 rounds.\nThis charm\
  \ can only be used once, after which the charm's magic is gone forever. A charm\
  \ occupies the wearer's shoulders or neck slot, though it can share that slot with\
  \ one other magic item (as a cloak pin or token hanging from a necklace, for example).\
  \ A character can never wear more than one charm at a time."
