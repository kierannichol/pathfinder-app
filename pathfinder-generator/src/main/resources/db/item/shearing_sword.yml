description: "This +1 greatsword is often found among the robot-hunters of Numeria.\
  \ Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder can envelop the blade with\
  \ a razor-edged field of force for 1 minute. Thanks to this field, the sword ignores\
  \ the damage reduction of creatures with DR 5 or less (other than DR/epic), and\
  \ when it's used to attack an object or sunder a weapon, the sword treats the item\
  \ as having a hardness of 5 less than the item's actual hardness."
