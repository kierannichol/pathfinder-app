description: "The blades of these antique scissors are engraved with images of an\
  \ infant, a child, an adult, and an elder (female images on one blade, male images\
  \ on the other). The blades are permanently coated with salve of slipperiness and\
  \ therefore adhesives do not stick to them, making them especially suitable for\
  \ cutting through sticky things (such as spiderwebs, cave fisher filaments, and\
  \ so on). If used in combat, the shears function as a masterwork dagger. Once per\
  \ day as an immediate action, the bearer can point the shears at a creature within\
  \ 30 feet and force that creature to reroll its most recent attack, check, or save,\
  \ and use the result of the second roll; the bearer is staggered on her next turn\
  \ after using this ability. In addition, the bearer can use deathwatch once per\
  \ day."
