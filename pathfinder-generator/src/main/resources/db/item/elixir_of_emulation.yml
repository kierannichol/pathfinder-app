description: "A drinker must add hair, skin, fur, blood, or nail clippings of a single\
  \ creature to this elixir before drinking it, or it is expended uselessly. Once\
  \ appropriate material has been added, the elixir retains potency for 24 hours,\
  \ after which it becomes an inert, valueless liquid. If drunk while potent, the\
  \ elixir functions as alter self, allowing the drinker to assume the shape of the\
  \ donor creature, which must be a living, corporeal, Small or Medium creature. In\
  \ addition, the elixir aids the drinker in duplicating the mannerisms of the donor\
  \ creature, granting her a +20 bonus on Disguise checks to pass herself off as that\
  \ creature and eliminating the penalty for masquerading as a different gender, race,\
  \ or age. Once during the elixir's duration, the drinker can try to learn information\
  \ known by the donor creature at the time its material was harvested, as if she\
  \ had cast harvest knowledge (see below). An elixir of emulation lasts 2d6+12 hours."
