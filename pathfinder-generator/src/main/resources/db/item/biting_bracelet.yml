description: "This +1 heavy wrist launcher appears to be a lavish, gold bracelet.\
  \ This functions like the glamered weapon special ability (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate\
  \ Equipment 142), except a biting bracelet is able to only assume this one specific\
  \ form, and can revert to its innocuous appearance 1 round after being used as a\
  \ weapon."
