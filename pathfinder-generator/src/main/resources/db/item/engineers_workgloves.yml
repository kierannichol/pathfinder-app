description: "These durable canvas and leather gloves imbue the wearer with an instinctive\
  \ knowledge of mechanical devices. The wearer also gains a +5 competence bonus on\
  \ Craft and Knowledge checks made to repair or understand mechanical devices.\n\
  Once per day, the wearer may touch a device and instantly analyze it, learning its\
  \ purpose and general method of operation, as well as diagnosing any acute malfunctions\
  \ of the device, but not its magical powers or additional non-mechanical effects.\
  \ For example, she could touch a pressure plate and understand that stepping on\
  \ it would trigger a wall scythe trap attacking that square and that the trap resets\
  \ automatically, but not that the trap includes a +1 flaming scythe coated in poison."
