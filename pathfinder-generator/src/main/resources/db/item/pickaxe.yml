description: "A two-handed version of the heavy pick, the brutal pickaxe is equally\
  \ effective at breaking up earth and stone as it is at sundering flesh and bone.\
  \ Often a weapon of convenience for commoners, the pickaxe is also a favorite among\
  \ brutes and thugs who value the intimidation factor afforded by the immense weapon."
