description: "This cloak is made of tough leather, and is decorated with brilliant\
  \ red and orange feathers. As a free action, the wearer can rub her hands together,\
  \ setting them alightâ€”thus granting her natural attacks and unarmed strikes the\
  \ burn special ability (Bestiary 298; 1d6, Reflex DC 14). The wearer can use this\
  \ ability for up to 10 rounds per day, which don't need to be consecutive.\nIf the\
  \ wearer takes damage that would reduce her below 0 hit points, she can expend one\
  \ use of mythic power to transform into a phoenix-like being. This doesn't require\
  \ an action. When this happens, she is immediately affected as though targeted with\
  \ a breath of life spell (CL 9th) and polymorphs into a birdlike creature made of\
  \ flames (as elemental body II, CL 9; fire elemental only). While in this form,\
  \ the wearer also gains a fly speed of 50 feet with good maneuverability, as well\
  \ as a +4 bonus on Fly skill checks due to this maneuverability."
