description: "When ingested, this thin serum awakens your potential for independent\
  \ action. If you are under the influence of a mindaffecting effect, you receive\
  \ a new saving throw with a +4 alchemical bonus to break the effect (you can gain\
  \ this benefit only once per day). If the serum is ingested by a bonded creature\
  \ such as a familiar, animal companion, bonded mount, or homunculus, the creature\
  \ ceases to be bound to its master's will for 10 minutes. It gains a +2 morale bonus\
  \ on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks, and becomes\
  \ interested in finding its own way of doing things. Its attitude toward its master\
  \ might change drastically during this time, depending on how the master has treated\
  \ it in the past. As soon as the duration of this effect ends, the creature becomes\
  \ bound to its master's will again."
