description: "This +1 keen shock spear constantly flickers and sparks with power.\
  \ When casting spells with the electricity descriptor, the spear's wielder adds\
  \ 1 to her effective caster level. (This doesn't stack with other effects or feats\
  \ that increase caster level.) Once per week, the wielder can cast control weather\
  \ for the purposes of summoning a storm or increasing the severity of an existing\
  \ storm.\nAs a full-round action, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power\
  \ to call lightning down on foes he hits. This works like the call lightning spell\
  \ (CL 13th), w ith t he following differences. Rather than being directed as a move\
  \ action, for 13 rounds the lightning is called down on the first opponent hit by\
  \ the spear each round. This effect bypasses lightning resistance and treats lightning\
  \ immunity as lightning resistance 10. If the wielder confirms a critical hit on\
  \ an attack that calls down a lightning bolt, the lightning also deals double damage."
