description: "This mummified human hand hangs around a character's neck by a leather\
  \ cord (taking up space as a magic necklace would). If a magic ring is placed on\
  \ one of the fingers of the hand, the wearer benefits from the ring as if wearing\
  \ it herself, and it does not count against her two ring limit. The hand can wear\
  \ only one ring at a time. Even without a ring, the hand itself allows its wearer\
  \ to use daylight and see invisibility each once per day."
