description: "Each ski is a flat piece of wood about 5â€“6 feet long for a Medium wearer,\
  \ curled up slightly at the front end, with lengthwise grooves along the underside\
  \ and a wooden or metal bracket with laces on top for holding the wearer's boot\
  \ in place. Wearing skis allows you to move on snow and ice at normal speed, but\
  \ your movement is reduced to 5 feet on all other terrain. You normally use a pair\
  \ of spiked poles to help you move and maintain balance while skiing, but javelins,\
  \ shortspears, or even trimmed-down saplings will do if nothing else more suitable\
  \ is available. Donning or removing a ski is a full-round action, though the laces\
  \ can be cut as a move action (which requires repairing or replacing the laces if\
  \ you want to use the skis again)."
