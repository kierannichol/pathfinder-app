description: "This jewel-like lens slowly changes colors over time, with no discernible\
  \ pattern. It may appear as a ruby one morning and a sapphire that night, only to\
  \ become opaline for the entire next day. Most owners set their rhombocrystal in\
  \ a metal festoon on a chain and carry it as a pendant, monocle, or loupe. A rhombocrystal\
  \ can be used as a magnifying glass, and grants its bearer a +5 competence bonus\
  \ on Appraise checks involving gems and crystals.\nIf Nivi Rhombodazzle is the bearer's\
  \ patron, the bearer gains a +1 luck bonus on Reflex saving throws."
