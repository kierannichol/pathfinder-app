description: "This horn functions as a horn of blasting, except that it deals 10d6\
  \ points of sonic damage, stuns creatures for 1 round, and deafens them for 4d6\
  \ rounds (a DC 19 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half and negates the stunning\
  \ and deafening). Crystalline objects take 16d6 points of sonic damage as described\
  \ for the horn of blasting. A greater horn of blasting also has a 20% cumulative\
  \ chance of exploding for each usage beyond the first each day."
