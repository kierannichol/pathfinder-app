description: "A crown of the simurgh grants the wearer the protection of the simurgh\
  \ (Bestiary 3) who created it. The crown only works for a single creature for whom\
  \ the crown was specifically crafted. A simurgh can create one crown of the simurgh\
  \ every 500 years.\nWhile wearing a crown of the simurgh, the wearer is constantly\
  \ affected by the spell protection from evil. Once per day, the wearer of this crown\
  \ can spend a full-round action concentrating to mentally contact the simurgh who\
  \ created the crown. If the simurgh allows this connection to be made, the wearer\
  \ instantly knows the distance and direction of the simurgh and can communicate\
  \ with it as per the spell sending. Should the simurgh be on the same plane and\
  \ both parties wish it, the crown's wearer can teleport to the simurgh's location.\
  \ Ten minutes after teleporting to the simurgh's side, however, the crown's wearer\
  \ teleports back to wherever he was before teleporting (or the nearest safe square),\
  \ whether he wishes to or not.\nAs a final effort or in a time of great need, the\
  \ wearer can take a full-round action to hold the crown to the sun and call out\
  \ to the simurgh that created it. This summons the simurgh as per the spell summon\
  \ monster IX. The simurgh remains for 1 minute, and follows the wearer's commands.\
  \ At the end of this time, the simurgh vanishes and the crown is destroyed."
destruction: "Aside from making use of the crown of the simurgh's summoning ability,\
  \ this artifact is also destroyed if it is taken onto the Plane of Shadow."
