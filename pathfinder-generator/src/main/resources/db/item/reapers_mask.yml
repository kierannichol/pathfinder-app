description: "The wearer of a reaper's mask gains a +2 competence bonus on Perception\
  \ checks made against creatures that aren't immune to fear and a +1 profane bonus\
  \ on damage with slashing weapons made against living creatures. The wearer can\
  \ cast confusion twice per day (DC 16). When a reaper's mask is donned, the wearer\
  \ takes 1 point of Charisma damageâ€”most Skinsaw cultists don their masks well in\
  \ advance of a mission so they have time to recover."
