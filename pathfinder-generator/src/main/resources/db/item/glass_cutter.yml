description: "This small metal rod has a tiny sharp wheel on one end and a bulb on\
  \ the other. You score the glass with the wheel and tap it with the bulb to break\
  \ it. If you succeed at a DC 15 Sleight of Hand check, you can break the glass very\
  \ quietly (DC 15 Perception check to hear). Most thieves use glue paper with a glass\
  \ cutter to reduce noise and capture glass fragments."
