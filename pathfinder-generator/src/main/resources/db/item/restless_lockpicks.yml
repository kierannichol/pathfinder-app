description: "This set of mithral masterwork thieves' tools springs to life in the\
  \ hands of a skilled user. If the user attempts to use the tools to disarm a trap\
  \ or other device, he may spend a standard action beginning the disarm attempt,\
  \ after which the tools continue on their own without being held. Thereafter, the\
  \ bearer may perform other actions or even move away while the tools work. The tools\
  \ make a Disable Device using the bearer's skill bonus plus the +2 for being masterwork\
  \ thieves' tools, taking the normal amount of time to disable the device. When the\
  \ skill check is completed, the tools remain in place until removed from the device.\
  \ The tools can animate for up to 10 rounds per day. They can take 10 but cannot\
  \ take 20. If there aren't enough rounds left in the tools to finish a particular\
  \ check, the bearer can continue where the animated tools left off as long as she\
  \ is in the square with the tools when the animation duration runs out."
