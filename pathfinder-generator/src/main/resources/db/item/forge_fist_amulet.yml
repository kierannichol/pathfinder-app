description: "This fist-shaped stone amulet glows with a fiery light. On command,\
  \ this amulet causes the wearer's fists to transform into red-hot flaming adamantine.\
  \ The wearer is protected from the searing heat and can make savage blows with his\
  \ hands. Unarmed strikes and natural attacks the wearer make with his hands gain\
  \ the flaming weapon special ability and are treated as adamantine for the purpose\
  \ of bypassing damage reduction (but not hardness). The wearer's hands become rigid\
  \ while using this amulet and cannot be use to hold or manipulate objects (unless\
  \ that manipulation could be accomplished with a club and is not damaged by fire).\
  \ The transformation can be ended as a swift action."
