description: "A breastplate protects a wearer's torso with a single piece of sculpted\
  \ metal, similar to the core piece of a suit of full plate. Despite its sturdiness,\
  \ its inflexibility and open back make it inferior to complete suits of metal armor,\
  \ but still an improvement over most non-metal armors."
