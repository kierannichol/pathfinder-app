description: "This mithral ring is engraved with a pattern of rolling waves that encircles\
  \ the entire band. The saltspray ring is immune to rust, both from natural oxidation\
  \ and rust caused by magical effects.\nUpon command, the ring causes a thick vapor\
  \ to continuously surround its owner as per obscuring mist, except the mist has\
  \ a 10-foot radius from the wearer and the area of effect moves with the wearer.\
  \ This mist is exceedingly wet and extinguishes all nonmagical fires within its\
  \ area. Magical fires and creatures with the fire subtype are not dispelled or adversely\
  \ affected by the mist, though such creatures find being in the fog to be an uncomfortable\
  \ experience. The mist does not permit aquatic creatures without the amphibious\
  \ special quality to breathe out of water, but creatures that must remain wet or\
  \ suffer a negative effect or condition have that requirement satisfied by the ring's\
  \ effect. This effect can be dismissed as a standard action. The ring has no effect\
  \ whatsoever underwater."
