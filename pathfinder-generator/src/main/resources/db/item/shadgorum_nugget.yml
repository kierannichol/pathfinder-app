description: "This impossibly hard, lumpy piece of unforged iron originates from metal\
  \ that remained cool after smeltingâ€”ore that resisted all attempts to forge it into\
  \ another shape. Worshipers of Gorum believe this metal is a reflection of their\
  \ god's unrelenting determination, and often fashion this \"stubborn iron\" into\
  \ a pendant, though it is sometimes used as a mace head or as a counterweight to\
  \ a greatsword or another large weapon instead. While wearing a Shad'Gorum nugget\
  \ around the neck, the wearer gains fire resistance 1 and a +1 resistance bonus\
  \ on Will saving throws.\nIf Gorum is the wearer's patron, the wearer can use chill\
  \ metal once per day. At will, the wearer can mend small metallic items as if using\
  \ a mending spell."
