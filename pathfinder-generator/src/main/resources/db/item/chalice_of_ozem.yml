description: "This chalice is perhaps the last surviving artifact from Sacred Ozem,\
  \ now forever lost in a tragic battle that ultimately led to the foundation of the\
  \ Knights of Ozem. Made of shimmering mithral and studded with dozens of rubies,\
  \ the Chalice of Ozem was carried from the ruins and handed down through generations\
  \ until it was finally given to Iomedae, who used it in her fight against Erum-Hel\
  \ during the Battle of Three Sorrows.\nThe chalice cannot be harmed by any substance\
  \ it holds, no matter how caustic. Further, any liquid placed within the chalice\
  \ will never spill unless the chalice's carrier wills it. If the chalice is held\
  \ and the command phrase spoken (\"Ozem for Iomedae!\"), it projects a globe of\
  \ invulnerability. If a second command phrase is spoken (\"Her sheltering shield!\"\
  ) and a scooping motion is made with the chalice, a resilient sphere is created\
  \ around the carrier. Each of these effects can be called upon twice per day.\n\
  Once per day, a mythic character can expend one use of mythic power while pouring\
  \ a dose of holy water into the chalice to immediately transform that dose of holy\
  \ water into a single dose of nectar of the gods (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures\
  \ 155)."
destruction: "If the Chalice of Ozem is filled with Iomedae's blood and Arazni drinks\
  \ from it, the chalice shatters into glass fragments."
