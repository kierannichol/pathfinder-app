description: "Unlike the heavy cast-brass mariner's astrolabes normally used at sea,\
  \ this astrolabe is of the more common type found on land (Pathfinder RPG Advanced\
  \ Player's Guide 185), made of flat discs of brass. The famed navigator-astrologer\
  \ Svingli of Morm, a drowned settlement of old Lirgen, was said to have sacrificed\
  \ her eye to the instrument to grant her knowledge of things beyond mortal sight,\
  \ thus giving the astrolabe its name.\nIn addition to an astrolabe's normal +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus, Svingli's Eye grants a further +2 competence bonus on Knowledge (geography),\
  \ Profession (sailor), and Survival checks when used to navigate on land or sea.\
  \ Once per day, the user can make a DC 20 Perception check while using Svingli's\
  \ Eye as a move action to catch a glimpse of how things really are for 1 round,\
  \ as if with a true seeing spell. While using the astrolabe's true seeing ability,\
  \ the user can also see through concealment caused by smoke or fog and gains a +10\
  \ competence bonus on Perception checks to spot hidden or disguised creatures or\
  \ objects."
