description: "When you scatter this very fine pale blue powder on the ground, it reveals\
  \ the tracks of any creatures or individuals that have passed through the area within\
  \ the last 48 hours. The powder also grants you a +10 alchemical bonus on Survival\
  \ checks to follow tracks or, if you aren't trained in Survival, instead allows\
  \ you to track creatures whose prints are revealed by the powder for up to 1 mile\
  \ using Perception instead of Survival. A single application can cover an area of\
  \ up to 60 square feet. Tracking powder is sold in small leather pouches that hold\
  \ 10 applications each."
