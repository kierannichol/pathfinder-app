description: "Once exposed to air, this greenish alchemical sludge quickly takes on\
  \ a faint glow. This glow provides dim illumination in the area immediately surrounding\
  \ the fist-sized lump of false ectoplasm. This glow-in-the-dark effect lasts for\
  \ 1 hour before the substance begins to decompose into a brownish goo. A successful\
  \ DC 20 Sleight of Hand check allows a user to open a vial of false ectoplasm and\
  \ deposit it on an adjacent surface as a move action; a successful opposed Perception\
  \ check is enough to notice this trickery."
