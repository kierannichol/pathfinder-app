description: "This small but thick booklet contains information on a specific form\
  \ of folk divination, such as cartomancy, cheiromancy, crystallomancy, or horoscopy.\
  \ Using such a book while reading a creature's fortune reduces the time needed to\
  \ read that fortune by 2 minutes. When used as part of a Sense Motive check for\
  \ the prognostication occult skill unlock, this book grants a +2 circumstance bonus.\
  \ If the fortunetelling method requires a particular item, such as a deck of cards\
  \ for cartomancy or animal bones for osteomancy, that item provides a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus that doesn't stack with the bonus provided by the prognostication manual.\n\
  A prognostication manual is useful primarily for cheiromancy (palm reading), horoscopy,\
  \ and other methods that don't require special equipment."
