name: "Scroll of Lead Blades"
description: "Lead blades increases the momentum and density of your melee weapons\
  \ just as they strike a foe. All melee weapons you are carrying when the spell is\
  \ cast deal damage as if one size category larger than they actually are. For instance,\
  \ a Medium longsword normally deals 1d8 points of damage, but it would instead deal\
  \ 2d6 points of damage if benefiting from lead blades. Only you can benefit from\
  \ this spell. If anyone else uses one of your weapons to make an attack it deals\
  \ damage as normal for its size."
