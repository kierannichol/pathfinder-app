description: "This emerald-colored adhesive is made from animal glands, urine, and\
  \ other powerful scents that are difficult to wash off. A target splashed with it\
  \ smells like weak prey to predators. Creatures with the scent ability can detect\
  \ a marked creature at five times the normal range, note its direction as a free\
  \ action, pinpoint it when it is within 25 feet, and track it by scent with a +5\
  \ bonus on their Survival checks. Immersion in water within 1 round of exposure\
  \ washes the musk off; otherwise the effect decreases by 1 range increment per day\
  \ (four times normal range after 1 day, three times normal range after 2 days, and\
  \ so on) until the creature is again at normal scent levels. One dose of Kaava musk\
  \ costs 40 gp and weighs 1/2 lb.; the Craft (alchemy) DC to create Kaava musk is\
  \ 20. For more information on Kaava musk, see page 31."
