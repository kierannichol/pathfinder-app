description: "This heavy builder's mallet has a wooden shaft and a head made from\
  \ shiny black iron that turns slightly red when held close to metal. The wielder\
  \ of the mallet can, as a fullround action, swing the hammer to create and immediately\
  \ hammer into place a copper nail, iron spike, iron piton, or 4-foot wooden fence\
  \ post. A created fence post can penetrate earth, and the other materials can penetrate\
  \ earth, wood, or stone. Removing the created item from the surface destroys it,\
  \ but otherwise the item lasts as long as a normal object of its sort. The mallet\
  \ can create up to 100 items per day."
