description: "Crafted of overlaid bronze, steel, and chain, each Vudran Ashak helmet\
  \ is a work of art. These exotic helmets possess three stylized faces, each serene\
  \ visage staring in a different direction (with the wearer's face concealed behind\
  \ the central sculpted plate). The helm allows the wearer to see in every direction,\
  \ granting him immunity to being flanked, as well as granting a +4 enhancement bonus\
  \ on all vision-based Perception checks.\nOne in every 10 Vudran Ashak helmets is\
  \ an intelligent magical item, having spontaneously manifested such properties after\
  \ the deaths of heroically devoted former wearers. Such helms are lawful good, speak\
  \ Vudran, and have an ego score of 10. These lingering personalities prove noble,\
  \ knowledgable of Vudra's diverse deities, and actively encourage wearers to defend\
  \ the holy places of such gods and their devout worshipers. Some might even possess\
  \ goals from their lives that they wish their new wearer to fulfill. Despite any\
  \ of the helmet's desires, though, it possesses no way to compel a wearer other\
  \ than deactivating or reactivating its magical properties at will."
