description: "Horses, donkeys, mules, and ponies can graze in some regions to sustain\
  \ themselves, but feed provides more reliable nourishment. Riding dogs and other\
  \ carnivores can be fed meat for the same cost. Except for horses, other Large creatures\
  \ need to eat twice the feed of other animals each day. Huge creatures need four\
  \ times the feed."
