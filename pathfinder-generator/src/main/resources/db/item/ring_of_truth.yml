description: "Deceptively pleasant-looking, a ring of truth bears images of childlike\
  \ angels and broadly smiling divine creatures holding onto links of a heavy chain.\
  \ The wearer of this cursed ring is rendered unable to tell a deliberate lie, in\
  \ either speech or writing. The wearer may simply omit the truth or choose not to\
  \ communicate, but even then must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw to avoid\
  \ answering a direct question truthfully. The wearer cannot remove the ring unless\
  \ the magic of the curse is negated."
