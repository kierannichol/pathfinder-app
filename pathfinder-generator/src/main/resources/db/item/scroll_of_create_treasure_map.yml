name: "Scroll of Create Treasure Map"
description: "You can take a piece from a dead creature's body and use it to create\
  \ a map that reveals the locations of any valuables that creature knew about while\
  \ still alive. You must cut this piece off yourself and the creature cannot have\
  \ died more than 24 hours prior to the casting of this spell. You cannot cast this\
  \ spell on a creature without a physical body, and the portion you remove must have\
  \ a fairly level surface such as a piece of hide, carapace, or skin. The map you\
  \ create is accurate to the best knowledge the creature had at the time of its death.\
  \ It reveals the location of one source of treasure for every three caster levels\
  \ you possess. Any inaccuracies or faulty information held by the creature are represented\
  \ on the map as well. Similarly, the map cannot account for any changes that occur\
  \ after the creature's death. You must choose the scale of the map when creating\
  \ it, opting between nearby (e.g., one or two dungeon levels), local (e.g., a valley\
  \ or community), or broad (e.g., a country or larger). The map reveals the locations\
  \ of what the creature deemed most valuable within its area. Depending on the creature,\
  \ the map might reveal a source of tasty food, suitable mates, or even your own\
  \ treasure vault."
