description: "Cooled in baths of holy water after its forging, this +1 silver stake\
  \ (see the Advanced Player's Guide) is often used by devout warriors to slay vampires.\
  \ When driven through a helpless vampire's heart, the stake emits a constant hallow\
  \ effect centered on the slain vampire (whoever placed the stake can choose to fix\
  \ a spell effect to the stake as a full-round action; otherwise follow the rules\
  \ in the hallow spell description in the Core Rulebook).\nOnce a stake of the righteous\
  \ has been driven into a vampire's heart, only creatures that share the original\
  \ slayer's alignment can easily remove it. Other creatures may attempt to remove\
  \ the stake by making a DC 14 Charisma check; a creature that fails this check takes\
  \ 2d6 points of damage as holy energy courses through the weapon, and it cannot\
  \ attempt to remove the stake again for 24 hours."
