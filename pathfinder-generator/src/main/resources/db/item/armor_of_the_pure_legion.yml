description: "The plates of this suit of +1 steel lamellar armor are etched with the\
  \ complete Laws of Man from the secular nation of Rahadoum. Suits of armor of the\
  \ Pure Legion are created for high-ranking members in the eponymous organization\
  \ and grant protection against the two most common scourges of Rahadoum: divine\
  \ magic and desert heat. Such armor grants its wearer spell resistance against divine\
  \ spells equal to 5 + the wearer's base attack bonus. It also protects the wearer\
  \ from heat dangers as if she were affected by a continuous endure elements spell.\
  \ Additionally, once per day when the wearer of a suit of armor of the Pure Legion\
  \ fails a Will save against a mindeffecting spell cast by a divine spellcaster,\
  \ she can attempt another save as a free action on the following round to end the\
  \ spell."
