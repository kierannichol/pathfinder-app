description: "Emberchill is a +1 frost sickle whose cruel blade is crafted entirely\
  \ of magical ice. The weapon itself is immune to fire damage. It is believed that\
  \ one of Irrisen's past queens originally forged Emberchill, and over the succeeding\
  \ centuries, tradition has kept the weapon in the hands of the White Witches, such\
  \ as its current wielder, Nazhena Vasilliovna. A spellcaster can store a single\
  \ spell of any level with the cold descriptor and a casting time of one standard\
  \ action in Emberchill. The wielder can use the stored spell to counterspell any\
  \ spell with the fire descriptor, provided that the stored cold spell is 1 or more\
  \ levels higher than the target fire spell (unless the cold spell specifically counters\
  \ the fire spell). The wielder must still ready an action and succeed at a Spellcraft\
  \ check to identify the spell to counterspell it. Once stored in the weapon, the\
  \ cold spell cannot be used for any other purpose, but the wielder can harmlessly\
  \ discharge the stored spell as a swift action to make room for another spell. Abilities\
  \ that grant the cold descriptor to spells, such as the frozen caress hex of the\
  \ winter witch archetype, make those spells suitable for storing within Emberchill."
