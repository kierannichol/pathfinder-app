description: "This short, slender rod appears to be crafted from solid iron, though\
  \ it is incredibly light. In this shortened form, the rod has no powers. However,\
  \ when the wielder pushes a small button on one end of the rod (a move action),\
  \ the rod springs open to a 5-foot length, and its powers become available for use.\n\
  Once extended, the rod possesses several powers that add to the wielder's acrobatic\
  \ abilities. The wielder of the rod receives a +10 competence bonus on all Acrobatics\
  \ checks involving long jumps and high jumps; additionally, the wielder covers double\
  \ the normal distance for a jump when making an Acrobatics check. The individual\
  \ holding the rod also gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC when fighting defensively instead\
  \ of the usual +2 bonus. Also, while using this item, the user of the rod cannot\
  \ be knocked prone, and takes only half damage from falling. A rod of balance emits\
  \ a faint aura of the abjuration and transmutation schools."
