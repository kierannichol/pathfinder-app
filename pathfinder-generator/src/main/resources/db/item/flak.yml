description: "Flak ammunition is a type of short-fused bomb, specifically designed\
  \ to explode in midair. Flak ammunition is packed with steel balls and black powder,\
  \ and may be fired from a bombard or catapult. When flak explodes, it deals 4d6\
  \ points of piercing and bludgeoning damage to all creatures and objects within\
  \ 40 feet of the target square. A flak bomb must reach an altitude of at least 50\
  \ feet to function properly. If flak ammunition impacts anything before it reaches\
  \ this altitude, the bomb deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage and fails to explode."
