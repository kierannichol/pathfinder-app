description: "The head of this +1 heavy flail looks like a human skull with wicked\
  \ spikes growing out of it. At will, the wielder can affect a creature struck by\
  \ the obliviating flail with lesser confusion as a free action (a successful DC\
  \ 11 Will saving throw negates this effect). If the struck opponent fails its save\
  \ against the lesser confusion effect, the wielder of the obliviating flail is automatically\
  \ affected by this effect as well (no saving throw). If the wielder uses the flail\
  \ to perform a coup de grace and successfully kills her target, she gains 1d4 temporary\
  \ hit points, which last for 1 minute per HD of the target slain."
