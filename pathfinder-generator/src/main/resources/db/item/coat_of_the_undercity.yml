description: "This dirty, tattered-looking gray coat would not look out of place wrapped\
  \ around a drifter or vagrant. When the wearer speaks the command word, the coat\
  \ of the undercity shifts into a wave of clacking chitin, transforming the wearer\
  \ into a giant cockroach (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 58) as vermin shape I. This\
  \ transformation can occur only in an urban environment. The wearer can remain transformed\
  \ for up to 5 minutes per day. This duration doesn't need to be consecutive, but\
  \ must be used in 1-minute increments."
