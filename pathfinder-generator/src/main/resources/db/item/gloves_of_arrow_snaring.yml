description: "Once worn, these snug gloves seem to meld with the hands, becoming almost\
  \ invisible to casual observation. Twice per day, the wearer can act as if he had\
  \ the Snatch Arrows feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites for the feat.\
  \ Both gloves must be worn for the magic to be effective, and at least one hand\
  \ must be free to take advantage of the magic."
