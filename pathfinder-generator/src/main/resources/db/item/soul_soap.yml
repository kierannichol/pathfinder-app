description: "This small bar of coarse gray soap has tiny pieces of ash, coal, or\
  \ hard earth embedded in it, leaving anyone washed with it as dirty as before. Washing\
  \ a creature with the soap requires water and takes 1 minute, after which the creature\
  \ can attempt a new Will saving throw against any hostile ongoing mind-affecting\
  \ effect currently affecting it. Unwilling creatures must be pinned or otherwise\
  \ made helpless before they can be washed. The soap is sufficient to wash one creature."
