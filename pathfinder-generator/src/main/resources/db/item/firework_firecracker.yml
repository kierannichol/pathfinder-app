description: "These small paper or cloth cylinders or spheres are filled with a tiny\
  \ charge of black powder. One round after lighting a firecracker in an adjacent\
  \ square, the firework detonates with a loud bang, dealing 1d2+1 points of nonlethal\
  \ damage to any creatures in the square and deafening them for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude\
  \ DC 11 halves damage and duration of deafness). The bang also causes unintelligent\
  \ animals within 20 feet of it to become frightened for 1d3 rounds; an animal can\
  \ overcome this effect with a successful DC 11 Will save or if an adjacent ally\
  \ calms the animal with a successful DC 11 Handle Animal check (an immediate action)."
