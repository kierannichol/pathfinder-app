description: "This small harp is made from a sprite's twisted, leathery corpse, its\
  \ arms and legs arching up to hold the crossbar along the instrument's top. The\
  \ strings are made from thin strips of twisted flesh flayed from the fey's torso\
  \ and strung between their anchor points on the corpse and the crossbar. Though\
  \ the corpse's chest cavity is clearly visible, all viscera have been removed.\n\
  A skin harp functions as a masterwork harp. In addition, once per day, it can be\
  \ activated to cast either command undead or dominate person (Will DC 19 negates).\
  \ With a successful DC 20 Perform (string instruments) check, the save DC for this\
  \ effect increases by +2. When used in this manner, the harp animates and plays\
  \ itself, the corpse freeing one hand from the crossbar in order to strum its flesh\
  \ strings."
