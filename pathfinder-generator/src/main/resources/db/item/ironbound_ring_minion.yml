description: "While holding one or more minion's ironbound rings, the wearer of a\
  \ master's ironbound ring can impart instructions of 50 words or fewer to each minion's\
  \ ironbound rings. The wearer of a minion's ironbound ring can recall the instructions\
  \ at will and is aware of any action that would cause him to act against those instructions.\
  \ The DC of any skill check attempted to force the wearer to abandon, misinterpret,\
  \ or consciously fail the instructions increases by 5, such as for Bluff checks\
  \ to trick the wearer or Intimidate checks to interrogate him. The wearer gains\
  \ a +3 resistance bonus on Will saves to resist spells and effects that would force\
  \ him to act against the instructions, such as dominate person and suggestion."
