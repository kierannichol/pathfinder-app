description: "A band of golden skulls encircles this golden crown, and smaller skulls\
  \ top its points. Forged for the first Hurricane King, Turpin Irons, when he sailed\
  \ out of the Eye of Abendego more than 100 years ago to claim rulership over the\
  \ Shackles, the Hurricane Crown has been passed down (or taken by force) from one\
  \ Hurricane King to the next ever since. On command, the Hurricane Crown changes\
  \ its shape and appearance to assume the form of a normal piece of headwear (such\
  \ as a hat or scarf). The crown retains all its properties (including weight) when\
  \ so disguised. Only a true seeing spell or similar magic reveals the true nature\
  \ of the crown when disguised.\nThe wearer of the Hurricane Crown gains a +5 competence\
  \ bonus on Profession (sailor) checks and Survival checks made to determine direction\
  \ or predict the weather at sea, and he can see normally through fog, mist, smoke,\
  \ and precipitation or weather effects, whether natural or magical. Once per day,\
  \ the wearer can cast control winds; if the wearer is standing on a ship, the ship\
  \ and any creatures aboard it are unaffected by the controlled winds unless the\
  \ wearer wishes to affect them, even if the ship's area is larger than the spell's\
  \ unaffected area. In addition, once per day, the wearer of the Hurricane Crown\
  \ can surround himself in either a shroud of elemental water or supernatural winds,\
  \ as the seamantle or winds of vengeance spells (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's\
  \ Guide 241, 256).\nLastly, the wearer of the Hurricane Crown can create a single-use\
  \ phase door in the rock of Lucrehold to access the sea caves and Hidden Harbor\
  \ beneath the island (see page 26). If the crown's wearer is standing on a ship,\
  \ the phase door is large enough to accommodate the ship and any creatures on it.\
  \ The phase door remains invisible and inaccessible to all other creatures and ships,\
  \ and otherwise functions as a normal phase door. This ability can be used at will."
