description: "This +1 rallying heavy steel shield prominently displays the sword emblem\
  \ of the god Iomedae, and functions as a holy symbol for her worshipers. When using\
  \ this shield, the wearer reduces the extra damage she takes from anarchic weapons,\
  \ smite good, smite law, and unholy weapons by her tier, to a minimum of 0. When\
  \ its wearer uses the smite evil class feature, she can expend one use of mythic\
  \ power to extend the deflection bonus to AC she gains against her target to all\
  \ allies in a 10-foot-radius burst centered on her. This bonus lasts for 1 minute\
  \ or until the smite evil ends, whichever comes first."
