description: "Three types of rings of the beast exist; all three appear as yellowed\
  \ bone carved in the shapes of wild beasts devouring their own tails. The type of\
  \ beast depicted on each ring depends on the ring's nature, but could be a wolf\
  \ (ring of the relentless beast), a rhinoceros (ring of the savage beast), or a\
  \ tiger (ring of the swift beast). Once per day, a ring of the beast can be activated\
  \ as a standard action to unleash the primal spirit hidden inside even the most\
  \ peaceful creatures. When the ring is activated, the wearer gains a bonus to a\
  \ single physical attribute and a penalty to a single mental attribute for 10 minutes,\
  \ as determined by the type of ring. A ring of the relentless beast grants a +4\
  \ enhancement bonus to Constitution and a –2 penalty to Charisma. A ring of the\
  \ savage beast grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and a –2 penalty to Intelligence.\
  \ A ring of the swift beast grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity and a –2\
  \ penalty to Wisdom. As long as the effects of this ring are active, the wearer\
  \ also gains a +2 enhancement bonus to his natural armor bonus."
