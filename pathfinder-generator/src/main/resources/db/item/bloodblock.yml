description: "This gooey, pinkish substance helps treat wounds. Using a dose gives\
  \ you a +5 alchemical bonus on Heal checks for providing first aid, treating wounds\
  \ made by caltrops or similar objects, or treating deadly wounds. A dose of bloodblock\
  \ ends a bleed effect as if you had made a DC 15 Heal check. When treating deadly\
  \ wounds, using a dose of bloodblock counts as one use of a healer's kit (and grants\
  \ the +5 bonus stated above)."
