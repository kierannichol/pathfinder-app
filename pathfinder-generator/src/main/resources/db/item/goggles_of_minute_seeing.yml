description: "The lenses of this item are made of special crystal, its band woven\
  \ with tiny patterns of metallic thread almost invisible to the naked eye. When\
  \ placed over the eyes of the wearer, the lenses enable her to see much better than\
  \ normal at distances of 1 foot or less, granting her a +5 competence bonus on Disable\
  \ Device checks. Both lenses must be worn for the magic to be effective."
