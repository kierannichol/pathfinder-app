description: "The kestros is an oddly shaped Bronze Age sling used for launching kestros\
  \ darts. Your Strength modifier applies on damage rolls when you use a kestros,\
  \ just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire—but not load—a kestros with one\
  \ hand. Loading a kestros is a move action that requires two hands and provokes\
  \ attacks of opportunity. Halflings treat the kestros as a martial weapon."
