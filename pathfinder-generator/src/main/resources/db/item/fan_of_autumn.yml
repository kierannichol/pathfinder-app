description: "This delicate fan is made of dried leaves and thin twigs. Three times\
  \ per day as a standard action, the wielder can wave the fan to summon forth a 30-foot\
  \ cone of swirling red and gold leaves that lasts for 3 rounds. This area acts as\
  \ obscuring mist, except for the duration and the fact it is composed of leaves\
  \ rather than fog (thus, creatures able to see through mist and fog can't see through\
  \ the fan of autumn's concealment). As long as the wielder has the fan in her hand,\
  \ the leaves don't obscure her vision."
