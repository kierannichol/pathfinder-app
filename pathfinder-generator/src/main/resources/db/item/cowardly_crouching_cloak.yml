description: "This nondescript gray cloak has a hood that can fit over the wearer's\
  \ entire face. The wearer can, as a move action, cover his face and drop to a huddling\
  \ crouch. Any creature seeking to directly attack him while he does this must make\
  \ a DC 11 Will save to do so (as the sanctuary spell). The wearer cannot see or\
  \ take any actions while crouching. This makes him effectively blind, with all the\
  \ normal penalties, but not helpless. The wearer can end his crouch simply by standing\
  \ up or moving."
