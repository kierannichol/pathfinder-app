description: "These unpleasant-tasting, alchemically grown crystals release breathable\
  \ air when chewed. A pouch of air crystals provides 1 minute of breathable air.\
  \ Placing air crystals in your mouth takes a standard action; chewing them each\
  \ round is a free action. Any attempt to speak while chewing air crystals negates\
  \ any remaining duration."
