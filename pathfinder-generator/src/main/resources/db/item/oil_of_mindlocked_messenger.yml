description: "You speak a short message (up to 10 words per caster level), implanting\
  \ both it and the identity of the message's intended recipient in the mind of a\
  \ willing creature. The creature is aware of the message and who the recipient is.\
  \ Any attempt to speak, write, or otherwise communicate the message to anyone other\
  \ than its intended recipient causes the target to forget the message for 1d6 minutes.\
  \ Attempts to read the target's mind (such as with detect thoughts) or to force\
  \ the target to reveal the message (such as with torture or magical compulsion)\
  \ likewise cause temporary amnesia regarding the message."
