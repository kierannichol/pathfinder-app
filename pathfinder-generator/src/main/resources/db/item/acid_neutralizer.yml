description: "This alkaline salt counteracts the properties of oozes' acid. You can\
  \ apply acid neutralizer to a piece of equipment such as a weapon or shield as a\
  \ move action. For 1 minute afterward, any acid damage that would be dealt to the\
  \ protected equipment is reduced by 5 points. This does not reduce acid damage dealt\
  \ to you or unprotected equipment.\nYou can apply a dose of acid neutralizer to\
  \ an adjacent ooze creature by emptying the container on it. Treat this as a ranged\
  \ touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. When used in this way,\
  \ acid neutralizer prevents the ooze creature from dealing acid damage (assuming\
  \ it is normally able to do so) for 1 round."
