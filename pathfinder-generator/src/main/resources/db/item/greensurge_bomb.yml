description: "A greensurge bomb is a small, magically and alchemically treated plant\
  \ bulb with a root growth that forms a handle. The bomb can be thrown like a splash\
  \ weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. When the bomb strikes the ground, it\
  \ bursts open, scattering weeds in a 10-foot radius. At the beginning of the thrower's\
  \ next turn, the weeds rapidly grow into thick undergrowth, creating an area of\
  \ difficult terrain. The weeds flourish regardless of the surrounding natural terrain\
  \ (even in urban settings or on hard rock floors) but don't grow on damaging surfaces,\
  \ such as pools of lava or acid. The new vegetation lasts for 5 minutes before it\
  \ turns brown and crumbles to dust."
