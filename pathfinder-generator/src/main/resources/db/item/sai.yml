description: "A sai is a metal spike flanked by a pair of prongs used to trap an enemy's\
  \ weapon. When wielding a sai, you get a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to sunder\
  \ an enemy's weapon. Though pointed, a sai is not usually used for stabbing. Instead,\
  \ it is used primarily to bludgeon foes, punching with the hilt, or else to catch\
  \ and disarm weapons between its tines. Sais are often wielded in pairs."
