description: "This mithral zip-line hook is attached to a black leather strap with\
  \ a bronze buckle shaped like a spider. When the hook is attached to a rope, a cable,\
  \ or a similar object, the user can move along the rope at a speed of 30 feet per\
  \ move action, regardless of the rope's slope or inclination; a hook of ascension\
  \ can even carry its user straight up vertical ropes in this manner. Furthermore,\
  \ the user doesn't need to attempt Climb checks while using a hook of ascension\
  \ to climb a rope, and this movement does not constitute vigorous motion for the\
  \ purpose of casting spells. The hook can even be commanded to stop mid-travel,\
  \ suspending its user in midair along the rope's path without risk of falling."
