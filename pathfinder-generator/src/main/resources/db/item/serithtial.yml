description: "Serithtial is a +4 holy bastard sword crafted, it is said, by Iomedae\
  \ herself as a gift to Mandraivus's great-grandfather, a man who led several crusades\
  \ against Nidal. The sword was handed down through the generations, finally coming\
  \ into the hands of a well-respected hero of Lastwall— Mandraivus. Serithtial was\
  \ the perfect weapon for Mandraivus's assault on Scarwall, and some scholars of\
  \ history now believe that Iomedae had foreseen its need and forged it early to\
  \ ensure that Mandraivus not only would inherit it, but would respect its traditions\
  \ all the more.\nAlthough made of steel, Serithtial is treated as if made of both\
  \ cold iron and silver for the purpose of penetrating damage reduction. Serithtial\
  \ glows with the equivalent of a continual flame, but its wielder can extinguish\
  \ or ignite this glow as a move action. In addition, it gains a further +2 enhancement\
  \ bonus and deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against foes who serve or worship\
  \ Zon-Kuthon, as if it had the bane weapon special ability against such foes. This\
  \ effect also functions against Queen Ileosa and those who directly serve her—including\
  \ creatures like the dragon Zarmangarof (who serves her under magical compulsion)\
  \ and the Red Mantis assassins (who serve as paid mercenaries). While Serithtial\
  \ was forged as a bastard sword and reverts to this shape when no one wields it,\
  \ when held in the hand, the sword immediately transforms into the type of blade\
  \ its owner is most proficient with (choosing from dagger, short sword, longsword,\
  \ scimitar, falchion, greatsword, rapier, or bastard sword—the GM can add additional\
  \ sword-like weapons as she sees fit).\nSerithtial can cast cure moderate wounds\
  \ and zone of truth three times per day each, and usually reserves its healing power\
  \ to use on its wielder when he is reduced to 1/4 his total hit points.\nSerithtial's\
  \ wielder gains the benefits of death ward and freedom of movement against attacks\
  \ and effects generated by followers of Zon-Kuthon (and by extension, Queen Ileosa\
  \ and her followers).\nAlthough Serithtial is lawful good, as long as its wielder\
  \ is dedicated to the defeat of Kazavon and those he has corrupted (such as Queen\
  \ Ileosa), the sword does not attempt to seize control of its wielder. If its wielder\
  \ does go against its wishes, Serithtial tries to force him to relinquish the blade\
  \ to a more appropriate wielder. As with all holy weapons, Serithtial imposes 1\
  \ negative level on any evil creature attempting to wield it. The negative level\
  \ remains as long as the creature holds the weapon in its hand and disappears when\
  \ the weapon is no longer wielded. A worshiper of Zon-Kuthon who wields Serithtial\
  \ takes 4 negative levels and is nauseated as long as these negative levels persist.\
  \ The negative levels and any additional side effects cannot be overcome in any\
  \ way (including by restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded."
destruction: "Serithtial can be destroyed only if Kazavon—restored to life—or a great\
  \ wyrm shadow dragon worshiper of Zon-Kuthon uses its breath weapon on the blade\
  \ while Serithtial is unattended."
