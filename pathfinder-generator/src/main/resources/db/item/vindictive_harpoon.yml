description: "This +1 returning harpoon (Pirates of the Inner Sea 18) is made from\
  \ the jagged, scrimshaw-carved tusk of a narwhal attached to a 50-foot length of\
  \ woven sinew. Unlike most thrown weapons, a vindictive harpoon functions as well\
  \ underwater as on land, and its wielder takes no penalties on attack rolls underwater."
