description: "These crude straps are used to secure a goblin or other small creature\
  \ to the underside of a dire bat (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 30) or giant vulture (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Bestiary 3 284). These straps count as an exotic riding saddle. If the mount\
  \ fails a Fly check, there's a 50% chance the straps break and the rider falls.\
  \ Masterwork flying straps count as an exotic military saddle, and don't have a\
  \ chance to break if the mount fails a Fly check."
