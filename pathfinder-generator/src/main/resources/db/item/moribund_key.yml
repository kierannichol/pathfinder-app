description: "Greater agents of the Whispering Way use these silver medallions as\
  \ keys to their sanctuaries. Each moribund key bears an engraved skull with two\
  \ gray, burned-out ioun stones for eyes. Small openings line the coin's outer edge.\
  \ By turning the skull's head, an inner plate marked with runic symbols lines up\
  \ with these openings to establish different combinations. Each setting matches\
  \ symbols inscribed on objects of great importance to the cult, such as statues,\
  \ paintings, and doors. The proper arrangement of these runes activates stored spell\
  \ effects in such objects, including powerful wards, programmed images, or the release\
  \ of arcane locks. The bearer of a moribund key can cast message at will, and spectral\
  \ hand and vampiric touch 3 times per day. In addition, the skull's eyes glow when\
  \ undead approach within 60 feet. A moribund key bestows one negative level on any\
  \ good creature carrying it. The negative level remains as long as the medallion\
  \ is carried and cannot be overcome in any way while the medallion is in that creature's\
  \ possession."
