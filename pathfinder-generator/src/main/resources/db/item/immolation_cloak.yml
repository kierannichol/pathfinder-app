description: "An immolation cloak grants its wearer resist fire 20. As a swift action,\
  \ the wearer can command the cloak to burst into flame, providing the benefits of\
  \ a fire shield (warm flames only). The wearer can dismiss the flames as a free\
  \ action. The cloak can be used for a maximum of 10 rounds per day, which don't\
  \ have to be consecutive.\nBy expending one use of mythic power, the cloak's wearer\
  \ can recharge its immolation abilities. In addition, the wearer can expend one\
  \ use of mythic power to detonate in a fiery explosion, dealing 1d8 points of fire\
  \ damage per character level in a 30-foot-radius spread. A successful Reflex save\
  \ (DC 10 + the wearer's mythic tier + the wearer's Charisma modifier) halves this\
  \ damage. Though apparently destroyed in the explosion, the wearer reforms just\
  \ prior to the start of his next turn in the space he exploded in (or the nearest\
  \ open space if that space is unavailable)."
