description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis parchment scroll is a legal contract detailing\
  \ terms of service between the signatories. Until the scroll is signed, its owner\
  \ can modify the contract as she sees fit. Once signed, the contract places all\
  \ signatories under a special geas that forces them to uphold their end of the contract,\
  \ although creatures cannot be forced to sign this contract while under magical\
  \ compulsions or other mental influences. This special geas ends for a signatory\
  \ only if that signatory completes his agreed-upon terms, if the terms become impossible\
  \ to fulfill, or via a miracle or a wish. Other means that would normally remove\
  \ a geas, such as break enchantment, automatically fail."
