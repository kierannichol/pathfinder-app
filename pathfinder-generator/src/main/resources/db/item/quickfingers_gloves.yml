description: "These dark-colored, skin-tight gloves are typically made of either supple\
  \ calfskin or silk. A wearer of these gloves with at least 1 rank in Sleight of\
  \ Hand can perform such a check as a move action by taking a –10 penalty on the\
  \ check rather than the normal –20. Both gloves must be worn for the magic to be\
  \ effective."
