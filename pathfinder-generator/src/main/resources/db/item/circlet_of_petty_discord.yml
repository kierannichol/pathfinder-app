description: "Once per day, when the wearer of this delicate silver crown casts a\
  \ spell from the charm subschool, he can add a subtle compulsion to the effect.\
  \ All targets affected by the spell must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or\
  \ become incredibly frustrated with their allies. For the next 10 rounds, affected\
  \ targets still recognize their allies (and do not attack them), but they cannot\
  \ treat them as allies when determining movement or flanking, nor can they use any\
  \ feats (including teamwork feats), spells, abilities, or effects that allow them\
  \ to target allies or use allies to gain beneficial effects, nor can they be the\
  \ targets of such friendly effects. Affected targets also cannot aid another."
