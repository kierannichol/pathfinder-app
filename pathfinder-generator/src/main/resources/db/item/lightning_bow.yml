description: "This intelligent item is called a lightning bow by mortals, a name is\
  \ seen as a slight to the lightning elemental trapped within it—a creature honor-bound\
  \ to serve in the bow for no less than 100 years. Each of these +3 adaptive composite\
  \ longbows is a haughty and often highly intelligent member of its race, who chides\
  \ those who don't know its true name— which is often a complicated series of high\
  \ pitched squeaks, like live wood burning on a pyre. The elemental in a lightning\
  \ bow only speaks Auran. Lightning bows will not fire on other outsiders with the\
  \ elemental subtype. Some are also bound not to attack other individuals, based\
  \ on their history. For instance, one of these bows might be foresworn not to attack\
  \ the Sultan of Fire, fire giants, or red dragons. Additionally, lightning bows\
  \ have the following powers."
