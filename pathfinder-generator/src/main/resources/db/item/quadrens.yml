description: "A quadrens looks similar to a sturdy dagger, but with four spikes mounted\
  \ in a square pattern in place of a blade. When you score a critical hit with a\
  \ quadrens, the resulting gaping wound causes 1 point of bleed damage. In addition\
  \ to punching through hide and armor, the spikes can also be used to snag opponents'\
  \ blades and twist them out of their grips."
