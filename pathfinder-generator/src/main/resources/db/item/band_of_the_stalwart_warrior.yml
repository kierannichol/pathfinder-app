description: "This plain iron band protects its wearer from fear effects. Whenever\
  \ the wearer suffers a fear effect, she is merely shaken (even if the effect would\
  \ normally make the target frightened or panicked). Furthermore, the subject gains\
  \ a +2 competence bonus on all Will saves against fear. If the wearer has the bravery\
  \ class feature, she is considered four levels higher when determining that class\
  \ feature's effect."
