description: "The head of a barbed arrow resembles that of a harpoon. When a barbed\
  \ arrow is attached to a length of silk rope and fired from a bow, the arrow's range\
  \ increment is reduced to 30 feet, but it gains the grapple special weapon quality\
  \ (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 22). Barbed bolts exist for crossbows."
