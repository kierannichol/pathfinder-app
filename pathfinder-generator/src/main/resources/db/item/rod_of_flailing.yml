description: "Upon the command of its possessor, this rod activates, changing from\
  \ a normal-seeming rod to a +3/+3 dire flail. The dire flail is a double weapon,\
  \ which means that each of the weapon's heads can be used to attack. The wielder\
  \ can gain an extra attack (with the second head) at the cost of making all attacks\
  \ at a â€“2 penalty (as if she had the Two- Weapon Fighting feat).\nOnce per day,\
  \ the wielder can use a free action to cause the rod to grant her a +4 deflection\
  \ bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws for 10 minutes. The rod\
  \ need not be in weapon form to grant this benefit.\nTransforming a rod of flailing\
  \ into a weapon or back into a rod is a move action."
