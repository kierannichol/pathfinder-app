description: "Armor vents can be built into a suit of medium or heavy armor to allow\
  \ for better ventilation and reduce the wearer's fatigue in hot environs. The vents\
  \ can be slid open at the discretion of the user to ensure proper air flow during\
  \ the day and then closed up at night to better preserve heat. A suit of armor with\
  \ armor vents weighs 5 lbs. less than one without and imposes only a –2 penalty\
  \ (instead of –4) on Fortitude saves to avoid taking nonlethal damage from heat\
  \ exposure, but also has 10 fewer hit points than normal because of its more intricate\
  \ construction."
