description: "This leather pouch is decorated with fresh mistletoe and sprigs of holly\
  \ that are shaped to resemble the druidic symbol of the Green Faith. The pouch contains\
  \ seeds of various small plants and grasses. When the pouch is used as a divine\
  \ focus component for a spell that affects or creates plant matter—such as entangle\
  \ or spike growth —its magic manifests as the pouch opens and the seeds float out.\
  \ The seeds plant themselves in the ground and instantly grow to create any vegetation\
  \ or grass that the spell requires to function inside of the spell's area of effect.\
  \ The vegetation created by the pouch grows regardless of the terrain, and lasts\
  \ the full duration of the spell, allowing the user to cast plant-altering or plant-creating\
  \ spells in deserts, badlands, and other harsh terrains."
