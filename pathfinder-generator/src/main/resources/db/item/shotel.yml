description: "The shotel is a downward-curving sword designed to reach over or around\
  \ an opponent's shield. You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls with a shotel against\
  \ opponents using bucklers, light shields, or heavy shields. The curve of a shotel's\
  \ blade varies from sword to sword, and some models are double-edged, while others\
  \ are single-edged, with the back edge able to be braced against a shield for additional\
  \ power. Shotels are particularly useful for hooking mounted combatants and ripping\
  \ them from their steeds."
