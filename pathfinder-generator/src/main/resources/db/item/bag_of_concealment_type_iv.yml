description: "A bag of concealment appears to be a common leather sack with a shoulder\
  \ strap, about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The bag behaves as a bag of holding, with\
  \ all the same carrying capacities according to size, except for a few key points.\
  \ Each bag of concealment is keyed to a specific owner upon creation (and can only\
  \ be keyed to one person at a time)â€”should the bag's owner be killed, it becomes\
  \ keyed to the next person to open it (the currently keyed person can also relinquish\
  \ this status as a standard action, allowing another creature to become keyed to\
  \ the bag by opening it). Only the person a bag of concealment is keyed to may access\
  \ its contents. Any others who look in the bag see only the inside of an empty sack,\
  \ with dimensions matching the bag's outside measurements, as the true contents\
  \ are kept separate and undetectable in the bag's magical pocket dimension. Should\
  \ anything be placed in the empty bag by someone other than the owner, the goods\
  \ that have been shunted to the pocket dimension cannot be accessed unless the new\
  \ item is removed.\nA bag of concealment registers as nonmagical unless successfully\
  \ identified, as per a permanent version of the spell magic aura. The mouth of a\
  \ bag of concealment can be stretched to up to four times its normal width, so larger\
  \ goods may be hidden inside."
