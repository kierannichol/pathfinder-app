description: "This nondescript belt pouch is quite popular among Pathfinders who need\
  \ to smuggle items past snooping guards or government officials. Detect magic does\
  \ not detect that it is magical (as per the magic aura spell), but the pouch acts\
  \ as a very small bag of holding (contents limit 10 pounds, volume limit 2 cubic\
  \ feet).\nWith a command word, the wearer can close or open the extradimensional\
  \ space within the pouch; when closed, the pouch holds no more than a mundane belt\
  \ pouch the size of a human fist, though objects within the extradimensional space\
  \ remain stored, unreachable until the pouch is unsealed again. This allows the\
  \ user to empty his pockets or even turn the pouch inside-out to prove he carries\
  \ no contraband, and access the hidden goods later when in a safe place. Because\
  \ of their nonmagical auras, these pouches sometimes hold secret treasures for generations\
  \ without their owners realizing their nature."
