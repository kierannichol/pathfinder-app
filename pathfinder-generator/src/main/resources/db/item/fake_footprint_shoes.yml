description: "These oversized shoes are worn over normal footwear. They create footprints\
  \ or bootprints that look like those left by another creature. Each pair creates\
  \ a specific type of footprint, such as tiger, orc, goblin, or ogre. When walking\
  \ with these shoes, you may make a Survival check; the check result is the Survival\
  \ DC for anyone trying to determine whether the tracks are what they appear to be."
