description: "This strange metal headband of vast intellect +2 is crafted in the shape\
  \ of intertwined tentacles and adorned with runes in the Aboleth language. When\
  \ a creature dons the headpiece, the tentacles seem almost alive, changing their\
  \ size and shape to fit the contours of the wearer's head.\nThe headband has two\
  \ special indentations for ioun stones similar to those found in a wayfinder. When\
  \ an ioun stone is inserted into one of the slots, the tentacles animate for a moment,\
  \ adjusting themselves around the slot to accommodate the shape of the ioun stone.\
  \ The wearer benefits from the ioun stone's effect as though the stone were orbiting\
  \ her head.\nThe headband uses a more refined version of the same technology that\
  \ powers a wayfinder. First, it coaxes two ioun stones to manifest their resonant\
  \ powers simultaneously. Furthermore, the slotted ioun stones do not suppress the\
  \ headband's own magical abilities. However, if the wearer is also carrying, wearing,\
  \ or wielding a wayfinder or any similar item into which ioun stones can be inserted,\
  \ the two items suppress one another's abilities, but both return to normal when\
  \ one is set aside."
