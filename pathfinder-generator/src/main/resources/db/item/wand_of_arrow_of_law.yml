name: "Wand of Arrow of Law"
description: "You fire a shimmering arrow of pure order from your holy symbol at any\
  \ one target in range as a ranged touch attack. A chaotic creature struck by an\
  \ arrow of lawtakes 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8). A\
  \ chaotic outsider instead takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum\
  \ 10d6) and is dazed for 1 round. A successful Will save reduces the damage to half\
  \ and negates the daze effect. This spell deals only half damage to creatures that\
  \ are neither chaotic nor lawful, and they are not dazed. The arrow has no effect\
  \ on lawful creatures."
