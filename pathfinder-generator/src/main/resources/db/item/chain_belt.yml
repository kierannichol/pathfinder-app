description: "While undines dress sparingly, they often wear 10-foot-long belts of\
  \ fine linked chain about their waists. The belts contain hinged links to which\
  \ the wearer can affix various objects such as tools, small weapons, and other valuables,\
  \ including links of silver and platinum, or small hammered plates of gold set with\
  \ gems. If worn properly, the belt can hold up to 30 pounds of small items. A swimming\
  \ undine can unwrap the belt as swift action if she needs to remove it to decrease\
  \ her weight load."
