description: "This glowing violet liquid is ice-cold regardless of the surrounding\
  \ temperature. This elixir allows a character to bypass the cold immunity or cold\
  \ resistance of creatures she attacks with her magic. For 6 rounds after drinking\
  \ a truefrost elixir, a character's spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural\
  \ abilities that deal cold damage become supernaturally cold, and the damage caused\
  \ by these effects is not subject to being reduced by a creature's cold resistance.\
  \ Creatures with cold immunity take half damage from such attacks. Truefrost elixir\
  \ has no effect on cold damage from weapons, on non-cold-based effects, or against\
  \ creatures without immunity to cold or cold resistance."
