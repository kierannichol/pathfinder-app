description: "At its simplest, a quintain is a swiveling pole with a pair of arms,\
  \ although permanent quintains are more elaborate and often look like armored mannequins.\
  \ One arm holds a wooden board shaped like a shield. The other arm has a padded\
  \ flail attached. In a routine originally used to train knights, a user rides past\
  \ a quintain and tries to hit the board with a weapon, and then get out of the way\
  \ before the quintain swings around to strike him with its flail in retaliation.\
  \ Training with a quintain requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 15 Ride check. If\
  \ you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Ride checks to stay\
  \ in the saddle, guide with your knees, and control a combat-trained mount. This\
  \ bonus lasts for 24 hours or until you fail a Ride check."
