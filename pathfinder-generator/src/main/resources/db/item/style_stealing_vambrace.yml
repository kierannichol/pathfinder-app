description: "This plain silver-and-steel bracelet grants the keen weapon special\
  \ ability to any piercing or slashing weapon wielded by the wearer. Each time the\
  \ wearer confirms a critical hit with such a weapon, however, she must succeed at\
  \ a DC 17 Fortitude save or the bracelet severs her hand, dealing 1d6 points of\
  \ Dexterity drain and 2d6 points of bleed damage. The style-stealing vambrace and\
  \ the severed hand immediately teleport to the item's creator if he is on the same\
  \ plane, or else drop to the ground if he is not.\nOnce per day, a creature holding\
  \ the severed hand can speak the bracelet's command word to gain access to one combat\
  \ feat known by the previous wearer for 24 hours, as if it were a bonus feat. The\
  \ creature must meet all of the usual prerequisites for the feat.\nThe wearer's\
  \ hand can be restored instantly with a regenerate spell, or with a restoration\
  \ spell or regeneration (such as that granted by a ring of regeneration) if the\
  \ severed hand is held against the stump. Restoring the wearer's hand removes the\
  \ Dexterity drain. The style-stealing vambrace cannot be removed from the severed\
  \ hand it holds or be reused until its victim dies or the hand is reattached."
