description: "A wooden roof and walls line this horse-drawn caravan wagon. By uttering\
  \ a command word, the wagon's owner can change the color and patterns that cover\
  \ the wagon's sides, creating text or images, or can cause one wall to unfold into\
  \ a stage. The home away's interior contains foldaway beds, desks, and cupboards,\
  \ and can accommodate up to six Medium creatures. The interior is always warm and\
  \ dry regardless of outside conditions, protecting anyone within from any weather\
  \ short of hurricane-force winds.\nOnce per week, the home away's owner can pull\
  \ the wagon's kingbolt, causing it to unfurl into a 60-foot-wide tent with the same\
  \ coloration as the wagon. The owner can declare a purpose for the tent as she pulls\
  \ the bolt—such as celebration, meetings, performance, or wilderness survival—and\
  \ the tent creates bleachers, tables, beds, and other simple furniture to accommodate\
  \ this purpose."
