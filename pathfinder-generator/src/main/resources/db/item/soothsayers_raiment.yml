description: "This +1 chainmail is attuned to a particular oracular mystery and contains\
  \ a revelation associated with that mystery (see the oracle class description in\
  \ the Advanced Player's Guide). Its design and coloration are typically suggestive\
  \ of its related mystery. While wearing the armor, an oracle has access to that\
  \ revelation and may use it as if she had it as a normal class feature. The oracle\
  \ must have the appropriate mystery to use the armor; for example, a soothsayer's\
  \ raiment (battlecry) is only usable by an oracle of battle. If the wearer already\
  \ has that revelation and the revelation grants an ability with a limited number\
  \ of uses per day, the oracle can use that ability one additional time per day.\
  \ This ability has no effect if the armor is worn by a non-oracle.\nFor divination\
  \ spells with a percentage-based chance of success (such as augury and divination),\
  \ the wearer's chance increases by +5."
