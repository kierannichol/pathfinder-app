description: "The bowl of this glass water pipe can be loaded with any inhalable drug,\
  \ alchemical powder, or alchemical liquid. You must set down a hookah in a free\
  \ space (a move action) and fill the water jar with half a gallon of water (another\
  \ move action) before the hookah can be used. You can consume the contents of an\
  \ adjacent hookah by sucking on one of the pipe's four hoses as a move action. Up\
  \ to 5 doses of a single substance can be loaded in the hookah at a time, and up\
  \ to four adjacent creatures can use the hookah during the same round. Reloading\
  \ a hookah is a standard action, regardless of the number of doses so reloaded.\n\
  Substances not intended for bodily consumption can cause harmful or even fatal effects\
  \ (GM's discretion) if loaded into a hookah and inhaled, and often destroy the hookah\
  \ in the process."
