description: "This green leather cloak has blue hues and flows gently in the wind\
  \ when worn, giving the wearer the appearance of donning a cresting wave on her\
  \ shoulders. This cloak causes any liquid poisons poured onto it to immediately\
  \ crystallize and blend into the leather, providing the wearer a +5 competence bonus\
  \ on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal poisons on her person. In addition, as a\
  \ full-round action, the wearer can pour up to 3 doses of poison onto the cloak,\
  \ which requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check. A natural 1 on this check\
  \ exposes the wearer to the poison. Any poisons poured onto the cloak last for 1\
  \ hour before becoming inert. As a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity,\
  \ the wearer can scrape off the crystallized poison onto her weapon and use it as\
  \ if she had applied the poison to it normally. Doing this does not put the wearer\
  \ at risk for being poisoned."
