description: "This two-sided case contains a soft wax that readily takes and keeps\
  \ an impression of an object pressed between the two halves, creating an excellent\
  \ mold of the item. A skilled artisan may then make a copy of the item from the\
  \ mold (destroying the mold in the process). Making an impression surreptitiously\
  \ requires a DC 25 Sleight of Hand check."
