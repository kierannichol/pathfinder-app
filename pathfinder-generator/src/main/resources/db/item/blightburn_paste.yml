description: "This heavy stone box measures 2 feet to a side, and the tiny compartment\
  \ inside is lined with lead. Inside the compartment is a half-ounce of deep green\
  \ paste. This paste is made of animal fat mixed with groundup blightburn. Once the\
  \ box is opened, blightburn paste limits teleportation within 60 feet and irradiates\
  \ anyone within 60 feet, afflicting them with blightburn sickness (see sidebar for\
  \ details on both effects). Any creature that touches the paste is afflicted with\
  \ blightburn sickness (no save), and takes 2d6 points of fire damage per round until\
  \ the paste is cleaned away with a successful DC 15 Heal check. Crafting this item\
  \ requires a successful DC 30 Craft (alchemy) check."
