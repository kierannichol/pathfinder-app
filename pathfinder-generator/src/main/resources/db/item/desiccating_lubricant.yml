description: "This oily solution draws water out of living creatures (especially amorphous\
  \ creatures), simultaneously dehydrating them and drenching their surfaces with\
  \ a slick, sickly cold sweat. Desiccating lubricant can be thrown as a splash weapon\
  \ with a range increment of 10 feet. A living creature struck by a direct hit from\
  \ desiccating lubricant takes 1d4 points of nonlethal damage; a –2 penalty on combat\
  \ maneuver checks to grapple, bull rush, or disarm; and a –2 penalty to CMD against\
  \ grapple, bull rush, and disarm checks. These penalties last 1 minute. Against\
  \ ooze creatures and creatures with the water subtype, desiccating lubricant deals\
  \ 2d4 points of lethal damage and the penalties increase to –4."
