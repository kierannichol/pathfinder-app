description: "These crystal lenses fit over the user's eyes, enabling him to cast\
  \ doom upon those around him (one target per round) as a gaze attack, except that\
  \ the wearer must take a standard action, and those merely looking at the wearer\
  \ are not affected. Those failing a DC 11 Will save are affected as by the doom\
  \ spell. The wearer also gains the additional power of a continual deathwatch effect\
  \ and can use fear (Will DC 16 partial) as a normal gaze attack once per week. Both\
  \ lenses must be worn for the magic item to take effect."
