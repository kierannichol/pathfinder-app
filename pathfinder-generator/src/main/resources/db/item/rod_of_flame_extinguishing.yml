description: "This rod can extinguish Medium or smaller nonmagical fires with simply\
  \ a touch (a standard action). For the rod to be effective against other sorts of\
  \ fires, the wielder must expend 1 or more of the rod's charges.\nExtinguishing\
  \ a Large or larger nonmagical fire or a magic fire of size Medium or smaller (such\
  \ as that of a flaming weapon or a burning hands spell), expends 1 charge. Continual\
  \ magic flames, such as those generated by a weapon or a fire creature, are suppressed\
  \ for 6 rounds and flare up again after that time. To extinguish an instantaneous\
  \ fire spell, the rod must be within the area of the effect and the wielder must\
  \ have used a ready action, effectively countering the entire spell.\nWhen applied\
  \ to Large or larger magic fires, such as those caused by fireball, flame strike,\
  \ or wall of fire, extinguishing the flames expends 2 charges from the rod.\nIf\
  \ a rod of flame extinguishing is touched to a creature with the fire subtype by\
  \ making a successful melee touch attack, the rod deals 6d6 points of damage to\
  \ the creature. This use requires 3 charges.\nA rod of flame extinguishing has 10\
  \ charges when found. Spent charges are renewed every day, so that a wielder can\
  \ expend up to 10 charges in any 24-hour period."
