  \ usefulness is revealed only when it's worn. When a person dons the mask, she instantly\
  \ assumes the appearance of single specific Small or Medium humanoid creature. Each\
  \ mask has a single \"face\" that can't be changed once the item is created. This\
  \ effect otherwise works as disguise self."
