name: "Oil of Penumbral Disguise"
description: "You mask your features with shadowy illumination, gaining a competence\
  \ bonus equal to your caster level on Disguise checks and Stealth checks attempted\
  \ while in normal light, dim light, or darkness. In addition, creatures that see\
  \ you while you are in dim light or darkness are unable to discern any but the most\
  \ general information about your appearance or actions. For example, they can determine\
  \ your general shape (such as humanoid), as well as the gist of your actions (such\
  \ as, â€œShe was trying to break into the store\"), but cannot determine your precise\
  \ actions, your appearance, or any identifying information about you. In bright\
  \ light, your normal appearance is revealed."
