description: "This vivid green gel instantly crystallizes into needle-like shards\
  \ upon contact with the air. You can throw a flask of shard gel as a splash weapon.\
  \ A direct hit deals 1d4 points of piercing damage as the shards penetrate the target's\
  \ flesh. The target's square and each square adjacent to it are covered in shards\
  \ that function like caltrops. The caltrops last for 5 rounds before dissolving\
  \ into harmless green sludge. Any effect that deals sonic damage to an area (such\
  \ as sound burst or shout) immediately destroys all gel shards in that area. Crafting\
  \ a flask of shard gel is a DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
