description: "Scale mail is made up of dozens of small, overlapping metal plates.\
  \ Similar to both splint mail and banded mail, scalemail has a flexible arrangement\
  \ of scales in an attempt to avoid hindering the wearer's mobility, but at the expense\
  \ of omitting additional protective layers of armor. A suit of scale mail includes\
  \ gauntlets."
