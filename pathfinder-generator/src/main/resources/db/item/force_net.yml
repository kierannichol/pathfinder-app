description: "The threads of this +1 ghost touch net are made of silver and magical\
  \ force. The net has 15 hit points and can be burst with a successful DC 30 Strength\
  \ check (a full-round action). The net can be used to entrap an incorporeal or gaseous\
  \ creature, which can attempt a DC 20 Escape Artist check to get out. If a spirit\
  \ creature possessing a body, such as a vetala, is trapped in the net, it cannot\
  \ abandon its physical host unless it escapes or bursts the net."
