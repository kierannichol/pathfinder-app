description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis cap is adorned with seven brightly colored\
  \ feathers of various types. Each feather imbues the cap's wearer with knowledge\
  \ of one language; these languages are fixed for each translator's cap.\nIf the\
  \ wearer is human, she can give a feather to an ally to allow that ally to use tongues\
  \ for as long as he carries the feather on his person. Removing the feather removes\
  \ the language of the wearer's choice from the cap's repertoire. A removed feather\
  \ works for 1 day before turning to dust, and the cap loses its power when the last\
  \ feather is gone. The price for the cap includes all seven feathers, and drops\
  \ by 2,000 gp per missing feather."
