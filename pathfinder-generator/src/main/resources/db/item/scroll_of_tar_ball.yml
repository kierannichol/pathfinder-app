name: "Scroll of Tar Ball"
description: "You create a sticky ball of burning tar that you can hurl at your enemies\
  \ as a ranged attack. If the tar ball strikes, it deals 1d4 points of fire damage\
  \ + your Strength modifier, and splashes the target with hot, sticky tar. The tar\
  \ deals 1d4 points of fire damage each round on the creature's turn for the next\
  \ 1d4 rounds and gives the target a â€“2 penalty to Dexterity for that duration. If\
  \ desired, the target can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish or cool\
  \ the tar before taking this additional damage. Extinguishing or cooling the tar\
  \ requires a DC 15 Reflex save or at least 1 gallon of nonflammable liquid. Rolling\
  \ on the ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a lake\
  \ or magically cooling the target automatically ends the effect."
