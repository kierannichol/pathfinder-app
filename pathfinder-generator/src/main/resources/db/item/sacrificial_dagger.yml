description: "The serrated blade of this +1 dagger is set in a hilt made of human\
  \ bone carved in the shape of a scorpion's tail. Once per day when the wielder delivers\
  \ a coup de grace with the sacrificial dagger and the target dies as a result of\
  \ the attack, the dagger traps the dead creature's life energy for 10 minutes per\
  \ Hit Die of the creature. A dark mist visibly seeps from the dagger during this\
  \ time, and anyone wielding the dagger gains the benefits of death knell. Determine\
  \ the number of temporary hit points granted when the target dies. The temporary\
  \ hit points stem from the dagger, so if another creature wields the dagger, that\
  \ creature gains the remaining temporary hit points (if any) and the previous wielder\
  \ loses them.\nIf, while the death knell effect is active, the wielder casts a spell\
  \ that requires sacrificing a creature, she can expend the life energy stored in\
  \ the dagger. For the purpose of fulfilling the spell's requirements, the life energy\
  \ counts as the creature did when it was alive (including Hit Dice and whether or\
  \ not it was sentient). Expending the trapped life energy ends the death knell effect\
  \ immediately, before the casting of the sacrificial spell is complete, so the death\
  \ knell effect doesn't increase the wielder's caster level for that spell. Sacrificing\
  \ another creature dissipates the life energy of any previous sacrifice already\
  \ held in the dagger."
