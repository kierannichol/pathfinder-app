name: "Wand of Lesser Globe of Invulnerability"
description: "An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you and excludes\
  \ all spell effects of 3rd level or lower. The area or effect of any such spells\
  \ does not include the area of the lesser globe of invulnerability. Such spells\
  \ fail to affect any target located within the globe. Excluded effects include spell-like\
  \ abilities and spells or spell-like effects from items. Any type of spell, however,\
  \ can be cast through or out of the magical globe. Spells of 4th level and higher\
  \ are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the globe\
  \ is cast. The globe can be brought down by a dispel magic spell. You can leave\
  \ and return to the globe without penalty."
