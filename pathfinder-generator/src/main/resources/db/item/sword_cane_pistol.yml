description: "A combination weapon, this gun mixes a coat pistol with a sword cane.\
  \ The sword cane pistol is considered a double weapon for the purpose of creating\
  \ masterwork or magical versions of this weapon. The pistol attachment makes the\
  \ nature of the weapon a little more difficult to hide. An observer must succeed\
  \ at a DC 15 Perception check to realize that an undrawn sword cane pistol is a\
  \ weapon rather than a simple walking stick; the DC decreases to 5 if the observer\
  \ is able to handle the weapon. A sword cane pistol uses either a bullet and 1 dose\
  \ of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. The sword part\
  \ of the weapon must be drawn in order to load the pistol part of the weapon. This\
  \ is an early firearm."
