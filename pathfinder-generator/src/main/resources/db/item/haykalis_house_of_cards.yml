description: "This item operates as a standard 22-card deck of many things, save that\
  \ if its wielder takes 5 minutes to build a card house out of its deck (a DC 20\
  \ Sleight of Hand check), he and any creatures touching him are instantly transported\
  \ to a pocket dimension constructed to resemble a massive, fully furnished mansion\
  \ made out of cards. Within its ever-shifting corridors, the PCs must defeat personifications\
  \ of the negative cards or be immediately shunted back to the Material Plane and\
  \ suffer the effects of the card that conquered them. If the PCs successfully reach\
  \ the heart of the mansion, they find the positive result cards floating there.\
  \ Each PC may choose one, whereupon he returns to the Material Plane and receives\
  \ its effects. A creature may enter the House of Cards only once. Designing and\
  \ mapping the adventure that results from characters entering the House of Cards\
  \ is left up to the GM; such preparations should take place before introducing this\
  \ artifact."
destruction: "Haykali's House of Cards can be destroyed only by surmounting its challenges\
  \ and then using the Moon card to wish for the deck's destruction."
