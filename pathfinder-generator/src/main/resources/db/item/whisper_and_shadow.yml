description: "12,310 gp is the price for each sword in the pair.\nThese cruel, paired\
  \ +1 cold iron shortswords where once wielded by the Doom Bringers at the end of\
  \ the First World and were thought to be lost. Recently, pairs of these blades have\
  \ emerged once more, finding their way into the hands of men and elves. Most sages\
  \ consider their reappearance a dark omen, though only the most erudite even know\
  \ these weapons' true origins. When you use Whisper and Shadow in tandem you gain\
  \ the Two Weapon Fighting feat (even if you do not qualify for it).\nAdditionally,\
  \ three times per day, Whisper may be used to cast silence (CL 10th, DC 20). Three\
  \ times per day, Shadow may be used to cast invisibility (CL 10th), or the blade\
  \ itself can be turned invisible for one round, making it incredibly difficult to\
  \ parry and dodge. If your opponent cannot see invisible objects and does not succeed\
  \ on a DC 25 Spot check to follow your arm motions, he is considered flat-footed\
  \ against all your attacks with Shadow that round."
