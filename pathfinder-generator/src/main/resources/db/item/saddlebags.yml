description: "These sturdy, weatherproof bags are draped over a saddle to add extra\
  \ carrying capacity. Each side of a saddlebag can typically carry 20 pound of items\
  \ that can fit in the bags. Saddlebags do not increase the amount of weight a mount\
  \ can carry; they merely give riders a place to stow their equipment."
