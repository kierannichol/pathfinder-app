description: "This military saddle is made of cured hide, with numerous straps and\
  \ hooks to allow it to be easily configured to fit different sizes of animals and\
  \ saddlebags. Any creature of the animal or magical beast type of an appropriate\
  \ shape to wear a saddle (creatures with unusual anatomies may be affected with\
  \ GM discretion) can wear the war saddle, which magically changes size and shape\
  \ as necessary. The saddle allows the creature wearing it to act as if it were combat\
  \ trained (see the Handle Animal description on page 97 of the Core Rulebook for\
  \ more information on combat training), and gives the rider a +5 competence bonus\
  \ on Ride checks made while mounted upon the creature."
