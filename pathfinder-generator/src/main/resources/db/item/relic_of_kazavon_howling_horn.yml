description: "Shaped from Kazavon's horns into a deadly musical instrument, the Howling\
  \ Horn grants the bearer a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity and Charisma. Sounding\
  \ the Howling Horn forces all nonevil creatures within 40 feet to make a successful\
  \ DC 25 Fortitude save or be deafened for 2d6 rounds. A user who succeeds at a DC\
  \ 20 Perform (wind instruments) check while using the horn summons forth the roar\
  \ of Kazavon, a blast that affects creatures in a 40-foot cone, dealing 20d6 points\
  \ of sonic damage and deafening them for 4d6 rounds (a successful DC 25 Fortitude\
  \ save reduces the damage by half and negates the deafening). Unattended crystalline\
  \ objects take double damage. Nonevil creatures within 10 feet of the horn when\
  \ the roar is sounded must succeed at an additional DC 25 Will save or be affected\
  \ as per the spell insanity."
destruction: "A performer must use the Howling Horn to make a successful DC 40 Perform\
  \ (wind instruments) check to entertain a good-aligned deity."
