description: "A shield boss is a sturdy steel device that fastens to the front of\
  \ a shield, providing metal support struts that radiate outward from the center\
  \ of the shield, reinforcing its structure. A shield boss can be added to a buckler,\
  \ light steel or wooden shield, or heavy steel or wooden shield. Tower shields are\
  \ too large for a typical shield boss, though one can be crafted to fit a tower\
  \ shield for an additional 300 gp. Attaching or removing a shield boss requires\
  \ 10 minutes of work and a successful DC 15 Craft (armor) check; on a failure, the\
  \ shield boss is not successfully attached or removed and the shield takes 1d6 points\
  \ of damage that bypasses any hardness.\nA reinforcing boss provides extra protection\
  \ to a shield, increasing the shield's current and maximum hit points by 10. The\
  \ boss makes the shield 10 pounds heavier and more unwieldyâ€”if the shield imposes\
  \ a penalty on attack rolls, as do bucklers and tower shields, the penalty increases\
  \ by 1. Common improvements to the basic reinforcing boss include the following.\n\
  Breakaway Boss: The metal stud at the center of the reinforcing boss holds a compartment\
  \ large enough to insert a single splash weapon, such as a vial of acid or alchemist's\
  \ fire, as a full-round action. On a successful shield bash attack, the weapon vial\
  \ breaks and deals damage to the target as though it were directly hit by the splash\
  \ weapon. The shield takes the normal amount of splash damage for being adjacent\
  \ to the target, but no other creatures adjacent to the target take splash damage\
  \ from this effect. A new splash weapon must be inserted into the breakaway boss\
  \ for it to be used again.\nHooked Boss: The struts on this reinforcing boss bear\
  \ large, sturdy hooks, which can be used to snag an opponent's clothing or armor,\
  \ causing it to stumble. You can attempt trip combat maneuver checks with this shield.\
  \ If the combat maneuver check is successful, the opponent does not fall prone,\
  \ but is considered flat-footed until the beginning of its next turn.\nIlluminating\
  \ Boss: The stud at the center of this reinforcing boss contains a covered slot\
  \ large enough to insert a sunrod. Installing a lit sunrod into an illuminating\
  \ boss is a full-round action. If you shake the shield firmly as a move action,\
  \ you can flip a metal flap fitted over the slot to conceal or reveal the sunrod's\
  \ glow.\nMasterwork Boss: Any of the bosses listed above, including the basic reinforcing\
  \ boss, can be masterwork. A masterwork reinforcing boss increases the shield's\
  \ current and maximum hit points by 15 instead of 10 and doesn't increase the attack\
  \ roll penalty."
