description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nOnce per day, this bloodstone amulet can be\
  \ commanded to produce a red liquid that temporarily satisfies one undead creature's\
  \ hunger for 24 hours, though feeding on the stone's liquid is unappealing, much\
  \ like eating the food from create food and water. The wearer can collect and store\
  \ the liquid in a vial for later use, but the fluid vanishes at the next sunrise\
  \ if unused. A dhampir wearer gains a +4 bonus on Diplomacy checks to influence\
  \ undead who have consumed the substance in the past day, and those undead take\
  \ a â€“2 penalty on saving throws against the dhampir wearer's spells and effects.\
  \ Additionally, a dhampir wearer can use command undead once per day on an undead\
  \ who has consumed the liquid from the amulet."
