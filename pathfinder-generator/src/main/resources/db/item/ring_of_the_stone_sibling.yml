description: "This gray ring looks like stone, but the material is soft and flexible.\
  \ Once per day, as a standard action, you can touch a stone wall with your hand\
  \ to create a stone duplicate of yourself.\nImmediately upon activating the ring\
  \ of the stone sibling, your double steps out of the wall. It appears to be a stone\
  \ statue carved in an exact likeness of you. The stone double stands 10 feet away\
  \ from you and mimics your movements, as if reflected in a mirror. As a move-equivalent\
  \ action, you can mentally command the stone sibling to move to a new location,\
  \ but it must remain within 30 feet of you at all times.\nThe stone sibling has\
  \ hardness 8 and 50 hit points. It can take no actions other than to aid you, which\
  \ it does every round on your turn. The stone sibling makes a +5 aid another check\
  \ each round, either to aid your attack rolls or your Armor Class, as you command.\
  \ It continues to render the same aid indefinitely until you command it otherwise\
  \ (which requires a move action).\nThe stone sibling lasts for 10 minutes, until\
  \ it is destroyed, or until you dismiss it (a standard action), whichever comes\
  \ first."
