description: "This wayfinder is made of heat-treated bronze that seems to warp and\
  \ shimmer in the light. It contains a single slot to store an ioun stone (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Ultimate Equipment 305), and the wayfinder's construction allows the bearer\
  \ to overtax the ioun stone's magical properties once per day to create a special,\
  \ short-term resonance effect based on the stone's shape. This process suppresses\
  \ any other resonance effects the ioun stone might grant for 24 hours. The ioun\
  \ stone is especially fragile during this time, crumbling to pieces if removed from\
  \ the wayfinder"
