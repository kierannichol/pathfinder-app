description: "This silver holy symbol rests just over the wearer's heart, imbuing\
  \ his blood with divine power. After wearing the amulet for 24 hours, the wearer\
  \ can shed his own blood as a standard action, dealing 1d6 points of damage to himself,\
  \ to collect an amount of divinely empowered blood that functions as a flask of\
  \ holy water. The wearer can collect his blood this way once per day, but the individual\
  \ vials lose their potency after just 1 week.\nUndead creatures and evil outsiders\
  \ that successfully use a blood drain attack on the wearer take 4d6 points of positive\
  \ energy damage and are sickened for 1d4 rounds unless they make a DC 16 Will save.\
  \ Any benefit the creature might gain from drinking the wearer's blood is negated\
  \ due to the power of this symbol."
