description: "You are surrounded by a soporific aroma that causes living creatures\
  \ that begin their turn or end their movement within 5 feet of you to fall asleep\
  \ for 1 minute. Creatures must save each time they begin their turn or end their\
  \ movement within the cloak of dreams, even if they have previously saved against\
  \ the effect. Sleeping creatures are helpless but can be awakened with a standard\
  \ action or after being wounded. Creatures with the scent special quality have a\
  \ â€“4 penalty on their saves."
