description: "Created by the masters within the Kusari-Gama faction, this thumbnail-sized\
  \ crystal stores a single point of ki. Any person with the ki pool ability may expend\
  \ the stored ki as if using his own ki. Once the ki is expended, the crystal shatters.\
  \ In Minkai, the Kusari-Gama monks sometimes craft ki crystals into the hilts of\
  \ powerful weapons. In Vudra, such crystals are often embedded in small animal statuettes\
  \ or in shrines venerating a favored deity."
