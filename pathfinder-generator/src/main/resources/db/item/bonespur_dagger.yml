description: "A bonespur dagger appears to have been crafted from a humanoid radius\
  \ and ulna, sharpened to a razor edge and needle point just below where the elbow\
  \ would be located and fitted with a hilt made of wood and bone. While the weapon\
  \ looks fragile, the magic that infuses the grisly blade tempers and strengthens\
  \ it to the level of steel. A bonespur dagger functions as a +1 punching dagger,\
  \ save that on a successful critical hit, the weapon strikes bone and cracks it.\
  \ The creature so struck must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to resist suffering a\
  \ -2 penalty to Strength for 1 minute from this pain; penalties from multiple successful\
  \ critical hits stack up to 3 times.\nAs a curious side effect, bonespur daggers\
  \ penetrate the damage reduction of animated skeletons and skeletal champions (but\
  \ not other skeletal undead) as if they were bludgeoning weapons rather than piercing\
  \ weapons."
