description: "The ground carcasses of goldbelly stinkbugs—insects native to the Mindspin\
  \ Mountains—give this paint its characteristic yellow hue. When applied as a full-round\
  \ action, this fine paste makes your head glow as though with an unearthly halo.\
  \ You gain a +2 alchemical bonus to your caster level for any spells you cast that\
  \ target one or more of your allies. The quicksilver in shaman's paint is harmful\
  \ to living creatures. If you wear shaman's paint for more than 1 minute per day,\
  \ you take 1 point of Wisdom damage, plus 1 point of Wisdom damage for every minute\
  \ you wear the paint that day after the first."
