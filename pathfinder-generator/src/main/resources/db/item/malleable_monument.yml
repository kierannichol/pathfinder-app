description: "This stone statuette is shaped like a humanoid, but it lacks a face\
  \ and fine detail. A character holding the statue can call upon her deity as a full-round\
  \ action, imbuing the statue within divine energy and reshaping it in the image\
  \ of her deity for 24 hours, after which it reverts to its original appearance.\
  \ For this duration, followers of that deity who are within 100 feet of the statue\
  \ gain a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. Additionally, followers\
  \ of the wielder's deity can use the statue as the origin point for channel energy\
  \ effects as long as the statue is within 100 feet. A follower of the deity can\
  \ drive the statue into the ground and spend 10 minutes praying to cast hallow or\
  \ unhallow centered on the statue. This functions as the chosen spell except all\
  \ effects end after 24 hours or when the statue is destroyed. The statue loses all\
  \ abilities after using this effect, but it retains its reshaped image. A malleable\
  \ monument has hardness 8 and 25 hit points."
