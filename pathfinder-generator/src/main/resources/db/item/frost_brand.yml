description: "This +3 frost greatsword sheds light as a torch when the temperature\
  \ drops below 0Â° F. At such times it cannot be concealed when drawn, nor can its\
  \ light be shut off. Its wielder is protected from fire; the sword absorbs the first\
  \ 10 points of fire damage each round that the wielder would otherwise take.\nA\
  \ frost brand extinguishes all nonmagical fires in a 20-foot radius. As a standard\
  \ action, it can also dispel lasting fire spells, but not instantaneous effects.\
  \ You must succeed at a dispel check (1d20 +14) against each spell to dispel it.\
  \ The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the caster level of the fire spell."
