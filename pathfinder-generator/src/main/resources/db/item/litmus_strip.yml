description: "This white paper strip treated with dyes extracted from common lichen\
  \ is used to quickly test the composition of any wate-rbased solution. The user\
  \ dips the end of the strip in the liquid and waits 1 round for the chemical reaction\
  \ to change the color of the strip. If the strip turns purple, then the water contains\
  \ poisonous toxins and must be purified before consumption. The darker purple the\
  \ strip turns, the more toxic the substance. If the strip remains white, the solution\
  \ is poison-free. Though it's not useful for testing oils, slimes, or gases, a strip\
  \ can be invaluable in determining whether a water source or beverage is tainted."
