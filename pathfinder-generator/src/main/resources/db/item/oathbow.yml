description: "Of elven make, this white +2 composite longbow (+2 S tr bonus) whispers\
  \ \"Swift defeat to my enemies\" in Elven when nocked and pulled. Once per day,\
  \ if the archer swears aloud to slay her target (a free action), the bow's whisper\
  \ becomes the shout \"Death to those who have wronged me!\" Against such a sworn\
  \ enemy, the bow has a +5 enhancement bonus, and arrows launched from it deal an\
  \ additional 2d6 points of damage (and ×4 on a critical hit instead of the normal\
  \ ×3). After an enemy has been sworn, the bow is treated as only a masterwork weapon\
  \ against all foes other than the sworn enemy, and the archer takes a –1 penalty\
  \ on attack rolls with any weapon other than the oathbow. These bonuses and penalties\
  \ last for 7 days or until the sworn enemy is slain or destroyed by the wielder\
  \ of the oathbow, whichever comes first.\nThe oathbow may only have one sworn enemy\
  \ at a time. Once the wielder swears to slay a target, he cannot make a new oath\
  \ until he has slain that target or 7 days have passed. Even if the wielder slays\
  \ the sworn enemy on the same day that he makes the oath, he cannot activate the\
  \ oathbow's special power again until 24 hours have passed from the time he made\
  \ the oath."
