description: "This tiny, shrunken, mummified monkey hand is worn around the neck on\
  \ a leather strap. Once per day as a free action, the wearer of a monkey's paw may\
  \ reroll one attack roll, skill check, or saving throw. The reroll must be made\
  \ before the result of the initial die roll is known. The second die roll must be\
  \ used even if the result is worse than the original roll. If the second die roll\
  \ is worse than the original, the wearer suffers a sense of impending doom, causing\
  \ him to be shaken for 1d4 rounds."
