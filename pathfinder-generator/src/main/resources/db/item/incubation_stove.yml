description: "Designed by dwarves, this iron potbellied stove is about the size of\
  \ a halfling. It burns wood, coal, dung, or fungus stalks, and has a large moveable\
  \ compartment on the outside to hold maturing owlbear eggs. The stoves need constant\
  \ attention to maintain the right temperature, else the eggs get cooked rather than\
  \ incubated. Some variations have a spring- or crank-turned device that turns the\
  \ eggs."
