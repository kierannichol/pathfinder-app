description: "This golden collar contains a piece of the demon lord Kostchtchie's\
  \ mortal soul, entrapped within by the witch Baba Yaga. The torc grants its wearer\
  \ immunity to cold and the ability to command frost giants at will. This ability\
  \ functions as dominate monster, but affects only frost giants, who take a –10 penalty\
  \ on their saves. In addition, the wearer can cast giant form II three times per\
  \ day. Anyone who wears the torc for 1 week also gains the ability to summon an\
  \ aspect of Kostchtchie's dark hunger once per day. This aspect takes the form of\
  \ a wendigo (Bestiary 2) who faithfully serves the wearer of the torc for 1 hour.\
  \ Using the torc in this way alerts Kostchtchie to the torc's whereabouts.\nIn addition,\
  \ anytime one of the Torc of Kostchtchie's powers is used, there is a cumulative\
  \ 5% chance the wearer goes berserk (gaining all the benefits and drawbacks of the\
  \ barbarian's rage ability), attacking the nearest non-giant creature until unconscious\
  \ or dead, or until no living non-giant remains within 30 feet."
destruction: "The Torc of Kostchtchie dissolves if boiled for 24 hours in the cauldron\
  \ within the Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga."
