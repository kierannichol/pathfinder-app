description: "At a glance, this object appears to be a hard, dark, roughly egg-shaped\
  \ rock. Closer inspection reveals it's actually a humanoid heart—frozen hard, solid,\
  \ and covered in smooth ice. When clenched in a fist, it feels like it throbs, though\
  \ the organ remains unmoving and unyielding to the eye. It's said to once have been\
  \ the heart of a gelugon, and before that it was the heart of a human being. Staring\
  \ at it causes the surface to gloss over with darkened ice and makes the observer's\
  \ eyes swim. Once the holder knows to study it, the heart functions as a crystal\
  \ ball with telepathy.\nThe heart has a more sinister secret ability. With practice,\
  \ mythic creatures can use the heart to scry more than just individuals, but entire\
  \ settlements and cities. As the owner does, her mind becomes flooded with information\
  \ about the region. Initially this knowledge consists of facts about population\
  \ size, local economy, agriculture, leaders, and popular deities worshiped in the\
  \ area.\nThe owner feels a powerful desire to continue watching, and if she does\
  \ so while taking no other breaks except to eat and sleep, the information continues\
  \ unabated. Over the course of 1d10 days, the heart reveals much more: the subtle\
  \ social, religious, and economic influences of the settlement; the strengths and\
  \ weaknesses of its leaders; and all the many secrets both pedestrian and profane\
  \ that could be used to manipulate and extort those with power over the location.\
  \ At this point, the heart begins to communicate to its new owner, suggesting courses\
  \ of action that would bring her a higher social station, wealth, and power in that\
  \ area. The heart's advice is almost always sound, but also always driven toward\
  \ an unfortunate and evil outcome for someone—just not necessarily its owner. If\
  \ the owner refuses to heed its advice, eventually the heart vanishes, seeking a\
  \ more pliant puppet to manipulate.\nLegends suggest that those who never question\
  \ the heart's orders or decline its gift of knowledge eventually disappear to whatever\
  \ cold place from which the heart originated."
destruction: "The heart must be carried to the plane of Elysium and submerged for\
  \ a day in the warm waters in the settlements of the azata. Once melted, a willing\
  \ kiss from a brijidine upon the now beating heart causes it to burst and turn to\
  \ dust."
