description: "You give a creature the ability to use one of its natural attacks to\
  \ firmly attach itself to an opponent. Choose one of the creature's natural attacks\
  \ (usually a claw or bite attack). The creature gains the grab ability with that\
  \ natural attack, including the +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks to start or maintain\
  \ a grapple. A creature with multiple natural attacks can strike at its grappled\
  \ opponent with its other natural attacks, but cannot attack any other creature."
