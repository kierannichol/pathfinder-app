description: "Each voidstick is 6 to 10 inches long, with a diameter of about an inch.\
  \ Carved from single pieces of polished darkwood, they often display markings or\
  \ symbols sacred to the deity of their creator, but can just as easily be plain\
  \ and smooth. Planting a voidstick into the ground with an appropriate prayer is\
  \ a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The device floods the\
  \ area with negative energy, producing an effect identical to the desecrate spell\
  \ in a 20- foot radius. In addition, any evil divine caster within 20 feet of the\
  \ voidstick may cast her spells without the need for any material component with\
  \ a value of 10 gp or less, or any focus item with a value of 50 gp or less. This\
  \ ability functions only for the individual planting the voidstick and persists\
  \ until the stick is uprooted.\nWhile this is a useful tool for shamans in locations\
  \ poorly serviced by trade in magical goods, it pales in comparison to the voidstick's\
  \ most potent function: the creation of undead. Creating a voidstick zombie requires\
  \ an hour-long ritual during which foul symbols are drawn across a corpse's flesh.\
  \ At the end of the hour, the creator must make a DC 25 Knowledge (religion) check\
  \ before driving the first voidstick into the victim's heart. If this check succeeds,\
  \ the victim is transformed into a voidstick zombie. To fully animate the creature,\
  \ one voidstick must be used for each Hit Die the base creature has. In 12 rounds,\
  \ the creature rises under its own power, eager to spread its negative energy and\
  \ snuff out life nearby. Undead created using voidsticks are not under the control\
  \ of their creator but can be commanded using channeled negative energy, spells,\
  \ or similar effects.\nVoidsticks can also be driven into a living body to slay\
  \ the creature and transition it to undeath. If a living body is used, the creature\
  \ must be pinned or otherwise helpless for the duration of the entire ritual. When\
  \ the ritual is complete and the first voidstick is inserted, the creature must\
  \ make a DC 18 Fortitude save. If this save succeeds, the creature is reduced to\
  \ 0 hit points and is dying, but the magic of the voidstick and the ritual are wasted\
  \ and the ritual must be performed again, using another voidstick. If the save fails,\
  \ the creature dies and the ritual is successful, transforming the base creature\
  \ into a voidstick zombie.\nUndead that contain such an item benefit from the +2\
  \ bonus hit points per Hit Die for having been created in the area of an enhanced\
  \ desecrate spell."
