description: "This simple lead ring is carved with a twisting face. When worn, the\
  \ ring causes a wearer to develop a single deformity over the course of 1 minute.\
  \ The exact malformation is determined when the ring is forged and can't be changed.\
  \ It modifies the wearer's appearance rather than changing it entirely; those familiar\
  \ with her normal appearance can easily recognize her in the modified form. Many\
  \ of these rings mimic the symptoms of terrible diseases, while others mimic birth\
  \ conditions, extensive scarring, or tattoos.\nIf the creature wearing a fool's\
  \ malady already has the deformity the ring mimics, the ring instead removes all\
  \ visual traces of the condition. The ring does not remove any pain or penalties\
  \ associated with the condition."
