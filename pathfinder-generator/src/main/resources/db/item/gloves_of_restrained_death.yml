description: "These supple black leather gloves have dramatic white stitching running\
  \ along their seams. Four small sapphires, two sewn onto the thumb of each hand,\
  \ pulse gently when the gloves are worn. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus\
  \ on Stealth checks. Anytime the wearer becomes poisoned while wearing the gloves,\
  \ she can tap on any number of the sapphires to reduce the frequency of the poison\
  \ by 1 increment per sapphire. The poison's frequency cannot be reduced to lower\
  \ than 1 increment. For example, if a poison's frequency was 1/round for 6 rounds\
  \ and three sapphires were tapped, the frequency would be reduced to 1/round for\
  \ 3 rounds. Tapping each sapphire is a free action that causes the touched gem to\
  \ become inert for 24 hours."
