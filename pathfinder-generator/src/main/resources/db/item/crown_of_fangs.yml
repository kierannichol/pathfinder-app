description: "The eponymous fangs set into this jeweled golden circlet are those of\
  \ the dragon Kazavon. The crown grants its wearer a +6 enhancement bonus to her\
  \ Constitution and Charisma scores, as well as regeneration 20. Only a blade capable\
  \ of destroying the crown, like Serithtial, can bypass this regeneration. The wearer\
  \ gains the personal benefits of foresight, while the crown itself can cast each\
  \ of the following spells three times per day: alter self, dominate person (DC 17),\
  \ major image (DC 17), mirror image, and mislead (DC 19).\nQueen Ileosa and this\
  \ crown are bound together, and she retains its bonuses to her ability scores and\
  \ regeneration even if she isn't wearing the crown, regardless of the distance between\
  \ the two. She prefers to wear the crown because that allows it to use its spells\
  \ in her defense—and because of her vanity and pride."
destruction: "The Crown of Fangs is destroyed if struck (while unattended) by a holy\
  \ sword forged by a once-mortal god—the blade Serithtial is one such blade."
