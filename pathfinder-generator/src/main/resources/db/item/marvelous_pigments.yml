description: "These pigments enable their possessor to create actual, permanent objects\
  \ simply by depicting their form in two dimensions. The pigments are applied by\
  \ a stick tipped with bristles, hair, or fur. The emulsion flows from the application\
  \ to form the desired object as the artist concentrates on the image. One pot of\
  \ marvelous pigments is sufficient to create a 1,000-cubic-foot object by depicting\
  \ it two-dimensionally over a 100-square-foot surface.\nOnly normal, inanimate objects\
  \ can be created. Creatures can't be created. The pigments must be applied to a\
  \ surface. It takes 10 minutes and a DC 15 Craft (painting) check to depict an object\
  \ with the pigments. Marvelous pigments cannot create magic items. Objects of value\
  \ depicted by the pigments—precious metals, gems, jewelry, ivory, and so on— appear\
  \ to be valuable but are really made of tin, lead, glass, brass, bone, and other\
  \ such inexpensive materials. The user can create normal weapons, armor, and any\
  \ other mundane item (including foodstuffs) whose value does not exceed 2,000 gp.\
  \ The effect is instantaneous."
