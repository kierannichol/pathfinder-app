description: "These bloodstained gauntlets are made of a combination of blackened\
  \ steel and polished white stone. They are slightly oversized and somewhat bulky,\
  \ though still suitable for combat. They function as +1 gauntlets.\nOnce per day,\
  \ the wearer can unleash a devastating attack with the gauntlets that can instantly\
  \ knock a target unconscious. The wearer must announce her intent before making\
  \ her attack roll, and creatures immune to critical hits can't be affected. To make\
  \ the attack, the wearer makes a single melee attack at her highest base attack\
  \ bonus as a full-round action. If the strike hits, the target takes 4d6 points\
  \ of force damage and must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or fall unconscious\
  \ until the end of its next turn. Even if the target succeeds at the Fortitude save,\
  \ it is staggered until the end of its next turn.\nWhen worn by a brawler with the\
  \ knockout class feature, the DC to resist the brawler's knockout increases by 2."
