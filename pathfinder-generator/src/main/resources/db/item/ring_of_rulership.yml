description: "This garish signet ring is worth 1,500 gp for its materials and workmanship\
  \ alone. Like the user of a rod of rulership, the ring's wearer can command the\
  \ fealty of creatures, but only if she is a member by blood of the family whose\
  \ symbol is displayed on the ring and only if those creatures are citizens or vassals\
  \ of the family's holdings (though it works on disaffected, disloyal, and even traitorous\
  \ subjects). On command, the wearer can use the ring to target a single humanoid\
  \ creature within 50 feet that meets those qualifications. This effect is automatically\
  \ successful if the creature has an Intelligence of 9 or lower. A creature with\
  \ a higher Intelligence must succeed a DC 14 Will save or obey the ring's wearer's\
  \ commands as if she were its absolute sovereign; a successful save renders that\
  \ creature immune to that ring's effects for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting\
  \ enchantment (compulsion) effect and counts as 3rd-level spell for the purpose\
  \ of break enchantment. If the ring's wielder gives a command that is contrary to\
  \ the nature of a ruled creature, that creature receives another saving throw to\
  \ shake off the effect. Even if the ruled creature fails the saving throw and remains\
  \ ruled, it can still refuse that particular command. The GM is the final arbiter\
  \ of what constitutes a command that is contrary to the nature of a ruled creature,\
  \ and for most creatures, if the ring's wearer coopts their every moment, the creature\
  \ can attempt a save every day.\nA creature is ruled until one of the following\
  \ happens: it shakes off the effect after being given a command against its nature,\
  \ an outside source (such as break enchantment) removes the compulsion, the wearer\
  \ removes the ring of rulership, the wearer commands the ring to release the creature\
  \ (a standard action that need not take place in the creature's presence), or another\
  \ member of the ruler's family rules the creature using a different ring of rulership,\
  \ whichever comes first.\nThe power of the ring can rule no more than three creatures\
  \ at a time; to rule a new creature, the ring's wearer must first release one of\
  \ the three ruled creatures."
