description: "This lens, mounted in a round electrum frame, fits snugly over the wearer's\
  \ eye. Upon donning the monocle, the user sees a swirl of arcane sigils through\
  \ the lens, but the sensation quickly fades. The monocle allows the user to decipher\
  \ magical inscriptions, as per read magic.\nOnce worn for 24 consecutive hours,\
  \ an eldritch scholar's monocle also protects the user from anything dangerous to\
  \ read or view. While wearing the monocle, whenever the user triggers a curse effect,\
  \ an effect that causes sanity loss, or a magic trap (such as explosive runes or\
  \ sepia snake sigil) simply by reading or viewing an object, the monocle's glass\
  \ starts shaking, pulling the wearer's attention away from the dangerous details\
  \ in the object. This allows the wearer to roll any saving throw against such an\
  \ effect twice and take the better result. This effect functions only once per day.\
  \ For the remainder of the day, everything viewed through the lens appears blurred\
  \ and distorted, and the read magic effect no longer functions."
