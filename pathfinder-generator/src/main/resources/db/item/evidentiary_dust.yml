description: "This light, shimmery blue powder is typically kept in a silk satchel\
  \ with hemp drawstrings. When tossed into the air, the dust can cover a chamber\
  \ with up to 100 square feet of floor space, and illuminates all footprints made\
  \ within that space in the last 24 hours. Illuminated footprints glow softly for\
  \ 1 hour after the dust is sprinkled and grant a +20 circumstance bonus on Survival\
  \ checks to follow the tracks. A handful of dust sprinkled along a trail or road\
  \ illuminates footprints in the same way, and can span as much as 250 feet.\nEvidentiary\
  \ dust cannot reveal footprints of creatures that hid their trail via effects such\
  \ as dust of tracelessness or a druid's trackless step."
