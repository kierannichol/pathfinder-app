description: "This fine alchemical salt has been developed to work against particular\
  \ types of foes. A batch of repellent salts is attuned to undead or a selected outsider\
  \ race, such as angels, demons, or devils. As a full-round action that provokes\
  \ attacks of opportunity, a dose of repellent salts can be applied to a 5-foot-square\
  \ area that functions as difficult terrain for the salt's attuned creature type.\
  \ Any creature can sweep the salts aside as a move action (or as a full-round action\
  \ for an attuned creature, which deals that creature 2d4 points of acid damage in\
  \ the process); moderate wind also disperses all repellent salts in a square (including\
  \ the draft created by a winged creature of at least Medium size that flies within\
  \ 5 feet of the salts). Alternatively, a vial of repellent salts can be used as\
  \ a splash weapon against the target creature, with a successful hit dealing 2d4\
  \ points of acid damage to the creature struck (or 1 point to an attuned creature\
  \ within 5 feet of the target and thus exposed to the attack's splash)."
