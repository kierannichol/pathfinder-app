description: "Originally discovered by dwarven alchemists working with adamantine\
  \ dust, efreeti cord is a viscid length of string approximately 18 inches long and\
  \ blue-gray in color. It can be purchased in greater lengths by multiplying the\
  \ price for every 18 inches or fraction thereof. Flexible and sticky, a length of\
  \ efreeti cord can be carefully shaped into almost any pattern, draped upon an object,\
  \ or wrapped around a fixture, and will stay in place until activated. Once activated\
  \ (using an efreeti switch; see below), efreeti cord rapidly heats up, and after\
  \ 1 round becomes a white-hot cord of fire. In the first round, the cord deals 3d6\
  \ points of fire damage to an object. This damage ignores any hardness less than\
  \ 10, and is not halved for an object. The cord continues to burn for 2 additional\
  \ rounds, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage the first additional round and 1d6 points\
  \ the second."
