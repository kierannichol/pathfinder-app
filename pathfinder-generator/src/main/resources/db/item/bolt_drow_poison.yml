description: "These iron bolts have small resin tips that break when the bolts strike\
  \ their targets. Inside is a dose of drow poison. Anyone struck by a drow poison\
  \ bolt must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or fall unconscious for 1 minute. After\
  \ 1 minute, the subject must succeed on another DC 13 Fortitude save or remain unconscious\
  \ for 2d4 hours. Those using drow poison bolts do not risk poisoning themselves,\
  \ but the strange tip affects the bolts' accuracy. Double the range penalties when\
  \ using a drow poison bolt."
