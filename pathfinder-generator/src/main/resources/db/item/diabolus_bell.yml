description: "This black, iron bell is inscribed with diabolical symbols. The spherical\
  \ clapper is affixed to a chain, resembling a tyrant's ball and chain. Diabolus\
  \ bells can be dedicated to other powers of Hell, such as archdevils. They act as\
  \ divine foci for spells granted by associated patrons.\nOnce per day, when the\
  \ wielder speaks a command word while ringing the bell (a standard action), lawful\
  \ neutral or lawful evil creatures within a 20-foot radius that hear the toll and\
  \ worship Asmodeus can say a prayer to Asmodeus as a move action to be affected\
  \ as per ward the faithful. The supplication must be said before the beginning of\
  \ the wielder's next turn and within 20 feet of the bell.\nChaotic or good creatures\
  \ within a 20-foot radius that hear the toll must instead succeed at a DC 13 Will\
  \ save or be affected as per doom. Creatures that are both chaotic and good that\
  \ fail the Will save take 1d8 points of sonic damage and must succeed at a DC 13\
  \ Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round.\nFinally, any living creatures within\
  \ a 20-foot radius that have â€“1 or fewer hit points must succeed at a DC 13 Will\
  \ save or be slain as per death knell. At the beginning of the wielder's next turn,\
  \ if the bell's death knell effect slew a creature, the wielder can then choose\
  \ to grant the benefits of death knell to either himself or any one creature within\
  \ sight that is benefiting from the bell's ward the faithful effect. Even if multiple\
  \ enemy creatures fail their saving throws versus the death knell effect, only one\
  \ creature gains the benefits."
