description: "This conch shell measures only a few inches long and shimmers with a\
  \ delicate pink color. Shells of sending always come in pairs, with each shell attuned\
  \ to the other. If pairs are mixed up or lost, a shell of sending can be attuned\
  \ to a new shell of sending in a process that takes 24 hours.\nOnce per day, anyone\
  \ holding a shell of sending can whisper up to 25 words into the shell. The sender's\
  \ words emerge from the second shell, audible to anyone holding the attuned shell,\
  \ as long as the receiver is on the same plane of existence. If the receiver wishes,\
  \ she can send a return message of up to 25 words.\nAnyone eavesdropping on either\
  \ sender or receiver must attempt a DC 14 Will saving throw. On a success, an eavesdropper\
  \ can hear the speakers normally. On a failure, the speakers seem to be relaying\
  \ gibberish and nonsense words to each other. Creatures who fail this saving throw\
  \ by 5 or more are deafened for 1d4 minutes."
