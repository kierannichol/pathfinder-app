name: "Scroll of Dance of a Hundred Cuts"
description: "You become a lethal combat dancer, swirling and spinning with grace\
  \ and precision. You gain a morale bonus on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls,\
  \ and Acrobatics checks, and to Armor Class. This bonus is equal to +1 per 3 caster\
  \ levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The bonus to AC is lost under any circumstances\
  \ that would cause you to lose your Dexterity bonus to AC. You must remain moving\
  \ for the spell to stay in effect. If in any round you do not either move at least\
  \ 10 feet or make a melee attack, the spell's duration ends."
