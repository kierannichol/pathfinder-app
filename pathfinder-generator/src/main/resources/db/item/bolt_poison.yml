description: "These iron crossbow bolts have resin tips that break when the bolts\
  \ strike their targets; inside the tip is a dose of injury or contact poison. In\
  \ addition to dealing damage normally, anyone struck by a poison bolt is exposed\
  \ to the poison. When using a poison bolt, you do not risk poisoning yourself, but\
  \ the tip affects the bolt's accuracy; double all range increment penalties when\
  \ using poison bolts. The bolt's cost does not include the cost of the poison, which\
  \ must be included during creation."
