description: "This rag doll, created in the likeness of a specific creature chosen\
  \ at the time of crafting, must be loved to activate its powers. This love takes\
  \ the form of time spent caring for the doll, keeping it on one's person, and preventing\
  \ any harm from coming to it.\nIn order to use the accumulated power within a Zonzon\
  \ doll of forgiveness, the owner must give the doll to the creature that it resembles.\
  \ Depending on how long the doll's owner took care of it, the doll may bestow up\
  \ to three cumulative effects. Each benefit lasts 24 hours unless otherwise noted.\n\
  If the doll is gifted after 1 day of care, it grants the owner a +5 sacred bonus\
  \ on Diplomacy checks against the creature that the doll resembles (hereafter referred\
  \ to as the target creature). If the doll is gifted after 1 week of care, the owner\
  \ can use the Diplomacy skill to shift the target creature's attitude closer to\
  \ helpful by up to three steps (exceeding the normal two-step limitation) and takes\
  \ no penalty for failing a Diplomacy check by 5 or more. Finally, if the doll is\
  \ gifted after 1 month of care, the recipient of the Zonzon doll may activate the\
  \ doll within 24 hours to gain the benefit of an atonement spell. After the doll\
  \ has been gifted and the duration of the effect expires, a Zonzon doll reverts\
  \ to a normal rag doll with no magical powers."
