description: "Small loops sewn into this bandolier look like they can hold twenty\
  \ alchemical cartridges (ammunition for a firearm, see Ultimate Combat), but due\
  \ to a subtle bending of space can actually hold up to 60 cartridges. Additionally,\
  \ the six thin pockets on the bandolier are extradimensional spaces meant to hold\
  \ extra guns and gear. The four small pockets can each hold a one-handed firearm,\
  \ 1 pound of ammunition, a powder horn, or a similarly sized object. The two large\
  \ pockets are large enough to hold a two-handed firearm or a similarly sized object.\
  \ The wearer can draw an item stored in the bandolier as easily as if from an ordinary\
  \ ammunition pouch or holster. The bandolier weighs the same no matter what is placed\
  \ inside it."
