description: "This book appears to be the holy text of a particular religion, but\
  \ it is actually a subtly encoded version of the text of an entirely different faith.\
  \ Such tomes allow the faithful to keep copies of their holy texts hidden in plain\
  \ sightâ€”especially when those tomes are outlawed or stigmatized. A creature reading\
  \ a disguised holy text can notice the irregularities of the text with a successful\
  \ DC 18 Linguistics check; if the result of this check is 25 or higher, the creature\
  \ cracks the text's cipher and understands its true meaning. A follower of a disguised\
  \ holy text's true faith gains a +5 bonus on her Linguistics check to decipher the\
  \ tome. The typical disguised holy text is of average quality, costs 25 gp, and\
  \ weighs 2 pounds; cheaper or more extravagant versions are available with varying\
  \ costs and weights."
