description: "The flanges on the head of this +1 axiomatic heavy mace are shaped like\
  \ skeleton keys. Three times per day as a swift or immediate action when making\
  \ a melee attack with the mace, the wielder can trigger this mace's unlocking ability.\
  \ This ability must be declared before the melee attack is rolled, and if the attack\
  \ is unsuccessful, the unlocking ability is wasted. Upon a successful melee attack\
  \ with the mace while using the unlocking ability, the wielder can attempt a combat\
  \ maneuver check against the target's CMD. On a success, the mace causes an item\
  \ on the target in the belt, shoulder, or neck slot to come loose and fall to the\
  \ ground in the target's space.\nIn addition, when attempting to destroy a lock,\
  \ the mace ignores up to 20 points of the lock's hardness."
