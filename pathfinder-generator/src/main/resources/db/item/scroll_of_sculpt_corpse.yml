name: "Scroll of Sculpt Corpse"
description: "With a clammy caress and a word to the powers lurking beyond death,\
  \ you can reshape a dead body look like another creature or even a specific person\
  \ so long as you have first-hand knowledge of how that creature or person actually\
  \ looks. You can make the corpse one size larger or smaller and change anything\
  \ else about it including its apparent type, gender, or age. Creatures with a reason\
  \ to suspect deception may make a Will saving throw to realize that the corpse was\
  \ altered. If you chose to make the corpse look like a specific individual anyone\
  \ who knows that individual can make a Will save to realize that the corpse is not\
  \ actually that person. However, if a creature fails its Will save by 5 or less\
  \ they believe the corpse is that of someone who closely resembled the person they\
  \ knew rather than a deliberate fake. This spell merely changes the appearance of\
  \ the corpse. Any spell or effect that targets the corpse (such as speak with deador\
  \ raise dead) treats it as if it still had its original appearance."
