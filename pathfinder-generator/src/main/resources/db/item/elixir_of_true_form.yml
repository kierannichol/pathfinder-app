description: "This elixir removes all curses and transmutation effects from the imbiber,\
  \ including the unnatural mutations resulting from the arcane warping of the island\
  \ of Nal-Kashel or gained through an ancestor's unspeakable interbreeding with ulat-kini.\
  \ The elixir stops gillmen from transforming into skum but cannot reverse the transformation\
  \ if a gillman has already become a skum. Only doses of the elixir manufactured\
  \ on the island of Nal-Kashel can remove the warping effects of the island's influence."
