description: "A gritty salve with an earthy odor, muscle grout is frequently sold\
  \ in areas where giant spiders or ropers haunt local trade routes. When massaged\
  \ into the muscles as a full-round action, this ointment provides a +2 alchemical\
  \ bonus on saving throws to resist nonmagical effects that cause Strength damage.\
  \ Any Strength damage you take manifests gradually as the salve slows muscle decay;\
  \ anytime you take Strength damage, you take only 1 point per round until the full\
  \ amount of damage is dealt. Additional Strength damage adds to the total, but is\
  \ dealt only at a maximum rate of 1 point per round, as long as the grout is active.\
  \ A dose of muscle grout lasts for 10 minutes. One dose of muscle grout is sufficient\
  \ for a Medium or smaller creature; Large creatures require 2 doses, Huge creatures\
  \ require 4 doses, and so on."
