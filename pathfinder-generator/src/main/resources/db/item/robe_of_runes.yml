description: "This robe is made of crimson silk and emblazoned with dozens of spindly\
  \ Thassilonian runes, each symbolizing a different type of magical effect or syllable\
  \ of power. Though favored by wizards, this robe can provide some benefit to any\
  \ spellcasting creature. While worn, it grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence\
  \ and allows the wearer to recall, as a free action, up to four levels of spells\
  \ per day that he had prepared and then cast. Each time a spell is recalled and\
  \ prepared again in this manner, the sudden rush of magical energy infuses the wearer\
  \ with power. For 1 round after recalling a spell, the wearer's spell save DCs and\
  \ attack rolls made with spells gain a +2 enhancement bonus."
