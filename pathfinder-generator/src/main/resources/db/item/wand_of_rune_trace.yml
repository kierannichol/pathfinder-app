name: "Wand of Rune Trace"
description: "By immersing yourself fully in the intricacies of a carved or written\
  \ rune of any kind, you can divine the elements of that rune's nature. While casting\
  \ rune trace, you must run your fingers (which cannot be gloved at the time) over\
  \ the rune, glyph, symbol, or other marking you want to examine (hereafter referred\
  \ to as the â€œrune\"). This does not trigger any effects that touching the rune would\
  \ normally trigger. Runes, symbols, and other effects that trigger when read still\
  \ trigger as normal if you do so-- but note that this spell does not require you\
  \ to view and read the rune that you're targeting. When the spell's casting time\
  \ ends, you instantly receive flashes of insight regarding the rune's nature, history,\
  \ and purpose, including the following information."
