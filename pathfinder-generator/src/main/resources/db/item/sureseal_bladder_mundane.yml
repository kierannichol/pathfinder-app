description: "While potion sponges (Advanced Race Guide 177) are a reasonable enough\
  \ method for air-breathers like undines to prepare to bring a potion underwater,\
  \ aquatic creatures prefer a solution that allows them to prepare potions, beverages,\
  \ and other liquids underwater to begin with. A sureseal bladder is made of a thin\
  \ membrane that won't allow liquid through. By passing a solid spout or tube through\
  \ the membrane, you can fill the bladder without allowing in any ambient seawater,\
  \ and the membrane seals behind the spout. Once the bladder is full, the drinker\
  \ can nip on the end of the membrane in order to sip the drink at her leisure, slowly\
  \ crumpling the bladder for eventual disposal. The cheaper mundane sureseal bladders\
  \ hold about 2 cups of liquid and work best for enjoying a favorite drink; the listed\
  \ weight assumes the mundane sureseal bladder is full. Potions rely on drinking\
  \ the entire dose, so potion sureseal bladders, while much smaller (just large enough\
  \ for a potion), are pressurized in order to expel the entire potion at once without\
  \ losing any of it, allowing the drinker to drink them as a standard action just\
  \ like drinking a potion above the waves. Either type of sureseal bladder can be\
  \ used only once."
