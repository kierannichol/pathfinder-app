description: "Solving this simple kinetic puzzle involves removing several pegs from\
  \ a handheld wooden cube. However, removing the final peg triggers the magical trap.\
  \ The box explodes in the victim's hands, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage (Reflex\
  \ DC 14 for half damage). Detecting that the box is trapped requires a successful\
  \ DC 30 Perception check made by a character with the trapfinding ability, and disabling\
  \ it requires a successful DC 30 Disable Device check."
