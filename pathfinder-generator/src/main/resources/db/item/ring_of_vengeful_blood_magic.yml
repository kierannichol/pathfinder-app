description: "This claw ring is made of red metal tinged with orange, and a long nail\
  \ made of obsidian extends from the tip. It allows its wearer to cast a spell as\
  \ an attack of opportunity. Three time per day, if the wearer is bloodraging and\
  \ a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from him, the wearer can cast a spell\
  \ with a casting time of 1 standard action or less as the attack of opportunity.\
  \ The spell must target the creature that provoked the attack or include it in the\
  \ spell's area, and must be no higher than 3rd level. This counts as one of the\
  \ wearer's attacks of opportunity for the round; casting this spell does not itself\
  \ provoke an attack of opportunity."
