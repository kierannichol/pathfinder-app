description: "Favored by those residents of Irrisen with no talent for witchcraft,\
  \ this exotic blade curves multiple times along its 3-1/2 feet. The sickle-sword's\
  \ hilt is long and curved, and its blade bears a small secondary grip partway up\
  \ its length. These allow a wielder with a free hand to rapidly twist the sword\
  \ in unpredictable ways. When wielding a sickle-sword in one hand and nothing in\
  \ the other, you can spend a swift action to gain a +2 bonus on your next attack\
  \ roll before the end of your turn."
