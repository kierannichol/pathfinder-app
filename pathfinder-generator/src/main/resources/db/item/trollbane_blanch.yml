description: "Originally developed by huldras for hunting trolls, this green-gray\
  \ paste is stored in a tree bark jar in order to mask its pungent odor, for trolls\
  \ recognize its scent immediately and often flee from it, or attack the bearer in\
  \ preference to all other targets. When applied to a weapon as a full-round action,\
  \ a dose of trollbane blanch causes the weapon to deal 1 additional point of fire\
  \ damage or acid damage (the type of damage is chosen when the blanch is created)\
  \ on its next successful attack. Once applied, trollbane blanch lasts for 1 minute\
  \ or until the wielder makes a successful attack."
