description: "Forged by powerful fey from the primal word as a gift to mortal champions,\
  \ a sword of mists is a +6 defending greatsword of gleaming blue steel with a stag's\
  \ head pommel. Strange, ancient runic etchings encircle the rain guard, and the\
  \ cross guard is fashioned in the shape of thorny vines. Anyone who wields the weapon\
  \ gains low-light vision, resist nature's lure (as the druid class feature), and\
  \ the ability to speak and understand Sylvan.\nThe wielder can expend one use of\
  \ mythic power to imbue the blade for 1 minute with the ability to bypass the hardness\
  \ of any solid object and cut through even the toughest material as if slicing through\
  \ butter.\nOnce per week, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to enter\
  \ the primal world of fey from the Material Plane or vice versa."
destruction: "If bathed in the blood of its fey creators, a sword of mists mystically\
  \ melts into a pool of useless lead."
