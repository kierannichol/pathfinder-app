description: "This jagged steel crown is rough and scratched but shows no sign of\
  \ being dented or misshapen. Once per day, the wearer can issue a challenge to a\
  \ creature able to see and hear him. The creature gains a +2 morale bonus on melee\
  \ attack rolls and damage rolls against the crown's wearer for 1 minute. The creature\
  \ challenged also takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and damage rolls against all\
  \ targets other than the wearer, and takes a –2 penalty to the save DCs of its spells,\
  \ spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities that affect other targets unless\
  \ they also affect the wearer of the crown. These penalties last 1 minute or until\
  \ the creature challenged makes a melee attack against the wearer of the crown.\n\
  If the crown's wearer has the challenge class feature, he gains the benefit of his\
  \ challenge against the creature challenged without expending a daily use of his\
  \ own challenge ability."
