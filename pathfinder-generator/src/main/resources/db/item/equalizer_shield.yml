description: "Shined to a mirror finish and fitted with supple leather straps, this\
  \ +1 mithral tower shield displays no decoration or markings on its highly reflective\
  \ surface. Once per day, the bearer of this shield can issue a challenge to a foe\
  \ and ring the shield like a gong, resulting in a resonating blast that negates\
  \ all magic in a 10-foot radius, as per antimagic field. This effect lasts for 1\
  \ minute."
