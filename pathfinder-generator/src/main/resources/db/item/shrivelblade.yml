description: "This +1 adamantine swordbreaker dagger (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment\
  \ 38) has a jagged ebon blade inscribed with ancient Thassilonian runes that translate\
  \ to \"cut down to size.\" Three times per day, when the wielder successfully sunders\
  \ a weapon using a shrivelblade, he can permanently reduce the size of the sundered\
  \ weapon by one size category, thus reducing its damage and its intended wielder\
  \ size by one size category and its weight by half. Using this ability is a swift\
  \ action. If the sundered weapon is magical, it can attempt a DC 14 Will save to\
  \ negate this effect. Multiple uses of this ability don't stack. A make whole spell\
  \ can return a weapon shrunken by a shrivelblade to its proper size."
