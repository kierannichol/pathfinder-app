description: "Often created by those who venerate Trelmarixian, the Horseman of Famine,\
  \ this dark leather belt has a piece of a cracked soul gem in its plain brass buckle.\
  \ the wearer of a belt of Trelmarixian doesn't need to eat and is immune to the\
  \ effects of starvation, though she begins to take on an emaciated appearance after\
  \ several days. Three times per day, the wearer can touch a creature (requiring\
  \ a successful touch melee attack) to affect it with incredibly painful pangs of\
  \ hunger. If the target fails a DC 15 Fortitude save, it takes 2d6 points of nonlethal\
  \ damage and is fatigued. Creatures that don't need to eat or are immune to nonlethal\
  \ damage are immune to this ability."
