description: "Patterned after the fiery blades masterfully wielded by Sarenite angels,\
  \ the split-blade sword is both a holy symbol and a difficult-yet-effective weapon.\
  \ A split-blade sword resembles a large scimitar whose blade splits into two about\
  \ two-thirds of the way toward the tip. If your Dexterity score is less than 15,\
  \ you take a â€“2 penalty on attacks rolls with a split-blade sword, as you're unable\
  \ to maneuver its unusual blade."
