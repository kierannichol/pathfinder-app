description: "This tool is perfect for its intended job. It grants a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus on a related skill check (if any). The bonuses provided by multiple masterwork\
  \ items do not stack.\nSeveral common items already count as masterwork tools for\
  \ particular skills. These are the alchemist's lab, climber's kit, disguise kit,\
  \ healer's kit, masterwork musical instrument, and masterwork thieves' tools. Therefore,\
  \ there is no masterwork climber's kit, masterwork healer's kit, and so on—those\
  \ items are already the best available for general checks with the relevant skill.\n\
  Some skills have no appropriate tool or masterwork tool— no nonmagical item exists\
  \ that grants a bonus for all uses of that skill. For example, just because a certain\
  \ perfume is favored by local nobles (granting a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy\
  \ checks to influence them) doesn't mean that perfume has the same effect on a member\
  \ of the thieves' guild, a foreign berserker, or a medusa. Likewise, just because\
  \ a fake beard woven by dwarves out of the beards of famous dwarves may grant a\
  \ +2 circumstance bonus on Use Magic Device checks to emulate the dwarven race doesn't\
  \ mean the beard has any effect on using that skill to activate elven items or paladin\
  \ items, or to decipher a written spell.\nIndividual GMs may want to allow masterwork\
  \ tools for other skills at the listed cost. The circumstance bonus for such a tool\
  \ should never be more than +2. The tool should either have a limited number of\
  \ uses (such as the disguise and healer's kits) or only apply to certain aspects\
  \ of the skill (such as the balancing pole's bonus on Acrobatics checks to traverse\
  \ a narrow surface or the magnifying glass's bonus on Appraise checks for detailed\
  \ items)."
