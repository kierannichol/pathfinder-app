description: "Mythic: If you are a mythic divine spellcaster and burn this incense\
  \ while preparing spells, you can expend two uses of mythic power to prepare any\
  \ one spell as a mythic spell (but not as an augmented mythic spell), even if you're\
  \ normally unable to cast the mythic version of that spell. Incense of divinity\
  \ burns for 1 hour; you can prepare as many mythic spells as you are able to during\
  \ this time, but you must expend two uses of mythic power for each mythic spell\
  \ so prepared."
