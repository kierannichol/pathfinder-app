name: "Scroll of Symbol of Scrying"
description: "This spell functions as symbol of death, except that, when triggered,\
  \ it creates a scrying sensor linked to you and centered on the symbol, even if\
  \ you are on a different plane than the symbol. You are immediately aware that the\
  \ symbol has been triggered if you are conscious, and are awakened from normal sleep\
  \ if sleeping. The symbol does not otherwise disturb your concentration. You may\
  \ observe the area through the symbol as if using a scryingspell with the sensor\
  \ as the target creature. Once triggered, the symbol remains active for 10 minutes\
  \ per caster level."
