description: "Originally invented by shamans of the Kellid tribes of the Realms of\
  \ the Mammoth Lords, zoic fetishes have spread throughout the Inner Sea region and\
  \ are much sought after in any area where dangerous animals dwell. Each zoic fetish\
  \ looks different, but is essentially a small fetish made from bone, branches, grass,\
  \ and twine crafted into one of several shapes—a mammal, a bird, a reptile, an amphibian,\
  \ or a fish.\nAs long as a creature carries a zoic fetish, it is somewhat protected\
  \ against attacks from animals, gaining a +1 insight bonus to AC against all animals.\
  \ In addition, possession of a zoic fetish grants a +4 insight bonus on wild empathy\
  \ checks. Finally, once per day, the wielder can present a zoic fetish to an animal\
  \ of the same classification as the fetish (amphibian, bird, fish, mammal, or reptile)\
  \ to use dominate animal on that creature."
