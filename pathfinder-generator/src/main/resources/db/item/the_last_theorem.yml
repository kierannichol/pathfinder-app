description: "This book is non-magical; it is the hieroglyphic formulas contained\
  \ within it that radiate both magic and evil. The formulas cannot be duplicated\
  \ or transcribed unless the reader has the ability to create artifacts. If the reader\
  \ loses focus for even an instant, the numbers swim into new positions throughout\
  \ the text. anyone who studies them for at least an hour may make a Concentration\
  \ check to attempt to hold them in their proper place and determine how much of\
  \ their meaning they can discern. Anyone who has studied the star charts from J1:\
  \ Entombed with the Pharaohs receives a +4 circumstance bonus to their Concentration\
  \ check.\nDC 10: The Last Theorem contains 11 constants, each of which is derived\
  \ from the relationship between the planet aucturn and Golarion. The reader must\
  \ make a DC 14 Will save or suffer from fear.\nDC 15: The Last Theorem can be used\
  \ to compute the date that the countdown clocks began and when the count will end.\
  \ the reader must make a DC 14 Will save or suffer from feeblemind.\nDC 25: The\
  \ Last Theorem is capable of affecting the physical world, but is missing the hidden\
  \ value of the \"White axiom.\" Without that, The Last Theorem's power cannot be\
  \ unleashed. The reader must make a DC 18 Will save or enter a permanent catatonic\
  \ state similar to that created by an eyebite spell. If both the Concentration check\
  \ and the Will save are successful, the reader's understanding provides a permanent\
  \ +1 enhancement bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (player's choice). Future\
  \ readings by the same person have no additional effect. only one person can gain\
  \ the bonus conferred by the theorem every 11 months."
