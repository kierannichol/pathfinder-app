description: "This kit provides a variety of creamy liquids in glass jars, and allows\
  \ you to temporarily change the color of your hair or skin to match that of a creature\
  \ of any humanoid race. This includes exotic and unusual hues, such as gnome hair\
  \ colors. If used as part of a Disguise check, this kit reduces the time required\
  \ to create the disguise by 1d6 minutes (to a minimum of a full-round action), and\
  \ halves the penalty to disguise yourself as a different race whenever such recoloration\
  \ is necessary. Each use of the kit changes either hair or skin color. If you need\
  \ to change both your hair color and your skin color, you must spend two uses of\
  \ the kit to gain the benefit. Each dye takes 1 minute to apply (thus requiring\
  \ 2 minutes to change both hair and skin color). Once applied, the colors are waterproof,\
  \ and can't be rubbed or burned away. An application of dye fades after 1d4+1 days\
  \ unless removed earlier by magical means. Applying a new application of alchemical\
  \ dye immediately covers and replaces a previous application. An alchemical dye\
  \ kit is exhausted after 10 uses."
