description: "This striped pink conch shell has thin leathery straps to keep it attached\
  \ to the wearer's face, with a clear mask attached to the top that the wearer can\
  \ see through. Prized by shoreborn pirates for searching for underwater treasure,\
  \ these diving masks are popular among many different sailors. The interior of the\
  \ shell holds enough air to allow the wearer to breathe underwater for 10 minutes,\
  \ but the mask must then be exposed to air for 20 minutes before it can be used\
  \ again to breathe underwater. The wearer gains a +4 competence bonus on Perception\
  \ checks while underwater, and she can detect and attempt to identify magical auras\
  \ underwater as though she had cast detect magic."
