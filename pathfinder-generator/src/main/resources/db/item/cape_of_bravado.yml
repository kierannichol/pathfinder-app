description: "This bright red garment bestows no benefit when worn on the shoulders,\
  \ but when held in one hand while draped over the arm, the cape obscures its user's\
  \ movements in combat. Used this way, the cape bestows a +1 insight bonus to AC\
  \ and a +5 competence bonus on Bluff checks to feint in combat. Readying the cape\
  \ in combat is a move action; if the wielder has a base attack bonus of +1 or higher,\
  \ the wielder can ready the cape as a free action as part of movement.\nOnce per\
  \ day as an immediate action, a creature brandishing a cape of bravado may attempt\
  \ to compel an opponent within 30 feet to attack him on its next turn (Will negates\
  \ DC 11)."
