description: "This delicious-looking gourd is infused with a pungent musk derived\
  \ from plants gathered in the southern jungles of the Mwangi Expanse. The gourd\
  \ can be thrown as a splash weapon. Anyone within 10 feet of the point of impact\
  \ is dazed and blinded by the fumes for 1d4 rounds and forgets the events of the\
  \ previous round. A successful DC 20 Will saving throw mitigates the effect. Those\
  \ who succeed at the saving throw are merely dazzled for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting\
  \ poison effect. A wielder with the bombs class feature can spend 1 use of that\
  \ ability to use the ability's DC instead."
