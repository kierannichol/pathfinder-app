description: "Leaving marks of your passage can alert predators that a newcomer has\
  \ entered their territory. Trackless boots help prevent you from making too much\
  \ noise as you creep along, and they also mask traces of your passage through underground\
  \ caverns to prevent your enemies from finding you. These boots are particularly\
  \ valued by smugglers who work in patrolled areas.\nTrackless boots are soft, well-worn\
  \ leather boots with thin soles. The softness of the boots' soles add a +4 competence\
  \ bonus on Move Silently checks. In addition, the boots conceal your passage much\
  \ like the pass without trace spellâ€”you leave no trail underground and cannot be\
  \ tracked."
