description: "This black-feathered quill has a glowing nib with a small amount of\
  \ glowing ink inside it. Three times per day, the bearer can place the quill's nib\
  \ against a wall and say a command word to cause the ink to flow from the pen and\
  \ draw a doorway onto the wall. The doorway persists for 10 minutes, during which\
  \ any number of creatures can spend a move action to walk through the door as if\
  \ it were real. Doorways can be created in this way only on walls that are no more\
  \ than 6 inches thick. Additionally, a doorway cannot be created if the space on\
  \ the other side of the targeted wall is blocked (such as by solid stone or dirt,\
  \ furniture, or another impediment). If the bearer attempts to create a doorway\
  \ in such an impossible place, the quill's ink simply doesn't flow and a daily use\
  \ of this item is not expended."
