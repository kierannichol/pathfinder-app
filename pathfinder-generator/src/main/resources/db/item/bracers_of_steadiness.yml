description: "These tortoise-shell bracers fit so snuggly against their wearer's skin\
  \ that they almost seem part of him. The wearer of these bracers becomes exceptionally\
  \ calm and composed if she takes her time to accomplish particular tasks. Whenever\
  \ she takes 20 on a skill check for a skill that primarily depends on her arms and\
  \ hands, she gains a +5 competence bonus on the check."
