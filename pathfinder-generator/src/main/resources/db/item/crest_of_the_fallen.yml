description: "This fist-sized silver badge bears a stylized image of a heraldic animal.\
  \ The first time a character wears the crest, the animal changes to match that of\
  \ the wearer's heraldic symbol. If the wearer doesn't have a heraldic animal, it\
  \ takes the form of an animal appropriate to the character's personality. The animal\
  \ depicted must be one suitable for use as a druid animal companion (see page 53\
  \ of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). Once a character has worn the crest, the\
  \ animal depicted on the crest is always the same for that character and can't be\
  \ changed.\nOnce per day, if the wearer of the crest of the fallen falls unconscious\
  \ (other than voluntary sleep), the animal on the crest jumps out of the badge and\
  \ becomes a living creature in an unoccupied square adjacent to the wearer. The\
  \ creature has the same statistics as a 1st-level druid's animal companion of the\
  \ same type as depicted on the crest, except its hit points are equal to one-quarter\
  \ of the wearer's maximum hit points. The creature also gains the 4th- or 7th-level\
  \ advancement as described in the animal companion's statistics if the wearer is\
  \ of sufficient level (treating his character level as the effective druid level).\
  \ It doesn't, however, gain any of the other bonuses or abilities of an animal companion.\n\
  The creature guards the fallen wearer to the best of its ability. It protects the\
  \ wearer by attacking enemies, assisting allies using the aid another action, dragging\
  \ the character's body to a safe location, or taking other helpful actions. The\
  \ creature can't move more than 50 feet from the badge, and it disappears after\
  \ 5 rounds. It can't use equipment or magic items, including potions.\nIf the animal\
  \ is slain, it disappears and the heraldic image on the crest of the fallen fades\
  \ to a dark gray for 1 week, during which time the crest can't be activated."
