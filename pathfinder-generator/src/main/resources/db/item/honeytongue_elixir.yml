description: "Drinking this elixir grants the imbiber a +10 bonus on Bluff checks\
  \ made to convince another that her words are the truth. This bonus lasts for 10\
  \ minutes, and doesn't apply to any other use of the Bluff skill, such as feinting\
  \ in combat, creating a diversion to hide, or communicating a secret message via\
  \ innuendo.\nIf a magical effect is used against the honeytongue elixir's imbiber\
  \ that would detect her lies or force her to speak the truth, the user of the effect\
  \ must succeed at a DC 16 caster level check to compel the elixir's imbiber to tell\
  \ the truth. Failure means the effect doesn't detect the imbiber's lies or force\
  \ her to tell the truth."
