description: "Appearing to be a wide leather belt that functions as a belt of mighty\
  \ constitution +4, this belt in fact saps the wearer's health rather than supplement\
  \ it. A belt of weakness confers a â€“4 penalty to its wearer's Constitution score.\
  \ Furthermore, when the wearer rolls a natural 1 on any Fortitude save, the belt\
  \ constricts, dealing 2d8 points of damage."
