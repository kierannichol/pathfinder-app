description: "The possessor of this fantastically bejeweled rod gains a +4 enhancement\
  \ bonus to her Charisma score for as long as she holds or carries the item. Once\
  \ per day, the rod garbs her in magically created clothing of the finest fabrics,\
  \ and adorns her with furs and jewels.\nApparel created by the magic of the rod\
  \ remains in existence for 12 hours. However, if the possessor attempts to sell\
  \ or give away any part of it, use it for a spell component, or the like, all the\
  \ apparel immediately disappears. The same applies if any of it is forcibly taken\
  \ from her.\nThe value of the noble garb created by the rod ranges from 7,000 to\
  \ 10,000 gp (1d4+6 x 1,000 gp)—1,000 gp for the fabric alone, 5,000 gp for the furs,\
  \ and the rest for the jewels (maximum of 20 gems; maximum value 200 gp each).\n\
  In addition, the rod has a second special power, usable once per week. Upon command,\
  \ it creates a palatial tent—a huge pavilion of silk 60 feet across. Inside the\
  \ tent are temporary furnishings and food suitable to the splendor of the pavilion\
  \ and sufficient to entertain as many as 100 people. The tent and its trappings\
  \ last for 1 day. At the end of that time, the tent and all objects associated with\
  \ it (including any items that were taken out of the tent) disappear."
