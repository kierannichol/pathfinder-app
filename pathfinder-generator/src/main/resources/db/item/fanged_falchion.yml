description: "The blade of this brutal-looking falchion is serrated, forming the fangs\
  \ of the stylized etching of a jackal's profile on the shimmering metal. Such weapons\
  \ are fashioned in honor of Lamashtu and are favored by her most powerful cultists\
  \ as weapons not only for battle, but also for sacrifice.\nA fanged falchion is\
  \ a +1 unholy falchion and wounds caused by the weapon's serrated edge are horrifically\
  \ ragged and bleed profusely. Whenever a fanged falchion's wielder scores a successful\
  \ critical hit with it, the sword's blade animates and \"chews\" at its victim.\
  \ In addition to doing damage for the critical hit, this horrific chewing deals\
  \ 2 points of Constitution damage and stuns the victim for 1 round (Fort DC 15 negates).\
  \ Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to this Constitution damage and the\
  \ stun effect."
