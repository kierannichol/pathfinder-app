description: "This dark gem attunes itself to the soul of its bearer. When carried\
  \ close to the body of a creature continuously for 1 week, the gem harmlessly absorbs\
  \ a portion of that creature's life essence. If separated from its bearer for at\
  \ least 1 day, the gem loses this attunement. If the bearer gains one or more negative\
  \ levels, the black soul shard absorbs one of these negative levels into itself,\
  \ negating the effect. The black soul shard can only absorb a negative level if\
  \ carried by the person it is attuned to. If an attuned black soul shard is used\
  \ as an additional focus component for raising the attuned creature from the dead,\
  \ the negative level cost of being raised is one less than normal (minimum 1), but\
  \ only if the spell is cast within 24 hours of the creature's death.\nAbsorbing\
  \ a negative level (whether from an attack or raising the attuned creature from\
  \ the dead) destroys the portion of the soul within a black soul shard. This does\
  \ not harm the creature, but requires re-attuning the gem for another week for it\
  \ to function again. A creature can only have one black soul shard attuned to it\
  \ at a time."
