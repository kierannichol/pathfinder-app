description: "This concertina was created by the notorious Chelish bard Vidlian the\
  \ Reveler. It can be used like a masterwork concertina, providing a +2 bonus on\
  \ Perform (keyboard instruments) checks. At any one time, Master Vidlian's squeeze-box\
  \ is either more compressed than extended or more extended than compressed, and\
  \ switching between the two is a free action (and in fact, happens regularly when\
  \ the instrument is played). When the concertina is compressed and held in a hand,\
  \ the wielder gains the compression ability. When the concertina is extended and\
  \ held in a hand, the wielder is immune to constriction damage (as from constrict\
  \ attacks) and damage from being buried, although the wielder gains no protection\
  \ from suffocation."
