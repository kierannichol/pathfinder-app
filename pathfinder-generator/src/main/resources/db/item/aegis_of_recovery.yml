description: "An aegis of recovery grants its wearer a +2 resistance bonus on all\
  \ saving throws made to recover from a continuing effect, such as ongoing poison\
  \ damage, daily saving throws against a disease, a hold person spell, or lingering\
  \ damage from an attack. This bonus does not help against initial saving throws\
  \ against such effects. Should the wearer ever drop below 0 hit points, the aegis\
  \ heals the wearer for 2d8+3 points of damage and then crumbles to dust."
