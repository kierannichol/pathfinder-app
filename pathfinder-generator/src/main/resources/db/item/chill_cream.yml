description: "This sticky light blue paste grows pleasantly cool to the touch whenever\
  \ it is exposed to light. Spreading a dose on your face and hands takes a full-round\
  \ action and grants you a +2 alchemical bonus on saves to resist hot weather. In\
  \ areas of bright light this bonus increases to +4, while in areas of dim light\
  \ or darkness it is negated. A dose of chill cream lasts for 1 hour after being\
  \ applied. A newly crafted bottle of chill cream holds 5 doses."
