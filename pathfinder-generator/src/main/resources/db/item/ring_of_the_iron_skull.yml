description: "Crudely cut amethysts and a single engraved skull decorate the band\
  \ of this thick iron ring. The ring grants its wearer a +5 competence bonus on Appraise\
  \ checks to determine the most valuable item in a treasure hoard and a +5 competence\
  \ bonus on Heal checks to ascertain details of a dead creature's demise. Once per\
  \ day as a standard action, the wearer can touch the ring to a corpse or piece of\
  \ a corpse to learn the dead creature's name, gender, race, and profession or role,\
  \ as well as the manner of the creature's death. The wearer also becomes aware of\
  \ the location of other pieces of the corpse if they're within 1,200 feet. If the\
  \ body part comes from a creature that's still alive or undead, the wearer gains\
  \ no information. The ring of the iron skull must be worn for 24 hours before it\
  \ starts to function for the wearer."
