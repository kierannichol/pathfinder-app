description: "This large brass belt has three panels depicting scenes of battle. Once\
  \ per day on command, the wearer can summon the spirit of a hero of one of the depicted\
  \ battles. This spirit acts as a spiritual ally, though unlike the force created\
  \ by that spell, the summoned hero is not entirely mindless. Whether or not the\
  \ summoned hero is active, it attempts to guide its wearer to victory via telepathic\
  \ warning and advice, granting its user a +1 insight bonus on all saving throws."
