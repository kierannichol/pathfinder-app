description: "This alchemical oil takes 1 minute to apply and completely masks your\
  \ odor for 6 hours. Creatures can't use the scent ability to track you, detect your\
  \ presence, or pinpoint your location. A single dose of scent blocker covers a Medium\
  \ or smaller creature. For each size category larger than Medium a creature is,\
  \ double the number of doses (and application time) required. Crafting scent blocker\
  \ requires a successful DC 23 Craft (alchemy) check."
