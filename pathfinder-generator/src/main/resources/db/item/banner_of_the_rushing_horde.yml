description: "The banner of the rushing horde is a tattered cloth flag, typically\
  \ 3 feet wide and 6 feet long, depicting the device or insignia of an orc tribe\
  \ or unit. It can be carried on a staff, affixed to a pole that's planted in the\
  \ ground, or hung from the harness of a great beast. Allies within 60 feet of the\
  \ banner gain the benefits of the Improved Bull Rush and Improved Overrun feats.\
  \ If planted, the flag does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by\
  \ an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of\
  \ its owner."
