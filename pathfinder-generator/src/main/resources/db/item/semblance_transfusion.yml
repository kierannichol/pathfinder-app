description: "When combined with a drop of a humanoid's blood, this solution allows\
  \ the homunculus that drinks it to grow to size Small and assume the likeness of\
  \ the subject whose blood was used. If the homunculus can speak, its voice changes\
  \ to resemble that of the subject. The homunculus's space and reach become 5 feet\
  \ and it loses its bite attack, but otherwise its statistics remain unchanged. This\
  \ transformation lasts 24 hours. The homunculus gains a +10 circumstance bonus on\
  \ Disguise checks to appear as the subject, but unless the subject is a halfling,\
  \ a gnome, a child, or another Small humanoid, the homunculus is likely shorter\
  \ than the subject."
