description: "This massive wooden shield is nearly as tall as its user. In most situations,\
  \ it provides the indicated shield bonus to your AC. As a standard action, however,\
  \ you can use a tower shield to grant you total cover until the beginning of your\
  \ next turn. When using a tower shield in this way, you must choose one edge of\
  \ your space. That edge is treated as a solid wall for attacks targeting you only.\
  \ You gain total cover for attacks that pass through this edge and no cover for\
  \ attacks that do not pass through this edge (see cover, Core Rulebook 195). The\
  \ shield does not, however, provide cover against targeted spells; a spellcaster\
  \ can cast a spell on you by targeting the shield you are holding. You cannot bash\
  \ with a tower shield, nor can you use your shield hand for anything else.\nWhen\
  \ employing a tower shield in combat, you take a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls because\
  \ of the shield's encumbrance."
