description: "This mottled gray cloak looks like granite or some other light gray\
  \ stone. The wearer can pull a minor stone cloak tight around herself and freeze\
  \ in place as a move action, which causes the cloak to harden like the stone it\
  \ resembles. When she does this, the wearer can take no actions other than free\
  \ actions and is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC but gains DR 5/adamantine. She\
  \ also gains a +5 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks while protected in this manner.\
  \ This effect can be dismissed as a free action."
