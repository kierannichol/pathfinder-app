description: "The Shard of Wrath is made of sparkling silver siccatite that feels\
  \ hot one day, but cold the next. As long as the Shard of Wrath is carried, its\
  \ owner can use fireball as a spell-like ability once per day, gains a +2 insight\
  \ bonus on saves versus evocation spells, and gains a +2 insight bonus on all weapon\
  \ damage rolls.\nCurse: The owner becomes addicted to violence, and is sickened\
  \ whenever she hasn't brought a living creature to –1 hit points or fewer within\
  \ the last hour. Once the owner attacks a creature, she must make a DC 20 Will save\
  \ if she wants to cease attacking; otherwise, she does what she can to kill the\
  \ creature."
destruction: "A shard of the Sihedron cannot be destroyed individually. Only by recombining\
  \ them into the Sihedron and then using that artifact's method of destruction can\
  \ one destroy the shards."
