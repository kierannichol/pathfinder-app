description: "This iron blacksmith's hammer bears designs of Torag's holy symbol;\
  \ it is not designed for combat, but the bearer can use it as a Medium light hammer.\
  \ Once per day, the bearer can strike the hammer hard against a weapon to target\
  \ that weapon with magic weapon. The owner gains a +2 competence bonus on all smithing\
  \ (armorsmithing, blacksmithing, weaponsmithing, and so on) skill checks made when\
  \ crafting with the forgehammer.\nIf Torag is the owner's patron, once per day the\
  \ owner can strike the hammer against another character's armor or shield to cast\
  \ shield other on that character. If the owner can craft magic weapons or armor\
  \ and uses the forgehammer during the crafting, the total time to craft the item\
  \ is decreased by 25% (minimum 1 day). This does not reduce the cost to create the\
  \ item. A particular forgehammer can aid in only one item's crafting at a time."
