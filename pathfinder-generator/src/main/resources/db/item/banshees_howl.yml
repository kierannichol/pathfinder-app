description: "This jet-black +3 rapier weeps quietly when wielded in combat. A creature\
  \ critically hit by banshee's howl must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be affected\
  \ by crushing despair for 1 minute. Each time an affected creature fails this save,\
  \ the effect's duration increases by 1 minute.\nAs a free action upon confirming\
  \ a critical hit with a banshee's howl, the wielder can twist the blade in the wound.\
  \ Doing so causes the weapon's blade to release a ghostly female elven form that\
  \ rises up to unleash a devastating cry, functioning as a wail of the banshee (Fort\
  \ DC 23 negates). The wielder and her allies gain no special protection against\
  \ this effect, and the creature struck by the critical hit takes a â€“4 penalty on\
  \ its saving throw against it. Once a banshee's howl has used this ability, it can\
  \ never do so again, but it does retain its other abilities. A banshee's howl whose\
  \ wail of the banshee ability has been expended is still worth 32,320 gp.\nThe first\
  \ banshee's howl was only recently discovered, but the creation process has since\
  \ been reproduced. Rumors have spread of female Lantern Bearers spontaneously transforming\
  \ into such weapons upon death to continue the fight, though their truth is uncertain."
