description: "The body of this wooden flute is elaborately decorated with carved motifs\
  \ of horses running across grassy plains. Once per day, the user of a horse-caller\
  \ flute can play a lilting melody with the flute, and while doing so can attempt\
  \ a DC 10 Perform (wind) check. On a success, a light riding horse appears in an\
  \ appropriate space adjacent to the player to serve as her mount for 2 hours, plus\
  \ an additional 2 hours for every 5 points by which the result exceeds the Perform\
  \ (wind) check DC. The horse does not appear if the terrain cannot support it; in\
  \ this case, if the user succeeds at the Perform (wind) check, the horse simply\
  \ does not appear and the item's daily use is not wasted."
