description: "This immense brass, bronze, and crystal orrery models Golarion's solar\
  \ system as it was in the Age of Legend. If consulted for 10 minutes or more, the\
  \ orrery grants a +5 circumstance bonus on Knowledge (geography) checks to navigate\
  \ or to answer questions about outer space. Once per month, it can be used to contact\
  \ alien minds on far-flung worlds—this works identically to the spell contact other\
  \ plane (use the demigod line to determine the effects of the spell or ability score\
  \ decreases)."
destruction: "Although it is a minor artifact, the Azlanti orrery can be destroyed\
  \ by regular damage. It has hardness 20 and 300 hit points."
