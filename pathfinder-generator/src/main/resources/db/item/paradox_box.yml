description: "A paradox box resembles a small stone chest of ornate design that measures\
  \ approximately 1-1/2 feet by 1-1/2 feet by 1 foot. Closer inspection reveals the\
  \ paradox box to be a solid piece of stone that's been carved to resemble a box—\
  it has no seam for a lid or hinges to allow opening. It is a secure storage device\
  \ that can be accessed only by use of the proper command word or combination. Until\
  \ the command word is intoned or the combination is correctly entered (the box's\
  \ creator decides which method of opening works for the box—most boxes have combination\
  \ locks that function similarly to the one detailed on page 9), the box is effectively\
  \ a solid piece of stone with no lid or aperture or even an interior, and as such,\
  \ attempts to open the box by bypassing a lock (with Disable Device or knock) do\
  \ not work. Some creators also build magical traps into paradox boxes (summon monster\
  \ traps are particularly popular), but these traps are not included in the standard\
  \ model.\nOnce the proper command is given, a seam appears around the chest, and\
  \ nested hinges within allow this lid to open, revealing an extradimensional space\
  \ 1 cubic foot in size. Anything that will fit completely within that space (regardless\
  \ of weight) can be successfully stored within, and the chest can be sealed again\
  \ simply by closing it. The contents of the storage space do not change the weight\
  \ of the chest, since they actually stay in an otherwise inaccessible extradimensional\
  \ space. If the chest is destroyed (hardness 8, hp 90), the extradimensional space\
  \ collapses and any contents are jettisoned randomly into the Ethereal Plane.\n\
  Paradox boxes were especially popular in Thassilon for their relative inexpensiveness\
  \ as well as their superior security and durability. Many Thassilonian creators,\
  \ burdened with arrogance and hubris, constructed their paradox boxes such that\
  \ their surfaces were decorated with elaborate and carefully constructed riddles\
  \ or wordplays that gave clues to their command words. These items are prize finds\
  \ for organizations such as the Pathfinder Society, because a particularly clever\
  \ investigator can often still open them, revealing their time-lost secrets even\
  \ though the command word might have been lost millennia ago."
