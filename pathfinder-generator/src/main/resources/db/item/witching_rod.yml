description: "This especially powerful dowsing rod (see page 248) is typically made\
  \ of a branch from an ancient tree or shafts forged of rare metals. When used for\
  \ the dowsing skill unlock in place of a mundane dowsing rod, a witching rod provides\
  \ a +5 circumstance bonus on the Survival check.\nA witching rod can not only detect\
  \ bodies of water, grave sites, and metal deposits, but can also manipulate substances\
  \ or souls related to them. The rod can produce the effects of control water, speak\
  \ with dead (DC 14), or stone shape. Though this ability can typically be used only\
  \ once per day, a wielder with the ability to use the dowsing occult skill unlock\
  \ more than once per day can instead produce a spell effect one additional time\
  \ per day for each additional use of dowsing she has. This doesn't require her to\
  \ expend uses of dowsing. Only one creature can produce extra uses of the witching\
  \ rod in this way each day."
