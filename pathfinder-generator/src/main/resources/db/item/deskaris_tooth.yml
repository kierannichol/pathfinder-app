description: "A gift to Areelu from Deskari himself, Deskari's Tooth is a +6 anarchic\
  \ unholy dagger that automatically casts soul bind whenever it is used to slay a\
  \ foe, provided no soul is currently stored in the blade. A soul of any power can\
  \ be stored in the blade in this manner, but only one soul at a time. If the dagger's\
  \ wielder is slain while a soul is contained in Deskari's Tooth, the soul is instantly\
  \ consumed and the effect or attack that would normally have slain the wielder is\
  \ instead negated. If Deskari's Tooth is used to perform a coup de grace on a lawful\
  \ good creature, it can be used to cast lesser planar binding. If the lawful good\
  \ creature has more than 11 Hit Dice, the dagger can instead be used to cast planar\
  \ binding, and if the creature has more than 17 Hit Dice, it can instead be used\
  \ to cast greater planar binding."
destruction: "Deskari's Tooth must be used by a paladin to commit suicide, so that\
  \ the paladin's soul becomes bound to the blade. If that soul is later used by a\
  \ demon to prevent death, the dagger shatters upon preventing that death."
