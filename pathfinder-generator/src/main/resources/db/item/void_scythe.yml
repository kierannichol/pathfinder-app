description: "Instead of a blade, a swathe of absolute darkness inimical to life tips\
  \ this scythe. It functions as a +1 brilliant energy scythe, except the blade is\
  \ formed of negative energy and gives off no light whatsoever. The wielder can channel\
  \ negative energy directly into the scythe to charge it with life-destroying energy\
  \ for 1 round per die of channeling. For example, channeling negative energy for\
  \ 5d6 points of damage fuels the scythe for 5 rounds. While so charged, the void\
  \ scythe bestows one negative level with each hit. One day after being struck, subjects\
  \ must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative level or the negative\
  \ levels become permanent.\nBlack energy utterly consumes any creature that is slain\
  \ by the void scythe, leaving no body behind but leaving the creature's equipment\
  \ unharmed. A victim of the void scythe can be restored only by true resurrection\
  \ or carefully worded miracle or wish."
