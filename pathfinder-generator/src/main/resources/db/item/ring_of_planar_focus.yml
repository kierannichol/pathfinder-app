description: "This large silver ring has a massive setting for a cloudy white crystal\
  \ about an inch in diameter. Once per week as a standard action, the wearer can\
  \ tap the ring with a forked rod attuned to a specific plane (the focus for a plane\
  \ shift spell). When tapped, the crystal transforms into a rough topographical map\
  \ of the plane in question for 1 minute. The wearer can manipulate the crystal to\
  \ focus on a single specific location within the plane, although the topographical\
  \ elements remain rough and display only large or well-known features around the\
  \ desired location. If the wearer has been to that location personally, she can\
  \ focus the crystal on the location in 1 full round. Otherwise, she can attempt\
  \ a DC 15 Knowledge (planes) check to focus on a location of her choice as a full-round\
  \ action. This location must be a public or well-known area, such as a public plaza\
  \ in the Common Quarter in the City of Brass. Obscure locations (such as Calistria's\
  \ private Garden of Hidden Fruits) or locations controlled by a divinity cannot\
  \ be focused on—in all cases, the GM has final say on whether a region can be focused\
  \ upon.\nIf the wearer casts plane shift to travel to the focused location while\
  \ the map is active, she arrives without error at the site, rather than 5d% miles\
  \ away. Once a ring of planar focus is used to aid a casting of plane shift, it\
  \ becomes inactive for 24 hours."
