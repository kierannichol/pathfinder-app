description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis elaborate silver diadem features stylized\
  \ antennae similar to those of a lashunta. While worn, it maintains a constant planetary\
  \ adaptation (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Distant Worlds 55) upon a wearer. The\
  \ diadem's magic also enhances a lashunta wearer's telepathy, allowing her to mentally\
  \ communicate with any creature that has a language, rather than only creatures\
  \ that share a language with her."
