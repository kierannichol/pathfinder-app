description: "This magical silver coin opens a portal to the First World. Any time\
  \ a character holds the coin in her hand while expressing a fervent desire or wish\
  \ of any sort, the magical coin activates, whether or not the bearer intended it\
  \ to. At some point in the next 24 hours, a portal to the First World appears in\
  \ that character's immediate vicinity. Such portals are only half-visible, and form\
  \ in seemingly random places—in the middle of a field, in a doorway, in the back\
  \ of a closet, and so on. This portal always leads to a random location in the Witchmarket\
  \ on the First World.\nWhen the portal first appears, the triggering character must\
  \ succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or accidentally stumble through. Other creatures\
  \ in the vicinity can spot the portal with a successful DC 15 Perception check,\
  \ and can pass through as well. The portal allows passage both ways, and remains\
  \ open for 10 minutes. The coin cannot generate more than one portal to the First\
  \ World in a single 24-hour period.\nOn the First World, a Witchmarket coin allows\
  \ its bearer and any designated companions to travel to the Material Plane, as if\
  \ via plane shift, simply by expressing a deliberate wish to do so. The effect always\
  \ transports the creatures to the last location in which the coin opened a portal\
  \ to the First World.\nA Witchmarket coin works only once for any given person,\
  \ though someone who's already triggered the portal can still pass through portals\
  \ created by other users."
