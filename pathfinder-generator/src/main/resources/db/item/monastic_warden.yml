description: "This +1 ki focus temple sword is often gifted to select students. A\
  \ character making an attack with this blade can spend 1 ki point as a swift action\
  \ to ignore any shield bonus to AC her target has for that attack.\nThree times\
  \ per day, the wielder of the monastic warden can slash the air in her target's\
  \ direction, causing a shimmering copy of the sword formed of white light to streak\
  \ toward the target. The wielder must make a ranged touch attack against the target.\
  \ A creature struck by the shimmering blade takes 4d8 points of force damage. If\
  \ the target is struck while on the grounds of a site sacred to the wielder, the\
  \ target instead takes 8d6 points of force damage and is dazed for 1 round. A successful\
  \ DC 14 Will saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the daze effect."
