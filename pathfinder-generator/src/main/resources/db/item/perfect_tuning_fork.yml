description: "Shelyn's association with harmony and music inspires many composers\
  \ to pen glorious songs in the Eternal Rose's honor, and numerous tools have been\
  \ devised by her church to improve the performances of such melodies. The perfect\
  \ tuning fork provides the ideal pitch to quickly begin an inspirational tune. When\
  \ holding a perfect tuning fork in the hand, the wielder can strike the fork as\
  \ part of the action of beginning a bardic performance. If the wielder can start\
  \ a bardic performance as a standard action, she can do so as a move action instead.\
  \ If the wielder can start a bardic performance as a move action, she can do so\
  \ as a swift action instead. A perfect tuning fork loses its magic after one use,\
  \ but it can be used as an ordinary tuning fork thereafter."
