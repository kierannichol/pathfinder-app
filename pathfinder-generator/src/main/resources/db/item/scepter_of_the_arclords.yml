description: "The Scepter of the Arclords is a powerful device capable of harvesting\
  \ all the ambient magic from a large area and focusing it into a single powerful\
  \ effect. Once per day the wielder can command the Scepter of the Arclords to duplicate\
  \ any spell of 3rd level or lower. This automatically succeeds, but there is a 10%\
  \ chance the wielder also gains a random minor spellblight (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate\
  \ Magic 94).\nAdditionally, once per week the wielder can command the item to create\
  \ any magic effect he desires. Roll d% to determine the effect of this command.\n"
