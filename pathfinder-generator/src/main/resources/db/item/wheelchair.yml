description: "This device is a chair, typically made from wood, with large wheels\
  \ attached on either side. A wheelchair can seat a single Medium or Small creature.\
  \ When seated in a wheelchair, you can propel yourself along a reasonably flat surface\
  \ at your base speed as a move action, so long as you have at least one hand free.\
  \ Moving twice in a round or taking the run action requires you to have both hands\
  \ free. Moving uphill or over rough terrain halves the speed you move in a wheelchair,\
  \ and certain terrain (such as fallen logs) may be entirely impassable. A wheelchair\
  \ has hardness 5 and 30 hit points."
