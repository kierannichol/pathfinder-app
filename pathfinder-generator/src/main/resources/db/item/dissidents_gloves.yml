description: "The inside of these fingerless leather gloves contains minute stitching\
  \ forming the holy symbol of a specific deity or religion. As a standard action,\
  \ the wearer can imprint a palm-sized image of the holy symbol onto any object (as\
  \ if using arcane mark) simply by pressing the palm of one of a pair of dissident's\
  \ gloves against it. The icon is invisible for 1d4 rounds after the imprinting;\
  \ it then appears and glows with light equivalent to a candle. While the image is\
  \ visible, any worshiper of the appropriate faith can use it as a holy symbol by\
  \ touching it. The image fades after 1 day, but can be prematurely removed by dispel\
  \ magic or erase."
