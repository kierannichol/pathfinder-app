description: "For all their cowardice and cruelty, goblins have a keen sense of what\
  \ can kill them, and harpies number among goblins' most feared predators. Using\
  \ this knowledge to their advantage, Varisian alchemists have devised ways to recreate\
  \ or distill the musk of harpies into a potent concoction. If smeared on a surface\
  \ or used as a thrown weapon, harpy musk fills a 30-foot area for 10 minutes before\
  \ dispersing. Any goblin who enters the area must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or\
  \ be shaken for 1 minute. Harpy musk affect only goblinsâ€”bugbears and hobgoblins\
  \ are unaffected. Harpy musk can be created with a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy)\
  \ check."
