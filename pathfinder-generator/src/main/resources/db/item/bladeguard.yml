description: "This clear resin protects a weapon from harmful attacks made by oozes\
  \ and rust monsters, as well as from similar effects that corrode or melt weapons,\
  \ rendering the weapon immune for 24 hours. One pot can coat one two-handed weapon,\
  \ two one-handed or light weapons, or 50 ammunition items. Applying it takes 1 full\
  \ round per pot. Immersing the weapon in water or similar liquid washes it off."
