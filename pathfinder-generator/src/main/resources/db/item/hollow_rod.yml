  \ keys. Three times per day, a kineticist can utilize the hollow rod in conjunction\
  \ with a blast wild talent or the kinetic healer wild talent to augment that talent's\
  \ destructive or healing capabilities, treating the wild talent as maximized. A\
  \ hollow rod can't be used on a wild talent affected by metakinesis."
