name: "Scroll of Animate Plants"
description: "You imbue inanimate plants with mobility and a semblance of life. Each\
  \ animated plant then immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate\
  \ as though it were an animated object of the appropriate size category. You may\
  \ animate one Large or smaller plant, or a number of larger plants as follows: a\
  \ Huge plant counts as two Large or smaller plants, a Gargantuan plant as four,\
  \ and a Colossal plant as eight. You can change the designated target or targets\
  \ as a move action, as if directing an active spell."
