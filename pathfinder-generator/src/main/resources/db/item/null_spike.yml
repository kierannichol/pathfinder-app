description: "Rootlike filaments of cold iron wind their way around this adamantine\
  \ spike, tapering as they approach its point. When driven deeply into solid stone\
  \ or a stone object weighing at least 1,000 pounds, the spike emits an aura that\
  \ interferes with spellcasting to a radius of 60 feet. Any spells cast within the\
  \ radius have a 30% chance of failing. This chance of spell failure does not stack\
  \ with spell failure from other sources. The aura persists until the spike is removed.\
  \ Driving the spike into the ground or pulling it free with a successful DC 15 Strength\
  \ check is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. If wielded\
  \ in combat, a null spike functions as a +1 adamantine dagger."
