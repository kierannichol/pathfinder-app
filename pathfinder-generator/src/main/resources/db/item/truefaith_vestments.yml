description: "Worn by enforcers and acolytes of the living god Razmir, this +1 chain\
  \ shirt appears as a fine hooded robe made of silk of a color appropriate to the\
  \ wearer's rank within the church as if it had the glamered special ability (it\
  \ appears white when worn by anyone who doesn't follow Razmir). Used primarily as\
  \ a means of appearing to be protected by the false god's power, the armor is treated\
  \ as a +3 breastplate against attacks made by any enemy who has not seen through\
  \ the illusion. Unlike with standard glamered armor, any creature that successfully\
  \ hits the target with a melee weapon is considered to have interacted with the\
  \ illusion, and can see the armor's true form with a successful DC 16 Will save."
