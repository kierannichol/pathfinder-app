description: "This bottle of viscous blue oil sublimates slightly when exposed to\
  \ air. When poured over water, the oil pools on the surface and takes 1 round to\
  \ spread out from the point of origin in a 20-foot radius. At the end of this round,\
  \ the cardice oil flash-freezes the surface of the water, creating an ice sheet\
  \ over the affected area (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 430). Any 5-foot square of\
  \ this ice can support up to 200 pounds of weight. Weight in excess of this amount\
  \ causes the entire sheet to crack and quickly break up. This ice sheet becomes\
  \ unstable and breaks up on its own after 1 hour, or 20 minutes in a hot climate.\
  \ Any creature whose bare skin comes in contact with cardice oil takes 1d6 points\
  \ of nonlethal damage each round because of the chemical's volatile nature, but\
  \ the oil is ineffective as a splash weapon."
