description: "This intensely polished steel sphere can be rolled in a manner similar\
  \ to a thrown splash weapon. Anyone who can clearly see the sphere within 30 feet\
  \ can notice the presence or absence of movement reflected on its surface, making\
  \ it useful for checking around corners for guards. A gently rolled ball on a smooth\
  \ floor requires a DC 10 Perception check to hear."
