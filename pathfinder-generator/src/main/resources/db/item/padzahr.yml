description: "Drinking this crystal-clear liquid accelerates the natural process of\
  \ healing Constitution damage. Resting for 1 hour after drinking a vial heals you\
  \ of 1 point of Constitution damage as if you had benefited from a full night's\
  \ rest. Taking multiple doses in an hour does not increase the rate of healing;\
  \ you must take each individually, followed by an hour of rest, for it to have any\
  \ effect. Using more than 4 doses of padzahr in 1 day has no effect."
