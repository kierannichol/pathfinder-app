description: "The curling horns that jut out from the temples of this splendid helm\
  \ are actually fangs extracted from the jaws of a cairn linnorm. Created by and\
  \ for the Linnorm Kings of old, the helm reserves its power for wearers who have\
  \ been targeted by a linnorm's death curse. For a worthy wearer, the funerary crown\
  \ suppresses any death curse currently affecting the wearer and grants a +4 resistance\
  \ bonus on saving throws to resist fear effects, poison, and all other curses. The\
  \ helm also grants a +4 insight bonus on all Charisma-based checks the wearer attempts\
  \ to influence other linnorm slayers. Once per month as a standard action, the wearer\
  \ can summon an einherji (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 84) for up to 10 minutes. This\
  \ power is otherwise equivalent to a summon monster VII spell.\nWhen placed on the\
  \ brow of one who has never slain a linnorm, the helm instead subjects the unworthy\
  \ wearer to the death curse carried by the last true Linnorm King to have worn the\
  \ helm. This curse cannot be dispelled while the crown is worn, but ends as soon\
  \ as the helm is removed."
destruction: "The funerary crown of the true king can be destroyed only if it is swallowed\
  \ by Fafnheir, the Father of All Linnorms."
