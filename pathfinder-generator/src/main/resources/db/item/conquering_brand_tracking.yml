  \ tip to grow red hot for 1 hour, and during this time one creature can be branded.\
  \ The brand's recipient is burned as normal for a branding iron (see page 63) and\
  \ is also affected as per brand (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 207) or\
  \ another spell the conquering brand carries, as the wielder of the brand chooses.\
