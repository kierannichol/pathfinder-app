description: "This slender silver crown is decorated with a single cat's eye gemstone\
  \ as a centerpiece. When the gem is attached to the crown, its wearer gains darkvision\
  \ 60 feet, or increases her darkvision by 60 feet if she already possesses that\
  \ sense. The gemstone is detachable, and can be rolled into rooms, dropped into\
  \ holes, thrown through windows, or planted on a creature. Once per day, on command,\
  \ the crown's wearer gains the benefit of the clairaudience/clairvoyance spell,\
  \ but uses the cat's eye gemstone as that spell's sensor and gains darkvision when\
  \ viewing through that sensor. If the stone is held or carried by a creature, even\
  \ within a sack or some other container, the creature wearing the crown uses the\
  \ senses of the creature carrying the gemstone as the sensor instead, whether or\
  \ not the creature carrying the gemstone is aware of the stone's true purpose or\
  \ even its existence. Destroying the gem (hardness 8, hp 5) severs the link, but\
  \ a new cat's eye gemstone worth at least 100 gp can be fashioned and attuned to\
  \ the crown. The attunement process takes 24 hours."
