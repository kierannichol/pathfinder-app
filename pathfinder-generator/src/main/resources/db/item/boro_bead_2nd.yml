description: "This multicolored, sturdy glass bead is an aid to members of the alchemist\
  \ class. Once per day on command, a boro bead enables the bearer to recharge any\
  \ one extract that he had mixed and then consumed that day. The extract is then\
  \ reconstituted and usable again, just as if it had not been drank. The extract\
  \ must be of a particular level, depending on the bead. Different beads exist for\
  \ recalling one extract per day of each level from 1st through 6th. A bead works\
  \ on an infusion, but not a potion, elixir, bomb, mutagen, or nonmagical alchemical\
  \ material such as antitoxin."
