description: "Under regular scrutiny, a hollow book appears as a normal tome. However,\
  \ it is designed to hold a concealed item within its pages. One type of hollow book\
  \ simply has a cavity cut into the interior pages that can hold a small pouch or\
  \ similar item. Flipping the cover of this type of book open instantly reveals its\
  \ true nature. Another type has a much thinner cavity cut into its unusually thick\
  \ cover. The cavity is concealed by the book's end-paper, which is affixed to the\
  \ inside of the cover by a gentle adhesive and can be peeled back and then reclosed\
  \ repeatedly. A small packet of folded documents can be carefully hidden inside\
  \ the cavity, and a successful DC 20 Perception check is required to notice the\
  \ hidden space."
