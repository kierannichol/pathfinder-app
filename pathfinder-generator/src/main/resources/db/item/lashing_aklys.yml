description: "The lashing aklys was first invented by derro magisters to bolster their\
  \ ability to upend their foes. A lashing aklys is a +1 aklys that grants a +2 bonus\
  \ on combat maneuver checks made to trip foesâ€”this bonus stacks with that granted\
  \ by Improved Trip. If you have Improved Trip, you can make trip attempts against\
  \ foes of up to two size categories larger than you with a lashing aklys."
