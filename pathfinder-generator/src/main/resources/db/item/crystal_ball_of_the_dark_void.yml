description: "Crystal balls of the dark void look like dark-colored crystal balls.\
  \ Upon inspection, most appear to be filled with roiling clouds of midnight blue\
  \ smoke, but some seem to contain motes of light that evoke the night sky. This\
  \ item functions as a standard crystal ball, but can be used to cast sending once\
  \ per day targeting any creature observed in the crystal ball.\nOnce per month,\
  \ the user can attempt to use a crystal ball of the dark void to contact a flying\
  \ creature from the depths of space called a shantak (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2\
  \ 244). The user must attempt at a DC 25 Spellcraft check. If the attempt to contact\
  \ a shantak is successful, the monster flies to the location where the user was\
  \ when contact was made. It arrives there in 3d20 hours, at which point the user\
  \ must use Diplomacy or magic to compel the shantak to serve him. Failure to do\
  \ so (or failure to meet the shantak) causes the angry shantak to remain in the\
  \ area for 2d6 hours, attacking anything that comes near.\nEvery time a crystal\
  \ ball of the dark void is used, there's a 5% chance that the item doesn't work\
  \ as intended and instead reveals glimpses of alien horrors from the depths of the\
  \ Dark Tapestry to the user, who must immediately attempt a DC 20 Will save to avoid\
  \ taking 1d4 points of Wisdom drain."
