description: "Keenly aware of their vulnerability to light and to those who wield\
  \ it as a weapon, the drow have pioneered many ways to defend themselves against\
  \ light—magic or otherwise. Light-killer's grease is a pungent, oily alchemical\
  \ substance harvested from underground fungus and mixed with powdered minerals common\
  \ in the deep earth.\nWhen combined correctly, this black, tarry mass absorbs light.\
  \ It must be applied around a creature's eyes (a fullround action) to function.\
  \ When worn, it negates the dazzled condition from exposure to bright light and\
  \ grants a +1 alchemical bonus on saving throws against spells and effects with\
  \ the light descriptor. The grease is considered an overpowering scent for the purpose\
  \ of the scent special ability, and a creature with scent can pinpoint the wearer's\
  \ location at a range of 10 feet instead of 5 feet.\nOnce applied, the grease remains\
  \ potent for 1 hour. Removing the grease is a full-round action that requires a\
  \ gallon of water or another suitable washing liquid; otherwise, the visual marks\
  \ can be removed, ending the effect, but the smell remains for the full duration.\n\
  Crafting light-killer's grease requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check."
