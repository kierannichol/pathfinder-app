description: "This musket has a warhammer head at the end of its barrel, which allows\
  \ it to be used as both a musket and a warhammer. It is considered a double weapon\
  \ for the purposes of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon. If\
  \ this firearm gains the broken condition, both the firearm component and the warhammer\
  \ are considered broken. A warhammer musket uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black\
  \ powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm."
