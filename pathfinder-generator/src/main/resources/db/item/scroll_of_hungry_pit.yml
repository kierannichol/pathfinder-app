name: "Scroll of Hungry Pit"
description: "This spell functions as create pit, except that the pit has the ability\
  \ to squeeze and crush any creature trapped within it and has a maximum depth of\
  \ 100 feet. Creatures who fall into the hole take falling damage as normal. In addition,\
  \ anyone within the pit, not just those on the bottom, takes 4d6 points of bludgeoning\
  \ damage each round as the pit contracts and then returns to its normal size (a\
  \ successful Reflex save halves this damage). The ever-shifting walls of the pit\
  \ are quite difficult to scale and have a Climb DC of 35."
