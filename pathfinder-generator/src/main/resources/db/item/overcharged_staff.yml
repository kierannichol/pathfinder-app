description: "This staff appears as a normal staff of electricity, except it is black\
  \ instead of silver and electricity occasionally arcs along the shaft. The curse\
  \ on this weapon alters the shocking grasp, lightning bolt, and chain lightning\
  \ spells granted by the staff, causing extra surges of energy to damage the wielder\
  \ and his allies.\nWhen the wielder uses the overcharged staff to cast shocking\
  \ grasp, he takes 1d3 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 5d3).\
  \ When the wielder uses the overcharged staff to cast lightning bolt, a random ally\
  \ takes 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d6); the ally\
  \ takes half that amount with a successful Reflex save. When the wielder uses the\
  \ overcharged staff to cast chain lightning, for each target the wielder chooses\
  \ as a primary or secondary target, a random ally must be chosen as a secondary\
  \ target."
