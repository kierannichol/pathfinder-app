description: "These alchemically prepared fungal spores are suspended in a thick green\
  \ ichor. They grow in patterns that match any plant or fungal material they touch,\
  \ even dead wood, causing any cuts or breaks in the matter to mend as if it had\
  \ never been damaged. When applied as a full-round action, mimic fibers heal 1d10+10\
  \ points of damage to one object made of wood, paper, earth, or other living or\
  \ onceliving material. Even a destroyed item can be repaired (treat as if at 0 hit\
  \ points) as long as the item is in no more than two pieces and is held together\
  \ at the break as the spores are applied."
