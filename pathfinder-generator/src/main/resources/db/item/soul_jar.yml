description: "An empty soul jar can be used to contain a soul that has been successfully\
  \ trapped in a black sapphire via soul bind. Holding the gemstone against the soul\
  \ jar's lid for 1 full round transfers the soul in the gem to the soul jar (which\
  \ can hold the soul of a creature of up to 20 Hit Dice), leaving the black sapphire\
  \ unharmed 50% of the time. The rest of the time, transferring the soul from gem\
  \ to jar shatters the black sapphire. A creature that can use soul bind as a spell-like\
  \ ability (and thus does not use a focus) can automatically place a captured soul\
  \ in a held soul jar as the spell-like ability is used. A soul in a soul jar cannot\
  \ travel to the Boneyard to be judged, but can be restored to life via resurrection\
  \ or more powerful magic. A soul jar can contain only one soul at a time. Soul jars\
  \ are fragile (hardness 1, hp 10); if a soul jar is broken, the soul held within\
  \ immediately escapes to the Boneyard."
