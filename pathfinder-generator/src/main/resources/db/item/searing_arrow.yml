description: "This +1 flaming arrow continues to burn its target each round, dealing\
  \ 1d6 points of fire damage on the attacker's turn for the next 3 rounds. Removing\
  \ the arrow requires a successful DC 10 Heal check and prevents any further damage\
  \ from the arrow (the DC increases to 15 if the target tries to remove the arrow\
  \ from himself). Removing the arrow destroys it, and it burns up once the 3 rounds\
  \ pass."
