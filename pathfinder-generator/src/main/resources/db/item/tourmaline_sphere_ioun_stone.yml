description: "This stone grants you a benefit when you're dying. When determining\
  \ the number of negative hit points you must accrue to die, treat your Constitution\
  \ score as if it were 2 higher. This doesn't provide a bonus to Constitution, so\
  \ it doesn't grant a bonus on checks to stabilize, but it does provide you 2 additional\
  \ rounds in which you can attempt such checks. You can benefit from only one tourmaline\
  \ sphere ioun stone at a time.\nRevelation: This stone grants a +1 bonus on Constitution\
  \ checks to stabilize when dying."
