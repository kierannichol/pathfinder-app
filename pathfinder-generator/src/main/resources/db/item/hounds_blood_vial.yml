description: "If you apply the thick, red paste known as hound's blood to your nostrils\
  \ or upper lip, it greatly enhances your sense of smell. For most creatures, this\
  \ grants a +2 alchemical bonus on Perception checks for 1 hour. For gnomes, it briefly\
  \ grants a super-heightened sense of smell, granting the scent ability for 5 minutes,\
  \ before the potency is reduced to a +2 alchemical bonus on Perception checks for\
  \ an additional 1 hour."
