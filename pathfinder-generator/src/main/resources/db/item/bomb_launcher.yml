description: "These odd looking, egg-shaped contraptions have cleverly placed fins\
  \ that improve bombs' accuracy. Goblin alchemists use these special containers to\
  \ make their bombs more accurate when thrown long distances. Using a bomb launcher\
  \ when throwing a bomb increases the bomb's range increment to 30 feet (or increases\
  \ the range increment of a bomb with the rocket bomb discovery to 70 feet). Bomb\
  \ launchers are destroyed when used."
