description: "This item takes the form of a half-dozen brown beans, usually contained\
  \ in a simple burlap sack. Ten minutes after the beans are planted in the ground,\
  \ they sprout into a 350-foot-tall beanstalk as if created by the beanstalk spell\
  \ (see page 70). The magic beans are consumed in the process. The beanstalk lasts\
  \ for 24 hours before collapsing into a pile of rotten plant matter."
