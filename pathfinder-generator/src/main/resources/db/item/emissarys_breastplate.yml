description: "When not being worn, this simple steel +1 breastplate appears to be\
  \ typical magic armor. When worn by a cavalier with the banner class feature, an\
  \ emissary's breastplate automatically displays the cavalier's heraldry and counts\
  \ as his banner. As long as the cavalier is not in disguise, he is considered to\
  \ be displaying his banner while wearing the armor. Additionally, the wearer can\
  \ expend a use of his challenge ability to speak on behalf of himself, his lord,\
  \ or other agent who has given him the authority to do so. This allows him to use\
  \ tongues (as per the spell) and issue a single command (as per the spell)."
