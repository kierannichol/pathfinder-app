description: "Horror dust is the compressed stuff of nightmares. It is contained in\
  \ a glass vial that can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10\
  \ feet. It shatters on impact, creating a cloud of hallucinogenic magic in a 20-foot\
  \ radius that causes victims to suffer terrible visions and hear phantom screams.\
  \ Targets in this area must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be shaken for 1d6 rounds.\
  \ If a creature is directly struck with the horror dust and fails its save, it is\
  \ also confused for 1 round. Goblinoids actually enjoy the visions created by horror\
  \ dust, and are immune to its fear effect."
