name: "Wand of Wandering Star Motes"
description: "You create sparkling motes of bright light that shoot toward the target\
  \ and swirl around it in a complex pattern. The pattern clearly outlines the target\
  \ and radiates light as if it were a sunrod, negating any concealment for the target.\
  \ The target must make a successful Will save. If the target fails its save, it\
  \ is dazed for 1 round and must make another save on its next turn or be dazed again\
  \ for 1 round. The target must continue making Will saves each round. If a target\
  \ makes its Will save, the wandering star motesjump to the nearest enemy within\
  \ 30 feet, who must now make Will saves every round or be dazed. Any time a target\
  \ makes its Will save, the wandering star motesjump to the next nearest enemy within\
  \ 30 feet. A given creature can only be affected by the wandering star motesonce;\
  \ once a target has successfully saved against the spell, it cannot be affected\
  \ again. If there are no new targets within 30 feet of a target that has successfully\
  \ made its save, the spell immediately ends. The spell only affects enemy creatures;\
  \ your allies are not affected."
