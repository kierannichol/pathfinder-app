description: "Abat-Ne, better known as the Blackstone Mace, is a +2 defiant light\
  \ mace named for the fist-sized mystic ebon s tone that serves as the weapon's head.\
  \ This stone head is set on a plain wooden handle fitted with a bronze hand guard,\
  \ though closer inspection reveals that the hand guard was likely added some years\
  \ after the weapon was made.\nConstructed for those whose task was driving back\
  \ and crushing foreigners seeking to usurp the kingdom of Osirion from its true\
  \ people, the Blackstone Mace senses anyone within 60 feet who was not born in Osirion,\
  \ and immediately alerts its owner of all such threats. Unfortunately, the mace\
  \ is unable to distinguish between foreigners who pose legitimate threats and those\
  \ with good intentions. Instead, whenever the mace detects someone non-native, it\
  \ immediately presses its owner to drive that person offâ€”or, if the encounter seems\
  \ especially dangerous, to kill her. To get the mace to cease its demands, the wielder\
  \ must succeed at a Will save against the mace's Ego. If the wielder fails this\
  \ struggle for dominance, his only recourse is to try to convince the mace of the\
  \ foreigner's innocent intentions.\nSimilarly, the mace fails to identify native\
  \ Osirians who may pose a threat. If used against a native Osirian, the mace refuses\
  \ to aid its wielder and shuts down its offensive magical properties, instead functioning\
  \ as a nonmagical masterwork light mace. In order to restore its powers, the wielder\
  \ must reason with the weapon and convince it that the individual or individuals\
  \ that were attacked pose a serious threat to Osirion. Not only is the mace prejudiced,\
  \ it is also arrogant and has the unfortunate quirk of constantly retelling the\
  \ same stories about how it helped various warriors throughout the centuries achieve\
  \ their victories. Still, once the mace commits to vanquishing an opponent, it proves\
  \ relentless in fulfilling its purpose."
