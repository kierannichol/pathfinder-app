description: "This weapon functions identically to a repeating heavy crossbow, except\
  \ that its damage, critical, and range values are equivalent to those of a light\
  \ crossbow instead of a heavy crossbow. Its significantly lighter construction and\
  \ pull make it both more portable and more useful to those who rely on stealth or\
  \ speed."
