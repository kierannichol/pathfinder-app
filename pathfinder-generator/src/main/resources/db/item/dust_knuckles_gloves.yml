description: "This fingerless leather glove includes four small pouches along the\
  \ knuckle line into which you can insert tiny glass vials. You can fill the vials\
  \ with poison or ground minerals. When you punch someone in the face, the vials\
  \ shatter, releasing their contents into the target's face and eyes. Together, the\
  \ four vials hold 1 dose of poison or ground minerals; there is no effect unless\
  \ all four are full.\nDiamond Dust Vials (25 gp): These vials are filled with finely\
  \ ground mineral crystals. When you shatter a vial with your punch, the target you\
  \ hit must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save to shield its eyes or be temporarily blinded\
  \ for 1 round."
