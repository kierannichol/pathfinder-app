description: "Thin golden strands snake through this transparent shaft, seeming to\
  \ flow from one brass end-cap to the other. Once per day when the wielder is damaged\
  \ by an effect that deals at least 10 points of electricity damage, the staff regains\
  \ 1 charge. This does not reduce the amount of damage the wielder takes from the\
  \ effect."
