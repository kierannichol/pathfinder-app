description: "This +1 shortbow is crafted from one of the long spines that bristle\
  \ along the body of a sea serpent. When used against a magical beast with the aquatic\
  \ subtype, a serpentseeker bow gains the benefit of the bane weapon special ability.\
  \ If such a creature is hit by an arrow fired from this weapon, anyone who touches\
  \ the bow senses the location of that creature as though by locate creature as long\
  \ as the arrow remains imbedded in the creature. If the creature is protected by\
  \ nondetection or a similar effect, anyone holding the bow gains a +10 competence\
  \ bonus on the caster level check to overcome it, but a failed check means the arrow's\
  \ magic burns out. The locating magic on an arrow fired from this bow automatically\
  \ ends after 1d6 days."
