description: "This portable hookah can be worn as a backpack, obviating the need to\
  \ set the hookah down before filling it with water. Up to four creatures (including\
  \ the wearer and any adjacent creatures) can use a traveler's hookah during the\
  \ same round. While wearing a traveler's hookah, you can stopper the hookah's bowl\
  \ valve as an immediate action to prevent unwanted individuals from using it until\
  \ the valve is reopened as a free action. If you are knocked unconscious or otherwise\
  \ fall prone while wearing a traveler's hookah, you must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex\
  \ save or the hookah is smashed during the fall. A traveler's hookah can hold up\
  \ to 5 doses of a single substance, and has four hoses."
