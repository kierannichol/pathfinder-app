description: "This pearl is worth at least 1,000 gp for its beauty alone, yet if it\
  \ is clasped firmly in hand or held to the breast while the possessor attempts actions\
  \ related to the pearl's powers, she understands and is able to employ the item.\n\
  The pearl enables its possessor to breathe in water as if she were in clean, fresh\
  \ air. Her swim speed is 60 feet, and she can cast spells and act underwater without\
  \ hindrance."
