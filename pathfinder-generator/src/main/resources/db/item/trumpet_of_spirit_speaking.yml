description: "This long, segmented cone is made of a lightweight metal and collapses\
  \ into three sections. Although nonmagical spirit trumpets are most often used by\
  \ fraudulent mediums and manipulated with sleight of hand and ventriloquism, a trumpet\
  \ of spirit speaking allows actual communication with the spirits of the deceased.\
  \ Once per day, when its mouthpiece is placed to the lips of a mostly intact corpse,\
  \ the user can ask up to three questions of the dead creature, as if the corpse\
  \ were subject to a speak with dead spell. The corpse's replies to the questions\
  \ issue forth from the horn in quiet, ghostly whispers."
