description: "Each of these silver-and-gemstone rings is attuned to a specific aiudara,\
  \ or elf gate. The ring must be created at the aiudara in question, and its gemstone\
  \ always matches the gate's portal-key. On command once per week, the ring teleports\
  \ its wearer back to that gate, as per word of recall. Theoretically, a ring of\
  \ retreat could be crafted instead to transport the wearer to a specific site of\
  \ import, such as a temple or stronghold, but to date, these rings have been crafted\
  \ only with elf gates in mind."
