description: "This miniature stone stalactite measures 4 to 5 inches long. As a standard\
  \ action, you can toss a portable stalactite up to any solid surface no more than\
  \ 20 feet above, whereupon the portable stalactite automatically affixes to the\
  \ ceiling. If no suitable ceiling exists, the portable stalactite falls at your\
  \ feet.\nOnce affixed, the portable stalactite remains in place until you call it\
  \ back to your hand (a standard action) or until a living creature (except you)\
  \ walks under it, at which point it drops from the ceiling and makes a +10 attack\
  \ roll aainst the target. If it hits, it deals 1d6+1 points of damage.\nYou can\
  \ affix as many portable stalactites as you like to an area's ceiling, but you must\
  \ leave at least 5 feet of space between each. A portable stalactite can be detected\
  \ and disarmed as if it were a trapâ€”it's a DC 20 Search check to discover, and a\
  \ DC 15 Disarm Device check to safely detach one."
