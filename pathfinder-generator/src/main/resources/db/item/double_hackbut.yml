description: "This double-length rifle uses a pair of trunnions to mount its barrel\
  \ into a swiveling mechanism fastened to the top of a lightweight, twowheeled carriage.\
  \ It takes a full-round action to set up the carriage. The carriage has a hind leg,\
  \ allowing the wielder to wheel the device about and immediately prop it for stability\
  \ during combat. Unlike other two-handed firearms, you must fire the double hackbut\
  \ while it is mounted, or else firing it imparts a â€“4 penalty on attack rolls and\
  \ the recoil knocks you prone. A Large or larger creature can fire a double hackbut\
  \ one size smaller than itself without the gun's mounting as a normal two-handed\
  \ weapon and without the danger of being knocked prone, but takes the normal penalty\
  \ for firing an inappropriately sized weapon. This is an early firearm."
