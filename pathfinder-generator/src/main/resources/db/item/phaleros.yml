description: "A phaleros is a type of metal javelin that stores a splash weapon in\
  \ a small cage between the haft and the spearhead. When a phaleros strikes its target,\
  \ the spearhead compresses toward the haft and breaks the payload, showering the\
  \ target with its contents as though you had struck the target's square with the\
  \ splash weapon. On a critical hit, you instead treat the target as though it had\
  \ suffered a direct hit from the splash weapon. A phaleros is reusable, and reloading\
  \ one with a splash weapon is a process that takes two rounds and provokes attacks\
  \ of opportunity."
