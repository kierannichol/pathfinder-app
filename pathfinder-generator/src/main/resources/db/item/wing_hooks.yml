description: "These wooden braces hook on to a gathlain's wings to help in clinging\
  \ to ivy, tree limbs, or other surfaces with significant handholds. Many wing hooks\
  \ are decorated with intricate carvings. A gathlain wearing wing hooks can cling\
  \ to a surface with a Climb DC of 10 or lower without effort, and can safely sleep\
  \ there. The wing hooks leave the gathlain's arms free while attempting Climb checks\
  \ on such surfaces."
