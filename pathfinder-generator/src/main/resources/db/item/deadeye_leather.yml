description: "This mottled green-and-brown +1 shadow studded leather has the symbol\
  \ of Erastil burned into the shoulder. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer\
  \ can prepare a perfectly aimed shot; as long as the wearer's next attack roll is\
  \ made before the end of the next round, this attack ignores the target's miss chance\
  \ and AC bonus from cover and concealment (but not total concealment)."
