description: "The tiny compartment in the thick bottom of this cup is an excellent\
  \ place to store a small item or substance. The most insidious are designed with\
  \ a weighted catch that opens when the cup is tilted back, releasing the hidden\
  \ substance into the contents of the cup. Spotting the secret compartment in an\
  \ empty cup requires a DC 15 Perception check."
