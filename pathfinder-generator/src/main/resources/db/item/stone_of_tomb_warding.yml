description: "When hung above a door or other portal, this smooth, scarab-shaped stone\
  \ prevents undead creatures from entering. An intelligent undead creature attempting\
  \ to move through the warded portal or touch the stone must attempt a DC 13 Will\
  \ save. If it fails, the creature cannot make another attempt until 24 hours have\
  \ passed. If it succeeds, the creature is immune to the stone's effect for 24 hours.\
  \ Nonintelligent undead creatures don't get a saving throw against the effect."
