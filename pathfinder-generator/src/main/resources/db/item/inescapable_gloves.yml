description: "The palms of these light doeskin gloves are covered with supple ripples\
  \ to augment the wearer's grip. The wearer gains a +4 competence bonus on combat\
  \ maneuver checks to grapple. The wearer can expend one use of mythic power when\
  \ a creature subject to freedom of movement or a similar effect attempts to escape\
  \ the wearer's grapple with a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check. That\
  \ creature must attempt the check as normal instead of automatically succeeding\
  \ at it. If a creature attempts use a non-mythic teleportation effect to escape\
  \ the grapple, the wearer can expend two uses of mythic power to negate that effect."
