name: "Oil of Share Language"
description: "You can share your facility for one particular language with another\
  \ creature. For 24 hours the target can read, understand, and communicate to the\
  \ best of its ability in any one language which you already know. For every 5 levels\
  \ you possess, you can grant the use of another language you know, to a maximum\
  \ of 5 languages at 20th level. The target must have the physical capacity to articulate\
  \ sounds, make gestures, or engage in whatever other method speakers of the language\
  \ use to communicate with each other in order to actually converse. If the target\
  \ lacks the mental capacity to grasp an actual language it still gains enough knowledge\
  \ to respond to and carry out even extremely complex commands or suggestions coached\
  \ in the language (whether written or spoken). However, since this spell does not\
  \ endow the target with greater reasoning capacity, merely a temporarily enhanced\
  \ vocabulary, the person offering up instructions to non-sentient creatures must\
  \ take care to remove any ambiguity or guesswork."
