description: "This gold amulet is fashioned in the shape of a winged scarab beetle\
  \ holding a large ruby that represents the solar disk. The scarab grants its wearer\
  \ a +4 bonus on saving throws against fear effects, and enables its wearer to detect\
  \ any mummy within 60 feet, although he must concentrate as a standard action to\
  \ use this ability. In addition, anytime the wearer would be affected by a curse\
  \ or disease effect, the scarab of mummy defense can absorb the effect with no harm\
  \ to the wearer. Upon absorbing 12 such effects, the scarab turns to dust and is\
  \ destroyed. An effect that's both a curse and a disease, such as mummy rot, is\
  \ considered a single effect for these purposes."
