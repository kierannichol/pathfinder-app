description: "This simple-looking amulet bears the symbol of a group or cult and resembles\
  \ the jewelry its members normally wear. When the bearer presents the necklace to\
  \ a current or prospective group member (humanoids only), the recipient is compelled\
  \ to accept and don the periapt unless he succeeds at a DC 11 Will save. Thereafter,\
  \ the wearer is deeply devoted to the person who gave him the periapt, as though\
  \ affected by a charm person spell (with no additional saving throw against the\
  \ effect). He always views the giver's words and actions favorably and speaks highly\
  \ of her whenever the occasion arises."
