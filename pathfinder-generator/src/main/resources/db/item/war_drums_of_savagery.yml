description: "Orcs turn the bodies of their slain enemies into these kettle-like drums,\
  \ using the foes' skins for the drumheads and the femurs as the drumsticks. The\
  \ drums come with a harness that is worn across the shoulders and back so that the\
  \ drummer can play and walk simultaneously.\nWhen war drums of savagery are beaten\
  \ rhythmically during battle, all of the drummer's allies within 60 feet of the\
  \ drums who can hear the pounding gain the effects of the rage spell. This effect\
  \ lasts for as long as the drummer continues to play, but once the drumming stops,\
  \ the effect can't begin again for 1 day. Allies who move within 60 feet of the\
  \ drums after the drumming has begun but while they're still sounding gain the benefits\
  \ of the effect. Any allies who move out of range of the drums temporarily lose\
  \ the benefits of effect, but they regain the benefits when they move back within\
  \ range of the drums.\nIf the drummer plays the war drums of savagery as part of\
  \ a bardic performance, those affected by the rage effect don't take the penalty\
  \ to AC as long as the drummer's bardic performance continues."
