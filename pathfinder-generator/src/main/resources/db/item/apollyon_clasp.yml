description: "This dark iron pin used to fasten a cloak or cape is the shape of a\
  \ fly with glittering fragments of soul gems for eyes and is usually crafted by\
  \ those who venerate Apollyon, the Horseman of Pestilence. Once per day as a standard\
  \ action, the wearer can exhale a cloud of black flies in a 15-foot cone. Any creature\
  \ caught in the cone takes 8d6 points of slashing damage as the flies bite its flesh.\
  \ A successful DC 18 Reflex save halves this damage. If a living creature takes\
  \ damage from these flies, it must also succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or be\
  \ sickened for 1 minute. Daemons are immune to these effects"
