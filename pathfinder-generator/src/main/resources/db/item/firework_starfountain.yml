description: "This tree stump-sized bundle of tubes immediately begins to emit arcs\
  \ of multi-colored sparks when lit. Starting 1d6 rounds after lighting, it loudly\
  \ releases brightly colored streaks of tiny flaming particles for 4 rounds. Outdoors,\
  \ these particles soar far up into the sky before dispersing. Indoors or in a closed\
  \ area, the ricocheting fireworks deal 1d6 points of fire damage each round in a\
  \ 20-foot-radius spread (Reflex DC 15 halves). Creatures who fail their save are\
  \ blinded for 1d4 rounds and deafened for 1 hour. Crafting this item is a DC 25\
  \ Craft (alchemy) check."
