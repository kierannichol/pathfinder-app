description: "This consists of two woolen sheets sewn together along the bottom and\
  \ one side to create a bag for sleeping in. Some have cloth straps along the open\
  \ side so the bedroll can be tied closed while you are sleeping. It can be rolled\
  \ and tied into a tight coil for storage or transport. Most people use a blanket\
  \ with the bedroll to stay warm or provide a ground cushion."
