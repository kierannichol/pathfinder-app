description: "A long wooden staff, shod in iron and inscribed with sigils and runes\
  \ of all types, this potent artifact contains many spell powers and other functions.\
  \ Unlike a normal staff, a staff of the magi holds 50 charges and cannot be recharged\
  \ normally. Some of its powers use charges, while others don't. A staff of the magi\
  \ does not lose its powers if it runs out of charges. The following powers do not\
  \ use charges:"
destruction: "A staff of the magi can be broken for a retributive strike. Such an\
  \ act must be purposeful and declared by the wielder. All charges in the staff are\
  \ released in a 30-foot spread. All within 10 feet of the broken staff take hit\
  \ points of damage equal to 8 times the number of charges in the staff, those between\
  \ 11 feet and 20 feet away take points equal to 6 times the number of charges, and\
  \ those 21 feet to 30 feet distant take 4 times the number of charges. A DC 23 Reflex\
  \ save reduces damage by half.\nThe character breaking the staff has a 50% chance\
  \ (01–50 on d%) of traveling to another plane of existence, but if she does not\
  \ (51–100), the explosive release of spell energy destroys her (no saving throw)."
