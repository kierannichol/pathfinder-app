description: "This iron pot is large enough for two Medium humanoids to stand in comfortably.\
  \ Upon command, the cauldron and up to 500 pounds of additional weight can fly as\
  \ if using overland flight. The cauldron moves under the direction of the person\
  \ who spoke the activating command word. It can carry up to double its capacity,\
  \ but doing so reduces its speed to 30 feet. It can hover in place without the need\
  \ for a Fly skill check. The cauldron provides partial cover for anyone standing\
  \ in it. It has a hardness of 10 and 60 hit points."
