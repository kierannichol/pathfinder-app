description: "The bones of Founder Raccona are small, blackened bone fragments, most\
  \ no more than an inch long, and that radiate a faint, soothing warmth. Each bone\
  \ grants the bearer 1 temporary hit point. These temporary hit points stack with\
  \ other temporary hit points gained from possessing multiple bones of Founder Raccona,\
  \ but not with those from other sources. These temporary hit points return daily\
  \ at dawn. There are a total of 32 bones that bear the power of the Founder Raccona.\n\
  In addition to granting temporary hit points, the bearer of one or more of these\
  \ bones is always aware of the presence of other bones of Founder Raccona within\
  \ 50 feet.\nThe bones also possess a mild drive to seek out their remaining pieces.\
  \ Every time a character acquires a bone of Founder Raccona, she must make a Will\
  \ save (DC 10 + the number of bones of Founder Raccona in her possession). Failure\
  \ causes the character to have a dream of Founder Raccona that encourages her to\
  \ seek out the other bones. This dream does not force the character to act, but\
  \ suggests that seeking the remaining bones would be a benevolent act. Should all\
  \ 32 bones of Founder Raccona ever be gathered together, they immediately crumble\
  \ to dust and release Raccona's soul to the afterlife, losing all power."
