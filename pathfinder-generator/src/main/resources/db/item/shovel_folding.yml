description: "This tool lets you dig a pit at a rate of 2 cubic feet per minute. If\
  \ a shovel is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals\
  \ bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size.\nFolding Shovel: A folding\
  \ shovel is a full-sized shovel with a sturdy sectional handle that folds into pieces\
  \ no longer than the shovel blade, allowing it to fit in a smaller space such as\
  \ a backpack. Converting the shovel from its folded state to usable (or vice versa)\
  \ is 2 full-round actions."
