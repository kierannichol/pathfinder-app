description: "This grotesque suit of +1 hide armor is stitched together from the hides\
  \ of gugs from the underworld of the Dreamlands and the nightmare realm of Leng.\
  \ The wearer of a suit of gug hide gains the benefits of Leng's basic infusion when\
  \ in an underground environment. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can\
  \ cause his arms to each split into two arms at the elbow, each bearing a furred\
  \ hand like that of a horrid subterranean gug. The wearer must designate one hand\
  \ as his primary hand; all others are considered off hands. He can use any of his\
  \ hands for other purposes that require free hands. A user who has Two Weapon Fighting\
  \ is treated as if he had Multi-Weapon Fighting while these extra arms are activated.\
  \ This ability lasts for 10 minutes and has no effect if the wearer already has\
  \ more than two arms."
