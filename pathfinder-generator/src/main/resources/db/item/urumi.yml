description: "Commonly known as a whip sword, this deadly weapon is fashioned from\
  \ one to four 5-foot-long, razor-sharp blades of flexible steel, almost like a metal\
  \ cato'- nine-tails. The weapon is wielded by whipping the blades at one's opponent.\
  \ The coiled blade is fine and flexible enough to be worn as a belt, and its wielders\
  \ often carry the blades wrapped around themselves in this fashion."
