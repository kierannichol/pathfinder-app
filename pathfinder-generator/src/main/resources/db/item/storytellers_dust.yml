description: "This dust is kept in gaudy bags, but is a simple white powder. When\
  \ thrown into a fire, it conjures a visible theater of the mind (as minor image)\
  \ within a 10-foot cube above the flames. The user can manipulate this illusion,\
  \ which lasts for 2 hours or until the user banishes the scene. The user gains a\
  \ +2 bonus on all Performance checks to tell a story using the image created by\
  \ the dust."
