description: "Dyed in somber shades of gray and tipped with treated shards of bone\
  \ instead of blade-tips, this +1 bladed scarf is predominantly used by wandering\
  \ Varisian caravans in the nation of Ustalav.\nThe wielder of a wanderer's scarf\
  \ is affected by a continual hide from undead spell as long as he carries or wears\
  \ it. In circumstances where the spell effect would normally end (such as when channeling\
  \ positive energy), this effect is suspended for 24 hours. Intelligent undead can\
  \ perceive the wielder by succeeding at a DC 10 Will saving throw.\nWhen used in\
  \ combat, this weapon deals an additional 1d6 points of positive energy damage to\
  \ any undead creature it strikes."
