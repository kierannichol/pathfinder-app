description: "This strange leather-bound book contains erratic handwriting; the words\
  \ within it appear to have been translated from Gnome into Common (and perhaps some\
  \ other language before Gnome). It contains notations of strange cult practices,\
  \ disturbing rants about ancient godlike beings, and confusing diagrams resembling\
  \ summoning circles, with many parts crossed out or obliterated with ink or fire.\
  \ The bearer of Preklikin's Book of Cults gains a +1 resistance bonus on Will saving\
  \ throws while carrying the book.\nIf the bearer's patron is one of the Great Old\
  \ Ones, the bearer can hold the book in one hand to use it as a lesser extend metamagic\
  \ rod, but only for conjuration spells that summon or call an evil outsider."
