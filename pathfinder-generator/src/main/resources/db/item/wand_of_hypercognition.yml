name: "Wand of Hypercognition"
description: "You rapidly catalog and collate all available data on a person, place,\
  \ thing, or event, calling to mind scraps of memory and assembling clues in a logical\
  \ and systematic order. Immediately after casting the spell, you can begin spending\
  \ the necessary time to perform an Intelligence check, a Linguistics check to detect\
  \ a forgery or decipher a hidden message, or a Knowledge check. If the check requires\
  \ at least 3 rounds, you can perform it five times as quickly (minimum 1 round).\
  \ If the check required fewer than 3 rounds, you can perform it instantly. Either\
  \ way, you gain an insight bonus on the check equal to your caster level (maximum\
  \ bonus +10), but this bonus can't raise your result above what you could have achieved\
  \ on a natural 20."
