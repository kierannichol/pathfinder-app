description: "Invisible ink is a staple of spies, rebels, and secret societies everywhere.\
  \ Messages written with invisible ink only become visible under specific circumstances.\
  \ Revealing the secret message with the proper triggering agent is a full-round\
  \ action per page of text. A successful Craft (alchemy) check reveals the message\
  \ without the proper trigger and takes 1 hour (the DC varies by ink quality).\n\
  Simple: This ink is keyed to a single, fairly common trigger, such as heat or vinegar\
  \ (DC 20 to reveal without the trigger).\nAverage: This ink is keyed to either two\
  \ common triggers or one uncommon trigger, such as blood or acid (DC 25 to reveal\
  \ without the trigger).\nGood: This ink is keyed to either two uncommon triggers\
  \ or one rare trigger, such as a specific vintage of wine or a specific kind of\
  \ monster's blood (DC 30 to reveal without the trigger).\nSuperior: This ink is\
  \ keyed to either two rare triggers or one unique trigger, such as the blood of\
  \ a specific person (DC 35 to reveal without the trigger)."
