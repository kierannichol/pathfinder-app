description: "The blade of this +2 holy bastard sword always appears lustrous and\
  \ polished, with a hilt wrapped in alternating colors of deep black and royal purple.\
  \ Effective on its own, a valor's minion is even more potent in the hands of those\
  \ who dedicate their efforts to vanquishing a single foe. Whenever a wielder uses\
  \ either the challenge or smite evil class feature, she can sacrifice one additional\
  \ use of that class feature to treat the smite or challenge as if she were three\
  \ class levels higher."
