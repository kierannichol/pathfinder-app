description: "This variant sunrod was developed by fetchling alchemists. When twisted\
  \ as a standard action, a gloomstick begins drawing in light from the surrounding\
  \ area, reducing the light level by one step (to a minimum of dim light) in a 20-foot\
  \ radius. A gloomstick remains active for 1 minute before crumbling to dust."
