description: "This intricate gold headband is decorated with several small blue and\
  \ deep purple gemstones. The headband grants the wearer an enhancement bonus to\
  \ Intelligence of +2, +4, or +6. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the\
  \ first 24 hours the headband is worn. A headband of vast intelligence has one skill\
  \ associated with it per +2 bonus it grants. After being worn for 24 hours, the\
  \ headband grants a number of skill ranks in those skills equal to the wearer's\
  \ total Hit Dice. These ranks do not stack with the ranks a creature already possesses.\
  \ These skills are chosen when the headband is created. If no skill is listed, the\
  \ headband is assumed to grant skill ranks in randomly determined Knowledge skills."
