name: "Potion of Lily Pad Stride"
description: "Your every footstep creates aquatic plants capable of supporting your\
  \ weight and that of any creature of your size or smaller that is following you.\
  \ These lily pads only appear when you cross water or other liquids which do not\
  \ immediately destroy plants. You can walk across these liquid surfaces without\
  \ any fear of stumbling (though if knocked prone, dragged under, or otherwise pulled\
  \ off your feet you still sink in the liquid). For the duration of the spell, any\
  \ creature of your size or smaller can attempt to follow you by making a DC 10 Acrobatics\
  \ check every round. Each such check allows it to move at half its normal land speed.\
  \ If the creature takes a –5 penalty on its check it can move at its normal speed.\
  \ If a creature fails an Acrobatics check, or if a creature that's larger than you\
  \ attempts to follow, it falls through, damaging the plants. Each time a creature\
  \ falls through, all subsequent creatures take a cumulative –5 penalty on their\
  \ Acrobatics checks when traveling across that particular stretch of plants. As\
  \ you move, the lily pads disappear behind you once you pass beyond the spell's\
  \ range. Otherwise, they remain until the spell's duration expires."
