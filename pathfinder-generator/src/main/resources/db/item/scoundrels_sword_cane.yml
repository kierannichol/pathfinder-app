description: "A skull and partial backbone carved from ivory top this +2 sword cane\
  \ (Advanced Player's Guide 179), and gray sharkskin covers its wooden scabbard.\
  \ The wielder can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply her Dexterity modifier instead\
  \ of her Strength modifier to attack rolls with a scoundrel's sword cane sized for\
  \ her, even though it isn't a light weapon.\nThe eyes of the skull atop the scoundrel's\
  \ sword cane constantly enhance the wielder's awareness, granting the wielder a\
  \ +5 competence bonus on Perception checks. In addition, once per day, the wielder\
  \ can concentrate while holding the cane to see through the skull's eyes as if they\
  \ were her own. In effect, the scoundrel's sword cane can be used as a periscope,\
  \ allowing the wielder to safely peer over obstacles or around corners. If the wielder\
  \ has total concealment from an observed creature except for the end of the cane,\
  \ the wielder uses the skull's Diminutive size modifier for her Stealth check instead\
  \ of her own size modifier."
