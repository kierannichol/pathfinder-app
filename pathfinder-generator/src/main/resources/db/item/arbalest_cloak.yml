description: "Images of ballistae ornament this metallic cloak, which fits easily\
  \ over armor and other bulky clothing. The wearer can activate this cloak as a swift\
  \ action, causing the garment to splay outward for 1 round, its jagged hem protruding\
  \ around the wearer in stiff, sharp points. While the cloak is active, the wearer\
  \ counts as wearing masterwork armor spikes with which she is proficient, and she\
  \ can walk on air (as though using the air walk spell). If she's riding a mount,\
  \ the air walk effect instead affects the mount while the cloak is active, and the\
  \ mount can move with the item's help even if it's not specially trained to move\
  \ with the aid of air walk. If the wearer (or her mount) isn't standing on a solid\
  \ surface by the end of the round, she immediately falls, taking any applicable\
  \ falling damage.\nIn addition, on her first successful charge attack during the\
  \ round the cloak is active, the wearer deals an additional 1d6 points of piercing\
  \ damage (1d4 if she is Small), plus another 1d6 (or 1d4 if she is Small) for every\
  \ 20 feet the wearer traveled in a straight line during the charge (maximum 3d6).\n\
  This cloak can be activated up to three times per day, but not more often than once\
  \ per minute."
