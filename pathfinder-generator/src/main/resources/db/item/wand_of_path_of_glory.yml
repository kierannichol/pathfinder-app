description: "You cause four 5-foot squares (one of which must be your space) to glow\
  \ with dim illumination. Starting on your next turn, as a swift action you can extend\
  \ the glowing area by an additional four 5-foot squares; each new square must be\
  \ adjacent to a square that was previously glowing. Allies that end their turns\
  \ on a glowing square (including one who falls unconscious in the square) are healed\
  \ of 1 point of damage."
