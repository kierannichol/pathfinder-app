description: "This stone grants only 1 temporary hit point, even if the target's Charisma\
  \ bonus is higher than 1.\nResonance: This stone allows the user to pick up on psychic\
  \ resonance from corpses. So long as the user has carried the ioun stone continuously\
  \ for at least 24 hours, the first three corpses touched by the user each day babble\
  \ residual psychic impressions into the bearer's mind. This functions as the grave\
  \ words spell, except that only the user can hear the corpse speak."
