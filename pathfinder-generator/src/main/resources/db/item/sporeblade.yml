description: "Bulbous fungal growths sprout from this short sword's blade, particularly\
  \ around the hilt. The fungal growths constantly swell, wither, and sprout again\
  \ in a continuous cycle. The growths appear bright blue, green, yellow, and purple.\
  \ The weapon's blade is a dull gray that does not reflect light.\nThe sporeblade\
  \ is a +2 keen short sword. On a successful critical hit, the sporeblade deals its\
  \ normal critical damage and also creates a puff of mottled spores. The victim of\
  \ the critical hit must make a DC 20 Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim\
  \ takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and becomes fatigued for 1 hour as the\
  \ spores take root in his flesh and grow with unsettling speed into thick, fibrous\
  \ tendrils. The special critical hit ability of the sporeblade functions no more\
  \ than once per round."
