description: "This longsword always performs as a +2 longsword, but it also has the\
  \ power to draw the life force from an opponent. It can do this nine times before\
  \ the ability is lost. At that point, the sword becomes a simple +2 longsword (with\
  \ a faint evil aura). A critical hit must be dealt for the sword's death-dealing\
  \ ability to function, and this ability has no effect on creatures not subject to\
  \ critical hits. The victim is entitled to a DC 20 Fortitude save to avoid death.\
  \ If the save is successful, the sword's death-dealing ability does not function,\
  \ no use of the ability is expended, and normal critical damage is determined. This\
  \ sword is evil, and any good character attempting to wield it gains two negative\
  \ levels. These negative levels remain as long as the sword is in hand and disappear\
  \ when the sword is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual\
  \ level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells)\
  \ while the sword is wielded."
