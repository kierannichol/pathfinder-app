description: "These glass vials are held within stylized cold-iron casings etched\
  \ with strange runes, necromantic designs, or other eldritch markings. Within the\
  \ vial roils a small wisp of white vapor, churning as if caught in a miniature vortex\
  \ of air.\nTo capture a haunt's energies within a haunt siphon, you need only twist\
  \ the metal casing to open the vial in the same round that the haunt manifests (a\
  \ standard action)—this can be before or after the haunt has acted. You must be\
  \ within the haunt's area of influence to use a haunt siphon. When you activate\
  \ a haunt siphon, it deals 3d6 points of positive energy damage to a single haunt.\
  \ If it deals enough damage to the haunt to reduce the haunt's hit points to 0,\
  \ the mist inside the haunt siphon glows green—if it does not reduce the haunt to\
  \ 0 hit points, the haunt siphon is still expended and becomes nonmagical. It may\
  \ take multiple haunt siphons to destroy powerful haunts. A haunt that is neutralized\
  \ by a haunt siphon takes a –5 penalty on its caster level check to manifest again\
  \ after its reset time passes.\nA haunt siphon that neutralizes a haunt can no longer\
  \ be used to harm haunts, but it can be used as a grenadelike splash weapon that\
  \ deals 1d6 points of negative energy damage with a direct hit. Every creature within\
  \ 5 feet of the point where the haunt siphon hits takes 1 point of negative energy\
  \ damage from the splash."
