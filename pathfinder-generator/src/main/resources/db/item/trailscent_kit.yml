description: "This small box of specially prepared catfolk pheromones and alchemical\
  \ reagents can be used to leave a small group of subtle but long-lasting scents\
  \ that only catfolk can smell and decipher. Given a minute, a catfolk can create\
  \ a scent mixture and apply it to a solid object, such as a tree, a wall, or even\
  \ a smaller item such as a weapon or potion vial. When the catfolk does this, it\
  \ leaves one of the following scent impressions: danger, food, shelter, or possession.\
  \ The possession impression is always keyed to the specific catfolk using the kit,\
  \ and signifies that she owns the territory or item. Other races can attempt to\
  \ use this kit to create the danger, food, or shelter impression, but doing so requires\
  \ a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check. A catfolk can detect a particular scent\
  \ applied with a trailscent kit from 30 feet away. If the scent is upwind, the range\
  \ at which a catfolk can detect the scent increases to 60 feet; if it is downwind,\
  \ the range drops to 15 feet. A catfolk with the scent racial quality doubles those\
  \ distances. A scent impression lasts for 1 year or until it is washed away. Each\
  \ kit has 10 uses."
