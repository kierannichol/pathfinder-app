description: "Ovinrbaane (literally translated as \"enemy of all enemies\") is a cursed,\
  \ intelligent +3 wounding greatsword. When Ovinrbaane succeeds at a contest of will\
  \ (Core Rulebook 535), it uses modify memory to mislead its wielder into believing\
  \ he's the barbarian warlord Armag and that anyone around him who isn't obviously\
  \ a member of his tribe is a mortal enemy. The cursed greatsword also slowly changes\
  \ the features of the wielder over the course of several days or even weeks to appear\
  \ as those of the original Armag. If left unchecked, these powers seemingly bring\
  \ the warlord back to life, recreating the savage warrior it deems to be its own\
  \ true wielder."
destruction: "To destroy Ovinrbaane, its wielder must bring it to the Boneyard and\
  \ strike three blows against his own gravestone, causing the sword to shatter."
