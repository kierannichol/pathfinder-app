description: "This rusty iron ring looks like a twisted chain. On command, the ring\
  \ can produce a rusty, clanky length of iron chain (hardness 10, 5 hp, break DC\
  \ 26). The ring can create no more than 100 feet of chain in this way. This total\
  \ length can be split among many uses, but must be spent in 10-foot increments.\
  \ When the ring's daily allotment of chain is renewed, any previously conjured chain\
  \ rusts away. Once per day as a standard action, the user can shoot a chain from\
  \ the ring as though it were a grappling hook, except the range increment is 50\
  \ feet. Whatever length of chain she shoots out counts against ring's daily allotment."
