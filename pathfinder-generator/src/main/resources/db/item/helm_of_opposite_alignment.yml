description: "When placed upon the head, this item's curse immediately takes effect\
  \ (Will DC 15 negates). On a failed save, the alignment of the wearer is radically\
  \ altered to an alignment as different as possible from the former alignmentâ€”good\
  \ to evil, chaotic to lawful, neutral to some extreme commitment (LE, LG, CE, or\
  \ CG). Alteration in alignment is mental as well as moral, and the individual changed\
  \ by the magic thoroughly enjoys his new outlook. A character who succeeds on his\
  \ save can continue to wear the helmet without suffering the effect of the curse,\
  \ but if he takes it off and later puts it on again, another save is required.\n\
  Only a wish or a miracle can restore a character's former alignment, and the affected\
  \ individual does not make any attempt to return to the former alignment. In fact,\
  \ he views the prospect with horror and avoids it in any way possible. If a character\
  \ of a class with an alignment requirement is affected, an atonement spell is needed\
  \ as well if the curse is to be obliterated. When a helm of opposite alignment has\
  \ functioned once, it loses its magical properties."
