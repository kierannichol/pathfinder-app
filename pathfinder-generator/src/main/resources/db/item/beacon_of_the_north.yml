description: "The Beacon of the North is a ship's lantern that appears to be an unusually\
  \ large bullseye lantern. Activating any of its powers requires a special lamp oil\
  \ made only by the White Witches of Irrisen. It can hold enough oil to burn for\
  \ 8 hours. When lit, the lantern burns with a cold light, and if the burning oil\
  \ is used as a weapon, it deals cold damage instead of fire damage.\nAs a standard\
  \ action, the wielder can focus the lantern's beam of light on a single living creature\
  \ as a ranged touch attack. Doing so consumes 1 minute's worth of oil and creates\
  \ a small portal from the frozen north to the interior of the target's body. The\
  \ target takes 1d6 points of cold damage and suffers frostbite and hypothermia (treat\
  \ the target as fatigued until all nonlethal damage is healed; see page 442 of the\
  \ Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). Any creature that dies from the cold damage caused\
  \ by the Beacon rises the following midnight as a draugr (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary\
  \ 2 110).\nAlso as a standard action, the beacon's user can focus the lantern's\
  \ light on a depiction of a specific ship, which creates a 5-foot-wide portal connecting\
  \ the depiction to the main mast of the ship itself. Any creature that touches one\
  \ side of the portal instantly appears at the other. These portals appear as shimmering,\
  \ blue-white patches of light; it's impossible to see what is on the other side.\
  \ The portals remain open as long as the lantern is lit, even if it no longer shines\
  \ directly on the depiction.\nFinally, if the Beacon of the North is lit and hung\
  \ on the prow of any ship, a ship-sized portal appears before the ship, allowing\
  \ the ship to sail through it. This portal always leads to Whitethrone harbor in\
  \ Irrisen. This function immediately closes any other portals previously opened\
  \ by the lantern.\nCreating a portal of any size consumes 10 minutes' worth of oil."
