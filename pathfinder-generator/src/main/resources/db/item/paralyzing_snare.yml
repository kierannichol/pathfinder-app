description: "Once the command word is spoken, this 5-foot-diameter loop of wire blends\
  \ with its surroundings. To find it, a character with the trapfinding ability must\
  \ succeed at a DC 30 Perception check. Setting the snare is a full-round action\
  \ that provokes attacks of opportunity. Any creature that steps into the snare must\
  \ succeed at a DC 26 Will save or become magically paralyzed, as the spell hold\
  \ monster. This effect can be ended by uttering the command word, succeeding at\
  \ a DC 30 Disable Device check, or succeeding at the Will save. The snare is destroyed\
  \ when the effect ends."
