description: "This brass oil lamp has an etching of crossed khopeshes on each side\
  \ and is thought to have once held a powerful malik. When the owner of this lamp\
  \ rubs it as a full-round action and concentrates on a nonmagical fire within line\
  \ of sight, he can gaze out of the flame as though he were standing in it. The targeted\
  \ flame can be as small as a candle or as large as a forest fire, though for fires\
  \ larger than 5 feet wide, the user must specify from which square within range\
  \ he sees.\nWhile gazing out from a distant fire, the user can communicate with\
  \ anyone who is near that fire simply by speakingâ€”the user's voice emanates from\
  \ the flame. The user cannot cast spells or make attacks through the flame, nor\
  \ can he perform any actions other than viewing and speaking. If the fire is doused\
  \ while the user is gazing through it, he must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become\
  \ dazed for 1 round.\nA lamp of fiery visions can be used for up to 5 minutes per\
  \ day. This duration need not be consecutive, but it must spent in 1-minute increments."
