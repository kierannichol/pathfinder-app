description: "The heady vapors of this coiled incense facilitate a deep meditative\
  \ trance. When an oracle lights a coil of incense of transcendence and then spends\
  \ 8 hours praying and meditating nearby, she can replace one of her revelations\
  \ with another revelation. The new revelation must be one available to her (such\
  \ as from the same mystery) and must be available at the same class level as the\
  \ original revelation (for example, she cannot replace a revelation available at\
  \ 1st level with a revelation requiring a minimum of 7th level). If she replaces\
  \ a revelation that is a prerequisite for another revelation or ability, she cannot\
  \ use that other revelation or ability while under the influence of the incense.\n\
  The coil of incense burns for 8 hours. Its effects persist for 24 hours, after which\
  \ the oracle's original revelations return."
