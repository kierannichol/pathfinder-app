description: "The face of this +2 heavy steel shield is lined with sheets of riveted\
  \ steel to absorb more impact. A surefooted shield grants its wielder a +2 bonus\
  \ on his CMD versus awesome blow, bull rush, and overrun combat maneuvers and on\
  \ Reflex saves against trample attacks.\nAdditionally, up to three times per day,\
  \ whenever an enemy's melee attack misses the wielder, an enemy fails a combat maneuver\
  \ against the wielder, or the wielder succeeds at a Reflex save against a trample\
  \ attack, the wielder can move 5 feet as an immediate action; this movement does\
  \ not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count as a 5-foot step."
