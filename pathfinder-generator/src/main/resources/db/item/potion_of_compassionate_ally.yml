name: "Potion of Compassionate Ally"
description: "At the sight of an injured ally, the target immediately disengages from\
  \ its current course of action and rushes to provide aid. If the target possesses\
  \ curative spells or magic items, it utilizes them to help the injured ally. If\
  \ not, the target provides aid by performing a Heal check. The target remains with\
  \ the injured ally to assure her safety and refuses to leave the ally's side until\
  \ her wounds are fully treated or the spell ends, but can otherwise defend itself\
  \ and make attacks."
