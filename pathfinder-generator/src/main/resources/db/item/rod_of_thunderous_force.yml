description: "This mahogany rod is etched with the image of whirling storm clouds.\
  \ Once per day on command, the wielder can slam the rod against the ground, releasing\
  \ a concussive wave of sonic and force energy. This creates a 20-foot radius burst\
  \ centered on the wielder. While it causes no damage, those within the burst must\
  \ succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or fall prone and be deafened for 1d4 rounds.\
  \ The wielder is unaffected by this blast. This effect is a force and sonic effect."
