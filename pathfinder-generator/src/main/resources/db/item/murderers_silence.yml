description: "In areas where divine magic is readily available, speak with dead has\
  \ captured many a murderer; this serum was invented by assassins to silence their\
  \ victims. Murderer's silence prevents a corpse from communicating via speak with\
  \ dead by dissolving the victim's vocal organs. To use this item, the thick black\
  \ liquid must be slowly poured down the throat of the corpse (a full-round action\
  \ that provokes attacks of opportunity). The following round, the corpse's tongue,\
  \ vocal cords, and lips deteriorate and the corpse becomes incapable of responding\
  \ to speak with dead. Other means of interrogating the spirit of the departed still\
  \ function normally. Magic that restores the flesh to a corpse doesn't restore any\
  \ parts rotted away by murderer's silence. This item has no effect on parts of the\
  \ body other than those listed. The listed is for a single dose."
