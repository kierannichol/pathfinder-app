description: "Aside from its superb craftsmanship, this +4 leather armor has little\
  \ to distinguish it from any other armor. Once per week, while a living creature\
  \ wears a suit of diviner's blight armor, the wearer can recite a command word and\
  \ spend 1 minute in concentration to have the armor imitate a creature with which\
  \ the wearer is familiar. The imitated creature must be within one size category\
  \ of the wearer. Imitating a creature has no visible effect on the armor or the\
  \ wearer, but instead confounds magical divinations.\nSpells such as scrying meant\
  \ to observe the imitated creature instead observe the wearer, who appears to the\
  \ scryer as the imitated creature; the imitated creature still attempts any necessary\
  \ saving throw or applies its spell resistance, but if the spell succeeds, diviner's\
  \ blight redirects any scrying sensor to its wearer. Magical means of detecting\
  \ a creature's location always consider the location of the wearer as the actual\
  \ location of the imitated creature, and only 8th-level or higher spells like discern\
  \ location or greater prying eyes can overcome this effect. Spells such as detect\
  \ lies or zone of truth react as though the wearer were the imitated target and\
  \ not himself, but only for the purpose of stating his identity. Diviner's blight\
  \ would not, for instance, affect a question about the wearer's mother's name.\n\
  The imitation remains in place until the wearer chooses a different creature to\
  \ imitate or spends 1 minute in concentration to end it. The armor resumes its normal\
  \ form when removed, but the target of its imitative effect remains setâ€”when a character\
  \ dons the armor (whether the character who dons the armor is the last wearer or\
  \ a different person), the armor immediately begins imitating the creature it's\
  \ set to imitate again."
