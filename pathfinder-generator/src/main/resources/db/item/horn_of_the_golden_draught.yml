description: "As a standard action, this gold-plated drinking horn can produce a golden\
  \ draught. A creature that imbibes or is anointed with this liquid is freed from\
  \ enchantments, transmutations, and curses as if subjected to a break enchantment\
  \ spell. If the user suffers from no such conditions, her skin instead takes on\
  \ a golden hue and becomes almost impervious to blows, as per stoneskin. A horn\
  \ of the golden draught can produce up to five draughts of each version of the draught\
  \ before it turns to brass and becomes nonmagical."
