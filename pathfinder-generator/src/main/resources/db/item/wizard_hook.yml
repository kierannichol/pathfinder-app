description: "A wizard hook is a +1 hook hand (Pirates of the Inner Sea 19) and a\
  \ useful item for any arcane spellcaster. Although a wizard hook does not allow\
  \ for fine manipulation, it is infused with magic that bolsters somatic componentsâ€”\
  you can use a hand stump outfitted with a wizard hook to fulfill any somatic components\
  \ for casting arcane spells. A wizard hook also grants proficiency in its use as\
  \ a weapon. You can make touch attacks with spells using a wizard hook, either by\
  \ making a normal attack with the hook (in which case it deals normal hook hand\
  \ damage plus the spell effect), or by making a touch attack with the hook (in which\
  \ case you gain a +4 bonus on the attack roll and the save DC of the spell increases\
  \ by +1, but you do not do hook hand damage)."
