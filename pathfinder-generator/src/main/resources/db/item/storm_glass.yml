description: "Heavy gray mist fills the interior of a storm glass, a receptacle lined\
  \ with thin metal strips and equipped with metal tuning forks jutting from inside\
  \ the top and bottom of the glass. The forks are attuned to the Material Plane and\
  \ can detect planar anomalies or intrusions, specifically the presence of outsiders.\
  \ The mist within a storm glass changes coloration after 1 minute of being within\
  \ 60 feet of a nonnative outsider (including creatures possessed by non-native outsiders),\
  \ and grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks to identify such\
  \ creatures. The color change lasts as long as the jar remains within range of an\
  \ outsider and for 1d4+1 rounds after leaving the area. Removing the storm glass\
  \ from the Material Plane (including placing it in extraplanar containers such as\
  \ a portable hole) causes the gas to permanently revert to a colorless, inert vapor."
