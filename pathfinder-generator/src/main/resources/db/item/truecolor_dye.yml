description: "Horticulturists harvest this magical dye from the pulp of rare plants\
  \ found only in the lushest regions of Tian Xia. Bisby first encountered this dye\
  \ while visiting the royal courts of the Miracle Samurai during his early adventures\
  \ as a Pathfinder. He made a point of returning with several bottles, and the decision\
  \ served him well over the next several decades.\nTruecolor dye produces vibrant\
  \ colors, yet the actual color that registers varies according to the personality\
  \ and temperment of the viewer—the viewer's good, neutral, or evil alignment component\
  \ determines the color he sees. Good viewers see a pleasing gold, while evil viewers\
  \ see a rich blood red. A neutral viewer sees the dye as its actual color, a dull\
  \ orange. Centuries ago, truecolor dye was used in the miracle courts of Tian Xia\
  \ as a way to trick emissaries into revealing their alignments, but its secret has\
  \ long since been disseminated on the eastern continent and lost its hidden value.\
  \ A DC 25 Knowledge (geography or nature) check reveals the dye's nature.\nA single\
  \ vial of truecolor dye is enough to coat a square foot of material, or to ink 5\
  \ pages of text. Once applied, truecolor dye is permanent, although it can be washed\
  \ off with universal solvent."
