description: "On a successful critical hit, this +5 unholy kukri deals 2 points of\
  \ bleed damage, which stack with any bleed damage already caused by the attack.\
  \ Each time the wielder strikes a blow that deals bleed damage with this weapon,\
  \ she gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the amount of bleed damage\
  \ dealt. No temporary hit points are gained if the target was already bleeding,\
  \ even for a lesser amount. Temporary hit points bestowed by Balgorrah last for\
  \ 1 minute.\nBalgorrah can cast bleed at will (and does so automatically if there\
  \ are any dying creatures within 30 feet), can cast death knell three times per\
  \ day, and can cast fear once per day. The kukri's special purpose is to defend\
  \ servants of Norgorber, and when wielded by a devout worshiper of Norgorber, it\
  \ grants a +2 luck bonus on attacks, saves, and checks."
destruction: "Balgorrah must be used to slay a 15th- or higher-level cleric of Norgorber,\
  \ at which point it reverts to its dormant version (see page 36 of Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path #98: Turn of the Torrent) and can be destroyed normally by taking damage."
