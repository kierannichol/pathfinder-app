description: "These aged charts of thick, yellowed parchment display rough representations\
  \ of the Shackles' major islands and the sea lanes between them. The detailed markings\
  \ on these charts grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Profession (sailor) or Survival\
  \ checks to navigate within the Shackles.\nIn addition, a multitude of wrinkles,\
  \ stains, and blemishes mar the charts' surfaces. Anyone meticulously studying the\
  \ charts notices that these markings shift over time. The creases, smudges, and\
  \ blotches on the map represent real weather conditions (such as clouds, rain, and\
  \ wind) in the region, allowing an informed observer to determine the current weather\
  \ patterns over the islands of the Shackles. The charts grant a +4 competence bonus\
  \ on Survival checks made to predict future weather conditions and a +2 competence\
  \ bonus on Survival checks to gain a bonus on Fortitude saves against severe weather.\n\
  Finally, the pilot of a wind-propelled ship can make a DC 20 Profession (sailor)\
  \ check to plot a course within the Shackles using the charts. If the check is successful,\
  \ the charts grant the ship a +10% enhancement bonus to its waterborne speed as\
  \ long as it follows the plotted course.\nAll of the charts' benefits only apply\
  \ within the geographic region of the Shackles. GMs with access to the Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting: Skull & Shackles Map Folio might use the elaborate player map\
  \ of the Shackles included therein to represent this item."
