description: "Platinum filigree wraps around this small, spiral-shell amulet, which\
  \ hangs on an ornate chain that resembles entwined tentacles. Enchantment spells\
  \ and effects created by the wearer of a masters' call are treated as though they\
  \ came from an aboleth source, so gillman targets take their racial –2 penalty on\
  \ Will saves to resist the amulet's effects.\nOnce per day, the wearer can speak\
  \ a trigger phrase in the Aboleth language to cast dominate person on a single target\
  \ (Will DC 18 negates). Regardless of whether the dominate person spell succeeds,\
  \ the wearer can then attempt to cast modify memory on the same target to change\
  \ its memory of either the actions the target performed while dominated or the attempted\
  \ domination (Will DC 17 negates)."
