description: "The surface of this delicate-looking blue silk robe is adorned with\
  \ tiny embossed runes across its entire surface. If the wearer is a spontaneous\
  \ caster, once per day she may use a spell slot to cast a spell from a written source\
  \ (such as a scroll or spellbook) as if she knew that spell. The spell must be on\
  \ her spell list, the same spell level or lower than the expended spell slot, and\
  \ the same type of spell (arcane or divine) as the spell slot expended. The caster\
  \ must also understand the written source (such as using Decipher Script or read\
  \ magic) and be carrying it. Activating the robe is not an action, but casting the\
  \ spell otherwise works as normal, including casting time, providing components\
  \ or foci, and so on. Using a mnemonic vestment's properties does not consume the\
  \ written source. A mnemonic vestment must be worn for 24 consecutive hours before\
  \ using its effects."
