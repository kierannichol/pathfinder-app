description: "When activated, this small masterwork metal gong remains charged with\
  \ power for 8 hours. When the gong is struck softly, it emits a clear and pleasing\
  \ tone that instantly focuses the striker's thoughts and mental energy. If the creature\
  \ striking the gong has a ki pool and worships Irori, she regains 1 ki point. This\
  \ use expends the power within the gong."
