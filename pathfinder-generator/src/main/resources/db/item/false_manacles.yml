description: "These manacles are nearly indistinguishable from standard manacles upon\
  \ inspection (Perception DC 25). A wearer who knows the location of the secret catch\
  \ can open them as a standard action; otherwise they act like masterwork manacles.\
  \ Some appear to be of common quality, though false manacles are always masterwork."
