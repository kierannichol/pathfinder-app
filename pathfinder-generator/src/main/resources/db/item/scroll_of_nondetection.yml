name: "Scroll of Nondetection"
description: "The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination\
  \ spells such as clairaudience/clairvoyance, locate object, and detect spells. Nondetection\
  \ also prevents location by such magic items as crystal balls. If a divination is\
  \ attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must\
  \ succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the\
  \ caster level of the spellcaster who cast nondetection. If you cast nondetection\
  \ on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster\
  \ level."
