description: "This forearm-length rod of onyx gemstone is capped by a sphere of amber.\
  \ Once per day when the bearer of a fossilizing rod casts animate dead to animate\
  \ skeletons, she can imbue the skeletons with fossilizing earth energy. Fossilized\
  \ skeletons gain the earth subtype, reduce their Dexterity scores by 4 and their\
  \ speeds by 10 feet, and cannot fly even if they could do so magically in life.\
  \ However, due to the stone infusing their bones, fossilized skeletons gain hardness\
  \ 8."
