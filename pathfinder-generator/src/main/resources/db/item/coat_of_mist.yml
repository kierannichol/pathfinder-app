description: "This gossamer jacket of gray-and-white silk allows the wearer to blend\
  \ into mist and become almost invisible. She gains a +5 bonus on Stealth checks\
  \ in areas of fog, mist, smoke, or even heavy spray (such as from a waterfall or\
  \ crashing surf). As a standard action, the wearer can gain total concealment in\
  \ such conditions, regardless of the distance between her and observers. Attacking\
  \ does not end this total concealment, though the wearer must remain within or adjacent\
  \ to the misty area to retain total concealment. The wearer can use the total concealment\
  \ ability for a total of 5 rounds per day; these rounds need not be continuous.\n\
  Once per day, the wearer of a coat of mist can turn into mist, as per gaseous form,\
  \ for up to 5 rounds."
