description: "These tattered and mismatched pages from the Book of the Damned deal\
  \ with other types of fiendish beings beyond daemons, demons, and devils. Unlike\
  \ the major chapters of the Book of the Damned, the apocrypha are not bound within\
  \ a single set of covers—some pages are crudely bound into small folios, held together\
  \ by lengths of chain or jagged barbs, or impaled on metal spikes, while others\
  \ are simply loose leaves. Many pages are duplicates or filled with irrelevant writing\
  \ on other topics, as if originally used for drafting, while the relevant content\
  \ appears as marginalia. Despite their disorganized state, the pages never scatter\
  \ or become lost; all of the various portions mysteriously remain together.\nA good-aligned\
  \ creature that touches this section of the Book of the Damned gains 1 negative\
  \ level. This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than\
  \ 10 feet away from this section of the book for 24 hours. A nonevil creature attempting\
  \ to read this section of the book must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have her\
  \ alignment permanently move one step toward evil.\nThese pages of the Book of the\
  \ Damned are written in a mix of Abyssal, Celestial, and Infernal; knowledge of\
  \ all three is necessary to understand their contents. A reader who spends at least\
  \ 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) reading the apocrypha gains certain benefits.\
  \ Where specified, these benefits apply to a single evil outsider subtype (other\
  \ than daemon, demon, or devil). For every additional 10 days spent studying the\
  \ apocrypha, the reader can gain these benefits with an additional subtype.\nWhen\
  \ using this portion of the Book of the Damned as a reference (by consulting it\
  \ for at least an hour), the user gains a +4 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks\
  \ regarding one evil outsider subtype. The apocrypha contain copies of every spell\
  \ with the evil descriptor, as well as sacrifice (see page 185). When the reader\
  \ casts planar ally or planar binding (including the lesser and greater versions)\
  \ to bind a creature of her chosen subtype, the HD limit for the conjured outsider\
  \ increases by 2.\nThe Book of the Damned apocrypha serve as the focal point for\
  \ an unhallow spell. Three times per day, the reader can cast one of the following\
  \ spells: blasphemy, greater planar binding (but only against evil outsiders of\
  \ the type chosen when studying the apocrypha), or unholy blight. Whenever the bearer\
  \ uses one of the apocrypha's daily spells, there is a 1% chance that a creature\
  \ of her chosen subtype notices; if the spell chosen is associated with a creature\
  \ of that subtype, the chance doubles, and the creature that notices is one that\
  \ could use that spell-like ability. Such creatures usually seek to embroil the\
  \ user in their schemes to further their fiendish agendas."
destruction: "The Book of the Damned apocrypha can be destroyed only by immersing\
  \ the pages in 10 gallons of holy water while in the presence of at least one creature\
  \ of each subtype of evil outsider described within. Unless the other three portions\
  \ of the Book of the Damned are also destroyed within 24 hours, this portion reappears\
  \ unharmed at some random, obscure point in the multiverse."
