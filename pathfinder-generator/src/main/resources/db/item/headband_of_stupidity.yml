  \ of granting a +4 bonus to Intelligence and bonuses to associated skills, the wearer\
  \ take a –4 penalty to Intelligence and a further –2 penalty on all Knowledge checks.\
  \ The wearer is not aware of the debilitating effects of the headband; even the\
  \ stupidest statement or misguided insight seems intelligent to him while he is\
  \ wearing it."
