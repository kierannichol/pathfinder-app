description: "Maybe it's the wide heads, but more likely it's the lack of common sense\
  \ that causes goblins to so often get stuck in narrow spaces. In such cases, a dose\
  \ of pig grease is really helpful. An application of pig grease applied to the body\
  \ grants a +2 circumstance bonus on all Escape Artist checks for 1 hour."
