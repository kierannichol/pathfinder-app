description: "When placed over the head, this halo of shimmering polished steel floats\
  \ above it, though it still takes up the head slot. The halo constantly radiates\
  \ a 20-foot-radius aura from its wearer. Any hostile creature within the aura must\
  \ succeed at a DC 20 Will save or take a –2 penalty on attack rolls, on saving throws,\
  \ and to AC for the next 24 hours or until it hits the wearer with an attack or\
  \ damages it with a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability. Chaotic\
  \ creatures take a –2 penalty on this saving throw. A creature that has resisted\
  \ or broken the effect of the halo of menace cannot be affected by the same wearer's\
  \ aura for 24 hours. The aura is a mind-affecting effect."
