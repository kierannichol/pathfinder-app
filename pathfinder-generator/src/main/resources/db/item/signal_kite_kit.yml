description: "Though wingless, tengus have long cast their thoughts toward the sky\
  \ and flight. Built from paper glued to bamboo frames, their kites are painted with\
  \ various colors and pictures. In addition to flying kites as a leisure activity,\
  \ tengus also fly kites of various shades and patterns to send signal messages.\
  \ Tengus have developed an extensive code of signals and can use their kites to\
  \ display complex messages visible at great distances. A signal kite kit includes\
  \ six small colored kites that can be hooked together in different patterns to facilitate\
  \ complex messages. The kit also includes a spool and 300 feet of twine. Sending\
  \ or interpreting a signal kite's message functions as described in the Bluff skill,\
  \ but the sender and anyone trying to understand the message must also know Tengu."
