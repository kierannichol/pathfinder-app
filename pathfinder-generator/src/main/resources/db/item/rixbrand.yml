description: "Arnlaugr's legendary blade, Rixbrand, is a double-sided blade of folded\
  \ blue steel, intricately engraved with ancient runes that light up with electric\
  \ flame in the presence of dragonkind. The hilt is inlaid with ebony and wrapped\
  \ with silver wire; the pommel features two silvered dragon heads.\nRixbrand is\
  \ a +3 wounding dragon-bane greatsword. When the blade scores a critical hit on\
  \ a dragon, the dragon heads on its pommel spit boiling acid into the wound hewn\
  \ by the blade. This deals an additional 1d10 points of acid damage and 1d10 points\
  \ of fire damage to the dragon. Rixbrand's wielder gains a +4 resistance bonus on\
  \ all saving throws against breath weapons, spelllike abilities, and spells from\
  \ dragons.\nSince Arnlaugr's death, several duplicates of the legendary sword have\
  \ been created. These blades have been wielded by mercenaries and adventurers alike,\
  \ although they tend to end up in dragon hoards when their would-be dragonslayer\
  \ wielders tackle something beyond their ability to endure even with the blade in\
  \ handâ€” the same fate that befell the original sword in Arnlaugr's hands."
