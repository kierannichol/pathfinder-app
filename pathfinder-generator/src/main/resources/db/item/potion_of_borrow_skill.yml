name: "Potion of Borrow Skill"
description: "You borrow one of the target's known skills. After touching the subject,\
  \ you can make a single check with the chosen skill using the subject's skill ranks,\
  \ but modified by your own key ability. If you take longer than the spell's duration\
  \ to make the check or the check requires more time, then it fails and you must\
  \ use your own skill ranks (if any). If the borrowed skill is a class skill for\
  \ you, you gain the +3 bonus on checks using that skill."
