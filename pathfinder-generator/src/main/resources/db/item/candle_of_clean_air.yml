description: "This clean-smelling white candle is inscribed with glyphs portraying\
  \ various sweet smelling flowers. When lit, the candle repels smoke, mist, cloud,\
  \ and other gas effects in a 5-foot radius. These effects do not penetrate the area\
  \ around the candle if they are of spell level 3 or lower. Against more powerful\
  \ cloud effects (including effects not based on spells, such as dragon breath or\
  \ a gorgon's breath weapon), the candle grants creatures in the area a +4 resistance\
  \ bonus on saving throws against these effects. Creatures in the area gain a +4\
  \ deflection bonus to AC against attacks from creatures with the air subtype.\n\
  The candle burns for up to 5 minutes, in increments of 1 minute. Once all 5 minutes\
  \ are used, the candle is destroyed."
