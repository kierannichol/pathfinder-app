description: "This heavy arm of stone appears to have been broken off a statue of\
  \ a well-muscled female warrior at the shoulder. The arm's wrist serves as a handle,\
  \ and its fist, clutched around a punching dagger, serves as a pommel. The arm thickens\
  \ with well-defined musculature all the way to the shoulder. Detailed carvings of\
  \ tattoos on the stony arm identify the statue as a representation—or perhaps the\
  \ petrified remains—of a pirate serving under the legendary pirate queen Captain\
  \ Mastrien Slash.\nThe pirate's arm functions as a +1 seaborne greatclub. Although\
  \ it is typically immobile, when the wielder is restrained or grappled, the arm\
  \ flexes to grant her a +4 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and checks\
  \ to escape a grapple."
