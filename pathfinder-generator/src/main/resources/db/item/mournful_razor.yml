description: "A mournful razor is a +3 vorpal war razor capable of inflicting particularly\
  \ distressing and demoralizing wounds. The weapon resizes automatically to fit the\
  \ hand of its wielder, from Tiny to Huge. Regardless of the weapon's size, it always\
  \ functions as a light weapon. Each time a mournful razor damages a foe, the blade\
  \ absorbs a tiny fraction of that foe's despair and sadness. Whenever a creature\
  \ takes sneak attack damage from a mournful razor, the creature so damaged must\
  \ succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be infused with these thoughts of despair and\
  \ self-loathing. The target so affected by the weapon has a 50% chance to act normally\
  \ each turn; otherwise, it takes no action. This curse persists as long as the target\
  \ remains wounded from any source (it ends immediately once the victim is completely\
  \ healed of all damage)."
