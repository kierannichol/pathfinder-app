description: "The favored blade of the Storm King, Noriznigath is named for the first\
  \ nascent demon lord it was used to behead, and is a Large +6 unholy longsword —\
  as with all slashing weapons, Noriznigath becomes a vorpal weapon in the hands of\
  \ a balor. The body of a creature decapitated by Noriznigath is disintegrated if\
  \ the decapitation results in death, and heals the wielder of 100 points of damage."
destruction: "Noriznigath melts into blood and mist if its namesake, the long-dead\
  \ nascent demon lord Noriznigath, is restored to life."
