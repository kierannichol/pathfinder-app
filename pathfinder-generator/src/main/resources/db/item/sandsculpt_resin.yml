description: "This sticky, amber-colored resin comes sandwiched between two sheets\
  \ of vellum. When you coat your hands with the resin, you gain the ability to sculpt\
  \ sand as per the stone shape spell, but you cannot create items with moving parts\
  \ and must sculpt the shape by hand. One use of resin allows you to shape up to\
  \ 15 cubic feet of sand, requiring 1 minute per cubic foot sculpted. Sand shapes\
  \ that cannot support themselves naturally (such as arches or overhangs) collapse\
  \ after 1 hour, but stable shapes like thick walls or mounds persist indefinitely,\
  \ barring vandalism or erosion. Once applied to your hands, the resin's power lasts\
  \ until you have sculpted 15 cubic feet of sand or 1 hour has passed."
