description: "Favored by doctors and torturers alike—especially the paincrafters of\
  \ Nidal—these jet-black spectacles fully obscure the eyes of the wearer while granting\
  \ her the ability to peer at the auras of other creatures. The wearer can read the\
  \ emotion and health auras of any creature as per analyze aura while the spectacles\
  \ are worn, but can perceive only those auras."
