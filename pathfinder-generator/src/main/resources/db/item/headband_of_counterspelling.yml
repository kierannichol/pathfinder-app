description: "This metal headband grants a +5 insight bonus on Spellcraft checks made\
  \ to identify a spell as it is being cast. Furthermore, once per day the wearer\
  \ can attempt to counter a spell by casting the appropriate spell as an immediate\
  \ action instead of doing so with a readied action. The wearer must first identify\
  \ the spell being cast before countering a spell with this headband."
