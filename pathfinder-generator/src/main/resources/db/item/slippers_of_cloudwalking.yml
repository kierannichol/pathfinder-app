description: "The wearer of these slippers may walk on air (as the spell air walk)\
  \ for up to 10 minutes per day, which may be used in 1-minute increments and requires\
  \ no action to activate. However, she may only walk on air within or on top of natural\
  \ or magical mist or fog, including fog-like gases such as those created by acid\
  \ fog, cloudkill, incendiary cloud, or stinking cloud. Walking on top of such clouds\
  \ carries no danger for the wearer, but walking through the cloud has its normal\
  \ effect."
