description: "The imperial intelligence agency, the Hatharat, entrusts rings of return\
  \ to agents within Taldor and other hostile regions. When a transport command word\
  \ is spoken (a standard action), a ring of return whisks the wearer to the nearest\
  \ imperial administration building within Kelesh's borders, as if via greater teleport.\
  \ If anyone attempts to remove a ring of return from the wearer's finger without\
  \ speaking a removal command word (a standard action that provokes an attack of\
  \ opportunity), the attempt triggers the effect, transporting both the wearer and\
  \ the person attempting to remove the ring. A successful DC 20 Will save allows\
  \ a character to resist the teleportation, but in any event, a ring of return can\
  \ be used only once; after its single charge is expended, it becomes an ordinary,\
  \ nonmagical ring."
