description: "Two times per day on command, the wearer of this ring can produce a\
  \ horrific smell affecting all living creatures other than the wearer within a 10-foot\
  \ radius. Once created, the smell remains, centered on the wearer, until she dismisses\
  \ it as a free action. This is a poison effect.\nAny creature affected by the disgusting\
  \ aroma produced by the ring must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw when\
  \ it starts its turn in the ring's stench radius. Those that fail a saving throw\
  \ become sickened for 1 round. If they are already sickened, they become nauseated\
  \ for 1 round instead."
