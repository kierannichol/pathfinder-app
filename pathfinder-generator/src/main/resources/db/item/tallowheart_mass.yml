description: "This disgusting mass of hardened beef tallow is always found divided\
  \ into three parts, each with a different function. If you rub the first piece on\
  \ a weapon it acts as a potion of haste. If you eat the second piece it acts as\
  \ a potion of cure serious wounds. If you eat the third piece it acts as a potion\
  \ of protection from fire, absorbing 60 points of damage before losing its effectiveness,\
  \ but any round you take fire damage causes you to cough sticky black smoke like\
  \ a pan of grease on fire (harmless to you or others but disturbing to see or experience).\
  \ You can separate the three pieces of the mass without harming its properties.\
  \ Each piece can only be used once."
