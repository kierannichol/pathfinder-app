description: "If this belt's wearer has at least one hand free (holding nothing),\
  \ he can attempt to deflect a successful melee attack with an immediate action.\
  \ To do so, he rolls an unarmed strike against the opponent, including any applicable\
  \ modifiers such as a favored enemy bonus or the penalty for Power Attack. If his\
  \ attack roll is greater than the opponent's attack roll, the attack is negated\
  \ without effect. The unarmed strike itself causes no damage and does not count\
  \ as a successful attack against the opponent. The opponent does not need to be\
  \ within the wearer's reach to use this ability. Whether the attack succeeds or\
  \ not, the wearer takes a â€“4 penalty on attack rolls until the end of his next turn."
