name: "Scroll of Sirocco"
description: "A blast of furnace-hot wind blasts downward, inflicting 4d6 fire damage\
  \ +1 point per caster level to all creatures in the area and knocking them prone.\
  \ A successful Fortitude save halves the fire damage and negates being knocked prone.\
  \ Flying creatures forced into the ground by the powerful downdraft take damage\
  \ as if they fell unless they make a DC 15 Fly check, in which case they remain\
  \ at their original altitude. Any creature that takes damage from a sirocco becomes\
  \ fatigued (or exhausted, if already fatigued, such as from a previous round of\
  \ exposure to a siroccospell). Creatures with the water subtype take a â€“4 penalty\
  \ on all saving throws against this spell and take double normal damage."
