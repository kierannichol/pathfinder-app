name: "Oil of Web"
description: "Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands\
  \ trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spiderwebs but far larger\
  \ and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically\
  \ opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures\
  \ caught within a web become grappled by the sticky fibers. Attacking a creature\
  \ in a web doesn't cause you to become grappled."
