description: "This ornate ring of protection +2 is emblazoned with the winged Eye\
  \ of Aroden in ruby and jet. The wearer of a duxotar's signet projects an air of\
  \ commanding authority that affects large groups; the wearer does not treat crowds\
  \ as difficult terrain and gains a +5 competence bonus on Diplomacy or Intimidate\
  \ checks to direct or influence crowds (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 436–437). The\
  \ wearer can also cast magic mouth at will, but the message trigger must be \"upon\
  \ seeing a creature wearing the Eye of Aroden\" (which triggers the magic mouth\
  \ for any dottari in uniform)."
