description: "This suit of +3 studded leather armor is decorated with metal skulls.\
  \ Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can command the skulls to unleash\
  \ a cacophonous chorus of howls, causing all creatures within a 30-foot spread to\
  \ make a DC 16 Will save to avoid becoming frightened for 1d4 rounds. The wearer\
  \ can choose up to three targets (plus himself) in the area of effect to be exempt\
  \ from the effect. The wearer of a suit of howling skull armor gains a +4 bonus\
  \ on all saving throws against fear effects. Each time the wearer of howling skull\
  \ armor succeeds at a saving throw against a fear effect created by someone other\
  \ than himself, he gains a +2 bonus on Will saves for 1 round."
