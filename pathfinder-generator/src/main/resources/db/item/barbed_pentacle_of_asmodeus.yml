description: "This iron disk hangs from an iron chain, and is inscribed with an inverted\
  \ pentagram and decorated around its outer edge with tiny metal barbs. When worn,\
  \ it provides a +1 deflection bonus to AC.\nIf Asmodeus is the wearer's patron,\
  \ the pentacle counts as an unholy symbol. By holding it and speaking a command\
  \ word, the wearer can use charm person once per day. If the wearer squeezes the\
  \ pentacle so its barbs draw her blood (dealing 1 point of damage), the wearer can\
  \ use that blood as ink, writing with a quill or even a finger for up to 1 hour.\
  \ The blood-ink dries instantly on writing surfaces so it never smudges, and if\
  \ it's used as part of a magical spell the wearer casts that requires or is augmented\
  \ by writing (such as magic circle against evil or sepia snake sigil), the DC of\
  \ that spell increases by 1."
