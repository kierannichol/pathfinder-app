description: "Two separate compartments make up this black glass canister the size\
  \ of a helmet. The large lower compartment contains hundreds of jagged shards of\
  \ obsidian. The upper airtight chamber contains a sticky resin that hardens immediately\
  \ upon contact with air. When you strike the canister with a bludgeoning melee weapon\
  \ as a standard action, both compartments shatter, causing the obsidian shards to\
  \ adhere to the weapon. The weapon deals piercing damage rather than bludgeoning\
  \ damage for 10 minutes, at which point the resin dries and the shards fall off,\
  \ or until you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll, which causes the shards to break\
  \ off prematurely. If the weapon is made of a special material, the special properties\
  \ of its material are suppressed while the obsidian shards adhere to the weapon.\n\
  If you use a rockshard canister to coat an unarmed strike or natural weapon, you\
  \ take 2d6 points of piercing damage when shattering the canister to apply the shards.\
  \ For unarmed attacks, this can be avoided by carefully applying thick leather or\
  \ rope straps to your hands and feet, which requires 5 minutes of work, prior to\
  \ smashing the canister."
