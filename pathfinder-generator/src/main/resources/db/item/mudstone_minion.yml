description: "When you take a full-round action to mold this perpetually moist lump\
  \ of clay into an animal, it flashes to life and grows to full size, attacking your\
  \ enemies or following your commands if you have the means to communicate with animals.\
  \ After 9 rounds the animal reverts to nonmagical clay. You may use the clay to\
  \ create any sort of creature that summon nature's ally I, II, III, IV, or V can\
  \ summon. There is enough clay to create up to five spell levels of creatures. For\
  \ example, you could expend 3 spell levels of clay to create a lion (from the summon\
  \ nature's ally III list) and still have 2 spell levels left over. Each use of the\
  \ clay produces only one creature."
