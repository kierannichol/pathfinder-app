description: "An ember glow lights the beady eyes of this blackened, burned out goblin's\
  \ skull. It is very brittle and shatters if dropped on solid ground. When a goblin\
  \ skull bomb breaks, the very last creature to touch it bursts into a raging magical\
  \ flame, automatically suffering 5d6 points of fire damage and also catching fire\
  \ should it fail a Reflex save (DC 13). If this kills the creature, its body burns\
  \ away in one round, leaving behind only a pile of ash and the creature's blackened,\
  \ burned-out skull, which is a new goblin skull bomb. If the target survives the\
  \ fire, doesn't have a skull, or if its skull is destroyed before another creature\
  \ touches it, it does not create a new goblin skull bomb.\nA skull bomb can be used\
  \ as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. If the attacker hits, the\
  \ skull shatters, immolating the target as described above. If the attacker misses,\
  \ the skull breaks upon the floor or another nearby hard surface and the attacker\
  \ bursts into flame. Touching the skull using gloves, gauntlets, or handheld items\
  \ such as tools or weapons counts as touching the skull. It can be safely moved\
  \ using spells (such as mage hand or telekinesis) or attacked with ranged weapons\
  \ (hardness 0, 1 hp)."
