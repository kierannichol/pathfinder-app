description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis leather cloak looks tattered and stained\
  \ no matter how carefully it is cleaned and repaired. Once per day, when a ratfolk\
  \ wearer bleeds upon the cloak (generally when he takes hit point damage), the cloak\
  \ mentally alerts the wearer's nearest ratfolk ally within 10 miles, telling her\
  \ the approximate distance and direction to the wearer. It also alerts the wearer\
  \ to the approximate distance and direction of that ally."
