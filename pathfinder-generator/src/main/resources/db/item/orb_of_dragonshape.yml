description: "Once per day, the bearer of one of these scintillating, 1-foot-diameter\
  \ orbs can transform into a Huge dragon of a specific variety. This effect is similar\
  \ to that created by form of the dragon III, but the bearer also gains spell resistance\
  \ 21 and the following abilities linked the orb's dragon type, usable three times\
  \ during the transformation. The transformation lasts for 10 minutes and cannot\
  \ be ended prematurely."
destruction: "To destroy an Orb of Dragonshape that transforms the user into a good-aligned\
  \ dragon, an evil dragon must use the orb to transform and sacrifice itself to save\
  \ another. To destroy an orb tied to evil dragons, a good dragon must use it to\
  \ transform and go on a rampage resulting in the death of more than 100 innocents."
