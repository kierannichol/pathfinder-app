description: "An eye patch covers one eye and ties around the head. Pirates usually\
  \ wear eye patches to cover injured or blind eyes, but some wear eye patches to\
  \ look more intimidating, or to keep one eye covered and thus retain their night\
  \ vision when transitioning from the relative darkness belowdecks to the sunlight\
  \ above."
