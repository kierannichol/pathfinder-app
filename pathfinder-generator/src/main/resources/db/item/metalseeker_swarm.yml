description: "In its inert state, a metalseeker swarm is a heavy, 2-inch-square cube\
  \ of textured Numerian steel. Once per day on command, the cube disintegrates into\
  \ a cloud of countless Fine flying constructs that resemble mechanical fireflies.\
  \ These fireflies cluster and flutter about in a 60-foot-radius spread around the\
  \ user, homing in on Tiny or larger masses of metal and illuminating them as though\
  \ the objects emitted candlelight. The fireflies continue to highlight metal objects\
  \ for 5 minutes before swarming back into cube-form in the user's hand.\nCreatures\
  \ in the area wearing metal armor are illuminated as if by faerie fire. Creatures\
  \ in the area wielding metal weapons are dazzled as long as they are within range\
  \ of the mechanical fireflies and continue to wield the weapons.\nThe mechanical\
  \ fireflies glow different colors depending on the type of metal they touch, though\
  \ the item bears no indication of which colors correspond to what metals, so the\
  \ user must figure out the fireflies' code to glean any useful information from\
  \ it."
