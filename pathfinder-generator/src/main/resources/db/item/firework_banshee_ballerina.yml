description: "This small firework burns brightly and makes a loud, eerie whistling\
  \ sound. It can be thrown to target an intersection as a splash weapon. Any creatures\
  \ within 5 feet of the noise are effectively deafened while they remain in the area,\
  \ as even the loudest sounds they make are drowned out by the piercing sound. A\
  \ banshee ballerina firework burns for 1d4+1 rounds before extinguishing itself\
  \ with a quiet puff of smoke. Crafting this item is a DC 30 Craft (alchemy) check."
