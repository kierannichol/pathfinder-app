description: "This weapon consists of a foot-long double-edged blade, with another\
  \ smaller, curved hook-blade sticking out the side like a rooster's spur. The blade\
  \ is strung to a large iron hoop with a 10-foot length of rope. The blade can be\
  \ used as an off-handed melee weapon or thrown like a dagger, while the rope and\
  \ circlet can be whipped around and swung at opponents as a bludgeoning reach weapon."
