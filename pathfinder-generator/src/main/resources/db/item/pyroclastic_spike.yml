description: "This 3-foot-long, magically reinforced obsidian rod is capped with a\
  \ globe of volcanic glass at one end, and a gleaming spike at the other. Veins of\
  \ molten earth glow faintly beneath the rod's surface, flowing from a swirling fiery\
  \ mass at the orb's core.\nOnce per day, the spiked end can be driven into sand,\
  \ mud, or loose earth as a move action, into dense soil or loose gravel as a standard\
  \ action, or into stone or metal as a full-round action. Once anchored, the earth\
  \ in a path that is 5 feet wide and 30 feet long cracks and erupts with superheated\
  \ gases in the direction of the wielder's choosing, originating in a square adjacent\
  \ to the pyroclastic spike. Creatures standing in the path take 2d6 points of fire\
  \ damage (Reflex DC 16 half) from the flaming jets of sulfuric gases as the ground\
  \ beneath them begins to liquefy.\nOne round after anchoring the rod, liquid fire\
  \ begins to pour from the pyroclastic spike along the affected area, creating a\
  \ molten river 2 feet deep. The pyroclastic flow deals 10d6 points of fire damage\
  \ to any barriers it encounters until it is able to flow freely forward to the full\
  \ range of effect. Creatures in the area of effect automatically take 2d6 points\
  \ of fire damage each round; those falling prone or held under the liquid fire take\
  \ 10d6 points of fire damage each round. The molten river persists until the pyroclastic\
  \ spike is removed from the ground as a full-round action, at which point the affected\
  \ area immediately cools. Any creature in the molten terrain becomes entangled when\
  \ the rock cools, but may escape with a successful DC 16 Reflex save."
