  \ depict the heraldic symbols of several key sites and fortresses once held by Lastwall,\
  \ and each provides different benefits, which are described below.\nA banner can\
  \ be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the banner does\
  \ not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness\
  \ until reclaimed and replanted by allies of the owner.\nHarchist (abjuration aura):\
  \ Allies of the owner of the Lastwall Harchist banner gain a +6 morale bonus on\
  \ saving throws against fear effects so long as they can see the banner. If the\
  \ mass combat rules (Ultimate Campaign 234) are being used, so long as this banner\
  \ is visible to the majority of an army, the DC of the Morale check to determine\
  \ whether the enemy routs decreases by 5.\nHordeline (abjuration aura): Allies of\

  \ per day, while this banner is held aloft or planted by someone with the bravery\

  \ of the Lastwall Sunwall bannerâ€˜s owner gain the benefits of a blessing of fervor\
  \ spell (Advanced Player's Guide 205) while the banner is visible. If the banner\
