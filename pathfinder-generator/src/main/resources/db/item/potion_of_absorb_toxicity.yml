name: "Potion of Absorb Toxicity"
description: "You absorb the toxicity of your surroundings, becoming toxic as a result.\
  \ While under the effect of this spell, you are immune to diseases and poisons with\
  \ which you come into contact. When you are exposed to a disease or poison, you\
  \ can choose to absorb it. Doing so ends the immunity due to this spell to any disease\
  \ and poison other than the one you absorbed. You remain immune to the new affliction\
  \ until this spell ends. Casting absorb toxicityon yourself a second time does not\
  \ allow you to absorb a second toxin, but instead resets the duration of the effect\
  \ to its full 10 minutes/level."
