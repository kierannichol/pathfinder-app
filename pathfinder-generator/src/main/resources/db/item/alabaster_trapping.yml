  \ several golden embellishments. The robe is under a constant prestidigitation spell\
  \ that removes any dirt or stains while preventing wrinkles. Once per day as an\
  \ immediate action, the wearer can repel one creature physically touching her (such\
  \ as a creature targeting her with a touch spell or a combat maneuver). The target\
  \ of this effect takes 5d4 points of force damage and is pushed 10 feet in a direction\
  \ specified by the wearer."
