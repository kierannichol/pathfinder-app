description: "This incense gives off a musty smell when burned, reminiscent of old\
  \ tomes in libraries. When a character lights incense of eidos and then spends 10\
  \ minutes meditating nearby, she is able to recall with perfect clarity any information\
  \ she wishes. For the next 10 minutes, the affected character can take 20 on any\
  \ Knowledge skill check, even if in immediate danger or distracted. One pound of\
  \ incense of eidos is enough for three 10-minute meditation sessions."
