description: "Sneaks and thieves know the value of a good disguise. The ability to\
  \ remove that disguise in a hurry, thus revealing the next layer of disguise, is\
  \ nearly as valuable. Tear-away clothing is generally loose fitting and allows another\
  \ layer of clothing to be worn underneath. The seams on this clothing are designed\
  \ to break easily, making it a simple matter (a standard action) to remove these\
  \ items and walk away with none the wiser. Any outfit can be crafted as tear-away\
  \ clothing for an additional price."
