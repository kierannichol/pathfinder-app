description: "The bars of this +2 nunchaku are solid iron, wrapped in leather decorated\
  \ with an imperial dragon motif, and connected by a chain. Once per day, when the\
  \ wielder of a dragonmaw nunchaku confirms a critical hit against an opponent with\
  \ the nunchaku, he can cast confusion on that creature as a free action. The confusion\
  \ effect lasts for 8 rounds, and a DC 16 Will save negates the effect.\nIn addition,\
  \ in the round following a successful disarm attack with the dragonmaw nunchaku,\
  \ the wielder can spin the nunchaku as a standard action, creating a curtain of\
  \ whirling force replicas of the disarmed weapon around himself for 1 round. This\
  \ functions as a ringed blade barrier with a radius of 10 feet around the wielder\
  \ (Reflex DC 19). The disarmed weapon determines the damage dice of the blade barrier\
  \ (i.e., 12d6 for a wakizashi, 12d8 for a katana, and so on). The disarmed weapon\
  \ is unaffected, and drops to the ground as normal. The wielder can create the blade\
  \ barrier once per day, and only in the round following a successful disarm attack."
