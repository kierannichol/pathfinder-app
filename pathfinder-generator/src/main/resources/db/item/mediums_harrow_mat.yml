description: "This harrow mat allows a harrower to tap into the ancestral knowledge\
  \ of nearby spirits. If a harrower uses this mat as an additional focus component\
  \ while casting harrowing or greater harrowing, she treats her caster level as 1\
  \ higher. When this mat is used to perform a harrowing (magical or not) over a grave\
  \ or other burial site, the spirit of the interned body influences the harrowing;\
  \ for each card drawn related to the past, the harrower can draw from the deck twice\
  \ and choose which card to place."
