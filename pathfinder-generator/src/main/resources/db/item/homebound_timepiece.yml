description: "This complicated brass chronometer can be wound only while on the Material\
  \ Plane. Attempts to wind a homebound timepiece on any other plane simply fail,\
  \ with the winding pin spinning and turning without effect. Winding a homebound\
  \ timepiece is an arduous process that requires 10 minutes, but it thereafter keeps\
  \ accurate time for the next 10 days, as time passes on the Material Plane. If a\
  \ homebound timepiece is taken to a plane with the erratic time or flowing time\
  \ traits, it speeds up or slows down as necessary to accurately measure the passage\
  \ of relative time on the Material Plane (for example, if it is taken to a plane\
  \ where 1 day is equal to 1 round on the Material Plane, the timepiece slows down\
  \ considerably and functions for nearly 40 years). If the homebound timepiece is\
  \ taken to a plane with the timeless trait, it is immediately but harmlessly unwound."
