description: "This foul-smelling gray paste is typically stored in a bone container.\
  \ When smeared upon a corpse, it preserves that corpse's state of decay for 5 days,\
  \ as if via the gentle repose spell. If smeared upon a corporeal undead creature,\
  \ it restores that creature's living appearance for 5 days—this has no effect on\
  \ the creature's abilities, but does grant it a +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise\
  \ checks to appear as a living creature and imparts a –5 penalty on Knowledge (religion)\
  \ checks to identify what type of undead creature it is. Unguent of revivification\
  \ is particularly popular in Geb, where many of that nation's movers and shakers\
  \ view it as a vanity item to mask the hideous truths of their undead flesh."
