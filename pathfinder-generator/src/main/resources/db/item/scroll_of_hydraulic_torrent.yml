name: "Scroll of Hydraulic Torrent"
description: "You call forth a powerful stream of water that batters all creatures\
  \ and obstacles in its path until it strikes something it cannot push past. Against\
  \ creatures and moveable objects this stream acts as a bull rush. You can bull rush\
  \ creatures of any size, not just those one size larger than your own. Make a combat\
  \ maneuver check and apply its results to each creature within the area. Your CMB\
  \ for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom,\
  \ or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush does not provoke an\
  \ attack of opportunity."
