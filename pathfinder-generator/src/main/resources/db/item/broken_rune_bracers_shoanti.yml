description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis pair of leather bracers is marked by runes\
  \ of bondage from ancient days. Each rune is deliberately incomplete, in order to\
  \ invert its intended function. Once per day, when a Shoanti wearer becomes possessed\
  \ by magic jar, possession (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 180), or a similar\
  \ effect, the bracers automatically expel the possessing creature. The possessing\
  \ creature does not have a chance to take any actions (such as removing the bracers)\
  \ before this occurs."
