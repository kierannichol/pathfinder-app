name: "Scroll of Animal Shapes"
description: "As beast shape III, except you change the form of up to one willing\
  \ creature per caster level into an animal of your choice; the spell has no effect\
  \ on unwilling creatures. All creatures must take the same kind of animal form.\
  \ Recipients remain in the animal form until the spell expires or until you dismiss\
  \ it for all recipients. In addition, an individual subject may choose to resume\
  \ its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell for that subject\
  \ alone."
