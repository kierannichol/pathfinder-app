description: "This tiny, unremarkable silver key can open nearly any set of shackles.\
  \ When the key is inserted as a standard action into the keyhole of locked leg irons,\
  \ manacles, or shackles, the lock unlocks provided that its Disable Device DC is\
  \ 30 or lower. Shackles whose lock has a Disable Device DC of 15 or lower are instantly\
  \ and silently broken into fragments.\nA liberator's key can be used 10 times, after\
  \ which it crumbles to dust."
