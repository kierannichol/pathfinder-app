description: "This single-use javelin bears a thunderstone in its haft, just behind\
  \ the weapon's head. If you hit with one of these javelins, the target takes javelin\
  \ damage as normal and is the center of the thunderstone's effect. If you miss,\
  \ roll to see where the javelin lands (as if determining a miss with a splash weapon);\
  \ that square becomes the center of the thunderstone's effect."
