description: "This special dust has many uses. If it is thrown into water, a volume\
  \ of as much as 100 gallons is instantly transformed into nothingness, and the dust\
  \ becomes a marble-sized pellet, floating or resting where it was thrown. If this\
  \ pellet is hurled, it breaks and releases the same volume of water. The dust affects\
  \ only water (fresh, salt, alkaline), not other liquids.\nIf the dust is employed\
  \ against an outsider with the elemental and water subtypes, the creature must make\
  \ a DC 18 Fortitude save or be destroyed. The dust deals 5d6 points of damage to\
  \ the creature even if its saving throw succeeds."
