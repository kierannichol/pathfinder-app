name: "Wand of Touch Injection"
description: "You must hold an elixir, infused extract, poison, or potion in hand\
  \ as you cast this spell. The held substance drains from its container into a magical\
  \ sac in your body. While the spell lasts, you can deliver the substance with a\
  \ mere touch. To do so to an opponent, you must make a successful melee touch attack.\
  \ If you hit, the substance takes effect immediately, despite any onset period,\
  \ and that opponent receives the normal saving throw (if any) against the substance.\
  \ In the case of a personal infused extract, the opponent receives both a Fortitude\
  \ save and spell resistance. If you miss, the substance remains in the magical sac\
  \ for you to use later."
