description: "This gritty sand bonds to surfaces that resist energy damage, corroding\
  \ the protection. Corrosenze can be applied to a weapon as if it were a poison.\
  \ A creature struck with a weapon coated with corrosenze has its energy resistance\
  \ reduced by 5 for 5 minutes (no saving throw), with the energy type correlating\
  \ with the corrosenze's color: rust-colored corrosenze affects acid resistance,\
  \ salt-colored affects cold, granitecolored affects electricity, and ash-colored\
  \ affects fire. As a full-round action, the target can attempt a DC 15 Reflex saving\
  \ throw to scrape off the corrosenze and regain its lost energy resistance. Crafting\
  \ this item requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
