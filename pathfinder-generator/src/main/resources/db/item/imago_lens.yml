description: "The imago lens appears as a 3-foot-diameter semitransparent disc of\
  \ amber gripped in the jaws of a metal demonic frame. This device functions as a\
  \ crystal ball with telepathy and true seeing —a successful DC 24 Will save allows\
  \ a creature to resist being scried upon by the imago lens. Once per day, the imago\
  \ lens may instead be used to create a projected image of the user, as the spell\
  \ project image. The user may project this image into any location she has observed\
  \ before, either in person or via scrying. Once the image is projected, the user\
  \ can sense the world around the image as if she were there, communicate with nearby\
  \ creatures, and even cast spells. The image cannot move from its current location.\
  \ Using this effect is not without risk; if the image is dispelled, the user must\
  \ succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 4d6 points of Constitution drain as\
  \ her body reels from the sudden disconnection and her soul is warped and twisted\
  \ by the lens's powerful magic. The imago lens is a chaotic evil artifact, and each\
  \ time it is used, a nonchaotic- evil user must also succeed at a DC 25 Will save\
  \ to resist having her alignment shift one step closer to chaotic evil."
destruction: "If a demigod is slain while it uses the lens to project an image, the\
  \ lens shatters and the demigod turns into an insane ghost."
