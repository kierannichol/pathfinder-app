description: "This rod looks like a royal scepter worth at least 5,000 gp in materials\
  \ and workmanship alone. The wielder can command the obedience and fealty of creatures\
  \ within 120 feet when she activates the device (a standard action). Creatures totaling\
  \ 300 Hit Dice can be ruled, but creatures with Intelligence scores of 12 or higher\
  \ are each entitled to a DC 16 Will save to negate the effect. Ruled creatures obey\
  \ the wielder as if she were their absolute sovereign. Still, if the wielder gives\
  \ a command that is contrary to the nature of the creatures commanded, the magic\
  \ is broken. The rod can be used for 500 total minutes before it crumbles to dust.\
  \ This duration need not be continuous."
