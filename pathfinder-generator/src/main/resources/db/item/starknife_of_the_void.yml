description: "The starknife of the void is a weapon designed by devotees of Black\
  \ Butterfly and at one time could only be found among the faithful of her mystery\
  \ cults. Over time, these weapons fell into the hands of those outside the cult,\
  \ and now they crop up in odd places— sealed vaults, underground treasure caches,\
  \ the bottom of the sea—but always places where there is darkness and stillness.\n\
  The starknife of the void is a +2 returning starknife. If the wielder scores a critical\
  \ hit against a foe with a starknife of the void, it discharges a blindness/deafness\
  \ spell affecting the creature struck. The target must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude\
  \ save or be struck blind or deaf (as chosen by the wielder of the starknife of\
  \ the void). If the starknife of the void deals more than one critical hit to the\
  \ same target, the target can potentially become both blind and deaf."
