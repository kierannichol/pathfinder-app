name: "Scroll of Stinking Cloud"
description: "Stinking cloud creates a bank of fog like that created by fog cloud,\
  \ except that the vapors are nauseating. Living creatures in the cloud become nauseated.\
  \ This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds\
  \ after it leaves. (Roll separately for each nauseated character.) Any creature\
  \ that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each\
  \ round on your turn. This is a poison effect."
