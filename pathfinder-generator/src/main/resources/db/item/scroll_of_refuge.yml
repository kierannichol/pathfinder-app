name: "Scroll of Refuge"
description: "When you cast this spell, you create powerful magic in a specially prepared\
  \ object. This object contains the power to instantly transport its possessor across\
  \ any distance within the same plane to your abode. Once the item is so enhanced,\
  \ you must give it willingly to a creature and at the same time inform it of a command\
  \ word to be spoken when the item is used. To make use of the item, the subject\
  \ speaks the command word at the same time that it rends or breaks the item (a standard\
  \ action). When this is done, the individual and all objects it is wearing and carrying\
  \ (to a maximum of the character's heavy load) are instantly transported to your\
  \ abode. No other creatures are affected (aside from a familiar or animal companion\
  \ that is touching the subject)."
