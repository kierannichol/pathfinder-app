description: "These appealing treats usually come wrapped in wax paper, sealed with\
  \ a drop of red wax embossed with the face of a smiling child. Made from sugar and\
  \ bone meal, spiteful cookies can be made in a variety of shapes, such as humanoid\
  \ creatures, dragons, or other legendary beasts. When the seal is broken and the\
  \ cookie unwrapped, the creature that unwrapped the cookie must succeed at a DC\
  \ 12 Will save or be compelled to eat the spiteful cookie. While initially quite\
  \ tasty, the treat soon turns to ash, cursing the victim to starvation for the next\
  \ 6 days, as the feast of ashes spell."
