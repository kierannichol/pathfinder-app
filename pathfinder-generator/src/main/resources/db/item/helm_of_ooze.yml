description: "This bulky, rusted helm incorporates a pair of goggles that sit on the\
  \ wearer's brow. The wearer of a helm of ooze control gains a limited ability to\
  \ telepathically command oozes. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can\
  \ attempt to gain control over a single ooze within 60 feet. The ooze must succeed\
  \ at a DC 17 Will save or fall under the wearer's mental control. This compulsion\
  \ affects even mindless oozes. The control offered by the helm is very limited,\
  \ and the wearer is able to issue only one of the following commands at a time,\
  \ as a move action, to a controlled ooze within 60 feet.\nAttack: The ooze attacks\
  \ the nearest creature.\nHalt: The ooze remains in place. It does not take any actions\
  \ but is not considered helpless.\nMove: The ooze moves toward a point in space\
  \ that the wearer can see.\nThe wearer can control up to 20 Hit Dice worth of oozes\
  \ at any given time. An ooze with 5 or more Hit Dice can attempt a new Will save\
  \ each day to free itself from the wearer's control. An ooze ordered to halt receives\
  \ a new Will save to overcome the helm's control if attacked. Oozes with an Intelligence\
  \ score, as well as those with 11 or more Hit Dice, are immune to this effect.\n\
  The wearer can issue a command to multiple controlled oozes with a single move action,\
  \ but if she does, each ooze receives the same command. Oozes that have been issued\
  \ a command continue to follow that command until a new command is issued or they\
  \ are released from the helm's control. Removing the helm does not release the oozes\
  \ from control, but the helm must be worn to issue new commands. If 24 hours pass\
  \ without the helm being worn, then all affected oozes are released from control."
