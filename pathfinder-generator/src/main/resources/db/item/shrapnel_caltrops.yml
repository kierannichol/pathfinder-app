description: "Shrapnel caltrops shatter into fragments that embed themselves into\
  \ a creature's body when stepped on. Shrapnel caltrops work just like normal caltrops,\
  \ except they are considered masterwork weapons (+1 bonus on attack rolls). Creatures\
  \ damaged by a shrapnel caltrop must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or take 1d2\
  \ points of Dexterity damage in addition to the caltrop's usual damage. The movement\
  \ penalty inflicted by a shrapnel caltrop cannot be removed until all Dexterity\
  \ damage dealt by the caltrop is healed, even if the creature receives magical healing\
  \ or is treated with a successful Heal check. Shrapnel caltrops are destroyed after\
  \ making one attack rolls. Shrapnel caltrops can't have the hollow special feature\
  \ or the serrated special feature."
