description: "This ring resembles a ring of psychic mastery, but its flawless sapphire\
  \ serves as a vessel for the wearer's soul. It possesses all the abilities of a\
  \ ring of psychic mastery in addition to the following effects.\nThe wearer's soul\
  \ instantly enters the ring upon the wearer's death, even if her body is utterly\
  \ destroyed. This counts as an object possession spell, except that the possessing\
  \ soul cannot animate the ring and must instead wait for someone to wear it. From\
  \ inside the ring, she can attempt a greater possession on anyone who voluntarily\
  \ wears the ring (Will DC 23 negates). A successful save against the greater possession\
  \ effect renders the new wearer immune to further such attempts for 24 hours. Dispelling\
  \ the object possession effect on the ring banishes the soul from the ring to its\
  \ appropriate afterlife. Otherwise, a soul can remain in the ring indefinitely.\
  \ While in the ring, the soul knows when a creature has put on the ring. The soul\
  \ can't otherwise sense the area around it or take actions other than attempting\
  \ the greater possession effect.\nA ring of the hidden psyche resists attempts to\
  \ discern its true nature. Detect magic reveals only the properties of a ring of\
  \ psychic mastery, though identify or stronger magic can reveal the ring's full\
  \ powers if the caster succeeds at a DC 23 Will save."
