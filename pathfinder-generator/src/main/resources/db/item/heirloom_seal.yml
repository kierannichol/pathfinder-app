description: "This carved stone seal can be dipped into red ink and used to stamp\
  \ a letter, proclamation, or other written document. Once a document has been sealed\
  \ in this way, the writing upon it cannot be altered by either mundane or magical\
  \ means. Spells that ruin text, change text, or render text unreadable cannot affect\
  \ writing that has been sealed with an heirloom seal unless the caster succeeds\
  \ at a caster level check (DC = 15 + the heirloom seal's owner's Hit Dice), nor\
  \ can additional text be added with spells such as explosive runes or illusory script.\
  \ Attempts at mundane forgery also slide off the sealed document in 2d4 rounds,\
  \ reverting the writing to its original state. An heirloom seal cannot be used on\
  \ runes or any form of magical writing. Each seal has its own unique mark to indicate\
  \ its owner, which can be magically verified with either detect magic or read magic."
