description: "Devil's spit is a more potent form of unholy water, and acts in most\
  \ ways like a vial of that substance. However, a direct hit by a flask of devil's\
  \ spit deals 4d4 points of damage to good outsiders and lawful good creatures, 6d4\
  \ points of damage to lawful good outsiders, and 2d4 points of damage to all other\
  \ good-aligned creatures. All creatures within 5 feet of the point where the flask\
  \ hits take 2 points of damage if they are good outsiders or lawful good creatures,\
  \ 3 points of damage if they are lawful good outsiders, and 1 point of damage if\
  \ they are chaotic good or neutral good.\nDevil's spit can also be used to charge\
  \ a rod of burning blood (see below). A single vial of devil's spit provides 5 charges\
  \ to that item. Charging a rod of burning blood with devil's spit is a standard\
  \ action that provokes attacks of opportunity."
