description: "This alchemical perfume is distilled from a blend of humanoid pheromones\
  \ and fey sweat. When applied as a full-round action, it grants the wearer a +2\
  \ circumstance bonus on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks for\
  \ 1 hour. During this time, the wearer takes a –2 penalty on saving throws against\
  \ charm and fascination effects originating from fey.\nLong-term use of lover's\
  \ breath eventually results in physical changes, causing the user to vaguely resemble\
  \ a fey creature such as a nymph or dryad, although these changes are only cosmetic."
