description: "Elves have traditionally eschewed the use of larger weaponry, opting\
  \ instead for lighter weapons that take advantage of their wielders' agility and\
  \ poise. The elven curve blade is perhaps the bestknown weapon in this category,\
  \ but the leafblade (often partnered with the substantially longer thornblade) embraces\
  \ these fighting styles to an even greater extent. This short sword has a blade\
  \ reminiscent of a long, narrow leaf and is suitable both for slashing swings and\
  \ targeted thrusts. These weapons are designed to be wielded alongside elven thornblades.\
  \ Attacks with an elven leafblade gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls made to confirm\
  \ critical hits."
