description: "A rockfall cloak is fashioned from rigid fabric with a stony texture,\
  \ and it grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks in underground terrain.\
  \ The wearer can command the cloak to encapsulate her as a free action. The cloak\
  \ then hardens into a spherical stone shell resembling a smooth boulder that occupies\
  \ an entire 5-foot square and weighs 200 pounds. The shell has a hardness of 10\
  \ and 25 hit points. Any damage from falling or from falling rocks is dealt to the\
  \ stone shell. If it is destroyed, any remaining damage is transferred to its wearer.\
  \ A rockfall cloak remains in this stone shell form for 1 hour (or earlier, if the\
  \ wearer chooses) before crumbling to dust. Once it's used in its stone shell form,\
  \ a rockfall cloak is destroyed."
