description: "A kapre's 2-foot-long cigar never goes out. It burns with a glow that\
  \ sheds light like a candle, but does not burn other organic material. Smoking the\
  \ cigar is dangerous for any but a kapreâ€”and not just because of its size. Only\
  \ a Medium or larger creature can attempt to smoke the cigar. Creatures doing so\
  \ must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 hour. Each time\
  \ a creature attempts to inhale, he or she must make another save, but receives\
  \ a cumulative +1 bonus for each successful inhalation in the past 24 hours.\nOnce\
  \ inhaled, the smoke can be exhanled to the detriment of nearby foes. The smoking\
  \ creature must exhale within 1 round of inhaling or be nauseated for 1 round, coughing\
  \ up the potent smoke into its own square. A Medium creature can blow the smoke\
  \ as a standard action at one adjacent enemy. A Large or larger creature can blow\
  \ the smoke in a 15-foot cone, also as a standard action. Creatures caught in the\
  \ smoky cloud must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round."
