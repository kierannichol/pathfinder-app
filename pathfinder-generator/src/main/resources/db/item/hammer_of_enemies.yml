description: "This special +3 bane warhammer seeks only to crush the enemy of its\
  \ wielder in battle. The hammer can speak Common, constantly mutters, curses when\
  \ it is not engaged in battle, and sings deeply of its love of carnage when it is\
  \ being used in a fight. The hammer of enemies is always eager to point out potential\
  \ enemies within its vision. Because of its bloodlust it does not bestow negative\
  \ levels on creatures that do not share its alignmentâ€”it is willing to fight for\
  \ anyone. Additionally, three times per day, the hammer of enemies can change the\
  \ creature type of its bane ability. A creature type remains until a new one is\
  \ chosen."
