description: "This +2 flaming burst longbow 's arrow rest is shaped like a dragon's\
  \ head with its mouth agapeâ€”as if about to unleash its breath weapon. A mythic wielder\
  \ can expend one use of mythic power when drawing back the bow to create an arrow\
  \ of pure flame. This flame arrow acts as a ranged touch attack that can target\
  \ only creatures within the first range increment of the bow. When it hits its target,\
  \ this flame arrow deals 3d10+2 points of fire damage. This damage stacks with the\
  \ bow's flaming burst special ability."
