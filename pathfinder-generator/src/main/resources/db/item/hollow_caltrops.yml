description: "Created by adherents of Norgorber to lure pursuers to their deaths,\
  \ hollow caltrops each have a hidden chamber built inside them. Hollow caltrops\
  \ work just like normal caltrops, except they are considered masterwork weapons\
  \ (+1 bonus on attack rolls), and they can be filled with poison. A single dose\
  \ of poison can be applied to an entire 2-pound bag of caltrops after 10 minutes\
  \ of work. Doing so requires a delicate hand, and there is a 5% chance of poisoning\
  \ yourself unless you have the poison use class feature or a similar ability. Hollow\
  \ caltrops can be further enchanted as per melee weapons, treating one 2-pound bag\
  \ as a single melee weapon. If any of the magic caltrops are lost, all the caltrops\
  \ lose any magic abilities until the missing caltrops are returned or replaced.\
  \ Hollow caltrops can't have the serrated special feature or the shrapnel special\
  \ feature."
