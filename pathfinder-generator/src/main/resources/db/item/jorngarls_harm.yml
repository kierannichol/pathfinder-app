description: "This Large +2 keen vorpal greataxe has an adamantine haft and a chipped,\
  \ pitted guillotine blade instead of a curved axehead. Obviously made for a giant's\
  \ hands, the axe laughs evilly whenever it kills. Like the final blades of Galt,\
  \ any creature killed by it (whether from decapitation or simple damage) finds its\
  \ soul trapped within the blade, and it cannot be raised from the dead while so\
  \ trapped. Presumably the Gray Gardeners would know how to release a soul from the\
  \ blade."
