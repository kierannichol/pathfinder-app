description: "This collection of gruesome anatomical diagrams is bound in leather\
  \ that shifts slightly under the reader's fingertips. The book's many illustrations\
  \ provide information about how to best wound a variety of creature types, and the\
  \ book emits light equivalent to that of a candle within 5 feet, allowing it to\
  \ be read in the dark. The owner can use this folio to gain a +5 bonus on Knowledge\
  \ checks to identify a creature's special powers or vulnerabilities. A monster killer's\
  \ folio has a tendency to quickly open to the appropriate page when consulted, as\
  \ though eager to provide information that will lead to violence. Additionally,\
  \ once per day the book can be used to cast discovery torch."
