  \ brightly with arcane energy as if affected by a permanent light spell. The bearer\
  \ can suppress the lantern's light or cause it to resume with a command word. Additionally,\
  \ once per day by saying a different command word, the bearer can use the lantern\
  \ to cast glitterdust in a 10-foot-radius spread. Any creature caught in the effect\
  \ must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw or be blinded for 3 rounds."
