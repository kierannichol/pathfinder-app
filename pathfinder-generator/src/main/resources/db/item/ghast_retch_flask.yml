description: "Harvested and concentrated from the remains of slain ghasts, this foul-smelling\
  \ powder is kept in tightly sealed flasks. It is thrown as a splash weapon and the\
  \ flask breaks on impact, releasing noxious dust. The target is nauseated for 1\
  \ round and sickened for 3 rounds after that. A successful DC 12 Fortitude save\
  \ prevents the nauseated condition, but not the sickened condition. Creatures within\
  \ 5 feet of where the flask hits are sickened for 1 round. This is a poison effect.\
  \ Crafting this item is a DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
