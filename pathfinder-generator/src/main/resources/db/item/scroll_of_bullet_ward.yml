name: "Scroll of Bullet Ward"
description: "You toss several adamantine bullets into the air, which then hover protectively\
  \ nearby and intercept firearm attacks targeting you. The number of bullets protecting\
  \ you is equal to half your caster level (maximum 4). When an opponent takes a shot\
  \ at you with a firearm, as an immediate action you can designate a hovering bullet\
  \ to attempt to block the attack, increasing your AC against that attack by 10.\
  \ Doing this destroys the adamantine bullet whether or not the attack hits. The\
  \ spell is discharged when all affected adamantine bullets are destroyed or taken\
  \ from you. Each adamantine bullet has AC 24, 20 hit points, and hardness 20."
