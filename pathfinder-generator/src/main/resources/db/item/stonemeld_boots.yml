description: "The wearer of a pair of stonemeld boots gains a +4 bonus to CMD against\
  \ bull rush, drag, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers. Additionally, once per\
  \ day as a swift action, the boots can be activated to grant the wearer a climb\
  \ speed of 10 feet on any natural stone surface (but not manufactured stone surfaces\
  \ like brick walls) for 30 minutes. A creature using stonemeld boots to climb in\
  \ this fashion leaves obvious deformities in the rock surface. Anyone attempting\
  \ to track a wearer of stonemeld boots moving in this fashion treats the base DC\
  \ as though the tracks were left in soft earth, and takes no penalties for time\
  \ elapsed since the tracks were made."
