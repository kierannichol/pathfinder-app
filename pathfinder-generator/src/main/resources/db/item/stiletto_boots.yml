description: "The most ostentatious and impractical of footwear, the tall heel attached\
  \ to these boots adds several inches to your height. This type of boot is popular\
  \ among Chelish nobles, though the trend has recently caught on among some members\
  \ of Taldan courts. You can use the heel of a stiletto boot as an improvised weapon,\
  \ dealing damage as a punching dagger"
