description: "This +2 studded leather armor comes in a number of varieties, each corresponding\
  \ to a specific type of terrain from the ranger's favored terrain list. The armor\
  \ takes on visual characteristics related to that type of terrain (cold stalking\
  \ armor might be gray and white with a white fur trim, jungle stalking armor could\
  \ be lush green with vine patterns, and so on) and makes the wearer blend in more\
  \ naturally with his surroundings. The stalking armor grants the wearer a +5 competence\
  \ bonus on Stealth and Perception checks attempted while in that specific terrain."
