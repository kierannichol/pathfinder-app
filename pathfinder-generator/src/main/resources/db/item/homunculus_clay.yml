description: "This thick clay mixture comes in a jar stamped with a silhouette of\
  \ whatever creature can be created using its contents. By adding a drop of blood\
  \ to a scoop of homunculus clay, you can create a temporary homunculus that hardens\
  \ and becomes fully animate in just 1 round. The character whose blood is used is\
  \ treated as the homunculus's master. After 1 hour, a clay homunculus withers and\
  \ dies, rapidly decaying into a viscous slime. The listed price is for a jar containing\
  \ 3 doses of homunculus clay."
