description: "This crystal lens fits over a single eye but takes up the entire eyes\
  \ slot. Once per day, the wearer is able to gaze at a 10-foot-by-10- foot area and\
  \ see exactly what occurred in that area during the past 24 hours. The vision of\
  \ what occurred in the specified area comes to the user in a single minute of observation;\
  \ if that minute is interrupted, the wearer must use the monocle again to get the\
  \ full observation. All the visual details of the observed events are clear and\
  \ memorable to the user, no matter how obscure. The monocle does not, however, provide\
  \ any insight into the observed events besides what can be visually seen. Observed\
  \ conversations cannot be heard, for example."
