description: "This device looks like a clear, fist-sized crystal with an internal\
  \ lattice made up of nearly invisible strands of silver-white metal. By holding\
  \ the crystal in both hands and concentrating, the user can record its own memories,\
  \ storing the information in the crystal so that it can be retrieved later with\
  \ perfect clarity. The crystal can store a nearly limitless amount of information,\
  \ but the user must concentrate for 1 minute to record an amount of information\
  \ that would require 10 minutes to communicate in other ways.\nThe information in\
  \ a mnemonic repository can be recalled in a similar fashion, requiring 1 minute\
  \ of concentration for each 10 minutes' worth of information gained, but the user\
  \ must know the repository's mental keyword, which is set by the creature that recorded\
  \ the memories. A mnemonic repository can be used to remove the effects of spells\
  \ such as modify memory or repress memory, as long as the user recorded its true\
  \ memories prior to being affected by those spells, but the device cannot remove\
  \ negative levels imposed by a mindwipe spell, nor can it restore previously cast\
  \ spells."
