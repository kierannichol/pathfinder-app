description: "A greasy paste of beeswax, pyrite, and various monster fluids, fool's\
  \ glow reacts with light to confuse magical senses. For 12 hours after being smeared\
  \ over an object or creature (a process requiring 1 minute), the fool's glow detects\
  \ as faintly magical if examined with a detect magic or arcane sight spell, though\
  \ no school or specific spell can be identified. With a successful DC 21 Craft (alchemy)\
  \ or Spellcraft check, a character identifies the coating for what it is. A single\
  \ jar of fool's glow can coat one Medium, two Small, or four Tiny or smaller objects.\
  \ Crafting a jar of fool's glow requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
