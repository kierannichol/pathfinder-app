description: "A regression mine is a nondescript plate of metal that can be armed\
  \ to deliver a terrible, mind-affecting curse. Arming the mine requires a move action,\
  \ and deploying it in an adjacent square requires a standard action. An armed regression\
  \ mine must be deployed within 3 rounds; otherwise, it must be rearmed before it\
  \ can be deployed.\nOnce it has been deployed, a regression mine triggers when any\
  \ creature enters its space. The triggered mine emits an invisible magical field\
  \ in a 20-foot-radius burst centered on itself, which lasts for 1 minute before\
  \ dissipating. Creatures in this field when the mine activates or that enter it\
  \ while it remains active are confused and take a â€“4 penalty to their Intelligence\
  \ scores as long as they remain in the field and for 1 minute thereafter. When a\
  \ creature with the confused condition from this effect determines its action, it\
  \ must reroll any result that isn't \"attack nearest creature\" and take the second\
  \ result.\nA creature in the field of a regression mine can avoid its effects with\
  \ a successful DC 15 saving throw, but it must continue attempting saving throws\
  \ at the same DC each round it remains within the regression mine's field.\nA regression\
  \ mine is a single-use item; once triggered, the mine is inert and nonmagical. An\
  \ armed regression mine in the area of another regression mine's active field automatically\
  \ triggers; therefore, a string of carefully placed mines can be activated in quick\
  \ succession when only one of them is triggered. An armed or active regression mine\
  \ can be disabled with a successful DC 30 Disable Device check. Failing the check\
  \ to disable an armed regression mine by more than 5 immediately triggers it. If\
  \ an active mine is disabled, its magical field immediately collapses. A regression\
  \ mine is inherently unstable; a creature that takes damage while carrying an armed\
  \ regression mine must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw, or the mine immediately\
  \ activates."
