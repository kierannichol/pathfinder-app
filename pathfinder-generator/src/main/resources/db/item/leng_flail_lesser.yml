description: "The immense and inscrutable Leng spiders are known to construct makeshift\
  \ flails by linking nearby debris, such as rocks or skulls, with their own extruded\
  \ web fibers. Although this organic webbing typically degrades over time, skillful\
  \ alchemy can preserve one of these weapons indefinitely.\nA lesser Leng flail is\
  \ a +1 heavy flail that allows its wielder to use spider climb at will. Much less\
  \ common are greater Leng flails, which are +2 throwing heavy flails that have the\
  \ same spider climb ability of the lesser flail. In addition, when the wielder of\
  \ a greater Leng flail confirms a critical hit against a creature, the target suffers\
  \ horrific hallucinations for 1d4 rounds, becoming confused (Will DC 19 negates).\
  \ This is a mind-affecting effect."
