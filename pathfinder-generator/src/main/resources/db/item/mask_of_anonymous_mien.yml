description: "This featureless mask is little more than a white disk with eyeholes\
  \ and a pair of short leather straps for tying. After donning the mask, the wearer\
  \ can meditate for 1 minute in order to assume a faceless identity, becoming an\
  \ utterly generic and unremarkable member of the wearer's race and gender. Knowledge\
  \ checks about the wearer's faceless identity don't reveal information about his\
  \ true identity, unless his true identity is revealed to the world at large. Additionally,\
  \ attempts to scry or otherwise locate the wearer work only if the creature is attempting\
  \ to locate the wearer's faceless identity (or the creature knows the wearer's faceless\
  \ identity and the wearer's true identity are one and the same). Otherwise, the\
  \ spell has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid\
  \ or did not exist. In addition, if the wearer owns multiple masks of anonymous\
  \ mien, the faceless identity he assumes is the same for all such items.\nA vigilante\
  \ who wears a mask of anonymous mien treats the faceless identity created by the\
  \ item as a vigilante identity for the purpose of his class abilities, although\
  \ this identity is separate from his actual vigilante identity."
