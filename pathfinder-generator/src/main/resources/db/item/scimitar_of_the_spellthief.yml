description: "This curved blade of golden metal, a +1 keen heartseeking spellstealing\
  \ scimitar, is the bane of spellcasters. Inscribed with flowing magical script that\
  \ purports to reveal the inner secrets of magic, the scimitar of the spellthief\
  \ grants the wielder a +2 bonus on Spellcraft and Use Magic Device checks. The scimitar\
  \ also reveals magical auras by touch; this functions as detect magic but affects\
  \ only a single object or creature at a time, which must be touched with the blade\
  \ while the wielder concentrates on detection, and the magical auras revealed are\
  \ clearly visible to all."
