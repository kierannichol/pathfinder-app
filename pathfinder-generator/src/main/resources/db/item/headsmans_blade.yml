description: "This scalpel-sharp greatsword has a simple black handle and crosspiece,\
  \ and is made of unusually dark steel etched with an organic wave pattern. Once\
  \ per day, the wielder of this +1 keen greatsword can attempt to assassinate a target,\
  \ per the slayer advanced talent of the same name. If the wielder is not a slayer,\
  \ he must spend a full-round action studying the target before attempting the assassination,\
  \ and the target's DC to avoid death is 15. In the hands of a slayer, the sword's\
  \ enhancement bonus on attack rolls is 2 better against a studied target, and the\
  \ DC to avoid death from an assassination attempt increases by 2. Additionally,\
  \ if the assassination attempt is successful, the target is decapitated instead\
  \ of merely slain."
