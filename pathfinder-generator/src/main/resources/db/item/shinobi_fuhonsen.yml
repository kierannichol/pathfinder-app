description: "The shinobi fuhonsen is said to have been the first payment ever made\
  \ to a ninja in the history of Minkai. The tarnished bronze coin has a square central\
  \ hole and bears six ideograms on its two faces—four on one face and two on the\
  \ other, with two spaces apparently left blank. A leather thong is threaded through\
  \ the coin's central hole, allowing the coin to be worn around the neck.\nThe six\
  \ ideograms on the coin correspond to six different skills: Acrobatics, Climb, Disguise,\
  \ Escape Artist, Perception, and Stealth. A DC 30 Knowledge (arcana) or DC 20 Linguistics\
  \ check identifies the ideograms and their corresponding skills. The shinobi fuhonsen\
  \ currently has six powers, each corresponding to one of the six ideograms and its\
  \ associated skill. If a new owner has at least 8 ranks in another skill, the shinobi\
  \ fuhonsen gains an additional power based on that skill, and a new ideogram emerges\
  \ on the coin's surface. The new power and the skill it corresponds to are left\
  \ up to the GM, though the power should be related to its skill, and the skill should\
  \ be one on which the owner often relies. Although the existing powers of the shinobi\
  \ fuhonsen are based on skills common to rogues and bards, new powers and their\
  \ corresponding skills are not restricted to those of any one class. Only one new\
  \ power may be unlocked per owner.\nThe coin's powers only function for a worthy\
  \ owner, who must have at least 8 ranks in each of the six skills, plus 8 ranks\
  \ in another skill. If the bearer of the coin is not a worthy owner (i.e., does\
  \ not have enough skill ranks), the coin vanishes from the bearer's possession at\
  \ the next new moon, reappearing elsewhere in Minkai to seek out a new owner.\n\
  When a new owner first takes possession of the shinobi fuhonsen and activates a\
  \ new power, the new ideogram (and its associated power) appears on the coin on\
  \ a temporary basis, and the owner receives a vision of the coin's previous owners\
  \ at the time of their deaths. If the new owner is not chaotic evil, he must immediately\
  \ make a DC 25 Will save or his alignment shifts one step toward chaotic evil. If\
  \ the save succeeds, the owner resists the change and can use the coin's powers\
  \ until the next new moon, when he must make another save. The owner must make a\
  \ new Will save at every new moon until his alignment becomes chaotic evil, or until\
  \ the artifact is no longer in his possession.\nAs long as the owner is not chaotic\
  \ evil, he can simply discard the shinobi fuhonsen, at which point the coin vanishes\
  \ at the next new moon. Once the owner becomes chaotic evil, the new ideogram (and\
  \ its associated power) becomes permanent and he can no longer discard the coin,\
  \ as if it were a cursed item.\nEach of the coin's powers can be activated by speaking\
  \ the name of the corresponding ideogram, unless otherwise noted. The known powers\
  \ (and their associated skills) of the shinobi fuhonsen are as follows."
destruction: "The shinobi fuhonsen can be destroyed if it is swallowed by an ancient\
  \ sovereign dragon (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3). If the dragon succeeds at a DC 30\
  \ Fortitude save, the coin is destroyed. If the save fails, the coin remains intact\
  \ and vanishes to reappear elsewhere."
