description: "The flamma horacalcum is tiny ball of fire harvested from a secret and\
  \ hidden grotto on the Plane of Fire where the flames are infused with energies\
  \ leaking from the Demiplane of Time. During the time of Azlant, dozens of flamma\
  \ horacalcums existed, each of which had to be encased in an orrery-like container\
  \ made of horacalcum to prevent the flame from burning away into another time. The\
  \ flame itself is weightless, but the orrery that contains it weighs 7 pounds, and\
  \ requires a free hand to carry and utilize.\nAs a free action, a flamma horacalcum's\
  \ level of illumination can be adjusted by its carrier's thought to range from the\
  \ brightness of a single candle to that shed by a daylight spell. This light is\
  \ considered to be from a 9th-level spell for the purposes of overcoming magical\
  \ darkness. Once the flamma horacalcum is set down, it continues to radiate its\
  \ last level of light.\nThis light bends and warps time in slight ways for its carrier,\
  \ granting her a +4 bonus on all initiative checks. Three times per day, the flame\
  \ can be commanded to cast a haste spell as a swift action. The carrier can also\
  \ use the flame as a standard action to unleash a thin beam of fire equivalent to\
  \ a searing light. A creature hit by this effect is slowed, as per the spell, for\
  \ 1d4 rounds if it fails at a DC 20 Will save.\nOnce per week as a standard action,\
  \ the user of a flamma horacalcum can blow the flame out, snuffing it entirely.\
  \ This triggers a time stop effect on the user that lasts for 1d4 rounds, after\
  \ which the flame reignites. Other observers see this effect only as a brief flickering\
  \ of the flame, since the duration of the time the flame was extinguished is contained\
  \ wholly by the time stop effect.\nIn certain areas that have been subjected to\
  \ powerful destructive magical effects associated with fire (such as Xin's Palace),\
  \ the light of the flamma horacalcum reveals images from the past. These images\
  \ only manifest if the device's light is at its highest setting, and what exactly\
  \ is revealed can vary—the light may reveal events from only a few hours past, or\
  \ it may reveal things from hundreds of centuries gone. The various encounters within\
  \ Xin's palace include sections on what the light of the flamma horacalcum reveals."
destruction: "The flame of a flamma horacalcum must be quenched in the shadow of a\
  \ demigod who hasn't yet been born."
