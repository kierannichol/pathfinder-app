description: "This flanged iron rod is much heavier than it looks, and grants the\
  \ wielder a portion of the skill of a master coldwarper. The wielder gains a +5\
  \ competence bonus on Craft checks involving metal.\nA coldwarp key has three charges,\
  \ which are renewed at midnight every night and can be expended to create a variety\
  \ of effects. Expending one charge from a coldwarp key allows the wielder to use\
  \ fabricate (as the spell) to affect metal only. If the wielder is in a natural\
  \ underground environment, she can expend two charges from a coldwarp key to draw\
  \ raw metal ore from the surrounding stone and shape it to her liking. This ability\
  \ acts as the major creation spell, except the wielder can create only base metals\
  \ and the duration is instantaneous."
