description: "This light-blue liquid is rich with antibodies and other chemicals that\
  \ block poison and disease and is usually contained in a tempered glass vial. Venomblock\
  \ can be applied to a weapon like a injury poison (save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round\
  \ for 6 rounds; cure 2 saves), but every time the affected creature fails its Fortitude\
  \ save, instead of dealing damage, venomblock suppresses the target's ability to\
  \ transmit one randomly selected poison or disease through its natural attacks until\
  \ the end of its next turn. This is a poison effect."
