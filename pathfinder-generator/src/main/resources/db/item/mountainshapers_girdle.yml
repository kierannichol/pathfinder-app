description: "This wide belt grants the wearer a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength.\
  \ In addition, the wearer can spend 1 ki point to use stone shape. When he uses\
  \ this ability, he can instead choose to shape metal, but he can affect only one-tenth\
  \ as much material. To shape a usable weapon out of metal or stone, the wearer must\
  \ succeed at a Craft (weapons) check. Items created in this way can never be of\
  \ masterwork quality."
