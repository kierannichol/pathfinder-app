description: "The beacon of true faith takes the form of an ornate torch made of electrum.\
  \ It holds an undying magical flame that requires no fuel or air, and in the hands\
  \ of most creatures it simply functions as an everburning torch. When held by a\
  \ divine spellcaster, an outsider with an alignment subtype, or a creature of strong\
  \ religious faith (GM's discretion, but usually requiring a feat or trait reflecting\
  \ this devotion), the beacon gains additional powers based on the bearer's alignment.\
  \ For example, a lawful good paladin gains access to the lawful and good powers,\
  \ but a neutral cleric gains access to no powers. All of these are command-word\
  \ activated.\nChaotic (violet flame): Word of chaos once per day on command.\nGood\
  \ (white flame): Allies within 30 feet of the beacon gain the benefits of protection\
  \ from evil and heroism.\nEvil (black flame): Bearer is constantly under the effect\
  \ of protection from good and may use harm twice per day.\nLawful (golden flame):\
  \ Dictum once per day on command."
destruction: "The beacon of true faith is destroyed if its bearer turns against the\
  \ worship of his deity to willingly embrace an opposite alignment."
