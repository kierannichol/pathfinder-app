description: "This rolled cloth resembles a rug or sheet. If the cloth is unfurled\
  \ on a flat horizontal surface and its command word spoken as a standard action,\
  \ its 10-foot-by-10-foot surface changes to match the coloration of the surrounding\
  \ ground. The next time a Small or larger creature walks over the portable pit,\
  \ it transforms into an extradimensional chasm at least 20 feet deep. Creatures\
  \ that trigger this effect and those adjacent to the portable pit when it transforms\
  \ must succeed a DC 20 Reflex save or fall into the pit, taking damage and suffering\
  \ additional effects (see below). The extradimensional pit persists for 1 minute\
  \ before collapsing (harmlessly expelling any trapped creatures into an adjacent\
  \ space) and becoming inert for 24 hours. If the command word is spoken a second\
  \ time, a portable pit transforms back into cloth and can be picked up, moved, or\
  \ stored.\nCreatures notice a concealed portable pit with a successful DC 20 Perception\
  \ check. Those trapped within can attempt to climb out; the Climb DC for the pit's\
  \ smooth walls is 20.\nAcid Pit: Woven from green and yellow fabric, a portable\
  \ acid pit drops victims 30 feet into a pool of boiling acid. The fall deals 2d6\
  \ points of damage and an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal damage, while the acid\
  \ deals 2d6 points of acid damage every round. The film of slick acid coating the\
  \ pit walls imposes a –10 circumstance penalty on Climb checks. Moderate conjuration;\
  \ CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, acid pit.\nBlunt Pit: Created in a spiraling weave\
  \ of blue and brown wool, a portable blunt pit drops the victim 20 feet onto hard-packed\
  \ earth, and the victim takes 2d6 points of damage from the fall. Faint conjuration;\
  \ CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, create pit.\nHungry Pit: Spun from blood-red silk\
  \ and studded with tiny teeth, a portable hungry pit transforms into a 40-foot-deep\
  \ pit, dealing 4d6 points of damage to any victims who fall into it. Its ravenous\
  \ walls then begin to grind like the stomach of a massive beast, dealing 4d6 points\
  \ of bludgeoning damage every round to any creature in the pit. The convulsing walls\
  \ impose a –15 circumstance penalty on Climb checks. Moderate conjuration; CL 9th;\
  \ Craft Wondrous Item, hungry pit.\nPersistent Pit: This pit drops victims 20 feet,\
  \ dealing 2d6 points of damage, and resumes its disguised form (expelling anyone\
  \ trapped within) after 1 minute like other portable pits, but doesn't become inert\
  \ once activated. A portable persistent pit continues to activate whenever a new\
  \ creature walks across it. Faint conjuration; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, create\
  \ pit. Spiked Pit: A portable spiked pit is woven from cotton fibers and thorns.\
  \ Once activated, it drops victims 20 feet onto a bed of spikes. Each victim takes\
  \ 2d6 points of damage from the fall, and lands on 1d4 spikes (Atk +10, 1d4+2 damage\
  \ each). Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, spiked pit."
