description: "This heavy, reinforced helmet can be used to make melee attacks. The\
  \ wearer may also use the helmet when attempting bull rush maneuvers, granting a\
  \ +2 circumstance bonus on the check, but after completing the maneuver (whether\
  \ successful or not), the wearer is staggered until the end of his next turn. In\
  \ addition, the helmet grants a +2 circumstance bonus to the wearer's AC against\
  \ critical hit confirmation rolls. A dwarven boulder helmet adds 20% to the wearer's\
  \ arcane spell failure chance. It occupies the head slot and is made of metal, not\
  \ stone, meaning that it can be crafted from unusual materials as a metal weapon.\
  \ A dwarven boulder helmet can be enchanted as a weapon (not as armor, despite providing\
  \ some protection)."
