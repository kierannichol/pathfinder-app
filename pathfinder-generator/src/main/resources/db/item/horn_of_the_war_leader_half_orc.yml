description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nA cord of leather attached to this large, hollow\
  \ animal horn allows it to hang from the neck, wrist, or belt. The bearer can blow\
  \ the horn as a standard action up to three times per day to create a blast of sound\
  \ that can be heard at a distance of up to 5 miles.\nIf the blower is a half-orc,\
  \ she can encode a message of up to 25 words (usually an order for deployed troops)\
  \ into the sound and designate any number of allies within range. The designated\
  \ allies automatically sense the blower's intention and learn the message."
