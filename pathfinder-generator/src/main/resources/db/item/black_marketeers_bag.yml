description: "This simple leather belt pouch can carry a small amount of ordinary\
  \ gear and objects, as a normal container of its kind. In addition to this ordinary\
  \ pouch, a black marketeer's bag contains three separate extradimensional spaces,\
  \ identical in size and function to the smaller side pouches in a handy haversack.\
  \ Each compartment requires a separate command word to access. A creature that knows\
  \ the command words can access each hidden compartment without disturbing the contents\
  \ of the bag itself. A creature opening the black marketeer's bag without first\
  \ speaking one of the command words sees only the ordinary contents. A black marketeer's\
  \ bag does not radiate magic (as per magic aura).\nWhen a creature attempts to remove\
  \ a black marketeer's bag from its bearer without permission, such as with a steal\
  \ combat maneuver or Sleight of Hand check, the would-be thief must succeed at a\
  \ DC 13 Will save or be compelled to instead place a random item it is holding in\
  \ its hand (if any) into the bag and then immediately forget the previous round,\
  \ as per memory lapse."
