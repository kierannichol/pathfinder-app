description: "Little distinguishes this bitter-smelling stick of incense from normal\
  \ incense until it is lit. In still air, the incense's smoke permeates a 40-foot-by-40-foot\
  \ area to a height of 20 feet. Within that area, incorporeal creatures take on a\
  \ measure of substance, such that they can no longer pass through objects and take\
  \ full damage from all attacks (even nonmagical ones). Incorporeal touch attacks\
  \ within this area resolve as melee attacks, but the incorporeal creatures add their\
  \ Charisma bonus on such attacks. Incorporeal creatures still lack cohesion and\
  \ mass. They retain the ability to fly as well as their immunity to combat maneuvers\
  \ and critical hits. They can pick up and manipulate physical objects as though\
  \ they had Strength scores equal to their Charisma scores, but they are still not\
  \ solid enough to wear equipment.\nModerate wind halves the area of incense of corporeality.\
  \ Strong wind disperses the incense, rendering it ineffective as long as the wind\
  \ continues. A single stick of incense of corporeality burns for 1 hour. If extinguished,\
  \ the remaining incense loses effectiveness."
