description: "This iron ring is set with a polished bloodstone. When created, a ring\
  \ of blood calling creates a link between a single mortal creature devoted to Asmodeus\
  \ and a specific devil with no more than 12 Hit Dice who willingly agrees to be\
  \ bound by the item. Once per day as a standard action, the ring's wearer can place\
  \ a drop of his own blood on the ring's gem (provoking attacks of opportunity) to\
  \ immediately call the devil linked to the ring to any space within 30 feet. While\
  \ the wearer does not control the devil, most wearers make agreements with the devil\
  \ linked to the ring for protection or some other service when called. The called\
  \ devil remains for 1 hour, or the wearer can dismiss the devil as a free action.\n\
  If the devil linked to the ring is killed, the ring crumbles to dust. If wearer\
  \ linked to the ring is killed, a new wearer can summon the linked devil, but can\
  \ compel the devil to perform only one service, as per planar binding, which severs\
  \ the devil's link to the ring when the task is completed unless the new wearer\
  \ makes his own deal with the devil, reestablishing the link between the wearer,\
  \ the devil, and the ring.\nNicolo Alazario's ring of blood calling is linked to\
  \ a bone devil named Xanthut. If Nicolo is killed, the PCs will need to make their\
  \ own arrangements with Xanthut to link themselves to the ring to call the devil."
