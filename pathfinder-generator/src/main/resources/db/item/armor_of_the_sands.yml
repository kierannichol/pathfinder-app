description: "This +2 leather armor is made of camel hide and has been worn smooth\
  \ as if blasted by sand. The wearer is protected from mundane extremes of cold and\
  \ heat (as the endure elements spell), and can see normally in sandstorms, dust\
  \ storms, and similar conditions. Once per day as a swift or immediate action, the\
  \ wearer can briefly turn to sand when hit by an attack but before damage is determined.\
  \ For the purposes of resolving the damage, the wearer is treated as an incorporeal\
  \ creature. Only a single attack is affected by each use of this ability."
