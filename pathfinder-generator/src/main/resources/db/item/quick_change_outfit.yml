description: "A quick-change outfit is actually two different sets of attire sewn\
  \ together, one inside the other. The quick-change outfit allows the wearer to rapidly\
  \ change from one outfit into another by reversing (pulling inside out) the entire\
  \ outfit. It takes a fullround action to slip out of the quick-change outfit, reverse\
  \ it, and put it back on. The two different outfits can appear to be of any variety,\
  \ such as a noble's outfit on one side and a monk's outfit on the other. The appearance\
  \ is only superficial, so the outfits do not grant any special bonuses (such as\
  \ a cold-weather outfit's benefits against exposure to cold). Anyone paying particular\
  \ attention to the outfit can notice discrepancies (such as odd seams and unusually\
  \ thick padding) with a successful DC 20 Perception check. The outfit's price is\
  \ equal to double the price of the more expensive of the two outfits it mimics."
