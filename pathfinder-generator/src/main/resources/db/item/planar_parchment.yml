description: "Resembling ordinary paper, planar parchment is used when negotiating\
  \ with outsiders via spells like planar ally or planar binding. Using the parchment\
  \ as part of negotiations grants the user a +2 bonus on her Charisma check to coerce\
  \ the called outsider if such a check is required.\nPlanar parchment offers some\
  \ autonomy to outsiders called for longer missions via planar ally. The use of planar\
  \ parchment increases the time for a planar ally from 1 day per caster level to\
  \ 1 week per caster level for long-term tasks (without increasing the cost of the\
  \ payment the outsider requires). An outsider that has its term of service increased\
  \ in this way isn't bound to the plane to which it was called. After negotiations\
  \ are complete, it can return to its home plane, but is still required to perform\
  \ the services it agreed to complete.\nRegardless of whether the outsider was called\
  \ via planar ally or planar binding magic, the outsider maintains a connection with\
  \ the planar parchment for the duration of its service. Any writings added to the\
  \ parchment are instantly transmitted to the bound outsider, as a sending spell\
  \ (with no chance of failure if the outsider is on another plane). These words disappear\
  \ from the parchment 1 hour after being inscribed.\nFinally, once an outsider is\
  \ bound to service with a planar parchment, the parchment is inscribed with script\
  \ visible only to the creature completing the negotiation, or via true seeing. Reading\
  \ this script is a full-round action, akin to reading a scroll. Reading this aloud\
  \ immediately summons the bound outsider to the location of the scroll.\nA planar\
  \ parchment can be used for only one negotiation, and then turns into a nonmagical\
  \ piece of parchment."
