description: "The runelords of Thassilon had a long tradition of placing power into\
  \ pools, liquefying and containing raw magic to harness for a multitude of goals.\
  \ Their runewells are perhaps the most notorious of these artifacts, though others,\
  \ like the Runeforge, exist. But they learned this technique from the artifacts\
  \ of those who preceded them. The Everdawn Pool is one such artifact. Unlike magical\
  \ pools created by the runelords, it needs no well as a container—it is a 30-foot-diameter\
  \ sphere of roiling, churning blood in which brief glimpses of limbs and faces (not\
  \ all of them humanoid) constantly form and dissolve.\nRecords of where Sorshen\
  \ first discovered the Everdawn Pool have been lost, if indeed they ever existed\
  \ in the first place, along with any hint of who or what may have created this potent\
  \ font of magical power (although certain obscure sources hint at Leng and the creatures\
  \ known as the scarlet walkers that dwell in that nightmare realm). What seems certain\
  \ is that she—and later, other runelords—were able to reverse engineer some of the\
  \ Everdawn Pool's properties and build pools of power of their own. In many cases,\
  \ these pools even surpassed the Everdawn Pool. Certainly, the power of Karzoug's\
  \ Runewell of Greed exceeds that of the Everdawn Pool, as would, one would guess,\
  \ the runewells created by those more powerful than him (Xanderghul, Alaznist, and\
  \ Sorshen). Yet the Everdawn Pool remains the first. It provided a legacy that helped\
  \ shape all of Thassilon, and was a significant part of what gave Sorshen the boost\
  \ in power to claim and keep the role of Runelord of Lust for the duration of that\
  \ ancient empire.\nThe Everdawn Pool requires specially prepared blood to function.\
  \ A single drop of blood and one 12-hour ritual performed by any character capable\
  \ of casting 9th-level spells who succeeds at a DC 30 Spellcraft check is enough\
  \ to awaken the pool and grant it 1 charge. Additional charges can be stored in\
  \ the Everdawn Pool by performing this ritual multiple times, but only one such\
  \ ritual can be performed at any one time (effectively limiting the Everdawn Pool's\
  \ capacity to be recharged to a rate of no more than 2 charges per day). The pool\
  \ can store up to 25 charges at a time, but when the PCs start Part 3 of \"Crown\
  \ of Fangs,\" Queen Ileosa has used most of what she stored within and the Everdawn\
  \ Pool has only 10 charges stored within it.\nA creature that spends 10 minutes\
  \ bathing in the blood of the Everdawn Pool becomes infused with its power for 1\
  \ week, during which time the creature is immune to bleed effects and modifies its\
  \ total hit points with its Charisma modifier rather than its Constitution modifier.\
  \ While immersed, a creature has no need to eat, drink, or breathe, and can see\
  \ into every chamber of the Sunken Queen as if using an unlimited number of clairaudience/clairvoyance\
  \ sensors. The creature can still observe only one location at a time, but can switch\
  \ locations as a move action. As a side effect, a creature that has been so infused\
  \ can use teleport effects within the Sunken Queen without restriction. The Everdawn\
  \ Pool must have at least 1 charge stored to grant these boons to those that bathe\
  \ within its waters, but granting these boons does not deplete its charges.\nOnce\
  \ a creature is infused with the Everdawn Pool's power, it can spend the pool's\
  \ charges to use the following abilities, as long as the creature is fully immersed\
  \ in the pool at the time.\nBlood Simulacrum: A creature infused with the Everdawn\
  \ Pool's power can spend 2 of the pool's charges to create a blood simulacrum of\
  \ itself. This creation takes 12 hours to complete and functions the same as that\
  \ created by the spell simulacrum, save that the simulacrum's creator can choose\
  \ at the time of creation to grant a blood simulacrum the redirection ability. Up\
  \ to seven blood simulacra can exist at any one time, but only one can have the\
  \ redirection ability at a time.\nRedirection (Su) As long as this simulacrum lives,\
  \ any divination spell that attempts to locate or otherwise target the real creature\
  \ is instead redirected to target this simulacrum. The caster of the divination\
  \ spell has a small chance to notice the redirection with a successful DC 40 Spellcraft\
  \ check as the divination spell is cast, but even if the redirection is noted, it\
  \ remains impossible to tell where the effect was redirected from. This effect also\
  \ affects long-distance spells like demand, dream, nightmare, and sending, but not\
  \ mental communication such as telepathy.\nCreate Life: Once per day, a creature\
  \ can use the Everdawn Pool to manifest a living creature to serve as a loyal minion—\
  the type of creature created is determined by the combined power of the user's soul\
  \ and personality, but as a general rule the pool creates a minion whose CR is 3\
  \ lower than the creator's CR. In Ileosa's case, life created using this power manifests\
  \ as a taniniver. Creatures created by other NPCs (or even PCs) should be selected\
  \ and customized as needed by the GM to represent the source. Only one life can\
  \ be created by the Everdawn Pool at a time, and as long as the created life lives,\
  \ it remains loyal to its creator unless it's subjected to mind control effects.\
  \ Creating life costs 5 charges but requires only a standard action.\nEternal Youth:\
  \ The ritual to gain eternal youth requires blood samples from numerous mortals\
  \ to be mixed into the Everdawn Pool. Once this step is completed, a creature must\
  \ immerse itself in the Everdawn Pool, soaking in the pool's power. At the end of\
  \ each day, the pool expends 1 charge. Once the user has spent 100 charges in this\
  \ manner, and as long as all 100 charges were spent within the span of a single\
  \ year, all of those creatures that provided blood samples drop dead, and for each\
  \ donor that dies, the user ceases to age for 1 year. Ileosa has infused the Everdawn\
  \ Pool with blood harvested from thousands of Korvosans, so if she completes this\
  \ ritual, she'll remain young for thousands of years—more than enough time to repeat\
  \ the ritual as she needs to extend her effective immortality. This adventure assumes\
  \ that she is only 10 days (and thus 10 charges) away from completing her ritual\
  \ when the PCs begin Part 3 of Chapter 6—see page 388 for more details. Note that\
  \ using this function of the Everdawn Pool is an evil act and may have alignment\
  \ repercussions for the user.\nManifest Magic: At a cost of 20 charges, a creature\
  \ can activate the Everdawn Pool as a standard action to cast wish, but only in\
  \ that spell's capacity to duplicate an existing spell. Sorshen often used this\
  \ ability to cast necromancy or transmutation spells, magic her specialization normally\
  \ forbade her from using. The pool currently doesn't have enough charges remaining\
  \ for Ileosa to use this ability."
destruction: "To destroy the Everdawn Pool, fresh samples of blood drawn from a titan,\
  \ a demon lord, an infernal duke, an empyreal lord, and a mythic vampire must be\
  \ introduced into the pool simultaneously (in the same round). Once these five blood\
  \ samples have been added to the pool, a mortal creature that has lived at least\
  \ 10 times as long as its natural lifespan would normally allow must enter the pool\
  \ and use the pool's ability to manifest magic to cast plane shift, moving itself\
  \ and the pool to the Negative Energy Plane. The Everdawn Pool can attempt to save\
  \ against this effect (it has a total Will save bonus of +18 against this specific\
  \ effect). If it resists, the Everdawn Pool absorbs the mortal, effectively destroying\
  \ the mortal as if via a sphere of annihilation; in this event, further attempts\
  \ to destroy the pool require new samples of blood drawn from different creatures\
  \ than those whose blood was used for the previous attempt. If the Everdawn Pool\
  \ is successfully plane shifted to the Negative Energy Plane, the energies of that\
  \ plane swiftly destroy the pool and deal 20d20 points of negative energy damage\
  \ to the creature that transported the pool in the first place (Fortitude DC 30\
  \ half)."
