description: "This item looks like and functions as a lucky horseshoe. In addition,\
  \ if the horseshoe is placed prominently over the entrance of a building and left\
  \ there for a period of at least 8 hours, it provides good luck to all those who\
  \ spend time within that building. In order to gain this benefit, a character must\
  \ spend at least 8 consecutive hours within the building; the benefit lasts for\
  \ 24 hours. A single communal lucky horseshoe can provide its benefit to any number\
  \ of creatures per day, but each creature can gain the benefits of only one lucky\
  \ horseshoe at a time. Once a creature invokes the lucky horseshoe's ability, she\
  \ can't benefit from another lucky horseshoe for 24 hours, though time she spends\
  \ inside the building during that interval counts toward the 8 consecutive hours\
  \ required to gain the communal lucky horseshoe's benefit for the next day."
