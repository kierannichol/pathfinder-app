description: "The surface of this silver ring never tarnishes, but when an evil creature\
  \ is wearing it, its luster diminishes. Whenever the wearer takes the total defense\
  \ action, he can activate the ring, creating a magic circle against evil effect\
  \ centered on him. This effect lasts 10 rounds per day, though the rounds don't\
  \ need to be spent consecutively. Once activated, the effect expends rounds until\
  \ the user ends it as a move action or the rounds run out.\ns a standard action\
  \ while the magic circle is active, the wearer can release the protective circle's\
  \ energy as a violent blast. This functions as holy smite centered on the wearer,\
  \ but the wearer can exclude a 10-foot-radius area from the center of the affected\
  \ area. Releasing the energy expends all the ring's remaining rounds and can be\
  \ done only if at least 5 rounds remain.\nThe ring's power renews each day at dawn."
