description: "This gold-edged +2 blinding heavy steel shield is impossibly light and\
  \ handy despite its size. It has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure\
  \ chance, and it allows the wielder to use feather fall on himself once per day.\
  \ A creature wearing celestial armor while wielding a celestial shield may command\
  \ the armor to provide overland flight rather than fly once per day."
