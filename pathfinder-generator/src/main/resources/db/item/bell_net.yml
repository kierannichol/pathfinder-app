description: "Copper bells hang at each the corners of this 5-foot-by-5- foot wire\
  \ net. A bell net is designed to blanket gear while you sleep, hunt, cook, or otherwise\
  \ can't give it your full attention, rasing an alarm if your possessions are disturbed.\
  \ Creatures attempting to access gear protected by a bell net must succeed at a\
  \ DC 25 Sleight of Hand check to avoid chiming the bells. Hearing the chiming bells\
  \ of a bell net requires a DC 0 Perception check. Because the many bells chime when\
  \ you move, traveling with a bell net gives you a â€“2 penalty on Stealth checks."
