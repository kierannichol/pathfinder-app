description: "This black iron lantern and chain functions as a +1 heavy flail. The\
  \ lantern burns with a cold blue-green flame that sheds light as per a hooded lantern.\
  \ On command, the wielder can reduce the light to a 5-foot radius of dim light or\
  \ restore it to full brightness.\nOnce per day, when the wielder hits a creature\
  \ with the lantern, she can deal an additional 2d6 points of negative energy damage\
  \ as a swift action. If she does so, she gains a number of temporary hit points\
  \ equal to the damage she dealt that last for 1 hour.\nA creature reduced to 0 hit\
  \ points or fewer by the lantern must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or die.\
  \ This is a death effect. For 24 hours after a creature is killed this way, the\
  \ lantern's flame holds an echo of the creature's soul. A speak with dead spell\
  \ cast on the flame yields information as if it were the creature's corpse. The\
  \ flame can hold the echo of only one creature's soul; if the lantern kills another\
  \ creature, a new echo replaces the previous one."
