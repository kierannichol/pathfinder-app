description: "This red and orange silk robe gives viewers the impression of a flame\
  \ roiling just below the fabric's slick surface. The robe grants the wearer fire\
  \ resistance 5 and increases the wearer's caster level for all spells with the fire\
  \ descriptor by +1. Once per day on command, the wearer of the robe can emit a 20-foot-radius\
  \ burst of fire. Creatures other than the wearer within the area take 2d6 points\
  \ of fire damage (Reflex DC 16 half)."
