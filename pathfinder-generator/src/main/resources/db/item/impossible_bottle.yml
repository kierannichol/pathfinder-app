description: "An intricately detailed miniature sailing ship sits inside this clear\
  \ glass bottle. When taken aboard an undamaged sailing vessel at sea, the model\
  \ automatically reconfigures to become a perfect replica of the new ship. It takes\
  \ 24 hours for the model to attune to the ship.\nA ship attuned to an impossible\
  \ bottle takes half damage from all attacks that deal damage. The model ship in\
  \ the impossible bottle absorbs the remaining damage, registering holes in its hull,\
  \ rips in its sails, and scorch marks from fire. Once the attuned ship gains the\
  \ broken condition, however, the impossible bottle ceases its protection, and any\
  \ further attacks on the attuned ship deal full damage. If the attuned ship gains\
  \ the sinking condition or is destroyed, the impossible bottle shatters and is permanently\
  \ destroyed. If an impossible bottle was attuned to a damaged ship, once that ship\
  \ has been fully repaired, the impossible bottle re-attunes itself over 24 hours\
  \ and thereafter resumes its protection. An impossible bottle removed from its attuned\
  \ ship ceases its protection, and must be re-attuned over 24 hours if brought back\
  \ on board. If the bottle is shattered while it is attuned to a ship, the impossible\
  \ bottle is destroyed and the attuned ship immediately takes 150 points of damage.\n\
  Lastly, an impossible bottle can be used to repair an unattuned ship. As long as\
  \ the bottle still functions, its owner can christen a vessel by smashing the impossible\
  \ bottle against the ship's prow, releasing a wave of restorative magic that immediately\
  \ repairs up to 150 points of damage to the vessel."
