description: "This tiny bundle of sacred herbs and bones supposedly attracts the attention\
  \ of helpful battle-spirits. By crushing the pouch as a standard action, an orc\
  \ (or a creature from a suitably warlike culture) gains 1d4+1 temporary hit points.\
  \ These temporary hit points go away after 10 minutes. A creature can only benefit\
  \ from 1 spirit pouch at a time. Once used, the spirit pouch is destroyed."
