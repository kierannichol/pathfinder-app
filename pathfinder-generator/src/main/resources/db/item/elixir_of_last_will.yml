description: "If a character drinks this gray liquid, the next time (within 24 hours)\
  \ he falls below 0 hit points, he exhales a sliver of his consciousness—whether\
  \ he is alive or dead. If a character drinks multiple elixirs in a 24-hour period,\
  \ only one is effective.\nAs an immediate action, the sliver can guide the action\
  \ of one ally within 30 feet of the drinker's body. This guidance gives a +2 luck\
  \ bonus on that ally's next attack roll, to the ally's AC against the next attack\
  \ made against her, or on the ally's next skill check. The drinker decides the type\
  \ of bonus and the ally. The bonus must be used within 1 round."
