description: "You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You\
  \ can use a composite longbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a\
  \ particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier\
  \ to use it with proficiency). If your Strength modifier is less than the strength\
  \ rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a â€“2 penalty\
  \ on attacks with it. The default composite longbow requires a Strength modifier\
  \ of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite longbow can be made with\
  \ a high strength rating to take advantage of an aboveaverage Strength score; this\
  \ feature allows you to add your Strength modifier on damage rolls, up to the maximum\
  \ bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds\
  \ 100 gp to its cost. If you have a negative modifier due to low Strength, apply\
  \ it to damage rolls when you use a composite longbow. A composite longbow fires\
  \ arrows.\nFor the purposes of Weapon Proficiency and similar feats, a composite\
  \ longbow is treated as if it were a longbow."
