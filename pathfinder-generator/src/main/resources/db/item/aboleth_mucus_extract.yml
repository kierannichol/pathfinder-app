description: "This jar contains 6 ounces of alchemically preserved aboleth mucus.\
  \ When 1 ounce of the extract is applied to a living creature's mouth, nose, and\
  \ throat (a full-round action), the target loses its ability to breathe air but\
  \ gains the ability to breathe water for 1 hour. An unwilling target can attempt\
  \ a DC 14 Fortitude save to negate the effect. If additional doses are applied to\
  \ the same creature, the duration of the effect extends by 1 hour for each ounce\
  \ used, to a maximum of 3 hours."
