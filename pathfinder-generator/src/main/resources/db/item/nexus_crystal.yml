description: "These cloudy, white crystals are believed to form spontaneously— though\
  \ extremely infrequently— when a region of planar chaos drifts near a lawfully oriented\
  \ one. When carried by a non-mythic creature, a nexus crystal bestows the ability\
  \ to survive the conditions of a hostile plane as though the bearer were native\
  \ to that plane. For example, the crystal would give immunity to the fires of the\
  \ Plane of Fire and the life-draining radiation of the Negative Energy Plane. Any\
  \ adaptation given protects only against the hazards of the plane itself, not the\
  \ creatures within it—fire attacks from creatures on the Plane of Fire are still\
  \ hazardous to the bearer. The crystal doesn't provide protection against extreme\
  \ conditions not normally experienced by inhabitants of the given plane, such as\
  \ the vacuum of space on the Material Plane.\nWhen carried by a mythic creature,\
  \ a nexus crystal has the following additional powers."
destruction: "A nexus crystal can be destroyed by invoking its plane shift power as\
  \ the bearer steps through a gate. Doing so destroys the crystal and the gate, and\
  \ the resulting magical explosion causes 18d10 points of damage to creatures within\
  \ a 2-mile-radius burst of either side of the gate (Reflex DC 27 for half damage).\
  \ Permanent gates between planes could potentially be destroyed in this fashion,\
  \ at the GM's discretion."
