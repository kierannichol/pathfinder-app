  \ is heated in a fire, it can be used to brand a creature or object. Anytime after\
  \ the branding, a creature can hold the branding iron of tracking and know the direction\
  \ to the nearest brand, as if using locate object for branded objects or locate\
  \ creature for branded creatures. The branding iron of tracking only tracks the\
  \ brand itself, so cutting or scraping off the brand can fool the item."
