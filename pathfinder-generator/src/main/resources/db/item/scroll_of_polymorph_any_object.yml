name: "Scroll of Polymorph Any Object"
description: "This spell functions like greater polymorph, except that it changes\
  \ one object or creature into another. You can use this spell to transform all manner\
  \ of objects and creatures into new forms--you aren't limited to transforming a\
  \ living creature into another living form. The duration of the spell depends on\
  \ how radical a change is made from the original state to its transmuted state.\
  \ The duration is determined by using the following guidelines."
