description: "This elegant headband has an intricately carved crystal located in its\
  \ center. The crystal shimmers with arcane energy. The wearer can remove or replace\
  \ this crystal as a swift action. As a standard action, the wearer can attempt to\
  \ force the gem onto a construct's body with a touch attack that provokes an attack\
  \ of opportunity. Once the crystal is attached to a construct, the construct must\
  \ succeed at a DC 23 Will save or become dominated by the crystal and follow the\
  \ orders of whomever is wearing the headband. The wearer of the headband can assume\
  \ direct control of the construct as a full-round action, controlling all of the\
  \ construct's actions as possession. The wearer can end this control at any time\
  \ as a free action. The wearer can remove the crystal from a construct as a standard\
  \ action, allowing the wearer to use the crystal on a different construct and returning\
  \ control of the construct to its original master. If the construct is destroyed\
  \ while the crystal is attached, there is a 10% chance that the crystal is destroyed\
  \ along with the construct."
