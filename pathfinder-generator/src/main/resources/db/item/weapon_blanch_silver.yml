description: "These silver, alchemical powders have a gritty consistency, appearing\
  \ at first glance to be simple metal shavings. When poured on a weapon and placed\
  \ over a hot flame for a full round, however, they melt and form a temporary coating\
  \ on the weapon. The blanching gives the weapon the ability to bypass one kind of\
  \ material-based damage reduction, such as adamantine, cold iron, or silver. The\
  \ blanching remains effective until you make a successful attack with the weapon.\
  \ Each dose of blanching can coat one weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. Only\
  \ one kind of weapon blanch can be on a weapon at one time, though a weapon made\
  \ of one special material (such as adamantine) can have a different material blanch\
  \ (such as silver), and counts as both materials for the first successful hit."
