description: "This strange device appears to be a twisted rod crafted of some unknown\
  \ alloy of metal and crystal. The device requires two hands to use. When activated,\
  \ the mist projector discharges a 60-foot cone of supercooled mist. This functions\
  \ as cone of cold, dealing 10d6 points of cold damage to all creatures in the area\
  \ (DC 17 Reflex save for half). Once fired, a cloud of mist persists in the area\
  \ of effect for 1d10 minutes or until dispersed, functioning as a fog cloud. A mi-go\
  \ mist projector normally contains 27 charges. A mist projector is impossible to\
  \ recharge without mi-go technology."
