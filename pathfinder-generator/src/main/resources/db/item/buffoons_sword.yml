description: "This blade seems to be and behaves in all ways as a sword of subtlety\
  \ until actually used in combat. Once used in combat, it imposes a â€“10 penalty on\
  \ all Stealth checks made by its wielder. It also makes it nearly impossible for\
  \ the owner to tell a lie or engage in any other sort of subterfuge. Each time he\
  \ does so, he must make a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid blurting out the truth\
  \ or taking some other involuntary action that spoils his attempted ruse. Only curse-ending\
  \ magic can rid the wielder of the sword once its curse activates."
