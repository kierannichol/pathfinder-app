description: "This shadowy, waterproof tome is 12 inches tall, 8 inches wide, and\
  \ 1 inch thick. When viewed in dim, normal, or bright light, the tome's 1,000 ebon\
  \ pages are blank and any new writing immediately fades from sight, as if erase\
  \ had been cast upon the page. When viewed in darkness, however, each page becomes\
  \ outlined with pale, silvery light and anything then written in the tome is recorded\
  \ in similar, silvery light. Writings within the tome are protected as per nondetection.\
  \ A tome of dissolution can be used as a formula book or a spellbook; if so, extracts\
  \ and spells can only be prepared from the tome when viewed in darkness. Necromancy\
  \ spells, spells of the shadow subschool, and spells with the darkness or shadow\
  \ descriptor take half as many pages when copied into a tome of dissolution as they\
  \ would in a normal spellbook or formula book."
