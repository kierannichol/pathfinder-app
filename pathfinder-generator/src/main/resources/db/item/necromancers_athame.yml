description: "This pallid length of sharpened thighbone is carved into the shape of\
  \ a dagger, but with tiny holes bored into it at equal intervals, almost like a\
  \ flute. A necromancer who selects this athame as his bonded object can use it to\
  \ spontaneously convert any prepared wizard necromancy spell into any other wizard\
  \ necromancy spell he knows; the desired spell must be of the same level or lower\
  \ than the prepared spell."
