description: "These rugged stone armbands slip on easily and swiftly adjust to a size\
  \ appropriate for the wearer. Once per day, the wearer can create a wall of stone\
  \ up to 2 inches thick and 45 feet long (or 90 feet long, if the thickness is reduced\
  \ to 1 inch). For the purpose of this effect, the bracelets of stone count as a\
  \ stone surface that the wall of stone can merge with, and they magically provide\
  \ the wearer the strength necessary to support any wall of stone so created. Thus,\
  \ the wearer can create a bridge or wall in nearly any location as long as he is\
  \ standing adjacent to a point where the bracelets can connect to it. If the bracelets\
  \ are used this way, the wearer can't move from this space and is considered flat-footed\
  \ during this time, but may end the effect as an immediate action (thus destroying\
  \ the wall). If either bracelet is taken off or a portion of the wall is breached\
  \ or destroyed, this effect immediately ends and the wall of stone crumbles to dust."
