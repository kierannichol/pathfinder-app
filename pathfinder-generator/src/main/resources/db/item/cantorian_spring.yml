description: "This long, straight staff bears a rough crystal at the top, wrapped\
  \ in wire extending to the base. When the staff moves, something liquid shifts within\
  \ the crystal. The staff tends to right itself if left alone, balancing easily on\
  \ its lower end, easily moved or toppled but quickly returning to its upright position\
  \ if left undisturbed for a few minutes. Though the creator of this item is uncertain,\
  \ most believe it has some ties to Canzoriant, a powerful devil whose cult gained\
  \ some renown by elves before the Age of Darkness (and who was crushed by Asmodeus\
  \ in a failed coup). Canzoriant had an interest in conquest and breeding stronger\
  \ slaves, and it is likely he played a role in its most famous work—the hobgoblin.\n\
  Ages ago, a group of elven adventurers located a strange colony where powerful mutated\
  \ goblins were being bred into a great army that would wash over the elven cities.\
  \ These new goblins were smarter, larger, and stronger than regular goblins, more\
  \ disciplined, and fearsome, conditioned to hate elves with stories of horror and\
  \ rumors that the elves reciprocated their hate and wanted the colonies razed. Alert\
  \ to the hobgoblin threat, the elves located the artifact at the center of the colony\
  \ and stole it; when the owners caught up to the elves, they battled, and in the\
  \ confusion the artifact was lost. Since that time the hobgoblins have been their\
  \ own masters and the names of the being or beings who thought up their creation\
  \ have been lost. Over the centuries the staff has appeared, usually in the hands\
  \ of someone wanting to create a new slave race (such as the supposedly-extinct\
  \ zhug, born of hafling stock) or to inflict a particularly cruel punishment on\
  \ an enemy (such as when Bandit King Anfax used it to transform his enemy's army\
  \ into catfish in the middle of a hot summer battle), and the Three Generations\
  \ War in the River Kingdoms resulted in it changing hands at least four times between\
  \ opposing parties.\nThe staff initially appears to be a fully-charged staff of\
  \ transmutation. With the proper command word, once per day you can use it to cast\
  \ a mass polymorph or baleful polymorph, though there reputedly is a very small\
  \ chance that the staff will transform you as well. You can use it to cast bear's\
  \ endurance, bull's strength, cat's grace, eagle's splendor, fox's cunning, or owl's\
  \ wisdom up to 10 times per day in any combination, or use five of the daily \"\
  charges\" of this power to cast a mass version of any of those spells.\nIf left\
  \ to balance itself, you can tap its crystal once and speak a command word to cause\
  \ it to slowly screw itself into the earth until only the crystal is visible. A\
  \ few minutes later water begins to bubble up from the earth, forming a pool or\
  \ spring if the shape of the ground permits it. This water is pure and clean and\
  \ replenishes itself at a rate of one gallon per minute. Through an attunement process\
  \ that takes several days of active concentration (similar to crafting a magic item)\
  \ you can give the spring magical powers so that any who drink from it will be permanently\
  \ affected, though there are usually slight side effects (for example, if the water\
  \ enhances Dexterity, a drinker may gain cat-like features).\nMany stories of magical\
  \ fountains or springs crystal rests at the bottom and is obscured by plants or\
  \ sediment, and it is possible that several variant races or subraces owe their\
  \ existence to this artifact. The power of the spring tends to drift over time,\
  \ requiring attention at least one day out of every month. Furthermore, the staff\
  \ has been known to create a spring without its owner commanding it to do so. If\
  \ the staff is removed from the spring, the water usually loses its magical powers\
  \ and eventually drains away, though the Bouldertop Oasis in northern Osirion has\
  \ no natural explanation and has a faint magical aura reminiscent of the Cantorian\
  \ Spring."
