description: "A burner is a metal or ceramic cylinder, open at the top and perforated\
  \ with air holes along the sides, often with sliding vents to open or close these\
  \ apertures as the fire inside requires. A burner is used to burn fuel pellets at\
  \ night without giving off light that would reveal the user's position to unfriendly\
  \ eyes in the wide, empty desert lands. In places where charcoal is a popular fuel,\
  \ burners are made of heavier-gauge metal. Lit coals can be banked with ashes and\
  \ kept hot, either for later ignition or simply so the burner can serve as an improvised\
  \ radiant heater."
