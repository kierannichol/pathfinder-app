description: "This tiny dagger has a black leather hilt and a gold-inlaid pattern\
  \ of stripes and sharp angles on its steel blade. It can transform into a delicate\
  \ necklace or ornate finger-ring at the wearer's command. The wearer gains a +3\
  \ competence bonus on Perception checks while the item is carried or worn. The wearer\
  \ can also use it to cast ghost sound once per day.\nIf Calistria is the wearer's\
  \ patron, once per day the wearer may speak a command word to use fox's cunning.\
  \ As a standard action, the wearer can prick her finger with the dagger and swear\
  \ an oath on her own blood to avenge herself against a particular named creature;\
  \ the wearer gains a +1 competence bonus on her next attack roll within 1 minute\
  \ against that creature. Speaking a new vengeance-oath removes the old one, whether\
  \ or not the wearer has achieved her vengeance."
