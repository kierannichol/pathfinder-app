description: "This macabre pin attaches to one's cloak. Tar-Baphon is said to have\
  \ gifted these brooches to highly favored but still untrusted minions. When worn,\
  \ a tyrant's mark provides a +3 deflection bonus to AC and a +3 resistance bonus\
  \ on saving throws. As a free action after failing a saving throw, the wearer can\
  \ expend one use of mythic power to reduce any damage resulting from the failed\
  \ save by half.\nWhen a tyrant's mark is created, it is keyed to a matching black\
  \ diamond worth no less than 1,000 gp. The creator of a tyrant's mark can expend\
  \ two uses of mythic power at any distance to use scrying (as the spell) on the\
  \ pin's wearer while gazing through the black diamond, with the pin acting as the\
  \ scrying sensor. The wearer of the tyrant's mark takes a –10 penalty on the Will\
  \ save against the scrying effect, as though the maker had possession of a portion\
  \ of the wearer's body."
