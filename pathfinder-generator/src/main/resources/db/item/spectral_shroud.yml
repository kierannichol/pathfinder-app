description: "This thin, bleached cloth covers the wearer's entire torso. Some also\
  \ cover the wearer's face, but don't interfere with the wearer's vision. The morbid\
  \ burial shroud grants the wearer some affinity with the spectral dead. The wearer\
  \ can discern invisible or ethereal creatures as though using see invisibility.\
  \ Once per day, the wearer can become incorporeal for 10 rounds and gain a fly speed\
  \ equal to half his base speed with perfect maneuverability. The wearer can't attack\
  \ while incorporeal, but can dismiss the effect as a move action."
