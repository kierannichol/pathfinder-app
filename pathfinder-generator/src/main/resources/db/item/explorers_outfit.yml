  \ includes sturdy boots, leather breeches or a skirt, a belt, a shirt (perhaps with\
  \ a vest or jacket), gloves, and a cloak. Rather than a leather skirt, a leather\
  \ overtunic may be worn over a cloth skirt. The clothes have plenty of pockets (especially\
  \ the cloak). The outfit also includes any extra accessories you might need, such\
  \ as a scarf or a wide-brimmed hat."
