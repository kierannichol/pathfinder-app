description: "This silver chalice has stylized representations of rearing unicorns\
  \ serving as handles. The bearer of the chalice can expel toxins from a poisoned\
  \ creature's body, causing the target to weep the poison from its eyes and allowing\
  \ the bearer to collect it in the chalice. This functions as neutralize poison on\
  \ the target, eliminating that poison. If the target is immune to poison or the\
  \ poison has run its course, the chalice has no effect. If the poison normally has\
  \ a solid or liquid form, it collects as a single dose of the poison in the cup\
  \ (regardless of how many times the target was poisoned). The collected poison has\
  \ all the normal effects of the original poison, except its DC is 4 lower, and can\
  \ be stored in another container or used like any other poison. The chalice can\
  \ be used once per day."
