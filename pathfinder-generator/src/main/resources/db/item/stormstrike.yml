description: "This +1 trident has a green-blue metal head, a pole made of driftwood,\
  \ and a sheaf of white human hair tied at the joint. The wielder of stormstrike\
  \ can speak one command word to use it as a frost weapon (which turns its tines\
  \ blue-white), or a second command word to use it as a shock weapon (which turns\
  \ its tines sea-green). Activating one of these abilities deactivates the other."
