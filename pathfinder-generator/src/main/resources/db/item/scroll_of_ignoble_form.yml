  \ target loses its darkvision, light blindness, and light sensitivity traits, if\
  \ it normally has them. The target gains lowlight vision; a +3 racial bonus on a\
  \ single Craft, Knowledge, Perform, or Profession skill of its choice; and both\
  \ a +4 bonus on Bluff checks and a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to pass itself off\
  \ as a half-elf."
