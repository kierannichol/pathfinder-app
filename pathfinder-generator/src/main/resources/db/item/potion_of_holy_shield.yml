name: "Potion of Holy Shield"
description: "You gain the ability to magically project the defense of your shield\
  \ to protect another creature at a distance. As a swift action, you designate one\
  \ target within 30 feet. The target gains your shield's shield bonus and enhancement\
  \ bonus to Armor Class until your next turn; you gain no benefit from the shield's\
  \ shield bonus or enhancement bonus while using this spell and cannot use any of\
  \ the shield's other properties or abilities (such as magical abilities, making\
  \ a shield bash, or providing cover with a tower shield). As a swift action, you\
  \ may move the protection to another target (including yourself); if you move the\
  \ protection to yourself, you may use any of the shield's properties or abilities\
  \ as normal. If the shielded creature exceeds the 30-foot range, your shield's protection\
  \ automatically reverts to you. Any circumstance that would make you lose your shield\
  \ bonus (such as an enemy breaking the shield, you dropping the shield, or you becoming\
  \ helpless or unconscious) means the protected creature loses the shield's benefit."
