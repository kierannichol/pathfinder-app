description: "This red marble altar is carved in the shape of two legless humans conjoined\
  \ at the waist, their heads facing opposite directions. The figure's four arms are\
  \ bent at the elbow, supporting the altar like the legs of a table would. Each face\
  \ is featureless save for a gaping maw, and hollow moans occasionally escape from\
  \ their taut, perpetually blood-stained marble lips.\nWhenever a creature within\
  \ 40 feet of the altar takes piercing or slashing damage, the altar's foul magic\
  \ invades the wound and forces it to stay open, automatically dealing 1d4 points\
  \ of bleed damage. This bleed damage doesn't stack with any bleed damage the attack\
  \ would normally deal, nor does it stack with itself.\nUnholy magic beckons spilled\
  \ blood to crawl toward the altar. There is a shallow, round indentation on the\
  \ altar; if a silver cup worth 25 gp is placed within, crimson nectar trickles into\
  \ the cup each time a creature within 40 feet takes bleed damage. The cup is filled\
  \ to the brim once 30 points of bleed damage have been dealt within 40 feet of the\
  \ altar. As a standard action, a creature can drink the nectar to regain 5d6 hit\
  \ points. The nectar heals both living and undead creatures. The nectar loses its\
  \ potency and turns into clotted blood if it is not consumed within 1 round of the\
  \ cup being removed from the altar. The altar can produce 3 full cups of healing\
  \ nectar per day."
