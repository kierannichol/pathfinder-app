description: "This framework of interlocking metal arms is used to duplicate drawings,\
  \ allowing enlarging (up to twice the original size) or shrinking (down to half\
  \ the original size) of the copy in the process. The pantograph is anchored at one\
  \ end, then fitted with a stylus and a writing implement such as chalk, an ink pen,\
  \ or a pencil. As the stylus is traced over the drawing or other item to be duplicated,\
  \ the pantograph reproduces the motions, creating a copy. While handy for making\
  \ quick, accurate copies of ancient carvings, runes, and drawings, a pantograph\
  \ is unable to produce a convincing forgery or duplicate magical writings such as\
  \ scrolls. More elaborate and expensive pantographs allow even larger or smaller\
  \ copies to be made, or multiple copies to be made at the same time."
