description: "Not every adventurer returns to the tavern, and Cayden's Hall has seen\
  \ many a drink raised in remembrance of a fallen comrade. A parting glass, engraved\
  \ with the names of adventuring companies and their honored dead, is a rare gift\
  \ given by senior priests of Cayden Cailean's church to survivors of quests that\
  \ fit with the church's ideals but demanded a high cost.\nOnce per day when used\
  \ in a toast with at least one other creature, a single creature drinking from a\
  \ parting glass gains a +5 morale bonus on the next saving throw it attempts within\
  \ 24 hours, and one poison (other than alcohol) currently affecting the drinker\
  \ is targeted by neutralize poison."
