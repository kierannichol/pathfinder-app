description: "A small magical device patterned on the design of ancient Azlanti relics,\
  \ a wayfinder is a compact compass typically made from silver and bearing gold accents.\
  \ While it serves as a badge of office for agents of the Pathfinder Society, a wayfinder\
  \ is as much a handy tool as a status symbol. With a command word, you can cause\
  \ a wayfinder to shine (as the light spell). A wayfinder also acts as a nonmagical\
  \ (magnetic) compass, granting you a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to\
  \ avoid becoming lost. All wayfinders feature a small indentation designed to hold\
  \ a single ioun stone. An ioun stone slotted in this manner grants you its normal\
  \ benefits as if it were orbiting your head; some ioun stones can grant additional\
  \ powers once they are fitted into a wayfinder, at the GM's discretion."
