description: "Anderos salve and mulibrous tincture are two very different alchemical\
  \ concoctions with contrary but similar goals: refining the mortal body and quieting\
  \ mental stresses. Anderos salve is a gray paste applied to the arms or chest that\
  \ helps restore youthful vigor, while mulibrous tincture is a bitter, minty tea\
  \ that eases pain and softens skin. If a dose of anderos salve is applied at least\
  \ twice per week over a period of months, the user's feminine secondary sex characteristics\
  \ are gradually reduced and masculine ones develop; imbibing mulibrous tincture\
  \ in this way reduces the drinker's masculine secondary sex characteristics and\
  \ feminine ones develop. Taking a dose of each concoction every week instead softens\
  \ all secondary sex characteristics, causing the user to take on an androgynous\
  \ appearance. After a period of 6 months, the transformation is permanent, with\
  \ no further doses required to maintain the new form.\nWhile these alchemical solutions\
  \ do not cause as swift or extensive a change as magical alternatives, they are\
  \ far more affordable, especially among the Rivethun, who often teach the process\
  \ of their creation to their disciples."
