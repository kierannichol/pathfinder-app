description: "Cleats reduce the penalty for walking over slick surfaces by 50%. For\
  \ example, walking across ice normally costs 2 squares of movement (1 square plus\
  \ a 1 square penalty) for every square of movement, but with cleats it costs only\
  \ 1.5 squares for every square. Cleats cause damage to any type of finished flooring.\
  \ They may supplement another outfit."
