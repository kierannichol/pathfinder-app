description: "The following suit of armor is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nOverlapping scallop shells form this suit of\
  \ +2 scale mail. While the wearer is swimming in water, the coat of shells restricts\
  \ her movement speed as light armor instead of as medium armor. Whether worn in\
  \ or out of water, a coat of shells requires medium armor proficiency.\nWhen out\
  \ of the water, a coat of shells keeps its wearer's skin wet and cool. This provides\
  \ the wearer resist fire 5 and the benefits of the endure elements spell against\
  \ hot temperatures only, and it doubles the amount of time a wearer with the water\
  \ dependent racial trait or water dependency can spend out of water without harm.\
  \ None of these benefits apply in water."
