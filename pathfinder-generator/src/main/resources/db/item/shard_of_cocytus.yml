description: "Appearing as a bloodstained icicle with a worn leather handle, this\
  \ +1 frost dagger is impervious to both cold and fire. Once per day, the dagger\
  \ can blast forth a ray of hellfrost at any target within 30 feet as a ranged touch\
  \ attack, dealing 4d6 points of damage. This hellfrost deals half cold damage and\
  \ half damage from unholy energy. Evil creatures and creatures with the evil subtype\
  \ take no damage from this unholy energy; good creatures and those with the good\
  \ subtype take double the usual damage. Protection from evil and similar effects\
  \ protect against the damage from the ray's unholy energy. If the shard of Cocytus\
  \ is used to deliver a coup de grace against a good creature, it recovers its ray\
  \ of hellfrost ability for the day."
