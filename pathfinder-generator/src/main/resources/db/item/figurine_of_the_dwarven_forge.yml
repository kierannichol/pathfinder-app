description: "These stone and steel figurines depicting a forge and anvil are warm\
  \ to the touch and give off a faint red glow. On command, the figurine enlarges\
  \ to become a full-sized working forge with a magical fire burning within. The forge\
  \ occupies a 10-foot-by- 5-foot area, and its transformation fails if sufficient\
  \ space is unavailable. A second command word returns the forge to its original,\
  \ miniature size.\nWhen a magic scroll containing a single spell is tossed into\
  \ the forge, the scroll is consumed in flame. Thereafter, the forge and anvil provide\
  \ that spell for the use of magic item creation in conjunction with Craft Magic\
  \ Arms and Armor. This allows the crafter to use the stored spell as a prerequisite\
  \ for multiple magic items. If a new scroll is consumed in the forge's flame, it\
  \ replaces the current spell. A spell remains available for use indefinitely until\
  \ replaced.\nIn addition, once per day, if touched to a melee weapon made primarily\
  \ of metal as a standard action, the figurine grants that weapon the igniting special\
  \ ability for 1 minute."
