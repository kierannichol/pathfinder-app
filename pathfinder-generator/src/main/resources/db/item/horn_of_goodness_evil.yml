description: "This trumpet adapts itself to its owner, so it produces either a good\
  \ or an evil effect depending on the owner's alignment. If the owner is neither\
  \ good nor evil, the horn has no power whatsoever. If she is good, then blowing\
  \ the horn has the effect of a magic circle against evil. If she is evil, then blowing\
  \ the horn has the effect of a magic circle against good. In either case, this ward\
  \ lasts for 1 hour. The horn can be blown once per day."
