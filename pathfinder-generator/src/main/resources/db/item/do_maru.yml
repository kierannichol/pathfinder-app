description: "The lightest of armors typically favored by samurai, do-maru wraps around\
  \ the wearer's body like a short armored coat. It consists primarily of lamellar\
  \ and lacks a solid breastplate or sleeves, leaving the shoulders and upper body\
  \ somewhat exposed, but permitting the wearer greater flexibility than do the majority\
  \ of heavier armors."
