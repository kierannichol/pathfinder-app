description: "The powder in this minute glass vial is made of caustic soda treated\
  \ with consecrated ashes, and is harmless to living flesh but dangerous to the deceased.\
  \ Necrosalt can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 5 feet. On\
  \ a successful ranged touch attack, 1 dose of necrosalt deals 1d4 points of damage\
  \ to a struck corporeal undead creature. For 3 rounds afterward, it deals an additional\
  \ 1d4 points of damage to its victim at the beginning of the victim's turn. Intelligent\
  \ undead creatures can brush necrosalt off their bodies and end its effect as a\
  \ move action. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 30 Craft (alchemy) check."
