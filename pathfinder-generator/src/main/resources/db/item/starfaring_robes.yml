description: "This simple blue robe appears plain during the day but sparkles in starlight\
  \ or moonlight. The wearer is constantly protected as if wearing a necklace of adaptation.\
  \ On command, the robe sprouts pale moth wings, allowing the wearer to fly as if\
  \ using wings of flying. In the vacuum of space, the wearer can fly at an incredible\
  \ speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system normally\
  \ takes 3d20 months, while a trip beyond should take 3d20 years (or more, at the\
  \ GM's discretion), provided the wearer knows the way to its destination. While\
  \ flying in this fashion, the wearer can enter a state of hibernation (similar to\
  \ temporal stasis), waking instantly if attacked, upon reaching his destination,\
  \ or after a set time period (such as a month or year)."
