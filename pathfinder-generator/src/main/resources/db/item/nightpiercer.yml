description: "This +1 repeating heavy crossbow is carved in the shape of a stylized\
  \ whippoorwill; the stirrup resembles the head, the limbs look like the wings, and\
  \ the stock is shaped like the bird's tail. Nightpiercer applies the ghost touch\
  \ weapon special ability to all bolts fired from it, and the bolts shriek like whippoorwills\
  \ as they fly through the air. Whenever a bolt fired from Nightpiercer deals damage\
  \ to an incorporeal undead creature, the bolt remains embedded in the creature,\
  \ reducing all of the target's speeds by half (to a minimum of 5 feet) for 1 round."
