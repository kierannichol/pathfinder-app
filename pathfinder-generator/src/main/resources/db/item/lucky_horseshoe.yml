description: "Although it appears to be a simple horseshoe, a lucky horseshoe focuses\
  \ and channels the mystical energies of good fortune. As long as a lucky horseshoe's\
  \ owner carries it on her person, she gains a +1 luck bonus on saving throws. Once\
  \ per day, she can invoke the lucky horseshoe's power to gain a +4 luck bonus on\
  \ a single saving throw. She must declare that she is using this ability before\
  \ the roll is made."
