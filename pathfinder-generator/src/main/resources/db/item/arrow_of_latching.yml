description: "The shaft of this unassuming arrow appears tightly wrapped in 6-1/4\
  \ feet of twine from arrowhead to fletching. In reality, the twine actually consists\
  \ of 100 feet of hemp rope, reduced to onesixteenth its size. An arrow of latching\
  \ functions as a mundane arrow when fired at a creature, but when fired at a Medium\
  \ or larger object, it embeds itself if the attack roll hits an AC of 5 + the hardness\
  \ of the target object.\nWhile the arrow is so lodged, anyone within 200 feet of\
  \ it can speak the appropriate command word to unfurl and lower the arrow's hemp\
  \ rope, causing the rope to return to its true size and extend downward 100 feet.\
  \ If the character who says the command word has a free hand and is within 100 feet\
  \ of the arrow of latching when he utters the command, the rope swings directly\
  \ into his hand. A character attempting to hit an object with an arrow of latching\
  \ can make a single ranged attack with the arrow and speak the command word to extend\
  \ the rope after attacking with the arrow as a full-round action. Once the arrow\
  \ is fixed, the rope can be used for any purpose a rope could serve and can bear\
  \ up to 1,000 pounds at a time. If this weight limit is exceeded, the arrow of latching\
  \ snaps, and any creature or object supported by the rope falls\nThe arrow remains\
  \ embedded within the target object indefinitely, although the user can pull it\
  \ free from the target object by speaking a second command word or by succeeding\
  \ at a DC 15 Strength check. If removed, the arrow of latching loses its magic,\
  \ reduced to a common arrow."
