description: "This jar of thick, gritty paste is made from coarsely ground plant matter,\
  \ weak epoxy, and bat guano. When exposed to air, the moldable substance quickly\
  \ creates a thin, paperlike surface, which is ideal for creating false earthen walls.\
  \ Creating a 5-foot-by-5-foot section of paper wall requires a full-round action.\
  \ Though this false wall is easy to punch through, it requires a successful DC 13\
  \ Perception check to identify the wall as a fake. If the creator of the paper wall\
  \ spends an additional full-round action disguising the wall with dirt and pebbles,\
  \ the DC increases by 2. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy)\
  \ check."
