description: "The end of this fishing lure is colored in bright greens and shaped\
  \ like a comical goblin face. The lure's ridiculous coloration and unique shape\
  \ attract all sorts of fish. Using this lure grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Profession\
  \ (fisher) checks, as per a masterwork tool. Each time such a check is attempted,\
  \ there is a 25% chance the lure is lost. You reduce the chance of losing the lure\
  \ by 2% for every rank of Profession (fisher) you have."
