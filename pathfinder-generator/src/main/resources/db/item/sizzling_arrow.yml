description: "This +1 corrosive arrow continues to leak acid onto its target each\
  \ round, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage on the attacker's turn for the next 3\
  \ rounds. Removing the arrow requires a successful DC 10 Heal check and prevents\
  \ any further damage from the arrow (the DC increases to 15 if the target tries\
  \ to remove the arrow from herself). Removing the arrow destroys it. The arrow dissolves\
  \ once the 3 rounds pass."
