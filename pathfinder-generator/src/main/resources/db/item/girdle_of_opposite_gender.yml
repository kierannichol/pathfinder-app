description: "When this magical belt is put on, the wearer must immediately make a\
  \ DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or be transformed into a person of the opposite gender.\
  \ The character's abilities, mind, and spirit remain unaffected; only the character's\
  \ sex changes. If the character's saving throw is a natural 1, the item actually\
  \ removes all gender from the wearer, giving him an androgynous, neutered appearance.\
  \ The change is permanent unless undone with curse-removing magic. Once its magic\
  \ takes effect, the belt can be removed without effort. A creature can only be affected\
  \ by a particular girdle once, though other girdles of this type can cause further\
  \ transformations."
