description: "This elaborate key on a fine gold chain always glints, even in the dimmest\
  \ light. The bearer can use it to lock (but not unlock) any nonmagical lock as if\
  \ it were the proper key. Once per day, the bearer can turn the key clockwise once\
  \ to activate a shield of faith upon herself (though if the wearer is chaotic it\
  \ provides only a +1 deflection bonus).\nIf Abadar is the bearer's patron, the key\
  \ counts as a holy symbol. Once per day, the bearer can speak a command word and\
  \ summon a two-headed eagle as if using summon monster II (the eagle's extra head\
  \ does not grant it an extra attack). This eagle obeys the bearer's commands as\
  \ if they shared a common language. While the key is worn as a pendant or held in\
  \ hand, the bearer gains a +2 bonus on Appraise checks to assess an object's value."
