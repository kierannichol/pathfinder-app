description: "These books come in all manner of shapes and sizes, from hardbound,\
  \ illustrated manuscripts to collections of journals, notes, and scrolls from multiple\
  \ authors. When used as a reference (an action that typically requires 1d4 minutes\
  \ of searching the text), occult reference material grants a +2 circumstance bonus\
  \ on Knowledge checks related to the occult topic covered by that manual. Some common\
  \ topics for occult reference materials include astral projection, auras, dreams,\
  \ ley lines, medium spirits, and rituals. Occult reference materials devoted to\
  \ general subjects—such as spirits as a whole—provide an overview but don't give\
  \ enough detail to grant a skill bonus."
