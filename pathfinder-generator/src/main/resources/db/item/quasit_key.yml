description: "A quasit key appears as a glass jar filled with preserving fluids in\
  \ which a pickled quasit floats. Each quasit key is attuned to a specific location\
  \ in the Abyss when created, and as long as it is carried (even if it's carried\
  \ in an extradimensional space), the carrier can use plane shift to transport himself\
  \ and up to eight other creatures that are joining hands to that location (the quasit\
  \ key found in this adventure is keyed to area C1 of Aponavicius's lair). If used\
  \ in the Abyss, the quasit key instead uses plane shift to transport its user back\
  \ to wherever the key was last used to travel to its linked location. Until a quasit\
  \ key is used to travel to its linked Abyssal location, it has nowhere to go from\
  \ the Abyss itself and does not function while in the Abyss. A quasit key functions\
  \ only twice per day."
