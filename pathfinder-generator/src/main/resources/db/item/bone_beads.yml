description: "This bracelet of tiny carved skulls allows its wearer to command up\
  \ to 8 HD worth of mindless undead creatures as the command undead spell. It is\
  \ a standard action to establish control over an undead creature, and a free action\
  \ to relinquish control. If the wearer attempts to control more than 8 HD of undead,\
  \ the new creatures fall under the wearer's control, and any previously controlled\
  \ undead in excess of this amount become uncontrolled."
