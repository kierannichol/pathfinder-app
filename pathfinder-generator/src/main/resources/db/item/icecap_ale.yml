description: "This rare and unusual brew is fortified by a process of repeated partial\
  \ freezing, during which the ice is continually skimmed off, resulting in a draught\
  \ with more than 10 times the alcohol content of ordinary ale. Icecap ale grants\
  \ a +2 alchemical bonus to the drinker's Strength and Constitution for 1 minute,\
  \ as well as a +4 alchemical bonus on saving throws against compulsions and fear.\
  \ However, after this initial surge of energy, the drinker becomes fatigued and\
  \ takes a â€“4 penalty on Dexterity- and Strength-based skill checks for 1 hour. In\
  \ addition, the drinker loses all memory of events that transpired during the 1d4\
  \ minutes directly following consumption of a draught of icecap ale; a successful\
  \ DC 20 Fortitude save negates this memory loss. Additional doses of icecap ale\
  \ imbibed during the hour following an initial dose cause the drinker to become\
  \ sickened for 1 minute (instead of gaining a bonus to Strength and Constitution)\
  \ and to suffer all the negative effects of icecap ale."
