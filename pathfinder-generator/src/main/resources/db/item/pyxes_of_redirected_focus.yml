description: "This round metal container is just large enough to contain the wooden,\
  \ coin-sized token inside. Each side of the token is inscribed with a different\
  \ prayer. Once per day, a cleric (or other class with cleric domains) may activate\
  \ the pyxes and may select any one of her prepared domain spells and replace it\
  \ with the domain spell of that level from her other domain. For example, a cleric\
  \ with the Fire and Luck domains could switch her 1st-level prepared burning hands\
  \ domain spell to true strike. The pyxes has no effect on creatures with no domain\
  \ spells or only one domain."
