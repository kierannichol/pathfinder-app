description: "This jar of transparent glass is bound with gold ribbons. As a standard\
  \ action that requires both hands, the user can untie the ribbon and remove the\
  \ jar's lid. When the user does so, the ribbon glows as the jar unleashes a burst\
  \ of positive energy that deals 3d6 points of positive energy damage to all manifested\
  \ haunts within 30 feet of the user. If this deals enough damage to a haunt to reduce\
  \ the haunt's hit points to 0, the haunt is neutralized as it dissolves into a violet\
  \ mist that then drains into the jar. A haunt neutralized by a jar of haunt siphoning\
  \ takes a â€“5 penalty on its caster level check to manifest again after its reset\
  \ time passes. Once used, a jar of haunt siphoning cannot be activated again for\
  \ 1d4 rounds, but any violet mist within the jar must first be removed. Removing\
  \ this mist is a full-round action that requires a creature to pour the jar's contents\
  \ into a nonmagical glass vial worth at least 1 gp. This transforms the vial into\
  \ a grenadelike splash weapon that functions like a vial of alchemist's fire, except\
  \ it deals negative energy damage instead of fire damage. Purifying a jar of haunt\
  \ siphoning in this manner causes the jar to reactivate in 1d4 rounds."
