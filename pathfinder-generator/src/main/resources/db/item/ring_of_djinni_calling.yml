description: "This \"genie\" ring serves as a special gate by means of which a specific\
  \ djinni (see the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary) can be called from the Plane of Air.\
  \ When the ring is rubbed (a standard action), the call goes out, and the djinni\
  \ appears on the next round. The djinni faithfully obeys and serves the wearer of\
  \ the ring, but never for more than 1 hour per day. If the djinni of the ring is\
  \ ever killed, the ring becomes nonmagical and worthless."
