description: "This mithral grappling hook is decorated with runic engravings and attached\
  \ to 50 feet of silk rope, with the other end of the rope tied around a thick iron\
  \ ring. Three times per day, the wielder of this item may speak the item's command\
  \ word while holding the iron ring. The grappling hook then teleports to any designated\
  \ location within 50 feet to which the user has both line of sight and line of effect.\
  \ The grappling hook does not teleport if the silk rope is held at any point other\
  \ than the iron ring. If the designated location does not possess a means for the\
  \ rig's hook to attach, the grappling hook falls to the ground after teleporting."
