description: "This heavy gold band can be worn openly as a display of wealth or concealed\
  \ beneath a sleeve. It grants its wearer a +5 competence bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy,\
  \ and Sense Motive checks. Whenever the wearer shakes hands with another creature\
  \ In order to seal a deal or a promise, she can immediately sense whether deceit\
  \ is involved (Will save DC 16 negates), though the wearer cannot determine the\
  \ exact nature of the deception."
