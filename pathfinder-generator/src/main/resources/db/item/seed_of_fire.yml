description: "Created by the Empire of Cheliax as a weapon capable of scouring the\
  \ battlefield in cleansing flame, this magic item consists of a pair of red gemstones.\
  \ When the command word and a period of time is spoken into one of the gems, the\
  \ other becomes permanently stationary and begins to glow with flame. When the period\
  \ of time expires, the gemstone explodes, raining fire on a 60-foot square area\
  \ directly below it. This fire deals 18d6 points of fire damage to all creatures\
  \ and structures in the area. A DC 22 Reflex save halves this damage. Once activated,\
  \ the seed can only be deactivated by destroying its partner gem (which destroys\
  \ the item) or by speaking a special command word into the partner gem, which allows\
  \ the seed of fire to be reused."
