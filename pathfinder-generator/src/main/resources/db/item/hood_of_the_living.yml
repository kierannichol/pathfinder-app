description: "This simple leather coif is of a style popular along the Crusader Road\
  \ and throughout northern Avistan. The wearer gains a +2 resistance bonus on Will\
  \ saves against mind-affecting effects created by undead creatures. Three times\
  \ per day, the wearer may activate the hood of the living to detect the auras of\
  \ any undead creatures within a 30-foot radius. Doing so is a full-round action\
  \ that discloses the presence of any undead auras, the number of undead auras, and\
  \ the direction of the nearest undead aura, as though the user had concentrated\
  \ for 3 rounds while using detect undead.\nWhen activated, a hood of the living\
  \ also detects any living creatures within a 30-foot radius that are acting under\
  \ the effects of a charm or compulsion created by an undead creature. This effect\
  \ only reveals the presence of such creatures, not their number or location."
