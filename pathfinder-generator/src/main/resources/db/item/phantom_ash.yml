description: "Many Rivethun who study the old ways to better manage a traumatic injury\
  \ use this concoction. Despite its evocative name, phantom ash has little to do\
  \ with spectral spirits. Instead, when applied dry or moistened into a salve, this\
  \ black dust causes a sensation of warmth when smeared on skin, and it removes any\
  \ lingering pain or distracting sensations associated with a chronic injury, such\
  \ as a lost or paralyzed limb. For 1 hour after each application, the user gains\
  \ a +1 alchemical bonus on all saving throws against phantasm effects and effects\
  \ that inflict pain."
