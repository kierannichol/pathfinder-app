description: "This thick, 5-foot-long wooden staff is made of rough oak and has two\
  \ branches growing from the top. The branches twist together and bend back toward\
  \ the body of the staff, and their leaves often rustle as if blown by a light breeze\
  \ even when the surrounding air is still. An oaken staff functions as a +1 called\
  \ spell storing quarterstaff, but can't be used as a double weapon (only one end\
  \ of the staff is usable in combat). The staff allows use of the following spells."
