description: "This pair of magical softpaw boots (see above) allows the catfolk wearing\
  \ them to gain extra maneuverability while moving through hazardous areas. As a\
  \ free action, the wearer can click her heels together to grant herself a +5 competence\
  \ bonus on Acrobatics checks made to move through threatened squares or to move\
  \ through an enemy's space without provoking attacks of opportunity for up to 10\
  \ rounds per day. The rounds need not be consecutive. Furthermore, anytime the wearer\
  \ of the boots successfully moves though the space of an enemy without provoking\
  \ an attack of opportunity, she gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against that enemy\
  \ until the end of her turn."
