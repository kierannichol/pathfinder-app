description: "This leather knapsack has one large pocket that closes with a buckled\
  \ strap and holds about 2 cubic feet of material. Some may have one or more smaller\
  \ pockets on the sides.\nMasterwork Backpack: This backpack has numerous pockets\
  \ for storing items that might be needed while adventuring. Hooks are included for\
  \ attaching items such as canteens, pouches, or even a rolled-up blanket. It has\
  \ padded bands that strap across the chest and the waist to distribute its weight\
  \ more evenly. Like a common backpack, it can hold about 2 cubic feet of material\
  \ in its main container. When wearing a masterwork backpack, treat your Strength\
  \ score as +1 higher than normal when calculating your carrying capacity.\nCarrier\
  \ Backpack: Reinforced metal bars allow for this leather backpack to withstand a\
  \ greater degree of stress than a traditional pack. Along with the standard backpack\
  \ compartment, this pack has an additional pouch and harness at its top. Used together,\
  \ the harness and pouch can safely contain a Tiny or smaller creature. While harnessed,\
  \ the creature can't leave the backpack or see outside of it; it takes a full-round\
  \ action to remove the harness from a carried creature.\nHydration Backpack: This\
  \ mostly leather backpack has a series of awkward metallic tubes, which run from\
  \ the pack over your shoulders, and a small bladder at its base. A hydration backpack\
  \ has a large pocket identical to that of a regular backpack that holds 2 cubic\
  \ feet of material, while the bladder holds 1 gallon of liquid. The ends of the\
  \ metal tubes can be positioned to allow you to easily dispense and drink liquid\
  \ stored in the attached bladder. Consuming water in this way grants a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus on Constitution checks to avoid nonlethal damage during a forced march.\n\
  Weaponrack Backpack: This leather backpack includes a small weapons rack. The rack\
  \ holds up to four weapons, such as battleaxes, longswords, maces, or short swords.\
  \ Allies adjacent to you can retrieve a weapon from the rack as a move action without\
  \ provoking attacks of opportunity, as if they were simply drawing a weapon. Like\
  \ a normal backpack, it can hold 2 cubic feet of material in its main compartment."
