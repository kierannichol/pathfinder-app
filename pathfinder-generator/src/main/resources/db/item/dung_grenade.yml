description: "The casing of this modified fuse grenade is partially filled with animal\
  \ dung or guano. You can throw a dung grenade as a splash weapon with a range increment\
  \ of 10 feet. Any creature directly hit by a dung grenade or in its splash radius\
  \ takes 1d6 points of fire damage and is covered with the grenade's malodorous contents,\
  \ becoming sickened for 1d4 rounds. A target can attempt a DC 15 Reflex saving throw\
  \ to halve the damage and the duration of the sickened condition. Crafting a dung\
  \ grenade requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
