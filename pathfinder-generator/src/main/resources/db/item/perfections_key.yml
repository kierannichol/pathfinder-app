description: "This platinum key can open nearly any lock or door with a mere touch.\
  \ With a touch of the key, a lock of DC 40 or lower unlocks. When a creature holding\
  \ the key attempts to break down a door with a break (locked) DC of 28 or lower,\
  \ the door is broken and opened. In all other cases it grants the creature possessing\
  \ Perfection's Key a +10 bonus on Disable Device checks to pick locks, and a +10\
  \ bonus on attempts to break down doors."
destruction: "Somewhere in the planes there is said to be an Impossible Lock —a mechanism\
  \ so perfect that only this key can thwart it. If Perfection's Key is inserted into\
  \ the Impossible Lock, the key is destroyed, but unlocks the Impossible Lock."
