description: "A brazen head is an object sacred to the cult of Baphomet. Most brazen\
  \ heads appear to be the head of a minotaur, but others in the shape of humans,\
  \ animals, or multi-faced demons exist.\nWhen mounted on a wall in an area sacred\
  \ to Baphomet, the brazen head constantly breathes out invisible vapors that fill\
  \ a 60-foot spread. Any evil creature in this area gains the benefit of a bless\
  \ spell.\nWhen in the area of an unhallow spell cast by a worshiper of Baphomet,\
  \ a brazen head can be used once per month to perform an augury. Rumors exist of\
  \ more powerful brazen heads capable of casting divination or even commune."
