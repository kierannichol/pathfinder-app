description: "This short cloak is made of gold thread spun into a pattern of interlocking\
  \ key shapes. The cloak grants the wearer a +1 shield bonus to AC. As a move action,\
  \ the wearer can activate the cloak, which instantly produces enough keys to wrap\
  \ the wearer in a dome-shaped shield of hardened metal, protecting the wearer as\
  \ if he were carrying a tower shield with which he is proficient. While using this\
  \ ability, the wearer can take no other actions (other than adjusting which direction\
  \ the effective tower shield is considered to be facing) and is immobile. The wearer\
  \ can remain in this form indefinitely, but resting in this form is equivalent to\
  \ resting in heavy armor. The dome of keys can be dismissed as a swift action, and\
  \ it automatically vanishes if the cloak is removed.\nOnce per day, the cloak can\
  \ also create a single special skeleton key as a standard action. This skeleton\
  \ key can be tried on any one lock that uses a key, even if you aren't trained in\
  \ the Disable Device skill. You use the key's Disable Device bonus of +15 rather\
  \ than your own; you cannot take 10 when using a skeleton key. You can only attempt\
  \ to open a particular lock with the skeleton key once. If the roll fails, the key\
  \ is unable to open or close that lock. The key lasts for 1 hour and can be used\
  \ on only a single lock during that time."
