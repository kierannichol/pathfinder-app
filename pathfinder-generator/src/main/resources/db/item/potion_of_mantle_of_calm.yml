name: "Potion of Mantle of Calm"
description: "You surround yourself with a mantle of calm serenity. You take a â€“2\
  \ penalty on attack rolls, and opponents gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against\
  \ spells you cast. Any creature affected by a rage effect (barbarian's rage, bloodrager's\
  \ bloodrage, blood rage monster ability, rage spell, skald's inspired rage raging\
  \ song, and so on) that strikes you with a melee attack must attempt at a Will saving\
  \ throw, without the rage effect's bonus to Will; failure means the rage effect\
  \ ends (as if it were dispelled or the creature voluntarily ended it, as appropriate)."
