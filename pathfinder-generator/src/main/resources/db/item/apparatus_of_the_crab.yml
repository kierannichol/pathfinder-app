description: "An apparatus of the crab is a metallic magical vehicle. When unoccupied,\
  \ it appears to be a large, sealed iron barrel big enough to hold two Medium creatures.\
  \ Close examination, and a DC 20 Perception check, reveals a secret catch that opens\
  \ a hatch at one end. Anyone who crawls inside finds 10 (unlabeled) levers and seating\
  \ for two Medium or Small occupants. These levers allow those inside to activate\
  \ and control the apparatus's movements and actions.\n"
