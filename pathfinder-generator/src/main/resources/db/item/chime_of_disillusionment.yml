description: "When struck, this heavy iron tube produces a discordant tone and draws\
  \ the surrounding light in on itself. Within a 60-footradius burst centered on the\
  \ point where the chime was struck, the illumination level drops one step, to a\
  \ minimum of dim light. The echoes of the chime resonate for 1 minute, during which\
  \ creatures in the area can't benefit from morale bonuses and gain a +4 bonus on\
  \ Will saves made to disbelieve. After this period, the suppression of morale bonuses\
  \ ends and the ambient light level returns to normal. If the bearer expends one\
  \ use of mythic power while striking the chime, the area increases to a 120-foot-radius\
  \ burst, and each mythic enemy within it loses one use of mythic power, in addition\
  \ to the chime's normal effects. The chime can be struck three times per day. Additional\
  \ strikes produce no sound or effect."
