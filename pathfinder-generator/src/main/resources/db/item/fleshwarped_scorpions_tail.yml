description: "This +1 scorpion whip is made from the tail of a giant cave scorpion.\
  \ Three times per day, it allows the wielder to use a poison effect (as the spell,\
  \ save DC 15) upon a creature struck by the whip. The wielder can decide to use\
  \ the power after she has struck. Doing so is a free action, but the poison effect\
  \ must be invoked in the same round that the whip strikes.\nIn addition, the fleshwarped\
  \ scorpion's tail can be attached to (or removed from) a willing or helpless creature\
  \ with 1 hour of surgery and a successful DC 20 Heal check. Whether or not the surgery\
  \ is successful, the creature takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage. While the\
  \ tail is attached, the creature gains a natural sting attack that deals damage\
  \ as the fleshwarped scorpion's tail (including the enhancement bonus and ability\
  \ to use the poison effect three times per day). The save DC for the poison effect\
  \ becomes 10 + 1/2 the creature's Hit Dice + its Constitution modifier."
