description: "A golden ribbon winds around this smooth, ring-shaped piece of basalt,\
  \ which was created to emulate the pit of the Starstone. The stone can be thrown\
  \ as a ranged attack with a range increment of 20 feet. When the stone strikes a\
  \ target, it creates a 10-foot-wide, 20-foot-deep moat, as per create pit, leaving\
  \ the target on a stone pillar equal in size to its space. Alternatively, the user\
  \ can target a specific grid intersection (or merely drop the stone, which requires\
  \ no attack roll) to create a 10-foot-wide, 20-foot-deep moat around the 5-foot\
  \ square onto which it was thrown or dropped. (If the wielder throws the stone at\
  \ a target and misses, treat the stone as a splash weapon to determine where it\
  \ lands.) Each creature that is not the target in the area where a pit is created\
  \ in this way must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex saving throw to jump to safety in the\
  \ nearest open space. The pit disappears after 6 rounds. The stone is consumed upon\
  \ being thrown or dropped."
