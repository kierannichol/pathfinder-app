description: "Mortal blacksmiths residing in the Gebbite city of Graydirge created\
  \ the first dark life rings. Too often had these living unfortunates suffered collateral\
  \ damage from the negative energy effects used daily in the streets of the undead-ruled\
  \ city, so they forged these rings in hopes of mitigating at least some of the harm\
  \ their unliving rulers carelessly inflicted upon them. Before the Blood Lords at\
  \ Mechitar could punish the insolent smiths of Graydirge, the dark life rings and\
  \ their imitators made their way into the wider world.\nA dark life ring grants\
  \ its wearer a +2 profane bonus on Will saving throws against channeled negative\
  \ energy and inflict spells (any spell with \"inflict\" in its name). In addition,\
  \ anytime the wearer takes damage from channeled negative energy or an inflict spell,\
  \ she subtracts 5 from the damage taken (calculated after the wearer has rolled\
  \ her Will save against the effect), to a minimum of 0 points of damage."
