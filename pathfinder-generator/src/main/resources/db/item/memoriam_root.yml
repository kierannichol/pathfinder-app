description: "This sharp wooden root looks green and alive. When plunged into the\
  \ earth over a buried humanoid corpse, the root grows into a young tree in 1 hour.\
  \ The appearance of the plant and the fruit it produces is a reflection of the personality\
  \ the dead humanoid had in life, and the resulting tree and the buried corpse cannot\
  \ be moved from the location without killing the tree. The tree produces 1d4 pieces\
  \ of magical fruit each day, regardless of the local climate or weather. Each fruit\
  \ provides nourishment as if it were a normal meal for a Medium creature and restores\
  \ 1 hit point when eaten. Consumed fruit also grants additional effects depending\
  \ on the alignment the corpse had while alive, as described below. A tree planted\
  \ over a creature that had a neutral alignment produces 2d4 fruits that provide\
  \ the neutral alignment effect.\nFruit harvested from the tree retains these effects\
  \ for 24 hours. When the tree grows new fruit each day, the previous day's fruit\
  \ loses its magical effect and falls to the ground. The effects below are cumulative.\n\
  Chaotic: The consuming creature gains an instinctual drive toward freedom. For 1\
  \ minute after it consumes the fruit, the creature becomes immune to any spell or\
  \ effect that impedes movement, such as paralysis, slow, solid fog, or web.\nEvil:\
  \ The consuming creature perceives the world through a hardened lens of cynicism.\
  \ This suppresses any spells or effects affecting the eater that cause confusion\
  \ for 1 minute after the fruit is consumed.\nGood: The consuming creature becomes\
  \ filled with hope and happiness. This suppresses any fear spell or effect affecting\
  \ the eater for 1 minute after the fruit is consumed.\nLawful: The consuming creature\
  \ feels supported by ironclad conviction. This suppresses any charm spell or effect\
  \ affecting the eater for 1 minute after the fruit is consumed.\nNeutral: The consuming\
  \ creature feels a sense of connection to the balanced, amoral nature of creation.\
  \ For 1 minute after it consumes the fruit, the creature can't be targeted by spells\
  \ or effects that would damage or otherwise harm it based on its alignment."
