description: "This pair of magnificent dark metal bracers is forged to depict the\
  \ shape of a raven stretched over the wearer's forearm. Once prized by the last\
  \ king of Zolurket, several additional raven bracers were created in the mines'\
  \ final days to aid the king's bodyguards in defending him and maintaining communications\
  \ throughout the mine.\nWhile worn, these bracers can be used as a swift action\
  \ to grant the throwing and returning magic weapon qualities to any held melee weapon;\
  \ these qualities persist for 1 round. This ability can be used three times a day.\n\
  In addition, the bracers may be removed and tossed into the air as a standard action,\
  \ where they transform into a pair of identical black metallic ravens similar to\
  \ silver raven figurines of wondrous power. Like those items, these ravens obey\
  \ the wearer, and may each bear a message as if affected by the animal messenger\
  \ spell. The ravens can only take this shape once per week, retaining the form continuously\
  \ for up to 24 hours.\nOnce both of these ravens have delivered their messages (or\
  \ once the 24-hour limt is reached), they both vanish in a cloud of smoke and return\
  \ unerringly to the owner's hands via teleportation. If the item's owner is no longer\
  \ on the same plane as the bracers when this event occurs, they merely revert to\
  \ bracer form and fall to the ground, awaiting a new owner to find and claim them\
  \ for their own use."
