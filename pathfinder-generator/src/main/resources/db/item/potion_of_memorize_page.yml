name: "Potion of Memorize Page"
description: "The target gains a perfect memory of the page you used as a focus component.\
  \ The target can visualize this page as easily as looking at it in person, including\
  \ minute details visible to close scrutiny by the naked eye. The memory of the page\
  \ includes text and images, such as a drawing or a map. Someone unfamiliar with\
  \ the language on the page (or even an illiterate person) could relay what is written\
  \ simply by copying the shapes of the letters so another person can read them."
