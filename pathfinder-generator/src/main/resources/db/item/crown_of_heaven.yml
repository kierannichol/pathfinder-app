description: "This slim golden diadem, bejeweled with diamonds and sapphires, grants\
  \ its wearer fluency in Celestial and allows her to detect evil at will and use\
  \ tongues once per day, both on command. She also gains a +5 sacred bonus on Knowledge\
  \ (planes) checks regarding outsiders with the good or evil subtypes, and any effect\
  \ she creates with the good descriptor takes effect at +1 caster level.\nA crown,\
  \ an orb, and a scepter of heaven —collectively known as a regalia of heaven —increase\
  \ in power when used together. If the wearer of a crown of heaven wields an orb\
  \ or scepter of heaven, effects she creates with the good descriptor gain an additional\
  \ +1 caster level, and she gains a +1 sacred bonus to AC and on saves against attacks\
  \ or effects created by evil creatures. She also radiates an aura of menace in a\
  \ 20-foot radius. Any evil creature within this aura takes a –2 penalty on attack\
  \ rolls, on saving throws, and to AC until it successfully hits the wearer of the\
  \ regalia (DC 20 Will negates). A creature that saves is immune to this effect for\
  \ 24 hours. If the aura is dispelled, the wearer can restore it as a standard action.\n\
  If the crown is worn while the wearer is wielding both an orb and scepter of heaven,\
  \ the crown's caster level increases to 15th, effects the wearer creates with the\
  \ good descriptor gain an additional +1 caster level increase, and her sacred bonus\
  \ to AC and saves increases to +2. In addition, as a full-round action, the wearer\
  \ can create an aura of sanctity for as long as she concentrates. This aura provides\
  \ a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against\
  \ attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, as well as the benefits of\
  \ a magic circle against evil and a lesser globe of invulnerability.\nA crown of\
  \ heaven bestows one negative level on any evil creature bearing it, which cannot\
  \ be removed or overcome while carrying the crown. If the same creature carries\
  \ an orb or scepter of heaven, it gains one additional negative level per object.\
  \ An evil creature intentionally donning a crown of heaven gains an additional negative\
  \ level and is affected as bestow curse (DC 17) immediately and every 24 hours that\
  \ the crown is worn. A neutral character can attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save to avoid\
  \ gaining these negative levels."
