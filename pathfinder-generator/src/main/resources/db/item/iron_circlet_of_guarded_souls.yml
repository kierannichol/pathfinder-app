description: "This simple cold iron circle has no markings or ornamentation upon it,\
  \ and is always slightly cool to the touch. The circle shields both the wearer's\
  \ soul and his identity from mystic intrusion. The wearer is immune to effects that\
  \ target souls (such as trap the soul) or that would be foiled by a nondetection\
  \ spell (unlike nondetection, the diviner's caster cannot attempt a spell resistance\
  \ check to overcome this effect). If the wearer is slain, he cannot be restored\
  \ to life by magic (save by a miracle, wish, or divine intervention) until the circlet\
  \ is removed."
