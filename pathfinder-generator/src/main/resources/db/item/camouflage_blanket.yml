description: "This large, coarse blanket covers a single square and has a multi-colored\
  \ design that blends in with a specific environment type, such as underground, forests,\
  \ or plains (see the ranger's Favored Terrains table on page 65 of the Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Core Rulebook for a full list of environment types). A character covered by\
  \ a camouflage blanket in that blanket's matching terrain has concealment. Such\
  \ characters who are also prone gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks.\
  \ The bonus applies even when the covered character attempts a Stealth check to\
  \ remain hidden after sniping with a projectile weapon."
