description: "This exquisite telescope is crafted of brass, ivory, wood, and carefully\
  \ polished crystal lenses and silver mirrors, and is over 10 feet long. Anyone using\
  \ a farwatcher must possess at least 5 ranks in Profession (astronomy) in order\
  \ to use itâ€”the device is simply too complex for anyone with less training to use\
  \ it properly.\nAn observer using this device gains a +20 circumstance bonus on\
  \ Perception checks to discern celestial bodies, as well as a +20 circumstance bonus\
  \ on any Profession (astronomer) checks made while using it at night. A farwatcher\
  \ can be used during either the night or day to look at celestial or terrestrial\
  \ objects, though any object within 1 mile viewed through the telescope is obscured\
  \ beyond recognition. A farwatcher allows its user to see things through it as though\
  \ under the effects of true seeing for up to 1 hour per day. These minutes need\
  \ not be consecutive, but must be expended in minimum increments of 10 minutes each."
