description: "This seemingly ordinary deck of 54 playing cards is held in an ornate\
  \ wooden box with a simple clasp, decorated with wasp-themed art. The clergy of\
  \ Calistria sometimes gifts decks of this kind to its more devout and covert spies.\
  \ As a move action, the owner of a deck of the hellwasp's sting can draw a card\
  \ from the deck and speak a command word to transform that card into a thrown weapon\
  \ (treat as a +1 flaming dart). Alternatively, the user can draw and activate a\
  \ card covertly as a standard action, using Sleight of Hand to palm it and treat\
  \ it as a hidden weapon for a subsequent attack. A card is always destroyed after\
  \ being thrown, even if it doesn't hit the target. If the thrower uses the Arcane\
  \ Strike feat with this attack, the feat's bonus damage doubles.\nIn addition, as\
  \ long as there are at least 20 cards remaining in the deck, the entire deck can\
  \ be sacrificed by speaking a command word and tossing the cards into the air as\
  \ a full-round action. The cards transform into a swarm of burning, poisonous paper\
  \ with the same statistics as a hellwasp swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 146),\
  \ except the swarm doesn't gain the inhabit ability, and all damage dealt by its\
  \ swarm attack is fire damage. The character who activated the ability can control\
  \ the swarm as if it were summoned by the summon swarm spell for up to 10 rounds,\
  \ at which point the swarm dissipates."
