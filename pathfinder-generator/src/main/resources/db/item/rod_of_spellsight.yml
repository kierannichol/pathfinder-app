description: "This beautiful ivory rod is embedded with countless sapphires and covered\
  \ with intricate designs inlaid in silver. The vision of a rod of spellsight's wielder\
  \ is unaffected by any magical cloud, fog, mist, smoke, or vapor effect. This allows\
  \ the wielder to see through the effects of fog cloud, obscuring mist, and even\
  \ incendiary cloud. The rod does not protect the wearer against blinding effects\
  \ such as blindness/deafness or the blinding effect of glitterdust."
