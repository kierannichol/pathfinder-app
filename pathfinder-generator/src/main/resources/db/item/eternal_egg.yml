description: "This device is an arcane engine that draws on the spell-like abilities\
  \ of the couatl egg trapped within to power a beacon that specifically calls to\
  \ the lost mage Nex. The beacon continually sings out across the dimensions to Nex\
  \ in an attempt to arouse his interest and draw him back to Golarion.\nAdditionally,\
  \ once per day the user can activate the device to teleport herself, the Eternal\
  \ Egg, and up to 8 willing creatures holding hands to or from Afareen Astabhan's\
  \ private extradimensional retreat (which acts as a permanent demiplane created\
  \ with lesser create demiplane). This functions as plane shift. When teleporting\
  \ from the extradimensional retreat, the item and its passengers are returned to\
  \ a location within between 5 and 500 miles (determined randomly) of the last location\
  \ the Eternal Egg occupied on the Material Plane.\nShould Nex ever respond to the\
  \ Eternal Egg's beacon, it can be used to transport the user and anyone else standing\
  \ in the 10-foot-radius magic circle inscribed on the floor to Nex's location. 24\
  \ hours later, the user and her companions can follow the beacon back. This use\
  \ exhausts the Eternal Egg's powers."
