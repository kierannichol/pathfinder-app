description: "Short swords are some of the most common weapons found in any martial\
  \ society, and thus designs are extremely varied, depending on the region and creator.\
  \ Most are around 2 feet in length. Their blades can be curved or straight, single-\
  \ or double-edged, and wide or narrow. Hilts may be ornate or simple, with crossguards,\
  \ basket hilts, or no guard at all. Such weapons are often used on their own, but\
  \ can also be paired as a matched set, or used in conjunction with a dagger or longer\
  \ sword."
