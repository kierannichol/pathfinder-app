description: "This +2 keen returning spear is adorned with feathers and fur, as well\
  \ as with a bright steel chain that trails down from the top of its haft.\nOn a\
  \ critical hit, Chada's harpoon lodges into the target's flesh or armor, and the\
  \ wielder can choose to pull the target toward him, reeling the victim in by use\
  \ of the magically extended chain. This functions as the pull universal monster\
  \ ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 303) with the following exceptions. Compare the\
  \ initial attack roll (instead of a new CMB check) to the target's CMD to determine\
  \ success. Success pulls the target 20 feet closer to the wielder. The wielder can\
  \ make additional attack rolls each round (instead of new CMB checks) to pull the\
  \ victim closer. Unlike the normal pull ability, Chada's harpoon can pull creatures\
  \ of any size. Once the target is pulled adjacent to the wielder, the bull rush\
  \ ends."
