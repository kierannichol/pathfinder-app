description: "This adamantine band is capped with a stone sigil of the first clan\
  \ to settle the Sky Citadel of Kraggodan. This ring is keyed to interact with several\
  \ devices and traps within the vaults—storehouses of ancient history and family\
  \ wealth—of the Sky Citadel. The ring grants its wearer acid resistance 10. Three\
  \ times per day as a swift action, the wearer can make himself undetectable by crafted\
  \ and magical traps and creatures of the construct type for the following minute.\
  \ This functions like greater invisibility within these limits and also prevents\
  \ the character's weight or presence from triggering traps."
