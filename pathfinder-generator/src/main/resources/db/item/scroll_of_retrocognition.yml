name: "Scroll of Retrocognition"
description: "This spell allows you to gain psychic impressions from past events that\
  \ occurred in your current location. Retrocognition reveals psychic impressions\
  \ from events that occurred over the course of the last hour throughout the first\
  \ minute of the duration, followed by impressions from the next hour back the next\
  \ minute you concentrate, and so on. If a psychically traumatic or turbulent event\
  \ happened during that time period, you must succeed at a concentration check (DC\
  \ = 20, 30, or 40, depending on the severity of the psychic disturbance) or lose\
  \ concentration on the spell."
