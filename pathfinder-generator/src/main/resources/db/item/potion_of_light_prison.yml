name: "Potion of Light Prison"
description: "Rays of light burst forth from your outstretched hand, encircling each\
  \ target's space with a cage of light. If a target fails its Reflex save, it becomes\
  \ enclosed in the light prison. A creature enclosed in a light prisoncan attack,\
  \ cast spells, and otherwise act normally as long as it stays within the light prison.\
  \ However, if a creature passes through the walls of a light prisonenclosing it,\
  \ it takes 1d6 points of damage and is blinded for 1 round. Creatures do not receive\
  \ saves to negate these effects. Once a creature passes through the walls of a light\
  \ prisonsurrounding it, the effect ends for that creature."
