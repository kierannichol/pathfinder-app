description: "Random patterns of brown rust, discolored metal, and dried blood tarnish\
  \ the surface of this +2 wounding starknife. If this weapon is thrown and deals\
  \ damage, it embeds itself in the target. The target continues to take bleed damage\
  \ until the embedded weapon is removed. An embedded hunter's starknife emits a blue\
  \ glow that imitates the effect of a faerie fire spell, affecting the weapon and\
  \ the target as long as it is embedded. Removing this weapon requires a successful\
  \ DC 15 Strength check (a full-round action). The creature takes an additional 1d4\
  \ points of damage when attempting this check, regardless of whether it succeeds\
  \ or fails."
