description: "This +1 blinding buckler is made from a lustrous glass that is as hard\
  \ as steel and reflects light like a mirror. The shield glows as a torch, though\
  \ this light can be suppressed or resumed on command. The shield can be commanded\
  \ to shine light as per daylight for up to 10 minutes each day. This duration need\
  \ not be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. The wielder can\
  \ also expend this duration while activating the buckler's blinding ability to increase\
  \ the save DC by 1 for every 2 minutes of daylight duration expended. The shield\
  \ must sit in natural bright light for at least 1 hour after its 10 minutes of daylight\
  \ is expended before the ability can be used again."
