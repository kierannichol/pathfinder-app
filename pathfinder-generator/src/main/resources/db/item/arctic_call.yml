description: "Fine vellum sheets fill these two well-worn books. Beautiful illustrations\
  \ depict the effects of each spell, many with a distinctly arctic theme. Though\
  \ the pages and their wintry illustrations are of high quality, the protective leather\
  \ case that encloses both books smells and feels greasy, as if the hide has been\
  \ crudely waterproofed with animal fat."
