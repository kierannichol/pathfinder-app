description: "This implement at first seems to be nothing but a 12-inch iron bar lined\
  \ with small plates and spikes. It can be folded, twisted, hinged, and bent, to\
  \ form almost any known tool. Hammers, shovels, even a block and tackle (without\
  \ rope) are possible. It can duplicate any tool the wielder can clearly visualize\
  \ that contains only limited moving parts, such as a pair of scissors, but not a\
  \ handloom. It cannot be used to replace missing or broken parts of machines or\
  \ vehicles unless a mundane tool would have done the job just as well.\nThe any-tool\
  \ counts as a set of masterwork artisan's tools for most Craft or Profession skills\
  \ (although very specialist crafts such as alchemy still require their own unique\
  \ toolset). It is an ineffective weapon, always counting as an improvised weapon\
  \ and never granting any masterwork bonus on attack rolls."
