description: "This bright red powder contains a mixture of rare herbs and black salt.\
  \ One dose of fire foot powder is enough powder to spread over two 5-foot squares,\
  \ usually around doorways. The first creature to enter a powdered square must succeed\
  \ on a DC 14 Fortitude save or immediately become overwhelmed by waves of fiery\
  \ pain as if its legs and feet were being burned to ashes. The victim takes 1d6\
  \ points of nonlethal damage per round for 5 rounds, during which time it is also\
  \ sickened.\nOnce a dose of desiccating dust is applied to an area, that area remains\
  \ warded by the effect for 24 hours, or until a creature is affected by the dust,\
  \ at which point the entire dusted area expends its magic and becomes harmless."
