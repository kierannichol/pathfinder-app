description: "Also known as \"alchemist's ice,\" this sealed jar contains crystalline\
  \ blue fluid that immediately starts to hiss and evaporate once opened. During the\
  \ 1d6 rounds after it is opened but before it evaporates completely, you can use\
  \ it to freeze a liquid or to coat an object in a thin layer of ice. You can also\
  \ throw liquid ice as a splash weapon. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of cold damage;\
  \ creatures within 5 feet of where it hits take 1 point of cold damage from the\
  \ splash. Crafting this item is a DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
