description: "Crafted from cattail wicker, rendered magically immune to fire, and\
  \ blackened by years of use, blackwick cauldrons are but one variety of a number\
  \ of similar items. Designed to aid in the crafting of potions and admixtures, a\
  \ blackwick cauldron grants a +5 competence bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks and\
  \ a +5 bonus on Spellcraft checks to create magic potions with the Brew Potion feat.\
  \ Additionally, a cauldron allows a user to craft multiple potions at a faster rate\
  \ than normal. The user can craft a single potion with a value of 300 gp or less\
  \ in 2 hours and can make any combination of potions totaling 1,200 gp or less in\
  \ value in a single day.\nIn addition to its crafting uses, a blackwick cauldron\
  \ can cast identify once per day on an item placed inside of it.\nA blackwick cauldron\
  \ can also be used as a focus or inexpensive material component for spells of the\
  \ divination school, such as clairaudience/clairvoyance or prying eyes, as long\
  \ as such focus or material component has a cost of 5 gp or less."
