description: "This silk cloth is folded into a neat triangle and tied with a gold\
  \ ribbon. If the command word is spoken, a floating sail unfurls up to its full\
  \ size in an area chosen by the speaker and becomes a rigid sheet of cloth capable\
  \ of supporting a large amount of weight. When the command word is uttered a second\
  \ time, the floating sail folds up into a triangle in a space chosen by the speaker\
  \ (this space must be one that the floating sail was touching while unfurled).\n\
  If the floating sail is bearing any weight when commanded to fold up, it collapses\
  \ and takes the form of a normal silk sail; depending on whether the sail was placed\
  \ on water, over a gap, or in a similarly perilous location, any creatures standing\
  \ on it may become entangled in the sail, fall to their doom, or worse (at the GM's\
  \ discretion, those who succeed at a Reflex save may avoid disaster). Similarly,\
  \ a floating sail immediately collapses if its weight capacity is exceeded. A collapsed\
  \ floating sail must be picked up and refolded by hand before it can be activated\
  \ again."
