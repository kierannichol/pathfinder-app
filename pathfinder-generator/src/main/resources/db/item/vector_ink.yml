description: "This specialized ink can be mixed with a contact poison to make the\
  \ poison last longer on paper. Once applied to a sheet of paper, the ink remains\
  \ slightly tacky and keeps the poison effective for up to 1 week. Any creature that\
  \ touches the writing (such as while opening a closed book or unraveling a scroll)\
  \ must save against the contact poison. Once a creature has come in contact with\
  \ the vector ink, the ink is expended. A single vial of vector ink is enough to\
  \ write a single page of text on standard-sized parchment."
