description: "This fearsome-looking mask of ivory, beaten copper, or pale wood is\
  \ typically fashioned into the likeness of a human skull with a missing lower jaw,\
  \ allowing the bottom half of the wearer's face to remain visible when the mask\
  \ is worn.\nOnce per day, after it has been worn for at least 1 hour, the mask can\
  \ be loosed to fly from the wearer's face. It travels up to 50 feet away from the\
  \ wearer and attacks a target assigned to it. The grinning skull mask makes a touch\
  \ attack against the target based on the wearer's base attack bonus. If the attack\
  \ succeeds, the target must make a successful DC 20 Fortitude save or take 130 points\
  \ of damage, as if affected by a finger of death spell. If the target succeeds at\
  \ its saving throw, it nevertheless takes 3d6+13 points of damage. After attacking\
  \ (whether successful or not), the mask flies back to its user. The mask has AC\
  \ 16, 10 hit points, and hardness 6."
