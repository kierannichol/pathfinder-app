description: "This delicate ring appears to be a ring of spell storing or a ring of\
  \ spell turning, but instead of aiding casting or counterspelling, the ring hinders\
  \ such efforts. Each time the wearer casts an arcane spell, he suffers a 25% spell\
  \ failure chance. Furthermore, the wearer of the ring takes a –4 penalty on Spellcraft\
  \ checks to identify a spell when attempting to counterspell. The ring can only\
  \ be removed by a remove curse spell or a similar effect."
