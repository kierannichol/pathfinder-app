description: "Written of only in the most cultic lore of Heaven and Hell, this foot-long\
  \ sliver of radiance is said to be the final piece of the spear Asmodeus used to\
  \ slay his brother Ihys. Glowing like a shard of the sun, this strange weapon functions\
  \ as a +5 axiomatic brilliant energy dagger that overcomes all damage reduction.\
  \ Any creature of or near deity-level power (including archdevils, demon lords,\
  \ empyreal lords, Horsemen, and similar beings) wounded by the Ihystear must succeed\
  \ at a DC 35 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round.\nAside from its use as a\
  \ weapon, the fragment holds within it the final scream of Ihys—the cry of the first\
  \ murder and of the first slain deity. As a full-round action, a creature bearing\
  \ the Ihystear that succeeds at a DC 30 Strength check can snap the weapon in half.\
  \ Doing so releases an echo of this scream: a terrible, deafening shriek that pierces\
  \ the world and can be heard for dozens of miles. Any creature within 100 feet of\
  \ the broken Ihystear —including the wielder—must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or\
  \ be slain instantly. Those who succeed at their saves are rendered deaf and insane\
  \ (as per the spells blindness/deafness and insanity). This scream continues for\
  \ 3 rounds and pierces even magical silence. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect.\
  \ At the end of this time, the Ihystear heals itself and returns to normal. However,\
  \ there is a 50% chance each time it is broken that it randomly shifts to another\
  \ plane.\nFor long centuries, Asmodeus held the Ihystear within the Catafalque,\
  \ deep in Nessus, though in recent years rumors claim sightings of the weapon on\
  \ Golarion. Whether these tales are true and why the Prince of Darkness might have\
  \ released his trophy after untold millennia remains mysteries."
destruction: "The Ihystear must be used to strike the same type of fatal blow to Asmodeus\
  \ that the Prince of Darkness used upon Ihys—but none living other than Asmodeus\
  \ know exactly what type of fatal blow this was. This does not slay Asmodeus, but\
  \ it does cause the Ihystear to vanish from existence for 9 years, 9 months, and\
  \ 9 days. After this time, if Asmodeus still lives, the Ihystear reappears in the\
  \ Catafalque."
