description: "This small wooden box has many tiny compartments filled with items useful\
  \ if you want to feign a sickness, as well as a handy reference book outlining common\
  \ indicators for some of the more feared virulent diseases. The kit includes such\
  \ things as false pustules, pills that cause the person chewing them to foam at\
  \ the mouth, and herbal concoctions designed to induce fevers or vomiting. Using\
  \ a symptom kit grants you a +5 circumstances bonus on Disguise checks made for\
  \ the purpose of simulating illness. A symptom kit is exhausted after 10 uses."
