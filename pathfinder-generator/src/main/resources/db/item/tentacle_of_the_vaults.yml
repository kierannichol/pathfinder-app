description: "The tentacle of the Vaults is an artifact fashioned by the xiomorns\
  \ from an aboleth tentacle to aid in their wars against the piscine masterminds.\
  \ The tentacle is 8 feet in length and too rubbery and flexible to carry comfortably;\
  \ humanoids find it more convenient to wear the tentacle of the Vaults wrapped around\
  \ the waist like a belt or over the shoulder as a sash, but no matter how the tentacle\
  \ is worn, it does not occupy a magic item slot. The tentacle's owner can cast dispel\
  \ magic and remove disease each five times per day.\nThe tentacle's primary power\
  \ activates when its owner tosses it onto the ground and speaks a command word as\
  \ a standard action. The tentacle animates, transforming into a construct with the\
  \ statistics listed in the paragraph below until the owner commands the construct\
  \ to return to an inanimate tentacle as a free action. The construct obeys and serves\
  \ its owner. It understands all languages spoken by its owner but does not speak.\
  \ If the construct is destroyed, the artifact reverts to an inanimate tentacle that\
  \ can be used again at a later time. The tentacle of the Vaults can be animated\
  \ for up to 1 hour each day. This time does not need to be consecutive, but it must\
  \ be used in 1-minute increments.\nWhen animated, the tentacle of the Vaults has\
  \ the statistics of a Medium animated object (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 14) with a\
  \ hardness of 20, the grab special attack, and the following special abilities.\n\
  Aboleth-Bane Aura (Su) A magical aura extends in a 20-foot radius centered on the\
  \ construct. All creatures within the aura, including the construct, gain a +8 bonus\
  \ on attack rolls and melee damage rolls against aberrations. Any creature subject\
  \ to a compulsion effect immediately receives another saving throw to break free\
  \ from the effect (if one was allowed to begin with) when it enters the aura and\
  \ at the start of its turn each round that it remains within the aura.\nDispel Illusion\
  \ (Sp) As a swift action, the construct can cast dispel magic (CL 20th) on an illusion\
  \ spell within 100 feet. This ability does not count against the number of uses\
  \ of dispel magic granted by the artifact."
destruction: "If the tentacle of the Vaults is soaked in the necromantic fluids from\
  \ the Vault called the Land of Black Blood and then used to cast remove disease\
  \ on a mythic aboleth (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 178) within 1 day, the mythic\
  \ aboleth permanently loses its slime ability and the artifact is destroyed."
