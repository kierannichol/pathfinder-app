description: "Crafted from collected ectoplasm and wax, candles of spirit protection\
  \ ward off creatures from the spirit world. To function, a candle of spirit protection\
  \ must be placed in the desired area. When it's lit, fine lines of smoke coil out,\
  \ creating a circular line of smoke in a 10-foot radius around the candle. This\
  \ area is protected against intrusion by astrally projected creatures, ethereal\
  \ creatures, haunts, incorporeal creatures, mediums channeling a spirit, and phantoms,\
  \ and at the GM's discretion can affect other spirits or creatures made of ectoplasm.\
  \ Such creatures can't enter the area of effect, and act as though they were affected\
  \ by an antilife shell that specifically targets them and no other creatures.\n\
  The candle can't be moved once it is lit; attempting to do so ends the effect. Otherwise,\
  \ a lit candle of spirit protection burns for 1 hour. Either way, the candle is\
  \ expended after one use."
