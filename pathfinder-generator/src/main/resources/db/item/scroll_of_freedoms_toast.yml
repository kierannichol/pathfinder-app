name: "Scroll of Freedom's Toast"
description: "When the caster hoists a flagon and delivers a toast to freedom, the\
  \ target is transported up to 15 feet from its position to a space of your choice,\
  \ though that space must be within your line of sight. If the target was prone at\
  \ the time of casting, you can choose for the target to be standing upon reaching\
  \ the destination. Furthermore, if the target was bound with nonmagical ropes, manacles,\
  \ or other restraints, those restraints are not transported with the target, effectively\
  \ freeing the target from those restraints. If the target is bound by magical restraints,\
  \ you can bar those restraints from being transported with the target with a successful\
  \ caster level check against a DC based on the restraints' caster level (DC = 11\
  \ + the restraining magic item's or spell's caster level)."
