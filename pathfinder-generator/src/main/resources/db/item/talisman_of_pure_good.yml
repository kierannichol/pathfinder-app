description: "A good divine spellcaster who possesses this item can cause a flaming\
  \ crack to open at the feet of an evil divine spellcaster who is up to 100 feet\
  \ away. The intended victim is swallowed up forever and sent hurtling to the center\
  \ of the earth. The wielder of the talisman must be good, and if he is not exceptionally\
  \ pure in thought and deed, the evil character gains a DC 19 Reflex saving throw\
  \ to leap away from the crack. Obviously, the target must be standing on solid ground\
  \ for this item to function.\nA talisman of pure good has 6 charges. If a neutral\
  \ (LN, N, CN) divine spellcaster touches one of these stones, he takes 6d6 points\
  \ of damage per round of contact. If an evil divine spellcaster touches one, he\
  \ takes 8d6 points of damage per round of contact. All other characters are unaffected\
  \ by the device."
destruction: "The talisman of pure good can be destroyed by placing it in the mouth\
  \ of a holy man who died while committing a truly heinous act of his own free will."
