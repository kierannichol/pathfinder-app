description: "Flexible tubes connect a hand pump and a breathing mask to this reinforced\
  \ leather backpack. When the hand pump is pressed, the artificial gills draw in\
  \ oxygen from the surrounding water and feed it through the mask, allowing the wearer\
  \ to breathe underwater for extended periods of time.\nThe hand pump must be regularly\
  \ depressed, requiring you to have a free hand and use a move action each round.\
  \ If you do not squeeze the hand pump in a round, you must hold your breath or begin\
  \ to suffocate. Artificial gills eventually become clogged with particulates and\
  \ must be disassembled and cleaned after 1 hour of being submerged, although this\
  \ time can be dramatically shortened by murky or polluted water.\nArtificial gills\
  \ provide no protection against temperature dangers or pressure damage in the open\
  \ seas. If artificial gills are submerged more than 100 feet below the surface,\
  \ they take 1d6 points of damage per round until they are either brought into shallower\
  \ water or they rupture from the pressure. Artificial gills have a hardness of 0,\
  \ 10 hit points, and a break DC of 30."
