description: "This plain black collar is decorated with snowflake obsidian and functions\
  \ only when worn by a spellcaster's familiar or spirit animal. If the bonded master\
  \ of a familiar wearing a collar of sacrifice is slain, the collar drains the familiar's\
  \ life force to restore its master; the familiar is killed instantly and the bonded\
  \ master is returned to life with 1 hit point. This item does not work if worn by\
  \ familiars who do not have a physical life force, such as undead or construct familiars.\n\
  A familiar that wears a collar of sacrifice becomes despondent and paranoid. It\
  \ will do nothing except skulk along in the shadows to follow its master. A master\
  \ must succeed at a DC 15 Charisma check to compel behavior or obedience from such\
  \ a familiar."
