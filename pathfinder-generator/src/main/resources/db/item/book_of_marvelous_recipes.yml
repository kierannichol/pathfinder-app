description: "The pages of this thick and travel-worn leather book visibly rewrite\
  \ themselves as a reader flips through them, creating a number of delicious recipes\
  \ that seem to anticipate the current craving or culinary desires of the reader.\
  \ The recipes can aid the reader in creating such dishes, allowing him to use the\
  \ Profession (cook) skill untrained, or granting a +4 competence bonus on such checks\
  \ if the reader is trained in that skill.\nFurthermore, once per day, this book\
  \ can be used to enhance a meal the reader is cooking. When used in this way, it\
  \ grants the meal being cooked the effects of a heroes' feast spell (caster level\
  \ 11th)."
