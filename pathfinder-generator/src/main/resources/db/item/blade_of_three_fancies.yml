description: "Three colorful silk ribbons tied at the base of this elegant, ornately\
  \ chased +1 glaive flutter gracefully with every movement and never seem to get\
  \ dirty. The glaive grants a +4 sacred bonus on one Perform skill (chosen when the\
  \ weapon is created). The wielder retains this bonus so long as the weapon remains\
  \ within 10 feet, which allows two-handed instruments to be played. Additionally,\
  \ once per day the wielder may use color spray."
