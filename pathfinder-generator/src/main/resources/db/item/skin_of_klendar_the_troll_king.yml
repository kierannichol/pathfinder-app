description: "This suit of mottled, greenish hide armor has no seams, as if it were\
  \ made from a single large, disgusting skin. When worn, it tightens to fit snugly\
  \ against the body. The skin acts as a suit of +2 hide armor and grants the wearer\
  \ 5 temporary hit points. These hit points regenerate at a rate of 1 hp per round.\
  \ If the wearer is damaged by fire or acid, the temporary hit points do not regenerate,\
  \ but may be restored by magical healing.\nIn addition, while wearing the armor,\
  \ the bearer finds that he can speak Giant with a commanding voice. The wearer gains\
  \ a +2 bonus on all Diplomacy or Intimidate skill checks made to influence any creature\
  \ with the giant subtype. This bonus extends to all giants except trolls, which\
  \ prove utterly offended by the armor, which all too readily resembles the flayed\
  \ flesh of one of their kind. Any troll treats the wearer of the armor one step\
  \ less favorably than it otherwise would. In addition, even the most charismatic\
  \ can never improve a troll's attitude any higher than indifferent while wearing\
  \ the armor."
