description: "These high-soled blue boots provide a great deal of comfort and arch\
  \ support while also making the wearer appear a little bit taller than normal. The\
  \ boot's wearer always takes the minimum possible damage from falls (as if the GM\
  \ had rolled a 1 on each die of damage incurred by the fall) and at the end of a\
  \ fall always lands on his feet."
