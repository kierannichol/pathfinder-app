description: "This flask of red liquid is enough to for 1 day stave off a vampire's\
  \ hunger for blood. Few vampires enjoy it; most describe it as tasting stale and\
  \ artificial. Some, particularly weaker or newer ones, feel that it interferes with\
  \ the unholy magic keeping their bodies animated. However, it's an option utilized\
  \ by vampires that are running for their unlives and attempting to stay hidden from\
  \ vampire hunters. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 40 Craft (alchemy)\
  \ check."
