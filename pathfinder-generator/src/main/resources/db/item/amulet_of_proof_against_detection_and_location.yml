description: "This silver amulet protects the wearer from scrying and magical location\
  \ just as a nondetection spell does. If a divination spell is attempted against\
  \ the wearer, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check\
  \ (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 19 (as if the wearer had cast nondetection\
  \ on herself)."
