description: "This +3 breastplate is crafted from the carapace of a giant scarab beetle,\
  \ enchanted to be as hard and reflective as polished steel. The wearer suffers only\
  \ half damage from vermin swarms and gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws\
  \ against the extraordinary abilities of vermin swarms.\nIn addition, once per day\
  \ on command, the wearer can transform the scarab breastplate into a swarm of scarab\
  \ beetles that skitter from her chest to attack creatures nearby. This swarm has\
  \ statistics identical to an army ant swarm (Bestiary 16) and attacks any creatures\
  \ within its space. The wearer can command the swarm to move (including changing\
  \ the shape of the swarm) as a move action, but the swarm must remain adjacent to\
  \ her. If the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points, if the wearer is forced to move\
  \ away from the swarm, or if the wearer commands it to return to her as a move action,\
  \ the swarm crawls back onto the wearer's torso and returns to armor form. While\
  \ the swarm is active, the wearer is not considered to be wearing the scarab breastplate\
  \ (except for purposes of commanding the swarm) and gains no defensive benefits\
  \ from it.\nA druid of 6th level wearing a scarab breastplate can use her wild shape\
  \ ability to duplicate vermin shape I (Ultimate Magic). At 8th level, she can also\
  \ use it to duplicate vermin shape II (Ultimate Magic)."
