description: "This set of goggles is engraved with geometric patterns and arcane runes.\
  \ The wearer can immediately see and discern magical auras within 60 feet, as arcane\
  \ sight. In addition, the wearer is more clearly able to see the animating forces\
  \ of incorporeal creatures and can therefore harm incorporeal creatures with nonmagical\
  \ attacks, though these attacks deal only half damage. If the wearer uses a magic\
  \ weapon to attack an incorporeal creature, the attack deals full damage instead.\
  \ The goggles have no effect on attacks made with ghost touch weapons.\nOnce per\
  \ day on command, the wearer can amplify the goggles' ability to sense animating\
  \ forces for 1 hour. This amplification allows the wearer the ability to notice,\
  \ locate, and distinguish between living and undead creatures within 30 feet, just\
  \ as if she had a psychopomp's spiritsense ability . The goggles do not grant the\
  \ wearer the ability to discern magical auras while amplified."
