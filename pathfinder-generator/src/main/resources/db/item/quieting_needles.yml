description: "A set of quieting needles costs 25 gp. Inserted into a corpse's heart,\
  \ lungs, and other organs, the needles can be well hidden inside a slain body with\
  \ a minute of work and a Sleight of Hand check—the result of this Sleight of Hand\
  \ check determines the Heal check DC to notice the use of quieting needles on a\
  \ corpse. This Heal check gains a cumulative +1 bonus for each day the body has\
  \ been allowed to decay, as the presence of the needles grows increasingly obvious\
  \ as the flesh rots away.\nA body pierced with quieting needles can be brought back\
  \ to life as normal via raise dead, but upon being restored to life, the victim\
  \ immediately begins suffering from the fact that his major organs are perforated\
  \ by hidden needles. This grisly fate can even strike someone brought back to life\
  \ via resurrection or true resurrection if the body itself was intact and the needles\
  \ were thus hidden. (Casting resurrection or true resurrection with only a fragment\
  \ of the body or no body, forcing the spell to rebuild the body as appropriate,\
  \ is a surefire way to avoid having the victim come back to life with the needles\
  \ still inside him.)\nA creature brought back to life with quieting needles inside\
  \ him is immediately struck with pain and must make a DC 25 Fortitude save each\
  \ round to avoid being nauseated from the pain and suffering 1d6 points of Constitution\
  \ damage. A successful Fortitude save negates the nauseated condition and reduces\
  \ the Constitution damage to 1.\nRemoving quieting needles from a dead body takes\
  \ 1d6+6 rounds (and a DC 20 Heal check if the process is to leave the body in a\
  \ condition where raise dead is still viable). Removing quieting needles from a\
  \ freshly restored living body causes 2d6 points of damage per round the procedure\
  \ continues, with a successful DC 25 Heal check reducing damage caused that round\
  \ to 2.\nThe use of quieting needles is relatively uncommon, meant as much to punish\
  \ enemies for attempting to raise dead allies and force them to waste the resources\
  \ on such expensive magic as well as to cause the restored creature agonizing pain—\
  using quieting needles is an evil act that is as illegal as murder in most civilized\
  \ regions.\nA set of quieting needles costs 25 gp."
