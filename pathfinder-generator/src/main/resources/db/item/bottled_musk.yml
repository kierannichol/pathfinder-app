description: "This glass vial contains alchemically preserved musk from a single variety\
  \ of creature. Sniffing bottled musk provides a +4 circumstance bonus on Survival\
  \ checks to track creatures of the same variety by scent. Additionally, bottled\
  \ musk can be used as an additional spell component for the following spells to\
  \ modify the spell's effects.\nDetect undead: Functions as written, but detects\
  \ creatures of the musk's associated creature type.\nLocate creature: Detects the\
  \ same variety of creature as the musk (for example, using bison musk detects only\
  \ bison, not all herd animals or animals), and provides a +2 bonus on caster level\
  \ checks to overcome nondetection."
