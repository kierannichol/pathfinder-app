description: "This set of three cups and accompanying balls are designed for cheating\
  \ at the popular shell game. In the game, a dealer places three identical cups opening-side\
  \ down and shows the customer (or mark) a small ball. The dealer then sets the ball\
  \ down upon a table, places one of the cups over it, and then rapidly shuffles the\
  \ three cups around, back and forth, with the expectation that the mark cannot keep\
  \ up and will be unable to accurately choose the cup that hides the ball.\nWith\
  \ this set, a small lever hidden upon the base of each cup flips an extra chamber\
  \ inside the cup back and forth. When the chamber is open, the ball is visible,\
  \ and when it is shut, the cup scoops the ball inside and hides it from view. The\
  \ dealer can control which cup \"reveals\" a ball while keeping the other two balls\
  \ hidden in their respective cups. To do this, the dealer must succeed at a Sleight\
  \ of Hand check with a +5 bonus opposed by the mark's Perception check to activate\
  \ the levers without being noticed."
