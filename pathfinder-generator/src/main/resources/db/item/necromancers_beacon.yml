description: "This gruesome lantern is made from bone and emerald-tinted glass. When\
  \ lit, it shines a disgusting green dim light in a 60-foot radius. This light makes\
  \ living creatures uncomfortable, but does them no harm.\nA lit necromancer's beacon\
  \ attracts undead creatures within 1,000 feet, whether they can see it or not. Sentient\
  \ undead must succeed at a DC 20 Will save to avoid this effect, and mindless undead\
  \ receive no saving throw. Any undead creature attracted by a necromancer's beacon\
  \ must move as fast as it is able toward the lantern; once it comes within 60 feet\
  \ of the lantern, the undead creature can act normally (unintelligent undead usually\
  \ attempt to destroy the lantern). This effect is blocked by 1 foot of wood, 1 inch\
  \ of stone, or a thin layer of lead. An intelligent undead that succeeds at its\
  \ saving throw against a necromancer's beacon is forever immune to the effects of\
  \ that particular necromancer's beacon.\nUndead creatures take 1 point of positive\
  \ energy damage every round they remain within the light shed by a necromancer's\
  \ beacon. If the lantern is destroyed, all undead are immediately freed from the\
  \ lantern's compulsion."
