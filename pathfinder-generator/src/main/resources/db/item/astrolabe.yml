description: "This device consists of a flat disc upon which two other discs are mounted.\
  \ The mounted discs can rotate on a central axis, allowing them to spin and move\
  \ as days pass. The bottom disc represents the latitude of the user; an astrolabe\
  \ is useless if the user is outside the preset latitude. The upper disc represents\
  \ the sky, and is filled with astronomical features. Anyone can be shown how to\
  \ use an astrolabe at night to determine the date and time (which takes 1 minute).\
  \ When using an astrolabe, you can make a Survival check using your Intelligence\
  \ modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier to avoid becoming lost."
