description: "The Deck of Harrowed Tales is a unique Harrow deck linked to the Harrowed\
  \ Realm, a fantastical demiplane populated by whimsical and nefarious manifestations\
  \ of characters from a Harrow deck's illustrations (see the sidebar for more details\
  \ on this realm). Once per day, at a mental command from its wielder, the Deck of\
  \ Harrowed Tales can create a swirling vortex to the Harrowed Realm, as per the\
  \ spell gate. This ability does not function while the deck is in the Harrowed Realm,\
  \ requiring those within to find another method of escape. The Harrowed Realm is\
  \ detailed in Pathfinder Module: The Harrowing."
destruction: "The Deck of Harrowed Tales can only be destroyed by completing a mythical\
  \ series of 54 quests tied to each of the Harrow cards within. Only then can the\
  \ final 55th quest be revealed, upon the completion of which the deck and the Harrowed\
  \ Realm cease to exist."
