description: "These sturdy leather-soled cloth boots have straps at the ankles and\
  \ calves to ensure a snug fit. Once per day, when the wearer of the boots is grappled,\
  \ pinned, or entangled, she may transfer herself to any spot within 30 feet as if\
  \ using a dimension door spell. A gnome wearing these boots may instead transfer\
  \ herself up to 400 feet away."
