description: "This unique instrument is composed of a 1-foot-long, sealed glass tube\
  \ filled with a clear alchemical solution. Eight smaller glass vessels, each containing\
  \ a different uniquely colored liquid, float within the primary tube. As temperatures\
  \ change in the atmosphere surrounding the haunt detector, the interior vessels\
  \ rise and fall in proportion to the density of their respective liquids. Observation\
  \ of a haunt detector's fluctuations grants a +2 competence bonus on Perception\
  \ checks to notice haunts or the presence of creatures with the cold or fire subtypes."
