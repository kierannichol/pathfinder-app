description: "This battered, leather-bound book looks like an aged and heavily worn\
  \ notebook. Anyone reading the journal for an hour or more has strange dreams the\
  \ following night, the details of which he cannot remember. The following day the\
  \ character is fatigued. Reading the journal for a total of 24 hours or more causes\
  \ the reader to have a prophetic dream wherein he sees his own deathâ€”though, as\
  \ before, he cannot remember the details. If a character who has had this vision\
  \ comes near death at any point afterward, at the moment he is about to die he may\
  \ reroll any failed saving throw made within the last round or force an opponent\
  \ to reroll a killing attack. The character must accept the result of the second\
  \ roll, regardless of its outcome.\nOnce a character has had the opportunity to\
  \ avert death, regardless of its success or failure, the journal provides no more\
  \ benefit and never aids the character again.\nThe Dream Journal of the Pallid Seer\
  \ is affected by a permanent magic aura that makes it appear to be nonmagical."
