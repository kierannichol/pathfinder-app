description: "Once affixed, this ancient ankh bonds seamlessly to the hilt or handle\
  \ of any magic melee weapon. The ankh's power remains dormant until you fall in\
  \ battle-unconscious, dead, or dying. At that point, the ankh animates the weapon,\
  \ enabling it to strike out against all foes, tenaciously guarding your fallen body.\
  \ Treat this effect as a dancing weapon, except that the weapon is allowed to make\
  \ up to three attacks of opportunity each round. The ankh tirelessly defends you\
  \ for up to 1 hour or until you regain consciousness. The ankh can only be activated\
  \ once per day."
