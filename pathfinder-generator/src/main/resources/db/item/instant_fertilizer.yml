description: "This ruby-red earth can be sprinkled over a 5-foot patch of ground as\
  \ a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Noncreature plants and\
  \ fungi in the area grow with alarming speed, and the ground becomes weedy, difficult\
  \ terrain for non-plant creatures. Any non-plant creature in the square must succeed\
  \ at a DC 15 Reflex save or it becomes entangled by the surging plants. Any plant\
  \ creature in the affected square is healed of 1d6 points of damage."
