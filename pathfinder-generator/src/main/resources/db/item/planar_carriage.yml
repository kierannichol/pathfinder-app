description: "Planar carriages are large metal-and-wood vehicles painted or styled\
  \ to reflect the appearance of a certain plane. When not being used to travel to\
  \ another plane, a planar carriage functions as a heavy wagon, except for the following\
  \ changes: instead of muscle propulsion, a planar carriage has built-in magic propulsion\
  \ that requires a driver to use Spellcraft or Use Magic Device for driving checks.\
  \ A planar carriage has a maximum speed of 90 feet and an acceleration of 30 feet.\
  \ Its driving device is a magic item (a 5-foot magical sphere) that occupies the\
  \ forwardmost square, and its driving space consists of the squares adjacent to\
  \ the device.\nOnce per day, the driver of a planar carriage can attempt to transport\
  \ the carriage and its occupants to a plane of her choosing other than the plane\
  \ that the carriage is currently on. For the driver to do so, the vehicle must be\
  \ moving at its maximum speed. While the carriage is moving at maximum speed, the\
  \ driver can attempt a DC 20 Spellcraft or Use Magic Device check to open a gate\
  \ in front of the planar carriage to the chosen plane, as per the gate spell, and\
  \ drive the carriage into the gate. If the driver designates a specific arrival\
  \ point on the target plane, the carriage arrives at that exact location; otherwise,\
  \ the carriage appears in a random location on the plane appropriate for the carriage's\
  \ size.\nWhen the carriage arrives on another plane, it grants its occupants the\
  \ benefits of planar adaptation for that plane as long as the occupants remain within\
  \ the carriage; the carriage itself also gains those benefits. A planar carriage\
  \ can grant the benefits of planar adaptation for only one plane at a time, so when\
  \ the carriage moves to a different plane, the benefits from planar adaptation change\
  \ accordingly. Occupants who are native to the plane the planar carriage is on do\
  \ not gain any benefits from planar adaptation."
