description: "These three-eyed goggles allow the wearer to discern subtler auras that\
  \ would normally be hidden by more powerful auras when using detect evil, detect\
  \ magic, identify, and other detection spells, provided the auras are no more than\
  \ one step different in strength.\nIf the detection would normally be automatically\
  \ foiled by an illusion or abjuration but arcane sight (or another detection effect\
  \ of 3rd level or lower) would have a chance of seeing through that effect, the\
  \ wearer gets a chance to see through it even with lower-level detection effects.\n\
  Three times per day, the wearer of the triple eyes of vivid auras can use greater\
  \ detect magic with a command word."
