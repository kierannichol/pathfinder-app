description: "These worn, shapeless leather slippers magically shrink or enlarge to\
  \ fit any foot placed within, and are as comfortable as a wellbroken- in pair of\
  \ boots. When worn by a halfling, the slippers fade from view almost entirely, manifesting\
  \ as strips of soft leather wound around the ankles so as to allow the halfling\
  \ to enjoy the comforts of being barefoot while still wearing them.\nA pair of subtle\
  \ slippers conceal their wearer's passage, leaving no footprints or scent trail,\
  \ as per the spell pass without trace, regardless of terrain. They also grant the\
  \ wearer a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks. Once per day as a standard action,\
  \ a character wearing subtle slippers can select up to four other creatures within\
  \ 30 feet to gain a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks. This bonus lasts for\
  \ 1 hour, but is suppressed for any creature who moves more than 30 feet away from\
  \ the character wearing the slippers. If that creature returns to a position within\
  \ 30 feet of the wearer of the slippers before the effect's duration expires, the\
  \ bonus reactivates for that character. The effect ends at once for all affected\
  \ if the wearer of the slippers removes the footwear, is knocked unconscious, or\
  \ is killed."
