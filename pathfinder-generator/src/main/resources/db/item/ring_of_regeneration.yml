description: "This white gold ring is generally set with a large green sapphire. When\
  \ worn, the ring continually allows a living wearer to heal 1 point of damage per\
  \ round and an equal amount of nonlethal damage. In addition, the wearer is immune\
  \ to bleed damage while wearing a ring of regeneration. If the wearer loses a limb,\
  \ an organ, or any other body part while wearing this ring, the ring regenerates\
  \ it as the spell regenerate. In either case, only damage taken while wearing the\
  \ ring is regenerated."
