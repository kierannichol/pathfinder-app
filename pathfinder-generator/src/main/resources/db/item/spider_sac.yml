description: "Despite their name, spider sacs have nothing to do with spiders but\
  \ rather are alchemical devices with a unique delivery system. Used for climbing\
  \ as well as combat, these grayish, gourdlike pouches are made of a specially grown\
  \ fungus with a tough but rubbery exterior. The fungoid is carefully harvested,\
  \ pierced at one end, hollowed out, and then injected with a strong alchemical adhesive\
  \ that hardens to a fibrous material almost instantly when exposed to air. When\
  \ squeezed, a spider sac's adhesive shoots out to a maximum range of 10 feet and\
  \ sticks to whatever it strikes, whereupon the strand dries instantly into a durable\
  \ fibrous rope. For the purposes of climbing, treat a spider sac as a grappling\
  \ hook except that all surfaces are AC 5. A spider sac can also be used as a lasso\
  \ except with AC 10, 4 hit points, and a DC 24 Strength check to burst. A spider\
  \ sac is a single-use item."
