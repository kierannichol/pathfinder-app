description: "This grotesque collar is useful to any witch who is eager to form a\
  \ coven, but would rather avoid associating with one or more evil hags. The collar\
  \ is a crude band of iron from which hang the fistsized shrunken heads of three\
  \ hags (an annis hag, a green hag, and a sea hag). The heads remain semi-animateâ€”\
  they occasionally twitch, blink, coo softly, or whisper curses at the wearer, each\
  \ other, or anyone else nearby. A witch with the coven hex who wears the collar\
  \ gains access to the following powers.\nChampion of the Unbound Coven: If the wearer\
  \ joins a coven, the coven can ignore the requirement to have at least one hag as\
  \ a member. Each of the coven members must still have the coven hex, and one of\
  \ the members must be at least a 9th-level witch.\nDreadful Gaze: Three times per\
  \ day as a swift action, the wearer can command the hags' heads to lock their terrible\
  \ gazes on one humanoid within 30 feet. The target of this gaze attack must succeed\
  \ at a DC 15 Will save or become paralyzed with terror (as the effect of the hold\
  \ person spell). This is a mind-affecting fear effect.\nHag Form: Once per day as\
  \ a standard action, the wearer can assume the form of a powerfully built Medium\
  \ crone that resembles the horrific union of an annis hag, a green hag, and a sea\
  \ hag. This metamorphosis is identical to the transformation spell, including the\
  \ violent change to the wearer's mindset and the loss of spellcasting ability."
