description: "This magical instrument is usually made of gold and inlaid with numerous\
  \ gems. If the proper chords are struck, a single use of this lyre negates any attacks\
  \ made against inanimate construction (walls, roof, floor, and so on) within 300\
  \ feet. This includes the effects of a horn of blasting, a disintegrate spell, or\
  \ an attack from a ram or similar siege weapon. The lyre can be used in this way\
  \ once per day, with the protection lasting for 30 minutes.\nThe lyre is also useful\
  \ with respect to building. Once a week, its strings can be strummed so as to produce\
  \ chords that magically construct buildings, mines, tunnels, ditches, etc. The effect\
  \ produced in 30 minutes of playing is equal to the work of 100 humans laboring\
  \ for 3 days. Each hour after the first, a character playing the lyre must make\
  \ a DC 18 Perform (string instruments) check. If she fails, she must stop and cannot\
  \ play the lyre again for this purpose until a week has passed."
