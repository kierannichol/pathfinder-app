description: "This +1 battle aspergillum has a dappled surface and a hollow interior,\
  \ and it's made from a corrosion-resistant alloy that allows it to contain certain\
  \ alchemical weapons. If the aspergillum is filled with one of these alchemical\
  \ weapons, treat the contents as holy water, except that it deals the corresponding\
  \ energy damage: acid (acid or alkali flask), cold (liquid ice), electricity (bottled\
  \ lightning), fire (alchemist's fire), or sonic (burst jar). If the wielder is an\
  \ alchemist, the aspergillum can function in this way an additional number of attacks\
  \ equal to his Intelligence bonus before it needs to be refilled."
