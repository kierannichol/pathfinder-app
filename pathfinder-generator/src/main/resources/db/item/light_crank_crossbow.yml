description: "This weapon functions as a heavy crank crossbow, except that its damage,\
  \ critical, and range values are equivalent to those of a light crossbow. Its lighter\
  \ construction means it provides only a +1 bonus on Climb checks and grapple combat\
  \ maneuver checks to pull the target toward you."
