description: "This narrow cloth belt has a silver buckle in the shape of four rings.\
  \ The belt allows a creature to wear a magic ring on each foot in addition to the\
  \ ring on each hand, though only two rings function at any given time. As a swift\
  \ action, the wearer can change which of his rings are active (both hands, both\
  \ feet, left hand and right foot, and so on). For example, a creature could wear\
  \ a ring of protection, ring of energy resistance, ring of swimming, and ring of\
  \ counterspells, switching between any two of them as a swift action each round\
  \ as it desires.\nThe belt does not change the type of action required to activate\
  \ a ring (for example, activating a ring of invisibility is still a standard action),\
  \ but allows the wearer to easily switch between the constant powers of several\
  \ worn rings. While the belt is worn, wearing a ring on a foot counts toward the\
  \ attunement process of certain rings (such as a ring of sustenance) even if the\
  \ belt isn't used to make that ring active during that attunement period."
