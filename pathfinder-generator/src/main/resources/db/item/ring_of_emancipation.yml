description: "This single thick iron band makes for a rather ugly ring. Rust pits\
  \ the surface of the ring in places and the item seems on the brink of falling apart.\
  \ Occasionally, these rings bear a tiny chain link or dented tankard symbol.\nWhile\
  \ wearing a ring of emancipation, you gain a +2 competence bonus on all Open Lock\
  \ and Escape Artist checks, in addition to all attack rolls made to sunder. Also,\
  \ the ring has three charges, which can be expended at any time to cast shatter\
  \ as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your character level. Each\
  \ time a charge is expended, the ring becomes more rusted and marred. Upon the third\
  \ charge being expended, the ring is destroyed."
