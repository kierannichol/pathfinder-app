description: "The impaler of thorns is an ancient weapon dating back to Thassilonian\
  \ times, when it was often used by city guards to aid in breaking up civil unrest.\
  \ An impaler's shaft is made of darkwood, and its head is a thornlike, wide-bladed\
  \ barb. When an impaler of thorns is used in combat, its successful critical hits\
  \ are accompanied by an unsettling screech, as of some wild beast in anger.\nAn\
  \ impaler of thorns is a +1 longspear. Once per day as it strikes a foe, the wielder\
  \ can cause it (as a free action) to unleash a 30-footradius burst of despair that\
  \ affects all creatures not wielding an impaler of thorns. Creatures affected must\
  \ succeed at DC 16 Will saves or become overwhelmed with sadness and despair, taking\
  \ â€“2 penalties on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and\
  \ weapon damage rolls for 6 minutes. The target struck when this effect is triggered\
  \ must also succeed at a second DC 16 Will save to resist becoming nauseated with\
  \ despair for 1 round."
