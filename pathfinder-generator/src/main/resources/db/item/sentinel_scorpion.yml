description: "This crystalline hand-sized scorpion figurine is so full of cracks and\
  \ occlusions that it looks as if it could fall apart at any minute. As a standard\
  \ action you may throw the sentinel scorpion to the ground, causing it to explode\
  \ into crystalline shards that cover the ground in a 10-foot burst. When any creature\
  \ steps in the area, the shards make popping sounds as loud as the audible version\
  \ of the alarm spell. A creature moving in the area of the shards has a 10% chance\
  \ each round of stepping on the stinger. The stinger injects Large scorpion venom\
  \ (1d6 Str/1d6 Str, Fort DC 18 negates) and is treated as a trap (Search DC 20,\
  \ Disable Device DC 20). After 2 hours, the shards decay into harmless powder."
