description: "This flaky compound of blessed ashes is steeped in juniper berries,\
  \ giving it a warm, chestnut color. Unintelligent undead instinctively recoil upon\
  \ touching warding ash. If an unintelligent undead creature moves into a space covered\
  \ in warding ash, it must immediately end its movement in that space (Reflex DC\
  \ 14 negates). A singe dose of warding ash is enough to cover a 5-foot-square space.\
  \ Applying warding ash is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The\
  \ warding ash becomes inert 1 minute after being laid, or after the ash is disturbed\
  \ in any way (such as being stepped on by a creature). Crafting this item requires\
  \ a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
