description: "This rough-spun green cloak is trimmed in wolf fur and fastened with\
  \ a silver clasp. With the cloak drawn over his shoulders and the hood pulled up,\
  \ the wearer becomes one with his surroundings, gaining a +5 bonus on Stealth checks\
  \ and on Survival skill checks made to follow tracks. The cloak also renders the\
  \ wearer immune to the scent ability.\nIf the wearer expends one use of mythic power,\
  \ the cloak turns him invisible for 1 hour, as greater invisibility. If the wearer\
  \ makes an attack, the effects last for 1 minute after the attack, then end. A character\
  \ made invisible by this cloak can't be detected with detect magic or other spells\
  \ or effects that detect magical auras. The greater invisibility can't be penetrated,\
  \ revealed, or dispelled by spells of 2nd level or lower (such as see invisibility\
  \ or glitterdust), though true seeing and dust of appearance can reveal the wearer's\
  \ presence."
