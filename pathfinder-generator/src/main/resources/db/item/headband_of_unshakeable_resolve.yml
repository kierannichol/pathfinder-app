description: "This simple white cotton headband is decorated with a stylized imperial\
  \ dragon coiled above the wearer's forehead. The headband grants the wearer a +2\
  \ enhancement bonus to her Wisdom score. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus\
  \ for the first 24 hours the headband is worn.\nWhenever the wearer suffers a fear\
  \ effect, she may spend an immediate action to reduce the severity of the fear effect\
  \ by one step. If the wearer would become panicked, she is instead frightened. If\
  \ she would become frightened, she is instead shaken. If the wearer would become\
  \ shaken, the effect is negated entirely. The wearer can use this ability up to\
  \ three times per day."
