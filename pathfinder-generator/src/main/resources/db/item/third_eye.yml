description: "As part of the process of crafting a third eye, the creator grafts an\
  \ actual eye into the palm of the recipient's hand. Once an eye is grafted into\
  \ a palm, it is undetectable while closed and doesn't hinder the user's manual dexterity\
  \ in the slightest. When in use, the eye opens.\nThe owner of a third eye can use\
  \ it to see through the donor creature's remaining eye. The third eye can also be\
  \ attuned to specially prepared bloodstones, allowing the user to observe things\
  \ in each bloodstone's vicinity as if the bloodstone were an eye as well. Preparing\
  \ a bloodstone in this manner requires soaking it in a potion of clairvoyance/clairaudience\
  \ for a week, at the end of which the owner drinks the potion and spits the bloodstone\
  \ into the hand bearing the third eye. These bloodstones are often incorporated\
  \ into magic items like phylacteries, rings, and amulets, allowing the user to gift\
  \ such items to other creatures and thus gain a new viewpoint. This remote viewing\
  \ ability functions at any range as long as the owner is on the same plane at the\
  \ bloodstone. It also allows the owner to cast clairaudience/clairvoyance up to\
  \ three times per day.\nAs long as the third eye is open in a hand that isn't holding\
  \ an object, the owner has all-round vision, gaining a +4 bonus on Perception checks\
  \ and making it impossible to flank the owner. Rakshasas, whose fingers bend backwards,\
  \ can use the powers of their third eyes while holding objects since their third\
  \ eyes effectively look out of the \"backs\" of their hands.\nA third eye cannot\
  \ be transferred between creatures—if removed from the owner's body, a third eye\
  \ is destroyed. A third eye that remains in the owner's palm but is damaged or otherwise\
  \ permanently blinded becomes useless until a remove blindness spell is cast upon\
  \ it."
