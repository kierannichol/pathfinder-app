description: "This tall, teapotlike device contains a small chamber for coffee grounds\
  \ and a large chamber for water, connected by a small tube. Heating the pot forces\
  \ boiling water through the tube and into the grounds. A glass knob at the top of\
  \ the tube allows you to see the color of the brew and stop when it is sufficiently\
  \ strong. It can brew up to 4 cups of coffee at a time. It can also be used to make\
  \ tea, steep medicinal herbs, or just boil water."
