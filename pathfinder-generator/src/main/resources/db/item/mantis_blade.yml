description: "The mantis blade is an intelligent +2 axiomatic sawtooth sabre made\
  \ of red chitin that forms a curved, serrated blade. It grants its wielder the ability\
  \ to make a sneak attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. This ability functions\
  \ as the rogue class feature of the same name, and the extra damage stacks with\
  \ any sneak attack bonuses the wielder already has. When a creature is wounded with\
  \ the blade, the wielder can activate the blade's bane weapon special ability as\
  \ a swift action (granting the weapon an additional +2 enhancement bonus and causing\
  \ it to do an extra 2d6 points of damage, but only against the type of creature\
  \ struck). The bane ability lasts for 10 minutes and is usable once per day.\nSacred\
  \ to the faith of the mantis god Achaekek, a mantis blade also grants bonuses to\
  \ a Red Mantis assassin who wields it. A Red Mantis assassin wielding a mantis blade\
  \ gains a +2 bonus to the DC of her prayer attack and gains an additional use per\
  \ day of both her red shroud and fading abilities.\nTo date, only one mantis blade\
  \ is known to exist, after it was recovered from a lost city in the Mwangi Expanse,\
  \ but ancient texts suggest others remain yet to be recovered."
destruction: "If a single wielder uses the mantis blade to slay nine rightful ruling\
  \ monarchs, the weapon can be destroyed by a successful sunder combat maneuver."
