description: "These pale gray gauntlets feature cabochons of banded black onyx that\
  \ slowly shift to white when the gloves are activated. Three times per day, the\
  \ wearer can activate the gloves as a swift action after successfully affecting\
  \ an undead creature with an offensive single-target spell. Doing so grants the\
  \ wearer a number of temporary hit points equal to 10 + the Hit Dice of the affected\
  \ undead (maximum +10), which last a number of minutes equal to the level of the\
  \ spell cast. This effect ends immediately if either glove is removed."
