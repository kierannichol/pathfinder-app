description: "This pale salve is always cool to the touch, regardless of the surrounding\
  \ temperature. When spread on your skin, it subtly alters your aura, making you\
  \ more difficult for some creatures to detect. For 1 hour after applying the ointment\
  \ to your skin, you can attempt a Stealth check to hide from any creature attempting\
  \ to perceive you using lifesense or spiritsense (see the psychopomp subtype), even\
  \ if you are clearly in that creature's perceptual field. Crafting this item requires\
  \ a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
