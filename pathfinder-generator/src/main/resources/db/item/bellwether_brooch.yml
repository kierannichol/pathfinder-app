description: "The creators of Dragonfall allowed for the possibility that at some\
  \ point in the future, Dragonfall might require relocation. While they could not\
  \ program the guardians with the flexibility of thought necessary to execute this\
  \ task themselves, they did, through the Bellwether Brooch, allow the option for\
  \ someone else to lead the guardians to a new location.\nAs long as the Bellwether\
  \ Brooch resides in its setting in the Paragon Chamber of Dragonfall, the Guardians\
  \ of Dragonfall follow their normal routines. If the Bellwether Brooch is removed\
  \ from its setting, however, the guardians immediately stop performing these routines\
  \ and await the commands of the brooch's wearer. As a free action, the wearer of\
  \ the brooch can telepathically command any Guardians of Dragonfall within 100 feet,\
  \ and the guardians obey fully. The guardians resume their normal routines if the\
  \ brooch is replaced in its setting. In addition, the wearer of the brooch receives\
  \ a +10 insight bonus on skill checks to craft constructs, is treated as 5 levels\
  \ higher for the purposes of creating constructs, and need not expend XP in the\
  \ creation of constructs.\nThe brooch is a clear diamond cut in an ovoid, two inches\
  \ long. It has no chain or clasp; instead, it attaches itself to the wearer's skin\
  \ at the neck. The wearer can easily remove it, but it is treated as a \"well-secured\
  \ object\" against any attempts to remove it by force."
