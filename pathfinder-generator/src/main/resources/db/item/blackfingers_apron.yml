description: "This +1 bitter leather armor looks much like a blacksmith's apron or\
  \ an alchemist's smock, and has many small pockets suitable for holding extracts,\
  \ potions, or poisons. Once per day, the wearer can use negate aroma (lasting 1\
  \ hour). This effect suspends the armor's bitter special ability if used on the\
  \ wearer. Once per day, the wearer can pull a tanglefoot bag from one of the apron's\
  \ pockets, although the bag crumbles into dust if it is not used within 1 minute."
