description: "By holding this fist-sized, sickly green gem and concentrating for 1\
  \ hour, the bearer can create a sphere of poisonous fog centered in a location the\
  \ bearer has seen that is within 1 mile of his current position. It must be centered\
  \ on a geographical point, so it can't target a specific person, but it can surround\
  \ that person if she is in the area the bearer targets. The sphere must be created\
  \ around an area of normal, safe air, of a size selected by the user when the sphere\
  \ is created, between 100 feet and 1 mile in diameter. This thickness of the fog\
  \ is always one-tenth the diameter of the safe area inside it, so a safe area 5,000\
  \ feet across is surrounded by a poisonous fog 500 feet thick. The sphere of fog\
  \ seeps through earth and liquids, but it does not penetrate worked stone. No amount\
  \ of wind can disperse the poisonous fog. The fetoring maw must remain within 10\
  \ miles of the center of the sphere, or the fog dissipates harmlessly.\nThe fetoring\
  \ maw can create only one sphere of poisonous fog at a time, and once a sphere is\
  \ created, the fetoring maw must recharge for 3 months before it can create another\
  \ one. The creature that created a sphere can dismiss it as a move action while\
  \ holding the gem, but the sphere otherwise lasts for 3 months or until the fetoring\
  \ maw is destroyed, whichever comes first.\nAny creature can pass through the poisonous\
  \ fog of the sphere's walls, though it obscures vision as per fog cloud. The fog\
  \ also includes poisonous vapors and bewildering mists, as described in The Fog\
  \ Dome on page 5. The creature that created the sphere can touch the fetoring maw\
  \ to the palm of a willing creature as a standard action, marking that target with\
  \ a skull-shaped brand that renders it immune to the fetoring maw's poison and mind-affecting\
  \ effects. A fetoring maw can mark up to 13 creatures in this manner every three\
  \ months."
destruction: "A fetoring maw can be destroyed by first immersing it in a mixture of\
  \ holy water blessed by a priest of a deity with the Healing domain and antitoxin,\
  \ in equal parts. For 1 minute after being immersed, the fetoring maw is weakened;\
  \ if dealt at least 10 points of damage in a single blow with a bludgeoning magic\
  \ weapon, the artifact shatters and any fog sphere it has created dissipates harmlessly."
