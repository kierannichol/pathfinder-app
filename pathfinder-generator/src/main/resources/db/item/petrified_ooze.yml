description: "This tiny blob of ooze looks like a small disc of green stone when inactive,\
  \ and is stored in a circular dish with an airtight cover. When the cover is removed\
  \ and the ooze is exposed to air, the user has 1 minute to handle the rapidly softening\
  \ ooze before it regains its former viscosity (as well as toxicity) and springs\
  \ back to life. Although much smaller than an actual ooze creature, this coin-sized\
  \ blob still deals 1d6 points of acid damage to anything it comes in contact with.\
  \ Due to its unpredictable nature, petrified ooze is typically only good for breaking\
  \ or melting whatever object or device on which the user originally sets the ooze,\
  \ after which the blob quickly scurries into the nearest corner or crevice so it\
  \ can feed on particles of dust and diminutive prey. Once restored to its viscous\
  \ form, a petrified ooze moves at a rate of 60 feet per round, and any creature\
  \ that comes in contact with the ooze must succeed at a DC 12 Reflex save to avoid\
  \ taking acid damage from it."
