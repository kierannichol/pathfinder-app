description: "This large wood-and-hide shield is similar to other Mwangi shields,\
  \ but the totem animal painted on the shield's face seems to move when the shield\
  \ is carried. Crafted by Mwangi shamans to grant its wielder the power of tribal\
  \ totem spirits, a Mwangi spirit shield functions as a +1 ghost touch light wooden\
  \ shield. Once per day on command, the shield can grant its bearer bull's strength\
  \ for 1 minute.\nOther versions of the Mwangi spirit shield exist; some are known\
  \ to grant cat's grace or bear's endurance to their wielders instead of bull's strength."
