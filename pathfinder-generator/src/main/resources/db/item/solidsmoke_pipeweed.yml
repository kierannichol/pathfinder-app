description: "When smoked in any pipe, this pinch of magical tobacco produces a languid,\
  \ milky-white smoke that the smoker can transform into useful objects. A halfling\
  \ who puffs on the pipe as a full-round action can shape the smoke into an object\
  \ weighing no more than 5 pounds and having a maximum volume of 1 cubic foot. The\
  \ halfling can, on following rounds, spend additional full-round actions to increase\
  \ the object's weight by 2 additional pounds and its volume by another cubic foot.\
  \ The halfling must succeed at an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item.\
  \ If the halfling stops puffing on her pipe for any reason before she finishes creating\
  \ the object, the figure in the smoke collapses and her pipe is extinguished. Objects\
  \ created by solidsmoke pipeweed last for 24 hours before fading away into vapor.\
  \ Objects created by the pipeweed have the same hardness, hit points, and other\
  \ qualities as manufactured objects of their type, but look smoky and indistinct.\
  \ Each pinch of solidsmoke pipeweed is sufficient for 3 full rounds of smoking.\
  \ A single larger item must be created with a single pinch of solidsmoke pipeweed,\
  \ so any item created with this pipeweed can't be larger than 9 pounds and 3 cubic\
  \ feet.\nA halfling cannot create an object designed to exactly duplicate or replace\
  \ another specific object. For instance, while she could create a smoky lock with\
  \ its own key, she could not puff smoke into an existing keyhole and then create\
  \ a key that would open that particular lock.\nThis smoke is caustic and chokes\
  \ non-halflings. It grants non-halflings no benefits, and each time they spend a\
  \ standard action to smoke the pipeweed, they are sickened for 1 round."
