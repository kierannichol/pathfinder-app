description: "This device is made of a strange metallic alloy. A bellows or tapered\
  \ accordion structure protrudes from the box, with handles and controls at the wide\
  \ end and a bright metal disk or lens at the other. The controls seem to have been\
  \ designed for operation by large creatures with only two fingers, though the smaller\
  \ but more agile hands of humanoids can manipulate them after some practice.\nAs\
  \ a standard action, the operator can hold the device in front of herself with two\
  \ hands and use the controls to unleash a blast that deals 10d12 points of electricity\
  \ damage on a successful ranged touch attack against a single target within 120\
  \ feet. The lightning blast sets fire to combustibles and damages objects that it\
  \ strikes. It can melt metals that have a low melting point, such as lead, gold,\
  \ copper, silver, or bronze."
