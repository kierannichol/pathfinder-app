description: "This ship's anchor is crafted of fused bones and skulls, but it has\
  \ the strength and hardness of iron. When attached to a ship by a rope or chain\
  \ and dropped into the water, the anchor increases its weight to properly anchor\
  \ the ship it is attached to. Once per day, the skeleton anchor can hold the ship\
  \ it is attached to immobile for up to 1 day, or until commanded to release.\nThe\
  \ greatest property of a skeleton anchor, however, is to summon undead skeletons\
  \ from the corpses of drowned mariners, who rise from the depths of the sea and\
  \ clamber up the sides of the ship to serve as its crew. The undead created by the\
  \ anchor are 1 Hit Die skeletons (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 250) that possess Profession\
  \ (sailor) scores of +7. Each skeleton can perform the duties of one crew member\
  \ but has no other abilities. The skeletons cannot speak, attack, or even defend\
  \ themselves. They are not proficient with any weapons or armor. The skeletons obey\
  \ the commands of the ship's captain or pilot, but they only obey orders pertaining\
  \ to the operation of a ship.\nA skeleton anchor can be used just once every 7 days\
  \ to create up to 28 skeletal crew members. The skeletons do not count against the\
  \ maximum total Hit Dice worth of undead creatures that the user can control. The\
  \ skeletons act as crew for 1 week or until dismissed by the ship's captain or pilot.\
  \ At the end of the week, the skeletons abandon the ship."
