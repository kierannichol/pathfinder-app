description: "This minute crystal vial contains a single drop distilled from the captured\
  \ dreams of a hundred different worlds. The drop can be poured into a vessel of\
  \ water, wine, or other drink, and shared between as many as nine recipients. If\
  \ not drunk within an hour of mixing, it loses potency. The imbibers drift into\
  \ sleep for at least 2d6 × 5 minutes (Will DC 17 negates). Anyone who sleeps for\
  \ at least 2 hours receives a +2 insight bonus on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma-based\
  \ skill checks for the next 24 hours.\nIf an imbiber expends two uses of mythic\
  \ power and envisions a destination as she falls asleep, she gains the benefits\
  \ above and sleeps for 2 hours before waking on a plane of her choice as though\
  \ using plane shift. Each imbiber who expends the uses of mythic power can travel\
  \ to a different plane. All imbibers traveling to the same plane wake up at the\
  \ same location on that plane."
