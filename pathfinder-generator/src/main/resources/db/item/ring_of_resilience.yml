description: "This tarnished copper band sheds its patina when worn by anyone with\
  \ panache or grit. Whenever the wearer regains a panache or grit point through her\
  \ actions (not just a daily refresh), she can try to end a single ongoing condition\
  \ affecting her, attempting a new saving throw against the original DC. The effect\
  \ must be one that allowed a saving throw, can be removed by either dispel magic\
  \ or heal, and be an effect against which the wearer failed her initial saving throw.\
  \ If the wearer succeeds at the new save, the effect is removed even if succeeding\
  \ at the save would normally have other consequences, and even if the effect normally\
  \ requires multiple saves to remove. If the effect allowed more than one type of\
  \ saving throw, use the type and DC for the first saving throw the wearer failed\
  \ for the effect. The wearer can use the ring only once for each ongoing condition.\
  \ As the wearer must regain a panache or grit point to reroll a save, the ring provides\
  \ no benefit if she hasn't used any grit or panache."
