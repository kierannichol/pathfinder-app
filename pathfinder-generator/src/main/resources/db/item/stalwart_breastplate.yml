description: "The burden of this weighty +1 light fortification breastplate gives\
  \ it an armor check penalty of â€“5. As an immediate action, the wearer can negate\
  \ the effects of a successful combat maneuver made to bull rush, overrun, or trip\
  \ her. As a swift action, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to gain\
  \ immunity to ability damage, ability drain, critical hits, and sneak attacks. This\
  \ effect lasts for 1 round per mythic tier the wearer possesses."
