description: "This gritty red paste makes you appear as if you were covered in dried\
  \ blood. When you apply imposing war paint as a full-round action, you gain a +4\
  \ alchemical bonus on Intimidate checks and the duration of any fear effects you\
  \ create increases by 50% as long as you wear the war paint. Unfortunately, imposing\
  \ war paint is made with realgar, which is toxic to living creatures. If you wear\
  \ imposing war paint for more than 1 minute per day, you take 1 point of Constitution\
  \ damage, plus 1 point of Constitution damage for every minute you wear the paint\
  \ that day after the first."
