description: "Carved from a mammoth tusk, this ivory flute is covered with delicate\
  \ carvings of wind blowing over waves, which are inlaid with silver. It functions\
  \ as a masterwork musical instrument, although the notes are pitched much lower\
  \ than most flutes and any tune, no matter how jauntily played, carries a mournful\
  \ quality.\nOnce per day, the user can attempt a DC 15 Perform (wind) check to summon\
  \ a bank of spectral fog. This effect functions as obscuring mist centered on the\
  \ user, except it moves with the user. The mist lasts for as long as the user continues\
  \ to play, to a maximum of 5 minutes. Spectral faces appear to anyone within the\
  \ mist other than the user, whispering for those within the mist to lay down their\
  \ burdens and rest. Anyone within the mist other than the user can elect to fall\
  \ asleep as a free action. Creatures asleep within the spectral fog heal 1 hit point\
  \ per minute spent sleeping, and recover 1 point of ability damage if they spend\
  \ at least 1 full minute asleep. Sleepers under this effect can be awakened normally."
