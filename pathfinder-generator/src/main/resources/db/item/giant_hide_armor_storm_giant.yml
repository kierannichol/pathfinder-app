description: "This drooping, many-folded suit of +3 hide armor is made from the tanned\
  \ skin of an actual giant. Once per day on command, the wearer can grow to match\
  \ the size of the appropriate giant, as if using giant form I (ogre, hill giant,\
  \ stone giant, fire giant, frost giant, or troll) or giant form II (cloud giant\
  \ or storm giant). This transformation lasts up to 15 minutes, and ends when the\
  \ wearer commands.\nMost good folk consider wearing the skins of intelligent creatures\
  \ to be abhorrent. Giants gain a +2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against\
  \ the wearer, or +4 if the wearer's armor is made from the same kind of giant as\
  \ the attacker."
