description: "The dark green orb on this silver necklace is covered in what looks\
  \ like thorns, but it's not sharp or painful to the touch. While wearing this amulet,\
  \ whenever you cast a spell that triggers a primal magic event, roll d% twice when\
  \ generating the result. You may pick which of the two results actually occurs.\
  \ Additionally, you gain a +2 bonus on all saving throws to resist primal magic\
  \ events. This bonus doesn't stack with other bonuses on saves to resist primal\
  \ magic events."
