description: "This little metal container holds a waxy fuel that creates enough heat\
  \ to cook with but only as much light as a candle. To snuff the flame, close the\
  \ metal lid on the container; it cools enough that it can be carried in a few minutes.\
  \ Each lasts 5 hours (enough to cook about 10 meals)."
