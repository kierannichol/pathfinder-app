description: "This finely polished wooden amulet has the image of a blindfolded medusa\
  \ carved upon its surface. Whenever the wearer fails a saving throw that would result\
  \ in him being turned to stone, he is instead staggered for 1d6 rounds. If a spell\
  \ or effect turns him to stone without allowing a saving throw, he is instead staggered\
  \ for 1 minute. These abilities do not function while the wearer is staggered."
