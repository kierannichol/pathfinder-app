description: "This deceptively complex weapon appears to be nothing more than a 12-foot\
  \ rope attached to a 6-inchlong, conical metal spike. Similar to a meteor hammer,\
  \ it can be whirled at great speeds, then aimed to strike and pierce opponents with\
  \ great reach. Once it strikes, the wielder can quickly retrieve the weapon with\
  \ a tug of the rope as a free action."
