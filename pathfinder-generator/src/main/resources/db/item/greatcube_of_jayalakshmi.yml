description: "Believed to be cut from the same mountain as the Stone Egg of Jayalakshmi,\
  \ this polished cube is 3 feet across and bears countless symbols, patterns, lines,\
  \ and tiny holes that pierce it no deeper than the thickness of a fingernail. Predominantly\
  \ a rich gray but veined with white and gold like luxurious marble, it is somehow\
  \ aligned to the flow of magical energy in its vicinity, and has been known to turn\
  \ itself suddenly, usually less than an inch but rarely a foot or more. Like the\
  \ Stone Egg it was once protected in a cave and studied until in 2804 AR a clever\
  \ supplicant found a way to transform it into a hand-sized replica of itself and\
  \ steal it away.\nThe Arclords of Nex possessed it for a time, though its disappearance\
  \ in 2822 may have played a role in their loss of Jalmeray to the rajahs. Anecdotal\
  \ evidence from the oldest record of the Shining Crusade mentions the Whispering\
  \ Tyrant having an item that matches its description, though it played no role in\
  \ any of their early battles. The gold dragon Mengkare claims he had it in his trove\
  \ shortly before the founding of his Great Experiment. Since that time it has turned\
  \ up in the hands of various strange mystics, petty magical tyrants, the church\
  \ of Nethys (who may have a book describing its powers and how to activate them),\
  \ and even a crafty linnorm, always for a short while before vanishing again.\n\
  In its large form, the cube encourages and enhances magic, similar to how its cousin\
  \ the Stone Egg works with psionics. Those near it with the potential to become\
  \ bards or sorcerers sometimes spontaneously cast their first cantrips. Wizards\
  \ gain insight to the formulae for new spells, clerics and druids hear echoes of\
  \ prayers lost to time.\nIf you know its secrets you can use the power of the cube\
  \ to duplicate the effects of an empowered, extended, maximized, quickened, or silent\
  \ greater metamagic rod, up to 8 enhanced spells per day, one cube-granted enhancement\
  \ per spell. You can use it as a rod of absorption, absorbing or releasing up to\
  \ 8 spell levels per day. You can use it as a spellbook, preparing spells from it\
  \ without needing read magic, and it contains knowledge of all common spells as\
  \ well as a few unusual ones. If you are a bard, sorcerer, or other spontaneous\
  \ caster you can use your own spell slots to cast spells the cube knows, even if\
  \ you do not know the spell yourself. Activating any of these powers requires you\
  \ to be sitting on the cube or touching it with one hand. It cannot be moved by\
  \ magic, only physical force; any attempts merely have no effect.\nTransforming\
  \ it to its hand-sized form or back requires a command word and takes 1 full round\
  \ for the transformation to complete. In its small form it retains its rod of absorption\
  \ powers and you can use it up to three times per day as a empowered, extended,\
  \ maximized, quickened, or silent lesser metamagic rod.\nThe cube may also contain\
  \ secrets of the planes and the strange colors between the stars, but doing so is\
  \ risky, and several users have gone mad in the attempts to learn unspeakable secrets—\
  but not before half-filling their spellbook or journal with dizzying runes and cryptic\
  \ phrases. Some believe the cube is partly sentient and has an agenda of its own,\
  \ and when it's bearer's path deviates from its goals it leaves, sometimes dramatically\
  \ and dangerously (such as Chelish mage Arrokos Vlen's sudden plummeting death when\
  \ the small cube made itself large while they were flying a mile above the ground)\
  \ or mysteriously (such as the hermit found in the Osirion desert crushed flat by\
  \ a large carved cube which was nowhere to be found)."
