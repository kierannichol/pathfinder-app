description: "This sealed vial contains a highly potent indigo liquid and is an essential\
  \ item for Dongun Hold miners, who often keep such vials handy for use against hostile\
  \ subterranean creatures. The vial can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range\
  \ increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 2d6 points of acid damage; this damage\
  \ is doubled against creatures made of crystal, earth, or metal. Every creature\
  \ within 5 feet of the impact takes 1 point of acid damage. Crafting mineral acid\
  \ requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
