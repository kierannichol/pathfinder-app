name: "Scroll of Seamantle"
description: "You sheathe yourself within a churning column of pure elemental water\
  \ up to 30 feet high that fills your space. You gain a swim speed equal to your\
  \ land speed and can see, hear, and breathe normally within the seamantle, but attacks\
  \ against you are treated as if you were under the surface of the water. You gain\
  \ improved cover (+8 cover bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves) against foes that\
  \ do not have freedom of movementeffects. The cover granted by the seamantledoes\
  \ not enable you to make Stealth checks or prevent attacks of opportunity. Magical\
  \ attacks against you are unaffected unless they require attack rolls or state that\
  \ they do not function underwater (such as cloudkill)."
