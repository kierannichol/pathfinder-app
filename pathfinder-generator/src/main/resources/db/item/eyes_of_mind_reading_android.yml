description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThese large goggles feature adjustable lenses.\
  \ When calibrated correctly, they sense the thoughts of a particular creature and\
  \ send them into the wearer's mind. If the wearer spends 3 rounds studying a creature,\
  \ spending a standard action each round to calibrate the lenses, she may scan a\
  \ target's surface thoughts as if she had spent 3 rounds studying the target with\
  \ detect thoughts. The target can attempt a DC 13 Will save to negate the effect.\
  \ The wearer must spend three consecutive standard actions each time she wishes\
  \ to read the mind of a new creature.\nIf the wearer is an android, he can spend\
  \ a nanite surge to immediately detect surface thoughts instead of concentrating\
  \ for 3 rounds."
