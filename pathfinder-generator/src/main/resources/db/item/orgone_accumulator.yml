description: "This cold-iron-lined wooden cabinet is the size of a large upright chest,\
  \ with just enough room inside for a Mediumsized creature to sit comfortably on\
  \ a small wooden seat. The cabinet is constructed of alternating layers of cold\
  \ iron sheets and slats of cypress wood insulated with sheep's wool, and is specially\
  \ crafted to attract and focus atmospheric energy to recharge the internal reservoirs\
  \ of characters capable of casting psychic magic.\nActivating an orgone accumulator\
  \ requires spending hours inside it while meditating. The creature must remain conscious,\
  \ taking no actions other than meditating. A creature inside the box that remains\
  \ in this state automatically gains a +2 bonus on saving throws to recover from\
  \ curses, diseases, and poisons. An orgone accumulator can also be used in conjunction\
  \ with the faith healing occult skill unlock. If the subject of the faith healing\
  \ is within the orgone accumulator, the creature attempting the Heal check for faith\
  \ healing gains a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.\nIn addition, a creature can\
  \ concentrate while within the box to gain the benefits of restorative spells. Each\
  \ of these spells lists a number of hours a user must remain meditating inside the\
  \ box. At the end of that time, the user must attempt a Wisdom check with the listed\
  \ DC to gain the benefits of the spell. A creature with the Psychic Sensitivity\
  \ feat or levels in an occult class gains a +2 bonus on this Wisdom check."
