description: "This hollow metal cylinder is etched with various religious symbols\
  \ and contains a reservoir of holy water. When you light its fuse (a move action),\
  \ a holy fountain firework fills a 10-foot-radius burst with holy water and bright\
  \ light for as long as it burns. Any creature in the affected area is treated as\
  \ though it had been struck with a flask of holy water, except a holy fountain firework\
  \ only deals 1d4 points of damage and does not harm creatures in spaces adjacent\
  \ to the affected area. Once ignited, the firework lasts for 1 minute.\nAs a standard\
  \ action, the firework can be extinguished before this time by being fully submerged\
  \ or forcing its tip into the ground or a similar surface, but the remaining duration\
  \ is wasted. A lit holy fountain firework can be picked up and moved, but the fountain's\
  \ burst of holy water and light doesn't function during this time and the creature\
  \ carrying the lit firework takes 1d4 points of fire damage each round she holds\
  \ it. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
