description: "The Chronicle of the Righteous is the collected records of the good\
  \ Outer Planes as written by the exiled angel Tabris, who was ordered to catalog\
  \ the lore of all the multiverse but was cast out of Heaven for his findings. The\
  \ pages pertaining to the good Outer Planes lie within covers of beaten precious\
  \ metals, bedecked with jewels of every color and inscribed with celestial iconography.\
  \ Only a truly reverent individual, completely devoted to good, can open the Chronicle\
  \ of the Righteous without an effort of will; for others, a successful DC 12 Will\
  \ save is required to open the book. On a failed save, the individual decides she\
  \ is unworthy of beholding the Chronicle and cannot attempt to open the book again\
  \ for 24 hours.\nThe Chronicle of the Righteous is written in Celestial. It details\
  \ the geography of the good-aligned planes, the gods, empyreal lords, and celestial\
  \ creatures who live there, and the unadulterated truths of these beings and their\
  \ acts—truths that are sometimes heartening and at other times unsettling. Any evil-aligned\
  \ creature who touches the Chronicle of the Righteous gains 1 negative level. This\
  \ level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away\
  \ from the book for 24 hours. Nongood creatures attempting to read the book must\
  \ succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have their alignment permanently take one step\
  \ toward good.\nA reader who spends 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) studying\
  \ the book receives several benefits. The book contains copies of every conjuration\
  \ (healing) spell and every spell with the good descriptor. The user gains a +4\
  \ bonus on all Knowledge (planes) checks if she uses the book as a resource (consulting\
  \ it for at least 1 hour regarding a question), and its descriptions of the good-aligned\
  \ planes are so accurate that any teleportation travel to or within those planes\
  \ always brings the caster to the exact location desired.\nAs long as the book is\
  \ carried, the user is immediately aware of any action that might cause an alignment\
  \ shift or a loss of standing with her deity, as if she wore a phylactery of faithfulness.\
  \ The Chronicle of the Righteous is also surrounded by a permanent zone of truth,\
  \ and creatures must succeed at a DC 15 Will save to tell a lie within 20 feet of\
  \ the book. The bearer of the book casts all good spells as if she were 2 caster\
  \ levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill\
  \ checks when interacting with good creatures. Three times per day, the book can\
  \ be used to cast one of the following spells: banishment, consecrate, greater planar\
  \ binding, holy smite, holy word, sanctify weapons, and summon monster VII. Each\
  \ time the Chronicle of the Righteous is referenced or used to cast a spell, there\
  \ is a 10% chance that any empyreal lords on the same plane as the user instantly\
  \ become aware of the book's precise location."
destruction: "The Chronicle of the Righteous can be destroyed by first bathing it\
  \ in the blood of a fallen empyreal lord who has killed at least 100 good mortals\
  \ and then burning it in a pit of hellfire."
