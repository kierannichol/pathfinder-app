description: "The front of this +1 bashing heavy steel shield looks as though it is\
  \ crafted from hundreds of bits of rubble and larger stones. When used to make a\
  \ shield bash attack, stones fall from shield and cling to the target of the shield\
  \ bash. The target must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or be entangled\
  \ for 1d4 rounds. Once per day on command, the target's wielder can choose to petrify\
  \ the target of a shield bash instead. The target must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude\
  \ saving throw or become petrified for 1 minute."
