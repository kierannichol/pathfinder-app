description: "This statue takes the form of a bull or a bull-headed humanoid. A hatch\
  \ in the idol's chest or side allows access to a hollow inside the statueâ€”this hatch\
  \ can be opened only from the outside. This hollow is typically large enough to\
  \ accommodate one Medium creature, though larger idols might accommodate more. One\
  \ round after a creature is placed inside, the idol's interior blazes with hellfire,\
  \ which deals 6d6 points of damage per round to any creature inside. Half the damage\
  \ is fire damage, but the other half results directly from unholy power and is therefore\
  \ not subject to reduction by resistance to firebased attacks. Pipes inside the\
  \ idol amplify the screams of those within, making them sound like the bellows of\
  \ an enraged bull. A creature inside the idol can break out through the locked door\
  \ by succeeding at a DC 30 Strength check, or by dealing enough damage (hardness\
  \ 15; hp 90; immune to fire damage). If a creature dies within the idol, all lawful\
  \ evil creatures within 100 feet gain the benefits of the spell bless for 1 hour."
