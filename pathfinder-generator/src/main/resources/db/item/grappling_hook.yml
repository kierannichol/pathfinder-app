description: "A grappling hook is usually thought of as a climbing instrument, but\
  \ is also used to grapple enemy ships and draw them close before a boarding action.\n\
  Grappling hooks bite deeply into the wood of the railing. It takes 1 minute to pry\
  \ a grappling hook free. The rope attached to a grappling hook can be cut, but pirates\
  \ often target the rigging and masts to make it difficult to remove the hooks. Tying\
  \ off the rope of a grappling hook is a move action.\nA grappling hook can also\
  \ be used as a ranged weapon. If you are proficient in the grappling hook, it is\
  \ a grappling weapon. On a successful critical hit with a weapon of this type, you\
  \ can grapple the target of the attack. You can attempt a combat maneuver check\
  \ to grapple your opponent as a free action. This grapple attempt does not provoke\
  \ an attack of opportunity from the creature you are attempting to grapple if that\
  \ creature is not threatening you. While you grapple the target with a grappling\
  \ weapon, you can only move or damage the creature on your turn. You are still considered\
  \ grappled, though you do not have to be adjacent to the creature to continue the\
  \ grapple. If you move far enough away to be out of the weapon's reach, the grapple\
  \ ends.\nA grappling hook's weight includes the weight of 50 feet of hemp rope.\
  \ It can be reduced by using shorter or lighter rope."
