description: "Images of a dwarf and human drinking together decorate the sides of\
  \ this 1-foot-tall granite stein, which is capped off with a rough-hewn orb of the\
  \ same material. When the user speaks the command word and places a watchful tankard\
  \ on a solid surface, such as a cavern ceiling or wooden table, the stein adheres\
  \ to the surface (with the equivalent of an 18 Strength score). The last creature\
  \ to drink from the stein can attempt Perception checks from the stein's location,\
  \ as well as from its own, as long as it is within 60 feet of the watchful tankard.\
  \ Any permanent vision-based bonuses (such as darkvision, low-light vision, or permanent\
  \ arcane sight) are also usable through the watchful tankard but are limited to\
  \ a range of 30 feet. It is possible to attempt Perception checks from the stein's\
  \ point of view only while it is adhered to a solid surface in this way. Grabbing\
  \ the handle and repeating the command word frees the watchful tankard from this\
  \ location."
