description: "Once the fortress of a legendary tyrant known only as the Storm King,\
  \ this castle now wanders the known universe, sometimes at the whim of its master,\
  \ but often as a drifting and aimless haunt of powerful monsters, ignorant of—or\
  \ unable to tap into—its fantastic power.\nThis grand and opulent castle is held\
  \ aloft and propelled by a foundation of storm clouds constantly rumbling with thunder\
  \ and crackling with electrical storms. Atop the massive storm cloud, the castle\
  \ is shaped like a square, with 80-foot guard towers at each corner. At its center\
  \ is a 140-foot tower with seven levels and more than 30 chambers. The central tower\
  \ is well appointed with many halls, living chambers, suites, privies, kitchens\
  \ (with pantries that magically replenish food stores every fortnight), and laboratories\
  \ suitable for arcane and alchemical study. Each guard tower has living chambers\
  \ and barracks for up to 25 guards, and one tower has an adjoining stable that can\
  \ hold up to a dozen griffons, hippogriffs, pegasi, or even terrestrial mounts.\
  \ In all, the tower can comfortably support a population of 300 Medium creatures.\n\
  In order to fully take control of the castle, a creature must be at least 17th level,\
  \ and must have the Leadership feat and 17 ranks in Knowledge (arcana). If the castle\
  \ already has a master, that master must be defeated before another can take her\
  \ place. The castle's movement is controlled by way of a control chamber located\
  \ at the heart (a central chamber on its 4th floor). There, a font of pure elemental\
  \ water serves as a scrying device for the castle's master, though it can view only\
  \ places inside the castle or within 100 feet of it. The master (or a person she\
  \ designates) can direct the castle's motion from within the chamber. It has a fly\
  \ speed of 250 feet (clumsy) and uses the Fly skill modifier of the person controlling\
  \ its motion; the castle can hover without needing to make a Fly check and never\
  \ risks falling due to a failed check. When not being controlled, the castle moves\
  \ randomly, sometimes changing direction every minute, sometimes holding the same\
  \ course for days at a time, but always avoiding the ground or other hazards. It\
  \ has the ability to travel to other planes, though no master other than the Storm\
  \ King is known to have invoked this power. The master of the castle gains the following\
  \ spell-like abilities."
destruction: "The Cloud Castle of the Storm King can only be destroyed if it is dissipated\
  \ by suitably strong winds; the only winds that can dissipate it are found only\
  \ in the most turbulent reaches of the Plane of Air (of course, as nobody knows\
  \ how to make it travel between planes, those wishing to destroy it must find it\
  \ on the Plane of Air to have any chance to do so). Any other attacks may cause\
  \ walls to collapse or even side towers to break loose, but the central chamber\
  \ and the floors beneath it will continue to exist in a ruined form over a smaller\
  \ storm cloud as long as this destruction condition is not met."
