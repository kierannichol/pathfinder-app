description: "This is a straw-stuffed wire frame of a monstrous creature, wrapped\
  \ in burlap and coated in the musk of that particular creature. When using the Handle\
  \ Animal skill to teach the attack trick, having a monster dummy present allows\
  \ the trainer to add whatever creature type the dummy represents to the list of\
  \ creatures the animal will attack. The dummy also provides a +2 bonus on Handle\
  \ Animal checks to teach animals to attack all kinds of creatures."
