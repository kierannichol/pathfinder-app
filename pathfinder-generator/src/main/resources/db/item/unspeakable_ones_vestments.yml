description: "This robe functions much as a robe of stars, granting its wearer the\
  \ luck bonus on saving throws, astral travel, and ability to create shuriken made\
  \ of magically hardened gold. In addition, the wearer gains a +4 armor bonus to\
  \ his AC.\nThe robe's curse activates after 1 month of being worn regularly, or\
  \ just as a creature whose patron is Hastur or Xhamen-Dor affects the wearer with\
  \ a spell or special ability. The wearer loses his luck bonus on saving throws against\
  \ such effects and instead takes a â€“4 penalty on those saves. While the curse persists,\
  \ the wearer takes 1d4 points of Wisdom drain every time he uses the robe to access\
  \ the Astral Plane, and the shuriken created are +5 anarchic shuriken. After another\
  \ month of continuous use, the wearer permanently becomes chaotic evil and pursues\
  \ increasingly delusional goals of domination, enrichment, or anarchy. Once donned,\
  \ this robe can be removed only with a remove curse spell."
