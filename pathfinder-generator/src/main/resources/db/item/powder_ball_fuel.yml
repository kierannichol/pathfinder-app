description: "This steel sphere is about the size of a standard cannon ball, though\
  \ it's significantly lighter. Small holes pock the surface of the sphere, which\
  \ can be unscrewed into two hemispherical pieces. By filling the intricate hollows\
  \ in an opened powder ball with a specific mixture of volatile chemical reagents\
  \ (which can typically be purchased in Highhelm for around 200 gp) and inserting\
  \ a proprietary fuse, an individual can use the weapon as a time-delayed explosive\
  \ device, throwing it as a splash weapon or simply placing it where she wants it\
  \ to explode. The fuse can be ignited as a move action; 1d4 rounds afterward, the\
  \ powder ball explodes, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage to anything in a 10-foot-radius\
  \ burst (DC 15 for half). A powder ball explodes in this way three timesâ€” the second\
  \ explosion occurs 1d3 rounds after the initial explosion, and the third explosion\
  \ occurs 1d2 rounds after the second. After the third explosion, the empty powder\
  \ ball can be refilled and used again."
