description: "Twice per day, as a swift action when the wielder of this +1 heavy wrist\
  \ launcher makes an attack with the weapon, he can have the launcher make no sound,\
  \ and can instead create a false sound of a crossbow being fired from another location\
  \ within 40 feet of him. In addition, for 6 rounds, any auras upon the wielder that\
  \ would normally be revealed by divination spells, such as detect spells, are redirected\
  \ to the same location as the crossbow sound."
