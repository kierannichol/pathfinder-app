name: "Scroll of Primal Scream"
description: "You voice a mighty yell from the depths of your soul, invigorating yourself\
  \ and dispelling enchantment and paralysis effects. This functions as break enchantment,\
  \ except it only affects you and only frees you from enchantment and paralysis effects.\
  \ If the caster level check to break the hostile effect succeeds, you give voice\
  \ to your scream and the spell takes effect normally; if not, this spell fails without\
  \ further effect. You can cast this spell even when paralyzed or unable to speak\
  \ because of an enchantment effect, but not in an area of silence , if you are unable\
  \ to speak for reasons other than enchantments or paralysis (for example, if you\
  \ are gagged), or if cast in an environment where speaking is not possible."
