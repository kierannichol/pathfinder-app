description: "A set of lithomancy stones contains 15 semi-precious stones of varying\
  \ shape and color, representing a mixture of elements, emotions, and various spiritual\
  \ presences from the outer planes. Once per day, the possessor of a set of lithomancy\
  \ stones can frame a question in her mind, cast the stones upon the ground, and\
  \ attempt a reading with a Knowledge (planes) check to find the answer to her question.\
  \ The check takes 1 minute, and the DC depends on the time frame of the question.\
  \ The DC for a question regarding the next 30 minutes is 20. A question regarding\
  \ the next day has a DC of 30, and a question about the next week has a DC of 40.\
  \ The GM rolls the check in secret. If the possessor fails the check by 5 or more,\
  \ she receives a false or misleading reading. If the possessor fails the check by\
  \ less than 5, it yields no result. A successful check reveals information similar\
  \ to that gained through a successful augury (for a reading about the next 30 minutes)\
  \ or divination (for longer readings), which is communicated by the relative position\
  \ of the stones.\nIn addition to this function, lithomancy stones can be used as\
  \ an additional focus for augury, divination, or similar spells to increase the\
  \ chance of receiving correct information by 10% (to a maximum of 90%)."
