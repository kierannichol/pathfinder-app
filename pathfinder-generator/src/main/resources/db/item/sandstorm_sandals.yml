description: "These sandals are made of cloth and animal hide stitched to wood blocks\
  \ that elevate them an inch off the ground. Monks often wear them as they roam across\
  \ the deserts of northern G arund, traveling with no food or water to perfect their\
  \ physical forms. The wearer of sandstorm sandals leaves no trace while traveling\
  \ in desert environments.\nIf the wearer possesses the flurry of blows class feature,\
  \ anytime he makes an unarmed flurry of blows while standing on sand or dirt, a\
  \ minor storm appears around him for 1 round. Any creature that ends its movement\
  \ within 5 feet of the wearer during this time takes 1 point of nonlethal damage.\
  \ While the storm is active, the sandals' wearer gains concealment (20% miss chance)."
