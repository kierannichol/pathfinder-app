description: "This fashionable silken shawl is incredibly light. Once per day on command,\
  \ a phantom entourage surrounds its wearer with 1d4+2 illusions of attractive socialites.\
  \ These illusions cluster closely around the wearer, laugh at his jokes, and generally\
  \ stroke his ego with fawning flattery. This functions similarly to a mirror image\
  \ spell, except an attacker has a 50% chance of ignoring the effect (as the illusions\
  \ don't match the wearer). In addition, for every two illusory socialites the wearer\
  \ currently has attending to him, he gains a +1 circumstance bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy,\
  \ and Perform (sing) checks and takes a –2 penalty on Stealth checks. This effect\
  \ lasts for 6 hours."
