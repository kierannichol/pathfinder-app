description: "This large container, crafted from an animal horn or woven of wicker,\
  \ overflows with fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Up to three times per day, it can\
  \ be inverted to pour forth delicious food equal to a casting of create food and\
  \ water for up to six people. Though the cornucopia produces no water, the succulent\
  \ fruits slake normal thirst.\nIf the user expends one use of mythic power when\
  \ inverting the horn, it instead produces a heroes' feast that also refreshes the\
  \ partakers as though they had rested for a full 8 hours sleep. Creatures with the\
  \ recuperation ability (see page 12) who dine on this feast recover as though they\
  \ had rested for the hour required by the recuperation ability, with no need to\
  \ expend additional uses of mythic power. Eating more than one such feast within\
  \ a single day provides no additional benefit."
