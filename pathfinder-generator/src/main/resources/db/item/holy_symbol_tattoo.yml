description: "In some religions, you are allowed to tattoo or brand your deity's holy\
  \ symbol onto your skin (typically the palm, back of the hand, or forearm) in a\
  \ special ceremony. Thereafter, it functions like an actual holy symbol of your\
  \ faith, and you may use it as a divine focus for spellcasting, channeling energy,\
  \ and so on. The tattoo must be fully visible to use it in this way (it cannot be\
  \ covered with a glove, gauntlet, or any other material). The listed price includes\
  \ the cost of a simple brand or non-fading black tattoo; add appropriate tattoo\
  \ costs if you want something more elaborate. Specifically damaging or erasing the\
  \ tattoo or brand negates its use as an actual holy symbol."
