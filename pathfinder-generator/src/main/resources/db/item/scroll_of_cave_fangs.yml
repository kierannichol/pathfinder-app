name: "Scroll of Cave Fangs"
description: "You create a magical trap in the area that causes deadly stalactites\
  \ or stalagmites to lurch out of the floor or ceiling of a stone surface to â€œbite\"\
  \ an intruder. The magical trap is triggered whenever a Small or larger creature\
  \ (other than you or your animal companion, familiar, or spirit animal) moves through\
  \ the affected area. The effect of cave fangs depends on whether you create stalactites\
  \ or stalagmites (see below). You can place these trapped squares anywhere within\
  \ the spell's range; they need not be adjacent to each other, and you can create\
  \ any mix of stalactites and stalagmites you wish. Cave fangs can be detected and\
  \ disarmed as per a magical trap with successful DC 30 Perception and Disable Device\
  \ checks. All trapped squares created by a single casting are linked, and they are\
  \ all disabled if one of them is. If you place the traps in an area that is occupied\
  \ by a creature, the spell effect is triggered at the completion of the casting."
