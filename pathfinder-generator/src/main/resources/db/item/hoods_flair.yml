description: "These garish tokens usually take the form of a colorful adornment for\
  \ a weapon; attaching a token takes a full-round action and provokes attacks of\
  \ opportunity. Once per day, when a token is tied to a ranged weapon or thrown melee\
  \ weapon that the user is wielding, she can use that token's ability, as described\
  \ below. If the bearer has a grit or panache pool, she can spend grit or panache\
  \ points to gain one additional use per point spent. A character can benefit from\
  \ only one token at a time; securing a second token to a weapon provides no additional\
  \ effects. There are four types of tokens, each offering a different benefit.\n\
  Black Feather: As a swift action when she takes a 5-foot step, the user can move\
  \ an additional 5 feet, for a total of 10 feet. This additional movement provokes\
  \ attacks of opportunity as normal.\nBrass Leaf: When the wielder user this token\
  \ as a swift action, her allies don't provide cover against her ranged attacks until\
  \ the end of her turn.\nSilver Chime: When the user misses with a ranged attack\
  \ because of concealment, as a swift action she can reroll her miss chance percentile\
  \ roll to see whether she actually hits.\nTeal Bead: While making a ranged attack,\
  \ the user doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity."
