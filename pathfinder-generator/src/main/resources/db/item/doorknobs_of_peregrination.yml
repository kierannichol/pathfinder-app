description: "These matching doorknobs or handles with latches are made of solid brass\
  \ and are inscribed with unusual spiraling patterns that appear to be merely decorative.\n\
  To use the doorknobs of peregrination, a user affixes the pair of them upon two\
  \ entirely separate, unconnected portals. When one of the doors is opened by means\
  \ of one such doorknob, it causes the other door to open as well, and the user and\
  \ anyone with him can step through the opening as if the two doors were one. The\
  \ doorknobs have a range of 400 feet; if the two doors are farther apart, the doorknobs\
  \ of peregrination don't function, and if the door on either side is locked, stuck,\
  \ or otherwise secured, the doorknob fails to open the first door (even if the second\
  \ door is the one that is locked).\nDoorknobs of peregrination can be removed and\
  \ placed on a variety of doors as often as desired (placing a doorknob is a standard\
  \ action, as is removing one). They can be placed upon different types of doors,\
  \ as long as the surface of each door is solid rather than open-air. Thus, the knob\
  \ can't function on a gate or portcullis, but it works on an otherwise solid door\
  \ with a small, sliding window (such as a prison door) as long as the window is\
  \ closed at the time of use. A knob can be placed upon a door and activated to connect\
  \ with its twin, and the user can remove the first knob while the door is open as\
  \ a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity in order to bring it\
  \ with him when he steps through. If he does so, the magic of the portal lasts for\
  \ 1 additional round and then fades."
