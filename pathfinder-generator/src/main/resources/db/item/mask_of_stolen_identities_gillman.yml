description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis simple, pale porcelain mask has large,\
  \ circular eye-holes. Twice per day, the wearer can speak a command word and make\
  \ a touch attack against a humanoid creature as a free action. If he hits, the mask\
  \ alters the wearer's appearance to match the creature touched as per alter self.\
  \ If the touch misses, the activation is wasted. Unlike a typical polymorph effect,\
  \ the disguise is a good likeness of the specific individual and grants a +10 bonus\
  \ on Disguise checks to pass as that individual. The mask melds into the wearer's\
  \ face, leaving only an extremely fine seam that can be noticed with a successful\
  \ Perception check opposed by the user's Disguise check. The effect lasts until\
  \ the wearer removes the mask or uses it to assume a new form.\nIf the wearer is\
  \ a gillman, he can concentrate on one simple question that could be answered in\
  \ 25 words or fewer when he activates the mask. If he does so, he learns what the\
  \ target thinks is the question's answer when the touch attack hits, unless the\
  \ target succeeds at a DC 17 Will saving throw."
