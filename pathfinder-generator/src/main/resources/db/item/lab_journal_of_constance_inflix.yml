description: "The steel cover of this slim journal has taken its fair share of abuse;\
  \ acid scars and minor slag spots show where the journal was subjected to intense\
  \ working conditions. Equations, balances, and chemical notations mark the margins\
  \ of the pagesâ€”with some formulae, it is difficult to tell where the notes end and\
  \ the formula begins."
