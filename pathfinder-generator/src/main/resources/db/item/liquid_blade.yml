description: "You can empty the contents of this palm-sized metal tube with a quick\
  \ flick of your wrist (a move action), causing the bubbling transparent liquid within\
  \ to instantly solidify into a jagged crystalline blade. By holding the tube, you\
  \ can then use the crystalline blade as if it were a Medium short sword with the\
  \ fragile quality (see page 22). The blade lasts for 10 minutes, after which it\
  \ evaporates, leaving nothing behind but the tube. You can add one dose of poison\
  \ to the liquid in the bottle, which acts like applying a dose of poison to a weapon\
  \ except it is a fullround action; when the liquid turns into a solid blade, the\
  \ weapon includes one application of that poison. When the blade evaporates, the\
  \ poison does so as well. Crafting a liquid blade is a DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check."
