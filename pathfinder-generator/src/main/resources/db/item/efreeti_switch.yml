description: "An efreeti switch is the activation device for efreeti cord; it measures\
  \ approximately 6 inches in length and is made of a supple, red-brown alchemical\
  \ compound. It is not consumed when activating a length of cord, and it can be used\
  \ with any length of efreeti cord. It's possible to key lengths of efreeti cord\
  \ to a specific switch; however, this doubles the price of both the efreeti cord\
  \ and the switch."
