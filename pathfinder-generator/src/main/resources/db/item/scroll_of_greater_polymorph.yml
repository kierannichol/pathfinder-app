name: "Scroll of Greater Polymorph"
description: "This spell functions as polymorph except that it allows the creature\
  \ to take on the form of a dragon or plant creature. If you use this spell to cause\
  \ the target to take on the form of an animal or magical beast, it functions as\
  \ beast shape IV. If the form is that of an elemental, the spell functions as elemental\
  \ body III. If the form is that of a humanoid, the spell functions as alter self.\
  \ If the form is that of a plant, the spell functions as plant shape II. If the\
  \ form is that of a dragon, the spell functions as form of the dragon I. The subject\
  \ may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the\
  \ spell."
