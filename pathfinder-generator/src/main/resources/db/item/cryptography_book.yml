description: "You can consult this book while attempting a Linguistics check to understand\
  \ or create a coded message; doing so makes the task take 10 times longer than normal\
  \ but grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on your check. The DC to decipher a message\
  \ encoded with a cypher you invent is equal to the result of the Linguistics check\
  \ you roll when creating the cypher. You can instead use one of the dozen example\
  \ cyphers in the book, in which case the DC to understand the message without the\
  \ cypher is 25, and any characters attempting to decipher the message do so automatically\
  \ if they consult a copy of the same book."
