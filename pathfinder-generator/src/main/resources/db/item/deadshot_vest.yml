description: "This rough vest of black snakeskin is decorated with a fringe of rawhide\
  \ tassels, each knotted around a bit of bone or a small animal skull. A gunslinger\
  \ with the deadeye deed reduces the grit point cost to use that deed by 1 (minimum\
  \ 1 grit).\nIn addition, once per day when the wearer reduces a creature to 0 or\
  \ fewer hit points with a firearm she can use death knell (Will DC 13 negates) against\
  \ that target as a swift action. She does not have to touch the target to activate\
  \ this ability, but her range increment penalty for shooting the target also applies\
  \ to the saving throw DC of the death knell (for example, if the range increment\
  \ penalty is â€“2, the DC is 11)."
