description: "These tiny spheres, crafted from a dull gray material and studded with\
  \ tiny copper protuberances, come in sets of four. As a standard action, a user\
  \ can throw four or more spheres at a single target as a ranged touch attack with\
  \ a 30-foot range increment. On a hit, the spheres explode outward, forming an immobile\
  \ cage of semi-solid lightning around the target. Any creature attempting to pass\
  \ through the cage wall automatically takes 10d6 points of electricity damage. Four\
  \ lightning trap spheres thrown simultaneously can capture a Medium target, eight\
  \ spheres can capture a Large target, 12 spheres can capture a Huge target, and\
  \ 16 spheres can capture a Gargantuan target. The trap persists for 1 minute for\
  \ each set of spheres used, then dissipates, consuming the spheres in the process.\
  \ The price above is for a set of four lightning trap spheres."
