description: "At first glance, this circlet of plaited hair interwoven with a single\
  \ gold thread appears to be nothing more than a personal memento or a lover's token.\
  \ Closer examination reveals that each strand of hair seems to have neither a beginning\
  \ nor an end. Most of these braids are blonde in color, but other hues are not unknown.\n\
  Up to three times per day, the wearer of a fate-woven braid of the norns can potentially\
  \ negate a disastrous turn of fortune. Upon rolling a natural 1 on a saving throw\
  \ or after failing a saving throw against a death effect, the wearer can activate\
  \ the braid as a free action to reroll the saving throw.\nThe golden thread is vulnerable\
  \ to severe twists of fate, though. If the result of any reroll obtained by the\
  \ braid is ever a natural 20, the golden thread frays, permanently reducing the\
  \ braid's daily reroll uses by one. If all three daily uses are eliminated in this\
  \ manner, the golden thread snaps and the fate-woven braid of the norns falls apart\
  \ into a nonmagical pile of wispy gray hair. A fate-woven braid of the norns uses\
  \ up the entire wrists slot, even though the user wears only one at a time. The\
  \ user can't use another item (even another fate-woven braid of the norns) that\
  \ also uses the wrists slot."
