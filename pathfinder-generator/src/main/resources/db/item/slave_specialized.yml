description: "Sentient creatures sold to perform a multitude of tasks all fall under\
  \ the category of slaves. Most slaves are kept to do menial jobs, but sometimes\
  \ slaves perform specialized tasks such as spellcasting or teaching. Slaves vary\
  \ in quality; the price may be half as much for old or infirm slaves, or several\
  \ times more for healthy, attractive specimens."
