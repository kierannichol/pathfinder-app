description: "This one-handed axe is short (roughly 1 foot long) and designed for\
  \ use with one hand. Unlike throwing axes, it is not well balanced for a graceful\
  \ tumbling motion, and is instead heavier at its head. Tomahawks, war hatchets,\
  \ and other such names usually refer to hand axes."
