description: "Each of these +2 glamered chain shirts bears a permanent illusion of\
  \ being a fantastic ebon gown of peerless design or a royal suit of nighted hues.\
  \ Yet those who see past the illusion find a strange padding within the armor, stitched\
  \ skins of macabre origins filled with locks of delicate hair, dyed in devil's blood.\
  \ Those who wear the armor find that they can see in even the most abysmal darkness\
  \ as per a devil's ability to see in darkness (seeing through even magical darkness\
  \ as if it were full light). In addition, the wearer finds that he can understand\
  \ Infernal perfectly, though the armor does not grant the ability to speak it.\n\
  Nightskin is a fundamentally evil armor and any wearer of good alignment is treated\
  \ as being sickened for as long as the armor is worn."
