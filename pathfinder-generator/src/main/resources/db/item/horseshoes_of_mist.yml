description: "When a horse is shod with these horseshoes, they give off a puff of\
  \ mist each time a hoof strikes the earth. On the rider's command, the mount and\
  \ the rider are both affected as if subject to a gaseous form spell. If for some\
  \ reason the rider and the mount become separated from one another while in gaseous\
  \ form, the effect automatically ends for both. The horseshoes can be used for 10\
  \ minutes per day. The duration need not be consecutive, but it must be spent in\
  \ 1-minute increments."
