description: "The bone handle of this +1 wounding dagger is engraved with imagery\
  \ of fierce beasts. Once per day as a standard action, the dagger can be driven\
  \ into a target's appendage by making a melee attack with a –5 penalty. If this\
  \ attack hits, the dagger drives itself into the bone of the creature, giving the\
  \ creature a –2 penalty on attacks, damage rolls, and Reflex saves for 1 minute.\
  \ The dagger can be removed by the target or another adjacent creature with a successful\
  \ DC 15 Strength check. The dagger also grants a +4 competence bonus on skill checks\
  \ attempted in conjunction with the Harvest Parts feat."
