description: "This +2 adamantine bastard sword becomes a +5 unholy adamantine bastard\
  \ sword in the hands of an antipaladin.\nWhile wielded by an antipaladin, a bastard's\
  \ sting deals 2d6 points of negative energy damage to all living creatures that\
  \ start their turn adjacent to the wielder. The antipaladin also gains fast healing\
  \ 5 as long as at least one living creature takes damage from this negative energy.\
  \ This negative energy has no effect on undead. The sword also enables the antipaladin\
  \ to use unholy blight at will on command at the class level of the antipaladin.\
  \ Paladins take a â€“2 saving throw penalty against this effect."
