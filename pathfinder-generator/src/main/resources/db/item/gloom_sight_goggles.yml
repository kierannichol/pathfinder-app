description: "These nonmagical goggles are set with a piece of alchemically treated,\
  \ black, obsidianlike stone found in the mountainous regions of the Shadow Plane.\
  \ Gloom sight goggles interact with the unique eyes of fetchlings in such a way\
  \ that when the goggles are worn over both eyes, they expand the range of a fetchling's\
  \ darkvision to 90 feet, but the fetchling also gains the light sensitivity weakness.\
  \ Other races cannot see through the lenses of these goggles, and they have no affect\
  \ on fetchlings whose eyes have been modified by the Gloom Sight feat. Though they\
  \ are alchemical rather than magical in nature, these goggles take up the magic\
  \ item eye slot."
