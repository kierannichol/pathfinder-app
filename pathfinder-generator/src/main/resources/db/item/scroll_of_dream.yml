name: "Scroll of Dream"
description: "You, or a messenger you touch, send a message to others in the form\
  \ of a dream. At the beginning of the spell, you must name the recipient or identify\
  \ him or her by some title that leaves no doubt as to identity. The messenger then\
  \ enters a trance, appears in the intended recipient's dream, and delivers the message.\
  \ The message can be of any length, and the recipient remembers it perfectly upon\
  \ waking. The communication is one-way. The recipient cannot ask questions or offer\
  \ information, nor can the messenger gain any information by observing the dreams\
  \ of the recipient."
