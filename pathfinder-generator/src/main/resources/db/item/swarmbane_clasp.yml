description: "An ancient fossilized insect lies trapped within this ornate amber clasp,\
  \ impaled by the long golden pin that fastens the wearer's cloak. The wearer's weapons,\
  \ unarmed attacks, and natural attacks deal full damage to swarms, regardless of\
  \ the swarm's immunity to weapon damage (if any, although damage reduction applies\
  \ as normal). If the wearer is damaged by a swarm, she automatically succeeds on\
  \ her saving throw against the swarm's distraction ability."
