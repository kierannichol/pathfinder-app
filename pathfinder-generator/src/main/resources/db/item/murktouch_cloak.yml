description: "This lustrous crimson cloak has an ethereal quality to it, and is unnaturally\
  \ light. When the wearer speaks the item's command word, a murktouch cloak dissolves\
  \ into a vortex of red fog that churns around her and extends her awareness.\nThe\
  \ fog forms a 15-foot-radius emanation around the wearer and remains centered on\
  \ her for as long as the cloak is activated. All creatures in the fog gain concealment\
  \ (20% miss chance), but the wearer has blindsight within the area. The vortex is\
  \ unaffected by wind or any similar effect.\nWhenever the wearer casts a spell or\
  \ uses an ability that requires a successful touch attack, she can attempt that\
  \ touch attack against any creature within the fog, even if she is not adjacent\
  \ to the targeted creature.\nThe cloak can be activated for up to 10 rounds per\
  \ day, though these rounds need not be consecutive. Its magic can be dismissed as\
  \ a free action."
