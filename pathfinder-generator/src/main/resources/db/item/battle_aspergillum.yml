description: "Named for the common aspergillum, a macelike tool used by priests to\
  \ sprinkle holy water, this light mace has a hollow head and a metal plug closing\
  \ off the hole through which the head is filled. When the mace strikes a creature,\
  \ holy water sprinkles out through tiny holes throughout the weapon's head; creatures\
  \ subject to damage from holy water take 1 point of damage in addition to the normal\
  \ effect of being struck by the mace (a nonmagical aspergillum can deal holy water\
  \ damage to an incorporeal creature in this manner, even if the mace itself deals\
  \ no damage). After 5 hits, the battle aspergillum is empty and needs to be refilled.\
  \ Filling it with holy water is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity\
  \ (like drinking a potion). A filled aspergillum is normally carried upright, to\
  \ prevent the holy water from leaking out as the weapon moves."
