description: "This beetle-shaped pin enables its wearer to detect any golem within\
  \ 60 feet, although he must concentrate (a standard action) in order for the detection\
  \ to take place. A scarab enables its bearer to combat golems with weapons, unarmed\
  \ attacks, or natural weapons as if those golems had no damage reduction."
