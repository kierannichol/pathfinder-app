name: "Scroll of Magic Jar"
description: "By casting magic jar, you place your soul in a gem or large crystal\
  \ (known as the magic jar), leaving your body lifeless. Then you can attempt to\
  \ take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the magic jar. You may move\
  \ back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to\
  \ possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own\
  \ body, leaving the receptacle empty. To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within\
  \ spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight\
  \ or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is,\
  \ as near as anyone can tell, dead."
