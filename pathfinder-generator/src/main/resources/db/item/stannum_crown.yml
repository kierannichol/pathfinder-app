description: "Though polished to a silvery gleam, the metal of this velvetcapped crown\
  \ is simple tin. Occult scholars believe the first stannum crowns were created by\
  \ a mad psychic king who had become convinced that entities from other planes were\
  \ watching and plotting against him.\nThe crown is powered by its wearer's paranoia\
  \ and mistrust, using them to grant the wearer immunity to mind-affecting effects\
  \ and divinations that gather information about him. The wearer can't lower this\
  \ immunity without removing the crown. Donning a stannum crown saps the wearer's\
  \ mind, imposing a –2 penalty to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Removing the\
  \ crown negates the penalty, but the wearer's enhanced paranoia makes him unwilling\
  \ to doff the headdress.\nHe can try to remove the crown once per day by attempting\
  \ a Will save (DC = 25 + the number of consecutive days the crown has been worn).\
  \ Once the DC becomes 35 or higher, the wearer's paranoia has progressed to the\
  \ point where he no longer treats any other creature as an ally and attempts saving\
  \ throws against even harmless spells and abilities. At this point, a natural 20\
  \ is not an automatic success on the saving throw to remove the crown, and the wearer\
  \ never counts as a willing target for the purposes of another's spell or ability,\
  \ even when he is unconscious. Other creatures can't remove the crown by force;\
  \ only the wearer can take it off."
destruction: "A stannum crown can be destroyed only by placing it on the head of a\
  \ sentient being who is truly incapable of mistrust. This destroys the crown, but\
  \ leaves the creature with the powers and drawbacks of the crown, forever unable\
  \ to remove or ameliorate them."
