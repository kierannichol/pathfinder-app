description: "A character who dons this battered robe notes that its patches rearrange\
  \ into the shapes of various helpful but mundane items. Only the wearer of the robe\
  \ can see the true shapes of these patches, recognize them for what items they become,\
  \ and detach them. One patch can be detached each round. Detaching a patch causes\
  \ it to become an actual item, as indicated below. A newly created robe of useful\
  \ items always has two each of the following patches:"
