description: "Essentially a longer version of a scimitar, but with a thinner blade,\
  \ the elven curve blade is exceptionally rare. You receive a +2 circumstance bonus\
  \ to your CMD whenever a foe attempts to sunder your elven curve blade because of\
  \ its flexible metal.\nYou can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity\
  \ modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls with an elven curve\
  \ blade that is sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon."
