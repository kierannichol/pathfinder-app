description: "This +1 keen spear has a crimson haft made of petrified redwood, and\
  \ its blackened stone head sports numerous vicious barbs on each side. Once per\
  \ day when the wielder confirms a critical hit against a creature with this weapon,\
  \ in addition to dealing damage, he can command the spear to turn the struck creature\
  \ to stone. The creature struck must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or instantly\
  \ become a mindless statue as flesh to stone. This effect traps the bloodstone impaler\
  \ in the process, making it unusable as long as it remains embedded in the statue.\
  \ A bloodstone impaler may be removed from a lapidified creature by a humanoid capable\
  \ of wielding it who succeeds at a DC 25 Strength check; doing so is a full-round\
  \ action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Removing a bloodstone impaler from\
  \ a petrified victim instantly changes the creature back to its original form."
