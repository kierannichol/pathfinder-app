description: "These metal boots are engraved with the imagery of The Keep, and evoke\
  \ the unwavering determination represented by that card. The boots can be used as\
  \ an immovable rod, even when worn. If the boots are moved, the wearer moves with\
  \ the boots. Even while not activated, bastion boots grant the wearer a +4 bonus\
  \ to her CMD against combat maneuvers to move her."
