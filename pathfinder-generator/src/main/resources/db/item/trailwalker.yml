description: "This +1 mithral bladed scarf (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner\
  \ Sea World Guide 290) is unusually long and ornate, patched and expanded over several\
  \ generations into a garish collection of colors and stitching in the shapes of\
  \ Varisian names and stylized map icons. Because of its extra length and magically\
  \ enhanced balance and accuracy, when the wielder makes a full attack with Trailwalker,\
  \ he can strike foes with it as if the item had the reach quality and still attack\
  \ opponents adjacent to the wielder. This doesn't expand the wielder's reach for\
  \ any attacks beyond those made as part of the full attack (such as attacks of opportunity).\n\
  Once per day as a standard action, Trailwalker's wielder can whirl the s carf through\
  \ the air and teleport as though using dimension door. The wielder can't transport\
  \ other creatures with this ability. If this ability is used to take the wielder\
  \ from one spot on a road or trail to another spot on that or a connected road or\
  \ trail (even if the connection is lengthy or indirect), this is a move action instead."
