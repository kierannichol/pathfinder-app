description: "The traditional robes of the runelord of greed are known as the robes\
  \ of Xin-Shalast. Rarely, a runelord would grant a favored apprentice a set of these\
  \ robes. Woven of the finest of silks and accented with precious gemstones and gold,\
  \ the robes are surprisingly light and easy to move in. Robes of Xin-Shalast aid\
  \ and accentuate their wearer's spellcasting ability. They grant a +6 armor bonus\
  \ and spell resistance 24, but also cause the wearer to cast all spells at +1 caster\
  \ level. Two of the robe's pockets function as handy haversacks. The wearer of these\
  \ robes is immune to the effects of the occluding field that surrounds the Spires\
  \ of Xin-Shalast, and can exist comfortably in all high altitudes, including within\
  \ the death zone at altitudes of 26,000 feet and higher."
