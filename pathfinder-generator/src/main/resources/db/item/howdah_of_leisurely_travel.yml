description: "This massive teak platform is designed to be strapped to the back of\
  \ a Huge or larger quadruped like a saddle. The howdah of leisurely travel automatically\
  \ resizes to fit a creature of Huge to Colossal size. It has room for four Medium\
  \ creatures if mounted on a Huge creature, nine Medium creatures if mounted on a\
  \ Gargantuan creature, and 16 Medium creatures if mounted on a Colossal creature.\
  \ The howdah is constructed for ceremony rather than war, with upright bronze posts\
  \ supporting a thin wooden roof and silk curtains; it does not provide cover to\
  \ those riding within it, though the curtains provide concealment when closed.\n\
  A howdah of leisurely travel grants a constant endure elements effect to all creatures\
  \ within and grants such creatures a +4 competence bonus on saves against disease,\
  \ effects that cause fatigue or exhaustion, energy drain, and poisons. Within the\
  \ howdah, natural healing takes place at twice the normal rate. The creature bearing\
  \ the howdah does not gain these benefits."
