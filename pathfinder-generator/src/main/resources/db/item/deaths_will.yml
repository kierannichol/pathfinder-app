description: "This black leather fingerless glove is etched with delicate patterns\
  \ and extends up to the wearer's midforearm, fitting snugly without being so tight\
  \ as to keep the skin from breathing. Situated subtly in the underside of the glove\
  \ is a hidden needle. Wearing this glove grants the wearer a +4 competence bonus\
  \ on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal poisons or toxins on her body. As a swift\
  \ action, the wearer can fire poison from the needle in the glove, delivering a\
  \ stream of poison to a target within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The needle\
  \ can hold a single dose of poison at any time. Refilling the glove requires a full-round\
  \ action that provokes attacks of opportunity."
