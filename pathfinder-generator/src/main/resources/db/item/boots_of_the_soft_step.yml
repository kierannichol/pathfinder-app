description: "These bronze-riveted boots have thick leather soles that compress and\
  \ expand as you walk. This reduces the force of your footfalls, making you more\
  \ difficult to detect with tremorsense. If you are walking at half speed, a creature\
  \ with tremorsense can only sense you at half the usual distance. If you walk at\
  \ one-quarter speed or slower, a creature with tremorsense cannot detect you at\
  \ all."
