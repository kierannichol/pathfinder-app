description: "This strange construct vehicle looks like a giant woolly mammoth with\
  \ a fortified palanquin mounted upon its back. Fashioned from rope, metal, wood,\
  \ and bone, the Emperor's Mammoth stands nearly 15 feet tall at the shoulder. Four\
  \ long, curved, wooden tusks protrude from its huge head, as does a thick trunk\
  \ consisting of a score of segmented metal plates wrapped in hide and wood.\nThe\
  \ mammoth can be animated and controlled by a golden crown;, however, the wearer\
  \ of the crown must retain at least one use of his mythic power in order to animate\
  \ and control the vehicle. When activated, the mammoth has the statistics of a huge\
  \ animated object with the constrict, grab, metal, and trample abilities.\nIf the\
  \ crown's wearer runs out of uses of mythic power while the mammoth is active, he\
  \ loses control of the mammoth and it goes berserk for the next 5d10 rounds. After\
  \ this rampage, the mammoth becomes inanimate and ceases to move until it is reactivated."
destruction: "Placing the crown upon the head of an unworthy goblin dungsweeper causes\
  \ the Emperor's Mammoth to crumble into a thousand pieces."
