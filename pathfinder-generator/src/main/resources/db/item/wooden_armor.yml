description: "This suit of leather armor has plates of fire-treated wood sewn over\
  \ vital areas. Though not as effective as metal armor, it offers better protection\
  \ than leather alone. Unlike metal armor, the wood is slightly buoyant, and the\
  \ armor check penalty for swimming in this armor is 0."
