description: "This is an elegantly styled, gem-encrusted drinking chalice made of\
  \ smooth jade, obsidian, or a burnished fine metal. The chalice has a hidden compartment\
  \ in the stem that allows for the insertion of a single vial of poison. The user\
  \ doesn't risk poisoning himself when inserting the vial. Inside the compartment\
  \ is a needle that siphons the poison from the vial and injects it into the bowl\
  \ of the goblet. A hidden button (DC 20 Perception to locate) on the side of the\
  \ stem begins the transfer of poison into the bowl. The transfer process takes 1\
  \ minute to complete, after which the hidden poison is emptied into the goblet."
