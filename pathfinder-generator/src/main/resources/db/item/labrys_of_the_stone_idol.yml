description: "This Huge, double-bitted stone axe, or labrys, is carved entirely of\
  \ hematite, with a wooden shaft covered in fur. It functions as a +3 stone impact\
  \ greataxe that automatically resizes to match the size of its wielder, from Small\
  \ to Huge size. The hematite that composes the axe is as strong as iron, and doesn't\
  \ have the fragile quality. Once per day, the labrys of the stone idol can be struck\
  \ against the ground to create a powerful tremor, as the earthquake spell. When\
  \ used in this way, the labrys creates a shield around its wielder, protecting him\
  \ from the immediate effects of the earthquake, including fissures, falling rubble,\
  \ and landslides. This shield disappears after 1 round, when the earthquake's effects\
  \ end."
