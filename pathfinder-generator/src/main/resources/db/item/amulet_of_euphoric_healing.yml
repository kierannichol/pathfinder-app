description: "These glass amulets hold bubbling red liquid and often feature a religion's\
  \ or deity's holy symbol, most commonly that of Asmodeus or Zon-Kuthon. While worn,\
  \ the amulet tinges the user's healing magic with a wash of ecstasy that acts as\
  \ a magical drug, making the recipient of the magical healing susceptible to mental\
  \ manipulation by the wearer. Anytime the wearer casts a healing spell or uses a\
  \ spell-like ability on a single target, the recipient of the magical healing additionally\
  \ must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or become addicted to the wearer's healing\
  \ spells. The wearer can suppress this effect by shielding the amulet from view\
  \ with a hand or held item as a free action. The drug has the following statistics."
