description: "Fashioned from rose gold and set with multicolored gemstones that glitter\
  \ with internal illumination, the Imperial Diadem contains the memories and personalities\
  \ of Yhtill's population. Any creature that wears the item for at least 24 hours\
  \ has a portion of its soul infused within the artifact. This fusion grants a constant\
  \ death ward effect to the wearer. As a standard action, Cassilda can teleport the\
  \ Imperial Diadem to her hand from any distance, including across planar boundaries.\n\
  Three times per day, the Imperial Diadem grants the wearer the ability to use mind-affecting\
  \ effects on creatures with a minimum Intelligence of 3 that are normally immune\
  \ to mind-affecting effects. The Imperial Diadem also allows the wearer to cast\
  \ prying eyes, greater scrying, and vision each once per day."
destruction: "The Imperial Diadem is destroyed if both Hastur and Cassilda die within\
  \ 24 hours of each other. This releases all of those souls stored within the item\
  \ to the Boneyard or permits them to be resurrected in a restored Yhtill."
