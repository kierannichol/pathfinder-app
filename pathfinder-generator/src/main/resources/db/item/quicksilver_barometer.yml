description: "A quicksilver barometer consists of a slender glass tube, closed at\
  \ the top, containing an open, mercury-filled base. Many quicksilver barometers\
  \ are fitted into elegant or even outlandishly ornate housings made of precious\
  \ materials. Such housings are not necessary for the device to function, and serve\
  \ only to increase the base price of the tool into the realm of an art object's\
  \ value. The device interacts with atmospheric pressure, causing the mercury within\
  \ the glass tube to lower or rise based on external pressure and temperature. It\
  \ takes 3 rounds for a quicksilver barometer to settle once placed on a flat surface.\
  \ While this device is normally used to measure and observe local temperature fluctuations\
  \ (if used in this manner and studied for at least 10 minutes, a quicksilver barometer\
  \ grants a +4 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to predict the weather), it\
  \ also functions in a method similar to a haunt detector (see above), but with greater\
  \ accuracyâ€”a quicksilver barometer grants a +4 circumstance bonus on Perception\
  \ checks to notice haunts."
