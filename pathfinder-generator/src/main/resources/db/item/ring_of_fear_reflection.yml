description: "This simple silver ring has a fear rune etched into its hammered apex.\
  \ The ring provides a morale bonus versus fear effects. This bonus starts at +0\
  \ and can advance no higher than +5.\nEvery time the wearer succeeds at a Will save\
  \ versus a fear affect, the ring's bonus increases by +1. Should the wearer fail\
  \ a Will save versus fear, the ring's bonus immediately falls to +0.\nIf the bonus\
  \ is +5 and the wearer is affected by a fear effect and succeeds at her Will save,\
  \ the ring automatically reflects the fear effect back to its source. If the source\
  \ is a creature not immune to fear, it must succeed at a Will save at the DC made\
  \ by the ring's wearer or be affected by the fear effect. Only the source of an\
  \ area fear effect is targeted by such a reflected spell."
