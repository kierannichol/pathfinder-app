description: "Once per day, the bearer of the Fluttered Wing can quietly and soothingly\
  \ converse with a creature that is at least indifferent toward it. While the bearer\
  \ does so, she gains a +10 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks against that target.\
  \ At any point during the conversation, she can cast suggestion on the target. When\
  \ she does so, she can attempt a Bluff check to hide the act of casting the spell\
  \ as mere words, gaining a +10 bonus on this check; an observer realizes she's casting\
  \ suggestion only if the result of his own Sense Motive check exceeds the result\
  \ of this Bluff check.\nA character who carries the Fluttered Wing is not affected\
  \ by effects that detect or reveal falsehoods unless those effects come from 8th-\
  \ or 9th-level spells."
destruction: "If the Fluttered Wing is bathed in the blood of an innocent while lies\
  \ about that innocent are chanted aloud for 30 minutes, it crumbles into ash."
