description: "This variant ring of ki mastery is made of a lock of hair held together\
  \ by small bands to form a ring. The ring allows a wearer with a ki pool to store\
  \ up to 2 ki points in the ring as a swift action. These points remain in the ring\
  \ until used. The wearer can use the ki points normally, but gains the following\
  \ benefits when ki points are stored in the ring.\nAs long as at least 1 ki point\
  \ is stored in the ring, the wearer gains a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to\
  \ bull rush, disarm, or trip opponents.\nIf at least 2 ki points are stored in the\
  \ ring, the wearer takes only a –1 penalty on attack rolls when making a flurry\
  \ of blows instead of a –2 penalty."
