description: "This ring has an odd, disquieting texture that always reveals greater\
  \ layers of complexity the more closely it is examined. If the wearer can cast summon\
  \ monster spells, the wearer adds cythnigot to the 3rd-level list of monsters he\
  \ can summon with those spells, adds shoggti to the 6th-level list, adds nyogoth\
  \ to the 7th-level list, adds chernobue to the 8th-level list, and adds augnagar\
  \ to the 9th-level list. Also, once per day on command the wearer can use this ring\
  \ to summon a cythnigot, as if by the summon monster III spell."
