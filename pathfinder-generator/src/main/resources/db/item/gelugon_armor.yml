description: "This +4 full plate is fashioned to make the wearer appear to be an ice\
  \ devil, complete with insectile eyes. Frosty blue energy emanates from the armor's\
  \ joints, and the helm's eyes intermittently surge with diabolical power. The armor\
  \ has a long, spearlike tail that can be used to make a single primary natural attack\
  \ per round as a standard action if the wearer makes no other attacks. This tail\
  \ attack deals 1d10 points of damage plus 2d6 points of cold damage for a Medium\
  \ wearer. The tail can also be used to make attacks of opportunity that count against\
  \ the wearer's maximum number of attacks of opportunity per round."
