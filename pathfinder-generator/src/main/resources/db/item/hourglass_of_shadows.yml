description: "The Hourglass of Shadows is a foul artifact that allows the user to\
  \ process a creature's remains into an undead shadow. The unwieldy, 5-foottall device\
  \ rests suspended on an iron stand fitted with pivots that allow its user to rotate\
  \ a central chamber of etched, smoke-colored glass. To operate the device, the user\
  \ must place the ashes of a Small, Medium, or Large sentient creature into the glass\
  \ chamber along with a crushed onyx worth 100 gp. After the ashes have flowed through\
  \ the chamber three times—a process that takes 3 hours—the contents can be emptied.\
  \ If deposited into a clay pot filled with grave dirt and brackish water, the ashes\
  \ transform the mundane container into a shadow urn. A creature whose remains have\
  \ been defiled in this way cannot be restored to life by any method short of a miracle\
  \ or wish until the shadow urn containing its spirit has been destroyed.\nA shadow\
  \ urn contains an unquiet spirit befouled by the Hourglass of Shadows. These fragile\
  \ urns can be thrown, have a range increment of 10 feet, and shatter on contact\
  \ with any creature or solid surface. When a shadow urn is broken, the single greater\
  \ shadow contained within is released. This shadow is free-willed—owing no allegiance\
  \ to the owner of the Hourglass of Shadows or whoever broke its urn—and typically\
  \ attacks the nearest creature, seeking to sate its hunger for life energy. A shadow\
  \ urn is destroyed when it is used. If not shattered, a shadow urn contains the\
  \ soul within indefinitely."
destruction: "Casting a spell with the light descriptor on the Hourglass of Shadows\
  \ renders it inoperative for 1 day per level of the spell. Casting sunburst on the\
  \ Hourglass under the light of the noonday sun causes it to shatter. Similarly,\
  \ a shadow urn broken in an area of full natural sunlight destroys the shadow within\
  \ rather than releasing it."
