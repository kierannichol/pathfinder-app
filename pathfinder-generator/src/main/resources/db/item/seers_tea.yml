description: "This rich tea can be made from any number of herbs. When the tea is\
  \ brewed without a filter and imbibed, the drinker can read the patterns in the\
  \ leaves remaining at the bottom of her cup, gaining the benefits of an augury spell.\n\
  Additionally, the unbrewed tea can be used as an extra material component when casting\
  \ augury, removing the need for a focus. In this case, the caster instead reveals\
  \ information as if she had cast divination instead."
