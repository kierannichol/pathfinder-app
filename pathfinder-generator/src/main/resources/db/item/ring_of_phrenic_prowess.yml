description: "This ring is made of rough iron and is set with four amethysts. It allows\
  \ a wearer with a phrenic pool to store up to 4 points from her phrenic pool in\
  \ the ring as a swift action. These points remain in the ring until used. A wearer\
  \ can spend points stored in the ring as if they were in her phrenic pool, in addition\
  \ to the following uses. As a free action, the wearer can expend 1 point stored\
  \ in the ring to gain a +2 bonus on concentration checks for 1 round.\nAs a standard\
  \ action, the wearer can expend 1 point stored in the ring to attempt to flood a\
  \ target with raw psychic power. The wearer makes a melee touch attack charged with\
  \ psychic energy. If the touch attack hits, it deals 3d6 points of nonlethal damage\
  \ and the target is stunned for 1 round. If the attack misses, the charge dissipates.\n\
  As an immediate action, the wearer can expend up to 4 points stored in the ring\
  \ to gain the benefit of spell turning for 1 round. The number of spell levels she\
  \ can turn is equal to the number of points expended."
