description: "These leather gauntlets and bracers are trimmed, backed, and studded\
  \ with metal, and yellowed bear claws cap each of the fingers. Although it incorporates\
  \ metal, use of the goreclaw does not violate a druid's prohibition against wearing\
  \ metal armor.\nThe goreclaw of Thercerrod is a +2 wounding spiked gauntlet. If\
  \ worn by a druid while wild shaping, the druid retains the +2 enhancement bonus\
  \ and the wounding weapon property for any natural claw attack she gains during\
  \ the transformation. Any effect that would improve or enhance such natural attacks\
  \ suppresses the magic of the goreclaw for the duration of the effect."
