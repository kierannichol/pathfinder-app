description: "This crystalline cube has a thin plate of soft white stone on one of\
  \ its faces that's inscribed with several lines of cryptic runes. When the cube's\
  \ bearer speaks a command word, the runes change shape and spell out information\
  \ regarding nearby secrets such as back alleys and hidden paths.\nOnce per day,\
  \ the wielder of a crook's cube can cast find the path. The cube also grants its\
  \ wielder a +5 insight bonus on checks with the following skills in which the wielder\
  \ has at least 5 ranks: Knowledge (dungeoneering), Knowledge (engineering), Knowledge\
  \ (geography), Knowledge (history), and Knowledge (local)."
