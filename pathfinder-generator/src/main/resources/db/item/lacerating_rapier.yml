description: "The blade of this +1 rapier is imbued with the ability to change form\
  \ slightly when used to sneak attack foes, allowing the wielder to hit multiple\
  \ targets.\nThree times per day when the wielder makes a sneak attack against a\
  \ foe that is adjacent to another creature, she may choose to attack both opponents\
  \ with a single strike as the blade unwinds, lengthens, and bends to meet their\
  \ flesh. The wielder uses the same attack roll result to hit both creatures. If\
  \ successful, the attack deals weapon damage to any creature it hits, though only\
  \ the first creature takes sneak attack damage."
