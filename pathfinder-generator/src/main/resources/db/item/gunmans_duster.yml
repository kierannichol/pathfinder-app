description: "This long, loose-fitting coat grants a +4 armor bonus to AC and a +2\
  \ luck bonus to the wearer's touch AC against firearm attacks. If the wearer is\
  \ a gunslinger or has the Amateur Gunslinger feat (see Ultimate Combat), she begins\
  \ each day with 1 additional grit point. This extra point does not increase her\
  \ maximum grit total. When the wearer uses the gunslinger's dodge deed, the deed's\
  \ dodge bonuses to AC increase by +1. If the wearer is not a gunslinger, she may\
  \ use the gunslinger's dodge deed once per day."
