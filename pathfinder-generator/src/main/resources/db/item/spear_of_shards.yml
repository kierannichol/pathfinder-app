description: "The spear of shards is a +6 returning wounding spear created by the\
  \ Vault Keepers to guide them through the convoluted passages between Golarion's\
  \ Vaults and to keep dangerous subterranean creatures at bay. The large crystal\
  \ composing the spear's head is mounted on a 5-foot shaft of lightweight metal that\
  \ swirls with a complex pattern that every so often appears to shift. A ring designed\
  \ to fit a dozen smaller teardrop-shaped crystals connects the base of the spear's\
  \ head to the shaft, although only seven of the 12 sockets contain a crystal. Each\
  \ of these smaller crystals is about an inch long and angles slightly outward on\
  \ one side of the ring to act like barbs when the spear is lodged deeply in flesh.\
  \ Each of these crystals pulses with a warm amber light. Any xiomorn within 1 mile\
  \ of the spear of shards is automatically aware of its presence, as well as the\
  \ distance and direction to the artifact.\nEach of the smaller crystals is attuned\
  \ to a different Vault beneath Golarion. When the wielder of the spear of shards\
  \ rhythmically taps one of these smaller crystals as a full-round action, the spear\
  \ identifies the path to the attuned Vault and can direct its wielder unerringly\
  \ to the Vault, as per find the path. This effect lasts until the spear reaches\
  \ the attuned Vault or until the crystal at the head of the spear is tapped in the\
  \ same manner. The five missing crystals are lost but, if rediscovered, could be\
  \ attached to the spear of shards and reveal the way to their attuned Vaults as\
  \ well.\nThe spear of shards has sufficient intelligence to remain staunchly loyal\
  \ to its xiomorn creators. If wielded by a non-xiomorn, it either refuses to provide\
  \ directions or intentionally provides erroneous directions to keep the wielder\
  \ away from the Vaults. If used by a nonxiomorn in combat, the spear of shards damages\
  \ the wielder rather than the target on any attack roll that is a natural 1, as\
  \ a cursed backbiter spear. When the spear of shards is used by a non-xiomorn in\
  \ combat against a xiomorn, any attack roll other than a natural 20 results in an\
  \ attack against the wielder instead. A non-xiomorn can use the Use Magic Device\
  \ skill to emulate a xiomorn and trick the spear of shards, but the DC of this check\
  \ is increased by 10 (to DC 35) to reflect the spear's suspicion."
destruction: "If a creature born in sunlight convinces the spear of shards to guide\
  \ him to all 12 of the Vaults represented by the crystals ringing the spear's head\
  \ (which would require discovering and reattaching the missing crystals), the artifact\
  \ is destroyed."
