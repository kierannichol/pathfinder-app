description: "This wood-and-leather riding saddle is stitched with icons of warriors\
  \ on horseback. The saddle is of archaic design, with a thick girth, high cantle,\
  \ and no stirrups. It automatically resizes to fit any mount from Medium to Huge\
  \ size.\nWhen the saddle is worn by a mount, its rider can speak with animals at\
  \ will, as the spell. Once per year as a fullround action, the rider can target\
  \ the animal wearing the saddle with the awaken spell. This doesn't predispose the\
  \ animal toward the rider and doesn't compel the animal to follow the rider's commands;\
  \ in fact, if the rider has treated the animal cruelly, the awakened animal may\
  \ attempt to unseat or attack the rider."
