description: "This stiff folded paper vaguely resembles a hand-sized pest such as\
  \ a beetle, spider, or cockroach. Completing two key folds in the paper causes it\
  \ to multiply into hundreds of similar-sized duplicates of itself. These duplicates\
  \ fill a 10-foot space and act as a rat swarm, except they have fire vulnerability,\
  \ the construct type, and do not have the disease special ability. The paper beetles\
  \ do not attack their creator, but are otherwise uncontrolled and attack anything\
  \ nearby. After 5 rounds, the beetles crumple and fall inert. Once activated, an\
  \ origami swarm loses all magic."
