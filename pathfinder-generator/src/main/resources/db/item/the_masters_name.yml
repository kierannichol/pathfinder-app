description: "If the user opens this vial while chanting prayers to the Master of\
  \ Masters, the sand inside this crystal vial pours out to form an elaborate, multicolored\
  \ mandala in the symbol of Irori's rebus. The vial never runs empty, but pours out\
  \ only enough sand to craft a single mandala at a time.\nThis item has two functions.\
  \ Once per day, the owner can meditate while focusing on the mandala and ponder\
  \ the great mysteries of the universe. After 1 hour of uninterrupted meditation,\
  \ the owner recovers a number of ki points equal to half his total ki pool. The\
  \ ki points recovered in this way are temporary, and go away if the user rests or\
  \ meditates for 8 hours to recover. Additionally, the owner of this item cannot\
  \ use it to replenish ki points in excess of his total ki pool.\nOnce per week,\
  \ when a command word is spoken, the owner of this item can open the vial and pour\
  \ out the contents, which coalesce to form a pavbagha (Pathfinder Campaign Setting:\
  \ Inner Sea Gods 295) marked with the Master's Rebus. The pavbagha fights alongside\
  \ the owner of the vial, protecting her to the best of its ability."
