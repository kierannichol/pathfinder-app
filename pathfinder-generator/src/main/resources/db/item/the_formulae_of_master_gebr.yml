description: "These four cloth-bound books are neatly printed—as with a printing press\
  \ or some other form of mechanical transcription—with a title page, a table of contents,\
  \ and a useful cross-referenced index. They have been treated well and are clearly\
  \ reference works, rather than laboratory notes; the writer was obviously a most\
  \ disciplined and focused inventor. Protection The cover is treated with tears of\
  \ death poison (contact; save Fort DC 22; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/minute for\
  \ 6 minutes; effect 1d6 Con damage and paralyzed for 1 minute)."
