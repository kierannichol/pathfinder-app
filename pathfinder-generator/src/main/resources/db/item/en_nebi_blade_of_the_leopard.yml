description: "Crafted in Katapesh some 300 years ago, En-Nebi is a katar some 15 inches\
  \ in length. An embossed image of a ferocious Katapeshi leopard adorns the weapon's\
  \ hilt, while strange shadowy patterns writhe across its damascened blade, even\
  \ in strong light.\nIn combat, En-Nebi is treated as a +1 vicious punch dagger.\
  \ As it strikes, the extra damage from the vicious property manifests as if a great\
  \ cat's claws had cruelly raked the victim's flesh. While this effect can be unnerving,\
  \ the consequences for the katar's wielder are even worse: if he confirms a critical\
  \ hit with the weapon, he must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract a form of\
  \ lycanthropy, becoming a Katapeshi wereleopard lycanthrope.\nEasily twice the size\
  \ of common leopards, Katapeshi leopards are infamous for their savagery. Now extremely\
  \ rare, these massive creatures once ranged from Nex to Thuvia (same stats as tigers).\
  \ Treat Katapeshi wereleopard lycanthropes as chaotic evil weretigers."
