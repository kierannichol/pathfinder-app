description: "Two distinct songs are etched on the entwined pipes of this flute. Playing\
  \ the first creates a soothing, rhythmic melody that lulls snakes and serpents into\
  \ compliance. This tune grants a +5 competence bonus on Handle Animal and wild empathy\
  \ checks to influence snakes as well as snakelike animals and magical beasts. If\
  \ the musician lacks the wild empathy class feature, she can still use this song\
  \ to influence snakes and snakelike creatures as if she had wild empathy, applying\
  \ only her Charisma modifier and the flute's +5 bonus to the roll.\nThe second song\
  \ of the snake charmer's flute can be performed only once per day as a full-round\
  \ action. When used, it summons an advanced giant anaconda (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary\
  \ 2 292, 252). This serpent obeys the musician's mental commands and remains as\
  \ long as the user continues to spend a move action each round maintaining the tune,\
  \ up to a maximum of 3 minutes."
