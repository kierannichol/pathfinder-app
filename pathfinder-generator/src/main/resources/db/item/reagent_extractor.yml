description: "These connected glass-and-copper apparatuses have heatstones and other\
  \ components installed at the base of each container to break down magic liquids\
  \ placed within. Any potion placed within the extractor is distilled down to its\
  \ component parts over the course of 4 hours; this destroys the potion. The extracted\
  \ essences can then be used to brew a new potion as long as the new potion is of\
  \ the same spell level or lower than the distilled potion. Using the extractor in\
  \ this way does not change the requirements for brewing a potion, but it does remove\
  \ the need to use fresh and unused ingredients and materials to brew the new potion,\
  \ and this waives the new potion's base cost (but not the requirement to provide\
  \ any costly material component or focus that the new potion's spell requires).\
  \ Essences extracted from a potion using a reagent extractor must be used to create\
  \ a new potion within 24 hours; after this time, they become inert."
