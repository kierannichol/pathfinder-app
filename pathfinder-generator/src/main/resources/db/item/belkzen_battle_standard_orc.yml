description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis ragged flag is marked with the emblem of\
  \ an orc clan. Creatures loyal to the clan represented by the flag's emblem gain\
  \ a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saving throws against\
  \ fear and charm effects as long as they can see the standard, which must be held\
  \ by an ally within 60 feet. This bonus is increased by 1 if the bearer has the\
  \ Flagbearer feat (The Inner Sea World Guide 286). If the bearer is an orc, the\
  \ bonuses from the flag are increased by 1 (for a total of +3 if the bearer also\
  \ has the Flagbearer feat) for orc allies loyal to the clan whose emblem is represented."
