description: "This huge cauldron forged from black iron serves as a dimensional gateway\
  \ to a mythic netherworld where powerful entities come seeking to barter with, commune\
  \ with, or corrupt mythic mortals. To activate the cauldron, a mythic creature must\
  \ spill some of its own blood into the black basin as an offering of his mythic\
  \ power. If the wound deals at least 4 points of damage, the cauldron drains one\
  \ use of the individual's mythic power through it. Once activated, the cauldron\
  \ fills with a strange red fog that remains for 1d20+10 minutes. During this time,\
  \ mythic creatures can enter the cauldron and be transported to the crossroads.\
  \ Non-mythic creatures that enter the cauldron take 4d6 points of damage per round\
  \ until they climb out or die.\nThe netherworld is small, with an overall area of\
  \ 1 square half-mile. Highly mutable, the netherworld's appearance is determined\
  \ by the will of whatever outsider currently waits there. Only one outsider can\
  \ inhabit the netherworld at any given time. The specifics of what entity resides\
  \ in the netherworld, as well as that entity's desire, change frequently and therefore\
  \ are left to the discretion of the GM.\nTime in the netherworld passes out of sync\
  \ with time in the Material Plane, thus a mythic creature can remain in the netherworld\
  \ for as long as he wishes, and reemerges from the cauldron only a few minutes after\
  \ his descent. The netherworld is a crossroads, coterminous with all planes. Outsiders\
  \ can enter from any plane, but mortals can't travel to other planes from the netherworld."
destruction: "Using the Netherworld Cauldron to boil a mythic hero to death destroys\
