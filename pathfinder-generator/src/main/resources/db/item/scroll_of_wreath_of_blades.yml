description: "The daggers serving as focus of this spell take on a deadly sharpness\
  \ as they animate and spin around you, creating a 5-foot-radius emanation of spinning\
  \ mithral blades that moves with you. Any creature that starts its turn within the\
  \ area of the spinning blades takes 1d4 points of damage for every two caster levels\
  \ (maximum 10d4 at 20th level) and the damage bypasses DR/silver."
