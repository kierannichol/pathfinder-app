description: "This heavy bronze bowl, etched with outlines of waves, feels cool to\
  \ the touch. Once per day as a standard action, the bowl can be commanded to grow\
  \ in size and fill with 25 gallons of cool, fresh water. In its enlarged state,\
  \ the basin can accommodate a Medium or smaller creature. The basin remains enlarged\
  \ for 1 hour or until the user commands it to shrink. All water in the basin disappears\
  \ when the item shrinks, and any creatures or objects that don't fit in the shrunken\
  \ bowl are expelled into an adjacent square."
