description: "This +2 leather madu is designed in the form of a bull elephant's head,\
  \ complete with imposing ivory tusks. The shield provides a +3 circumstance bonus\
  \ on combat maneuver checks made to bull rush opponents. If used as a weapon, the\
  \ elephant shield grants a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls\
  \ and deals damage as if it were one size category larger than it is. Once per day,\
  \ the bearer of the elephant shield can have the trunk of the shield lash out, allowing\
  \ the wielder to attempt a grapple combat maneuver check against a foe as a swift\
  \ action. This combat maneuver doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity."
