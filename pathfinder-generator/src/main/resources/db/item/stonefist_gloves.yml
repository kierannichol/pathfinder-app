description: "These heavy, stone gloves feel surprisingly supple to anyone who puts\
  \ them on. While a creature wears stonefist gloves, his unarmed strike damage is\
  \ treated as if he were one size category larger, and bypasses hardness of 8 or\
  \ lower. When a mythic creature uses these gloves to make a sunder combat maneuver,\
  \ he adds half his tier as a bonus on the combat maneuver check."
