description: "This spell creates waves of invisible energy that roll forth from you.\
  \ All metal or stone objects in the path of the spell are pushed away from you to\
  \ the limit of the range. Fixed metal or stone objects larger than 3 inches in diameter\
  \ and loose objects weighing more than 500 pounds are not affected. Anything else,\
  \ including animated objects, small boulders, and creatures in metal armor, moves\
  \ back. Fixed objects 3 inches in diameter or smaller bend or break, and the pieces\
  \ move with the wave of energy. Objects affected by the spell are repelled at the\
  \ rate of 40 feet per round."
