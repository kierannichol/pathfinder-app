description: "This time-delayed concussion grenade is a mainstay of trench warfare.\
  \ The device appears to be little more than a metal cylinder tapering to a handle\
  \ containing a spring-loaded lever. To detonate the device, you disengage the safety\
  \ pin while depressing the handle's lever, which releases the firing pin when thrown.\
  \ The device detonates at the beginning of your next turn, hopefully in the area\
  \ you targeted. The device relies on a concussive blast to deal damage, and all\
  \ creatures within a 20-foot radius take 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Ref lex\
  \ DC 15 for half)."
