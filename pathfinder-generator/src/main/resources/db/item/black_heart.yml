description: "This withered, black heart is disturbingly cool to the touch. It must\
  \ be attuned to an evil deity in a vile ritual that takes at least 1 hour and requires\
  \ a living sentient creature as a sacrifice before the wielder can use its powers.\
  \ Once attuned, it counts as an unholy symbol of that deity for all purposes (such\
  \ as acting as a divine focus for spellcasting) and can't be attuned to another\
  \ deity until at least 1 week has passed since its last use.\nBy brandishing the\
  \ black heart as a standard action, the wielder can detect the presence of good\
  \ creatures. If any good creatures are within 60 feet, the withered heart begins\
  \ to slowly beat. The heart doesn't show the wielder who specifically is good, but\
  \ it does beat faster the closer to a good creature it comes. The wielder can activate\
  \ this ability once per day, and it lasts as long as she concentrates, to a maximum\
  \ of 10 minutes.\nIf the wielder brandishes the heart and concentrates, the wielder\
  \ can squeeze the heart as a standard action, targeting a living creature within\
  \ 60 feet. The target takes 3d8+5 points of damage and becomes sickened for 1d4\
  \ rounds. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the sickened\
  \ effect. This is a negative energy effect, and evil creatures are immune to it."
