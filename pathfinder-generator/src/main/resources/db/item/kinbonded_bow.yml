description: "This stout +1 longbow is engraved with images of leaping deer. Designed\
  \ to prevent inaccuracy while hunting in a group, the bow is imbued with magic that\
  \ allows the wielder to accurately shoot past an ally. At will, the wielder can\
  \ spend 1 minute attuning the bow to a touched ally. Thereafter, that ally no longer\
  \ provides soft cover against ranged attacks with the kinbonded bow (Core Rulebook\
  \ 196). Only one ally can be attuned to the bow at a time."
