description: "These finely crafted leather bracers have plates of silvered steel covering\
  \ the back, and silver buckles at the wrist and forearm. The bracers enable the\
  \ wearer to use any traditional elven weapon (longbows, composite longbows, longswords,\
  \ rapiers, shortbows, composite shortbows, and any weapon with the word \"elven\"\
  \ in its name) as if he were proficient in its use. If he uses such a weapon and\
  \ is already proficient with it, he gains a +1 competence bonus on attack and damage\
  \ rolls. Both bracers must be worn for the magic to be effective."
