description: "Several Osa paintings exist, each displaying a hand-painted Shenmen\
  \ landscape. These paintings react to specific groups of individuals, sensing in\
  \ them a likeness between their fates and the curse that haunts Shenmen. Creatures\
  \ viewing the landscape that are deemed worthy (GM's discretion) are selected by\
  \ the painting, and a likeness of that creature appears in the depicted scene. Once\
  \ a full group is selected (usually four, but sometimes only one and at other times\
  \ a group of a dozen or more), the portrait triggers and each of the creatures depicted\
  \ must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be transported to the viewpoint depicted,\
  \ across any distance (including across planes), via teleportation. Once the group\
  \ has been gathered, they are placed under the effects of a geas/quest spell (no\
  \ save) to undertake a specific action in that region, preventing them from leaving\
  \ Shenmen until the task is completed."
destruction: "Once a selected group is brought to Shenmen and completes the task set\
  \ by the Osa painting, the painting itself turns into a blank, nonmagical canvas."
