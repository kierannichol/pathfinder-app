description: "These bronze bracers are etched with an elaborate crisscross pattern\
  \ on their exterior and are lined with a set of six small barbs that are anchored\
  \ into the interior. When worn, the bracers provide the wearer with a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus on Fortitude saves against poisons from venomous creatures. Anytime the\
  \ wearer fails a saving throw against a poison from a venomous creature, he can\
  \ say the bindings' command word as a standard action and cause the barbs in the\
  \ bindings to pierce his skin and begin siphoning the poison from his body, preventing\
  \ the poison from taking effect. After the poison has been siphoned off, the bracers\
  \ glow faintly for 1 minute. While the bracers are glowing, the wearer can touch\
  \ an empty vial to the bracers to deposit the stored venom into the vial. This extracted\
  \ venom lasts up to 1 hour before becoming inert. The bindings cannot hold more\
  \ than 1 dose of a poison from a venomous creature at a time. If the wearer attempts\
  \ to siphon poison from himself while the bindings already hold a dose of poison,\
  \ the stored poison immediately affects him and the other poison is instead siphoned\
  \ and stored in the bindings."
