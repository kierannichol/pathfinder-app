description: "An air-breathing adventurer would need to bring over a dozen tanks full\
  \ of air with her to have enough to breathe for even a single hour. Since this is\
  \ impractical, alchemists developed a technique to store greater amounts of air\
  \ in a smaller volume using pressure. Each pressurized air tank is a little smaller\
  \ than half the size of a tank, but it contains enough air for a swimming character\
  \ to breathe for 1 hour (the pressurized air itself weighs 7 pounds, so an empty\
  \ tank weighs only 23 pounds). When a small crank is manipulated as a standard action,\
  \ the tank releases just enough air for a breath, which the diving character breathes\
  \ in through a straw-like tube with a semipermeable end piece that allows air out\
  \ but not water in. The process of refilling the air tank requires 5 gp of materials\
  \ and a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check (failure destroys the tank) or the\
  \ services of a kineticist with basic aerokinesis."
