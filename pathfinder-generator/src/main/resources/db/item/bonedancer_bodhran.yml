description: "This calfskin drum is painted with an image of a grinning skull, and\
  \ comes with a giant's finger bones to use as beaters. A creature with at least\
  \ 1 rank in Perform (percussion) can play a steady rhythm on the drum as a standard\
  \ action each round. Doing so grants all undead creatures within 30 feet of the\
  \ drummer a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and Will saves each\
  \ round the drum is played.\nAlternatively, the drummer can instead force undead\
  \ creatures in the area to dance in place to the beat of the drum. Affected undead\
  \ within 30 feet can't leave their spaces and take a –2 penalty to Armor Class and\
  \ on Reflex saves for as long as the drummer plays. Intelligent undead can attempt\
  \ a DC 12 Will save to resist this effect; those that succeed can move and take\
  \ actions normally, but still take the –2 penalty on Reflex saves and must succeed\
  \ at concentration checks to cast spells (DC = 10 + the spell's level). Mindless\
  \ undead receive no save and can take no actions other than dancing.\nA bonedancer\
  \ bodhran can be used for 9 rounds per day; these rounds need not be consecutive."
