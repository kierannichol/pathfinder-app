description: "This masterwork musical instrument may be of any type (lyre, harp, drum,\
  \ and so on). As a focus, it transforms faith into powerful music. Once activated,\
  \ a member of the cleric's faith can draw upon the power in the instrument to add\
  \ a sacred (if positive energy) or profane (if negative energy) bonus on his next\
  \ Perform check; this bonus is equal to the number of dice of the cleric's channel\
  \ energy ability. The bonus persists for the entirety of the performance."
