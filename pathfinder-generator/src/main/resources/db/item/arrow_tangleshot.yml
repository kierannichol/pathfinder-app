description: "This arrow is tipped with a tiny vial of tanglefoot goo. Firing a tangleshot\
  \ arrow is a ranged touch attack; the arrow deals no damage when it hits, but the\
  \ target is splashed with the alchemical adhesive. This effect is similar to that\
  \ of a tanglefoot bag, but with the following adjustments: Reflex DC 10, Strength\
  \ DC 12 to break, 10 points of slashing damage to cut through, concentration DC\
  \ 10 to cast spells. A tangleshot arrow imposes a –1 penalty on attack rolls because\
  \ of its weight."
