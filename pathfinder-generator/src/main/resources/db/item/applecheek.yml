description: "This sticky-sweet syrup is distilled from ivy and rabbit musk, and causes\
  \ a mild allergic reaction in halflings. The slight swelling— especially in the\
  \ face—and mild redness it induces makes the face seem younger, granting a halfling\
  \ who drinks a dose of applecheek a +2 alchemical bonus on Disguise checks to look\
  \ like an elven, half-elven, or human child. The effects of a dose of applecheek\
  \ persist for 24 hours. Crafting a dose of applecheek requires a successful DC 15\
  \ Craft (alchemy) check."
