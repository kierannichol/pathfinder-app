description: "This +1 dagger has a thin crystal tube embedded in its center. Once\
  \ per day, the wielder of this dagger may slash herself, dealing damage as normal,\
  \ but also channel some of her own blood into the tube, imprinting her memories\
  \ onto the dagger.\nThe imprinted blood lasts for a number of days equal to the\
  \ wielder's HD plus her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). During this time, the\
  \ dagger of repossession is typically given to an ally of the creature whose blood\
  \ is imprinted. If the original wielder becomes possessed (such as by a ghost's\
  \ malevolence ability or a magic jar spell) and she's slashed with the dagger again,\
  \ the imprinted blood is consumed, the target regains her memories, and any possession\
  \ effect immediately ends. A dagger of repossession does not end charm or compulsion\
  \ effects, but the target receives another save against these effects at the original\
  \ DC. Other mind-affecting effects are unaffected by the dagger. An imprinted dagger\
  \ of repossession has no unusual effect if used on anyone other than the target\
  \ whose blood is imprinted."
