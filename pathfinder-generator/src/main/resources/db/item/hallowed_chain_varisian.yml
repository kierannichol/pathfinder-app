description: "The following suit of armor is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nMost often forged in Ustalav and Varisia as\
  \ protection against the unquiet dead, this suit of +2 chainmail amplifies the effect\
  \ of channeled positive energy. When its wearer is healed by positive energy (even\
  \ if not currently wounded) or is in the area of positive energy channeled to harm\
  \ undead, the armor absorbs 1 point of positive energy per 2 dice of healing, with\
  \ a minimum of 1 point and a maximum of 5 points. This does not reduce the effect\
  \ of the positive energy on any of its targets. Until the end of the wearer's next\
  \ turn, any creature that would be harmed by positive energy (such as an undead)\
  \ that strikes the wearer with a natural weapon or an unarmed strike or that succeeds\
  \ at a grapple combat maneuver check against the wearer takes an amount of damage\
  \ equal to the amount of positive energy stored in the armor.\nIf multiple effects\
  \ charge the armor, only the strongest effect applies. Fixed amounts of healing\
  \ (such as that granted by the heal spell) have no effect on the armor."
