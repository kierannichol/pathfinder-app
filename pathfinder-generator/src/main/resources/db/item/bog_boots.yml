description: "These boots are well worn and caked with mud, but still sturdy, comfortable,\
  \ and dry on the inside.\nThree times per day, the wearer can activate the boots\
  \ to cause up to 9 5-foot squares of nearby terrain to become a shallow bog. All\
  \ affected squares are instantly filled with 1 foot of water, mud, and plant life.\
  \ The wearer can move through these squares at her normal speed, but other creatures\
  \ treat the squares as a shallow bog (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 427), costing\
  \ 2 squares of movement to move into each affected square.\nThe initial affected\
  \ square must be adjacent to the wearer. Each additional affected square must be\
  \ adjacent to another affected square, but otherwise the effect can take any shape\
  \ the wearer desires.\nAs a standard action, the wearer can rearrange the affected\
  \ squares. Multiple uses of the boots can create larger areas of bog. The effect\
  \ lasts until dismissed by the wearer (a free action), the wearer moves more than\
  \ 5 feet beyond the affected area, the wearer becomes unconscious, or the boots\
  \ are removed.\nAdditionally, once per day, the wearer can travel as per dimension\
  \ door from one affected square to another."
