description: "Whenever the mind or body of this ring's wearer first becomes subject\
  \ to any harmful effect that allows a saving throw to resist or mitigate it, he\
  \ may, as an immediate action, choose to delay the onset of that effect for 1 minute,\
  \ after he fails the saving throw but before its effects occur. This activation\
  \ causes one of the ring's nine garnets to turn to powder. When that minute passes,\
  \ the wearer may continue to delay the onset of this harmful effect an additional\
  \ minute as an immediate action by willing the ring to do so, which destroys another\
  \ garnet, thus repeating the cycle for another minute. The delayed harmful effect\
  \ occurs when the wearer falls unconscious, when the ring is removed, or 1 minute\
  \ after the last time the ring's power activated; rounds spent delaying the effect\
  \ do not count toward the effect's duration (for example, a curse that lasts 5 rounds\
  \ takes effect for a full 5 rounds, even if the wearer delayed its effect several\
  \ minutes). Effects that protect against or negate the harmful effect work normally\
  \ while it is delayed. The price of the ring is reduced by 5,000 gp for each of\
  \ its garnets that has been destroyed."
