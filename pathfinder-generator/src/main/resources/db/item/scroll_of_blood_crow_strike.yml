name: "Scroll of Blood Crow Strike"
description: "Your unarmed strikes release blasts of energy in the form of bolts of\
  \ fire or glowing red crows, which fly instantaneously to strike your target. You\
  \ can make unarmed strike or flurry of blows attacks against the target as if it\
  \ were in your threatened area; each successful attack deals damage as if you had\
  \ hit it with your unarmed strike, except half the damage is fire and half is negative\
  \ energy (this negative energy does not heal undead). For example, if you are a\
  \ 14th-level monk, you can use a flurry of blows to attack five times, creating\
  \ one energy crow for each successful attack against the target, and dealing 2d6\
  \ points of damage (plus appropriate unarmed strike modifiers) with each crow."
