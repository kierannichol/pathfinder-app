description: "These gems always come in pairs—one white onyx and one black onyx. The\
  \ white onyx has an aura of faint divination, while the black onyx is nonmagical.\
  \ The black onyx gem on its own is worth 50 gp as a spell component for animate\
  \ dead and similar spells. If the black onyx is used as a material component in\
  \ a necromancy spell, the bearer of the white onyx receives a mental alarm. This\
  \ alarm reveals the direction of the paired black onyx gem as long as it is within\
  \ 1,000 feet, as locate object. This effect lasts for 5 minutes.\nIf the owner of\
  \ the white onyx gem is within 1 mile of the black onyx at the time the necromancy\
  \ spell is cast, the owner may destroy the white onyx as a standard action. Doing\
  \ so also destroys the black onyx, making it unsuitable for use as a spell component\
  \ and ruining the necromancy spell. The destruction of either onyx gem immediately\
  \ ends the alarm and locate object effects. The white onyx turns gray and crumbles\
  \ to dust after the locate object effect ends.\nMore expensive sets of these gems\
  \ exist; black onyx gems in such variant sets are worth up to 1,000 gp or more.\
  \ The value of the black onyx gem is added to the item's construction cost."
