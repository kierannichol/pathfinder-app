description: "This ring allows its wearer to persevere through physical or mental\
  \ trauma that hampers his actions. Once per daya, when the wearer gains the staggered\
  \ condition from an enemy's attack, she can ignore that condition for up to 5 rounds.\
  \ This does not prevent her from gaining the staggered condition again, and it does\
  \ not protect her if she gained the staggered condition multiple times."
