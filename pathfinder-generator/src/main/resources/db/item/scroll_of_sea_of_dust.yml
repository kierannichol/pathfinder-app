name: "Scroll of Sea of Dust"
description: "You cause all areas of water to which you have line of effect to recede\
  \ as if you had cast control water. Exposed water that enters the area ebbs away,\
  \ evaporating or leaching into the ground at a rate of 1 foot of depth per hour.\
  \ Living creatures in the area when the spell is cast are parched with thirst and\
  \ take a –4 penalty on Constitution checks to resist the effects of a hot climate,\
  \ and their daily water requirement to avoid thirst doubles (Pathfinder RPG Core\
  \ Rulebook 444). Plant creatures and inanimate plants take 1d6 points of nonlethal\
  \ damage per hour after the first 24 hours, which bypasses hardness and damage reduction.\
  \ Living creatures with the aquatic or water subtype, unless completely immersed\
  \ in water, must attempt a DC 20 Constitution check each hour no matter how much\
  \ water they drink. A creature that fails takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and\
  \ becomes fatigued until it recovers from the nonlethal damage."
