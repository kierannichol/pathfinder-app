description: "This silver locket is suspended from a silver chain. As a standard action,\
  \ a creature holding the locket can speak a command word to attempt to steal the\
  \ sight of one creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude\
  \ saving throw or its eyes are immediately sealed within the locket's interior and\
  \ replaced with featureless, shadowy orbs, causing the creature to be permanently\
  \ blinded. The wielder can speak a second command word to return the victim's eyes;\
  \ otherwise, this blindness cannot be removed except by miracle or wish.\nEach eye-stealing\
  \ locket can contain only a single set of eyes at a time, and the creature in possession\
  \ of the locket is treated as having a body part of the creature to whom the eyes\
  \ belong for the purpose of spells such as scrying. If the wielder is a mesmerist\
  \ and he uses an eye-stealing locket against the target of his hypnotic stare, he\
  \ can apply the Will saving throw penalty from his hypnotic stare to the Fortitude\
  \ saving throw the target attempts to prevent its eyes being stolen."
