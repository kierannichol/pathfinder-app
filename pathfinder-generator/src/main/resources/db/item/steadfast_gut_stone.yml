description: "This fist sized chunk of off-white stone seems too large to fit inside\
  \ a human's mouth, but may be swallowed with ease as a standard action. Once ingested,\
  \ the gut-stone remains active for up to a week, maneuvering itself within the body\
  \ to protect its bearer's vital organs. Any time an attack would subject the bearer\
  \ to precision-based damage (such as a critical hit or sneak attack), that damage\
  \ is instead directed to the gut-stone. All other damage from the triggering attack,\
  \ as well as damage that surpasses the gut-stone's hit points, is applied to the\
  \ character normally. A gut-stone has 10 hit points and hardness 0.\nWhen a gut-stone\
  \ is damaged by a melee weapon attack, as a free action its owner may sacrifice\
  \ the stone to damage the attacker's weapon. Treat this as the bearer making a free\
  \ sunder combat maneuver against the weapon, except that it does not provoke an\
  \ attack of opportunity, bypasses the weapon's hardness, and deals 1d4 points of\
  \ damage.\nOnly one gut-stone may be in a creature's body at a time. Any attempt\
  \ to swallow a second destroys both stones and forces the creature to make a DC\
  \ 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round. If a gut-stone is not used within\
  \ a week of being swallowed or is destroyed it crumbles apart and is passed harmlessly\
  \ out of the body."
