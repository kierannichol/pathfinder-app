description: "Whenever the user is holding this wooden staff, 10 bulging eyes carved\
  \ along the length of the staff animate, granting the user a +5 competence bonus\
  \ on Perception checks as long as he is grasping the staff. As a move action, the\
  \ wielder can select a creature ithin 100 feet and see through its eyes with no\
  \ saving throw. The creature selected must be either a spider summoned with the\
  \ staff or a creature blinded by a blindness/deafness spell cast from the staff\
  \ (the wielder ignores the blindness/deafness effect). The connection lasts as long\
  \ as the wielder and the target creature remain within 100 feet of each other, though\
  \ the wielder can end it as a free action. The effect also ends if the target was\
  \ a blinded creature and regains the ability to see. The wielder is blinded while\
  \ maintaining this connection.\nThe staff allows the use of the following spells."
