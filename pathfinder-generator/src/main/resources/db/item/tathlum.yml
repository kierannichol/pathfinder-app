description: "This horned and frilled dragon's head is coated with a thick layer of\
  \ white lime. When dropped from a height of at least 150 feet, the tathlum detonates\
  \ in an explosion of greasy darkness, dealing 20d6 points of damage to all creatures\
  \ within a 150-foot-radius spread from its point of impact (Will DC 25 half). Good\
  \ or lawful living creatures with 9 Hit Dice or fewer within this area must also\
  \ succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or die. This area is immediately affected by\
  \ unhallow with darkness as an associated spell effect. In addition, concussive\
  \ force blasts outward from the darkness, dealing 10d6 points of damage to all creatures\
  \ within the area between 150 feet and 300 feet from the impact point (Will DC 21\
  \ half). The tathlum is consumed in the explosion.\nIf at least 200 Hit Dice worth\
  \ of creatures are killed by the tathlum's detonation, the explosion spontaneously\
  \ creates 1d6 nightwalkers (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 201) within 150 feet of the\
  \ point of impact. On particularly dense battlefields, the detonation instead creates\
  \ 1d6 warsworns (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 272). These undead creatures are free-willed\
  \ and not under the control of the tathlum's wielder.\nIf the tathlum is dropped\
  \ from a height of less than 150 feet, it deals 3d6 points of damage to a single\
  \ creature as a falling object (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 443), plus an additional\
  \ 2d6 points of damage if the target is good or lawful. The tathlum takes no damage\
  \ and is not destroyed if dropped from a height of less than 150 feet."
destruction: "If dropped from a height of 150 feet or more, the tathlum detonates\
  \ and is permanently destroyed."
