description: "Scavenged from mysterious monuments, these depictions of forgotten figures\
  \ and nameless spirits are often sold as good luck charms, but most commoners don't\
  \ know that they can also be used to augment magic. Seven types of Varisian idols\
  \ exist; those that affect evocation, transmutation, and illusion are the most common.\
  \ Varisians associate each type of idol with their peoples' names for the various\
  \ schools of magic.\nIf used as an additional material component when casting a\
  \ spell the idol affects, a Varisian idol increases the effect of that spell. Using\
  \ multiple idols to cast a spell has no additional effect. A Varisian idol is destroyed\
  \ after one use.\nAvaria: When used to cast bear's endurance, bull's strength, cat's\
  \ grace, eagle's splendor, fox's cunning, or owl's wisdom, the spell grants a +5\
  \ enhancement bonus to the affected ability score.\nAvidais: When used to cast a\
  \ spell that allows you to make a dispel check (such as dispel magic or mage's disjunction),\
  \ you gain a +2 bonus on that check.\nCarnasia: When used to cast any spell of the\
  \ charm subschool, a threatened target does not gain the usual +5 bonus on its saving\
  \ throw to resist the effect.\nIdolis: When used to cast summon monster or summon\
  \ nature's ally, the summoned creature's maximum hit points increase by +2 for every\
  \ Hit Die it possesses.\nRagario: When used to cast a spell that deals energy damage,\
  \ you gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance.\n\
  Vangloris: When used to cast a spell of the glamer subschool with a duration measured\
  \ in minutes or less (such as displacement or invisibility), the effects of that\
  \ spell persist for 1 round longer than normal.\nVoratalo: When used to cast a spell\
  \ of the necromancy school that deals hit point damage, you also deal a number of\
  \ points of bleed damage equal to the spell level. This bleed effect lasts for 5\
  \ rounds."
