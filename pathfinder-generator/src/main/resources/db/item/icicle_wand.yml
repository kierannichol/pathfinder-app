description: "This fragile-looking wand appears to be nothing more than a sharpened\
  \ icicle nearly a foot in length, though it is as sturdy as any wand and the ice\
  \ never melts. A combination of arcane tool and weapon, icicle wands find frequent\
  \ use among the winter witches of Irrisen, and traders have carried them as far\
  \ south as the mountains of Cheliax, Andoran, and Taldor. An icicle wand functions\
  \ primarily as a wand of ice spears (see page 72), granting its user the ability\
  \ to create and turn icy terrain against her enemies. In addition, an icicle wand\
  \ can also be wielded as a masterwork dagger that deals 1 point of cold damage with\
  \ a successful attack in addition to normal dagger damage. An icicle wand with a\
  \ caster level of 7th or higher functions as a +1 frost dagger instead."
