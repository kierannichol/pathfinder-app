description: "Long ago, the tyrannical elemental lords waged war on their benevolent\
  \ counterparts and imprisoned them in powerful, unique artifacts. This lost artifact\
  \ imprisons Lysianassa, Empress of the Torrent, much like the Moaning Diamond (see\
  \ Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Artifacts & Legends) holds Sairazul, the Crystalline\
  \ Queen. The Gasping Pearl appears to be a perfectly spherical iridescent abalone\
  \ pearl the size of a human fist. At all times, it gives forth a choking, gasping\
  \ sound, as if struggling to breathe. Despite this constant, disturbing noise, the\
  \ Gasping Pearl is not evil. Three times per day, the bearer can call upon its power\
  \ to move and control water as if by the spell control water, affecting a 500-foot-by-500-foot\
  \ area up to 100 feet deep. Once per day, the Gasping Pearl can also summon an elder\
  \ water elemental (Bestiary 127) with maximum hit points that serves the caster\
  \ until it is slain; only one such elemental can be summoned at a time."
destruction: "The Gasping Pearl can be smashed by the combined power of three elemental\
  \ princes, one each from the Planes of Air, Earth, and Fire. Even then, the dust\
  \ must be cast into a place where it will never touch even a drop of water."
