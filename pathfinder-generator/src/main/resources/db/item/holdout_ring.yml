description: "Made of aged bronze and steel, this ring looks like it should have a\
  \ gem set in it, but instead has an empty circular hole. The hole in the ring holds\
  \ a single firearm bullet; if one is placed inside (as a full-round action), it\
  \ merges seamlessly into the ring. While a bullet is merged into the ring, the wielder\
  \ can fire the bullet as though she were using a +1 pistol that can't misfire. Once\
  \ the bullet has been fired from the ring, a new bullet can't be placed inside for\
  \ 24 hours.\nEach holdout ring is created with two +1 ammunition special abilities\
  \ and one +2 ammunition special ability. If the wearer has the grit class feature,\
  \ she can expend grit (maximum 4 grit points) to imbue bullets merged with the gun\
  \ with one or more of these abilities. Imbuing a bullet with a +1 special ability\
  \ costs 1 grit point; imbuing one with a +2 special ability costs 2 grit points.\
  \ Each ring's special abilities are established upon the item's creation and can't\
  \ be changed. If a special ability has multiple versions, as does bane, the specific\
  \ version must be set at that time (e.g., dragon bane). A typical holdout ring has\
  \ the flaming, seeking, and shocking burst special abilities."
