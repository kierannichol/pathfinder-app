description: "Forged in pairs, these solid metal blades end in curved hooks, while\
  \ the hand guards are hammered into outward-facing spiked crescents. Both the crescent\
  \ and the tip of the hilt are sharpened for combat. They can be wielded as single\
  \ weapons or with two-weapon fighting styles. These weapons gain the disarm special\
  \ feature when they are used individually. A pair of shang gou can also be formed\
  \ into a single one-handed weapon to gain the trip special feature."
