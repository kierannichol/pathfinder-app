description: "This flag bears an image of a red rose on a silvery field. Made for\
  \ the Scarlet Rose's standard-bearers, these flags offer protection to the wielder\
  \ and inspiration to her allies. To grant any benefit, a banner of the Scarlet Rose\
  \ must be held firmly in one hand by a woman. While held, it grants the bearer a\
  \ +2 shield bonus to AC and a +4 luck bonus to her CMD. A banner of the Scarlet\
  \ Rose counts as a heavy shield for the purpose of any feat or class feature that\
  \ requires the user to be wielding a shield (such as Sisterhood Styleâ€  or Shield\
  \ Wall).\nWhenever the banner's bearer uses a class ability that grants a competence\
  \ bonus (such as the bard's inspire courage ability or the cavalier's lion's call\
  \ order ability), the competence bonus granted to allies increases by 1. This benefit\
  \ does not apply to spells that grant competence bonuses, nor does it stack with\
  \ other item effects that increase competence bonuses.\nFinally, allies within 30\
  \ feet (including the banner's bearer) gain a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws\
  \ against mind-affecting effects."
