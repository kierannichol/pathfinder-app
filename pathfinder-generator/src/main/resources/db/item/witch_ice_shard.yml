description: "The witch ice shard is crafted from witch ice, a mysterious substance\
  \ found only beneath the windswept reaches of Witch Queen's demesne. This glittering\
  \ cerulean ice has many fell uses, but one of the Queen's favorites is as a dread\
  \ prison for her foes. Once prepared by Queen, the witch ice shard absorbs the soul\
  \ of the first non-fey to touch it as a trap the soul spell. Worse yet, anyone trapped\
  \ within becomes fuel for the crystal's bearer, painfully consumed by the power\
  \ of the shard as their new owner drains their life force away to use as they wish.\
  \ A fey creature may absorb one of the trapped creature's levels to gain an additional\
  \ use of one of its daily supernatural or spell-like abilities. When the trapped\
  \ creature's last level is drained, they are forever consumed and cannot be returned\
  \ to life by any magic short of a wish or miracle. This particular shard possesses\
  \ Tessa's soul, granting its bearer 10 levels worth of power. Each time one is used,\
  \ Tessa loses a level until her soul is completely consumed.\nShattering a witch\
  \ ice shard frees a trapped soul, who then must make a DC 15 Fortitude save for\
  \ every level lost (failure results in the level drain being permanent). Unlike\
  \ most artifacts, a witch ice shard is fragile. The crystal has a Hardness of 10,\
  \ 15 hp and a Break DC of 25."
