description: "Developed by Al-Zabriti riders, a Qadiran saddle is sturdy but minimal,\
  \ allowing horse and rider to communicate through slight muscle shifts and delicate\
  \ balance adjustments. A Qadiran saddle gives a rider a +2 circumstance bonus on\
  \ Ride checks, and it allows a rider to ignore the AC penalty from a charge when\
  \ she is mounted and her mount charges."
