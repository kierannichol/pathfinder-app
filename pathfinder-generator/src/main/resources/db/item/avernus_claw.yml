description: "Furcas's weapon is a +4 axiomatic flaming burst unholy trident. The\
  \ weapon's flaming burst special ability wreathes the trident in hellfire—half the\
  \ damage its flames deal is fire damage, while the other half results directly from\
  \ infernal power and is therefore not reduced by fire resistance. As a standard\
  \ action, Furcas can slam the trident's haft against the ground, causing all creatures\
  \ within 30 feet to be affected by dimensional anchor. Any affected creature that\
  \ attempts to teleport or travel to another plane (even by a permanent gate) instead\
  \ appears in a square adjacent to Furcas. As a standard action, Furcas can call\
  \ the trident to his hand from any distance, even across planar boundaries."
destruction: "The Avernus Claw must be sunk to the bottom of the deepest sea of Elysium\
  \ for 1 year, then dealt a blow by the weapon of a chaotic good deity."
