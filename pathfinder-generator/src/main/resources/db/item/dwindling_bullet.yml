  \ but incredibly dense. It's usually used by kobolds to shrink down foes or prey,\
  \ weakening them and making them more vulnerable to combat maneuvers. The target\
  \ must succeed at a DC 11 Fortitude save or decrease in size by one size category\
  \ for 1d4 rounds, as the spell reduce person."
