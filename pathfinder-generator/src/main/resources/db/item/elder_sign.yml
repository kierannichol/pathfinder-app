description: "This stone tablet bears a carving in the shape of a twig with five branches.\
  \ There are only a limited number of Elder Signs in existence, so each time one\
  \ of these artifacts is destroyed, the universe loses one of the few things that\
  \ can reliably keep cosmic horrors at bay—and inevitable doom draws closer.\nA creature\
  \ holding an Elder Sign can cast banishment, forbiddance, and greater dispel magic\
  \ at will by reciting occult mantras, though all three effects work only against\
  \ creatures and magic related to the Elder Mythos, including any of the following\
  \ creatures (and other cosmic horror-related creatures, at the GM's discretion):\
  \ bhole, colour out of space, deep one, deep one elder, denizen of Leng, elder thing,\
  \ flying polyp, gug, hound of Tindalos, Leng ghoul, Leng spider, mi-go, nightgaunt,\
  \ ratling, shantak, shoggoth, spawn of Yog-Sothoth, star-spawn of Cthulhu, voonith,\
  \ wendigo, and yithian. Casting forbiddance this way doesn't require a costly material\
  \ component, but if the same Elder Sign is used to cast forbiddance again, the artifact's\
  \ connection to a previous location warded by the spell is severed, ending the first\
  \ spell's effects immediately. Casting banishment on one of the listed creatures\
  \ works even if the creature isn't extraplanar; in that case, it sends the creature\
  \ to the place on the Material Plane from which it originated.\nAn Elder Sign can\
  \ also banish a Great Old One (no save), but doing so causes the artifact to be\
  \ consumed in a bright flame."
destruction: "Elder Signs are immune to damage, and the only certain way to destroy\
  \ one of these artifacts is to banish a Great Old One with it."
