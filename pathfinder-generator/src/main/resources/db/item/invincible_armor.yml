description: "Invincible armor shifts between three different appearances, but always\
  \ weighs the same and protects as +2 impervious moderate fortification full plate.\
  \ As an immediate action, the wearer can change the armor into heavy plate that\
  \ blocks slashing attacks (DR 10/bludgeoning or piercing), thickly layered chainmail\
  \ that blocks piercing attacks (DR 10/ bludgeoning or slashing), or overlapping\
  \ metal scales that block bludgeoning attacks (DR 10/piercing or slashing). In addition,\
  \ invincible armor provides the wearer with 5 points of resistance to acid, cold,\
  \ electricity, fire, and sonic, and is itself unharmed by damage from any of these\
  \ energy types."
