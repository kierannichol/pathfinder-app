description: "The creation of some long-forgotten tyrant, this iron crown is fitted\
  \ with four retractable spikes that can slide into the crown's interior. When the\
  \ crown of the iron king is placed on a creature's head, these spikes burrow violently\
  \ inward. The wearer becomes the thrall of the creature who placed the crown on\
  \ it for as long as it wears the crown. The crown must be placed on either a willing\
  \ or unconscious creature, which takes a full-round action that provokes attacks\
  \ of opportunity. Taking off the crown also takes a full-round action that provokes\
  \ attacks of opportunity and can be taken only by the creature who put the crown\
  \ on the wearer, or at the command of that creature. Although the crown's spikes\
  \ dig into the head of the wearer, it does no permanent harm aside from leaving\
  \ four vicious-looking scars once the crown is removed.\nOnce a creature becomes\
  \ a thrall of the crown's user, it must do everything the user commands, as per\
  \ the spell dominate person —though the crown's dominance is not limited to humanoids,\
  \ lasts as long the creature is wearing the crown, and allows no saving throw."
destruction: "The crown is destroyed if a creature places the crown on its own head.\
  \ This not only destroys the crown but it also kills the wearer. The wearer cannot\
  \ be returned to life by any means short of divine intervention."
