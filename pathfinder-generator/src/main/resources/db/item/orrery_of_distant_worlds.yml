description: "This portable orrery models Golarion's solar system, and is collapsible\
  \ down to a 1-foot-diameter globe—expanding it out to its full size (about 4 feet\
  \ across) or collapsing it takes 2d6 minutes.\nWhen expanded, the orrery of distant\
  \ worlds becomes affixed to whatever surface it sits upon, functioning as if anchored\
  \ to that surface via an immovable rod. If consulted, it grants a +10 bonus on all\
  \ Knowledge (geography) checks made to navigate or to answer questions about outer\
  \ space. Once per month, it may be used to contact alien minds on far-flung worlds—\
  this works identically to the spell contact other plane (use the demigod line to\
  \ determine the effects of the spell or to determine ability score decreases). At\
  \ your discretion, use of the orrery can have unanticipated results, as it can accidentally\
  \ release stored information when activated (see area D7 on page 24 for an example\
  \ of this event).\nThe 11 planetary spheres and the sun sphere can be detached and\
  \ carried separately. As long as even one of these spheres is missing, the orrery\
  \ cannot be collapsed or moved, nor can it be used to contact alien minds. Once\
  \ detached, a planetary sphere carries 4 charges that can be used to activate a\
  \ spell effect. The effects of the 12 spheres and the number of charges required\
  \ to use a sphere's spell are as follows:"
destruction: "Although it is a minor artifact, the orrery of distant worlds may be\
  \ destroyed by regular damage. It has hardness 20 and 300 hit points, but has already\
  \ taken 180 points of damage from the crash. Charges held within spheres remain\
  \ usable even after the orrery is destroyed, but they can no longer be recharged."
