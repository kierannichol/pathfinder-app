description: "As black as coal, this short sword grows more potent the farther it\
  \ is kept from light. It acts as a +1 short sword when in dim light. In darkness,\
  \ it acts as +2 short sword. When surrounded by supernatural darkness, such as in\
  \ an area of deeper darkness, it acts a +2 short sword and bestows the benefit of\
  \ the Blind-Fight feat on its wielder. In daylight or bright illumination, the sword\
  \ temporarily loses all its magical enhancement bonuses and acts as a masterwork\
  \ weapon, though it resumes its magical functions once it is no longer in the bright\
  \ light."
