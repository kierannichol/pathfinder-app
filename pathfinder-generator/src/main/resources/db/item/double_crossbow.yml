description: "This heavy weapon fires a pair of iron-tipped bolts with a single squeeze\
  \ of the trigger. Because of its size and weight, you take a –4 penalty on your\
  \ attack roll if you're proficient with it, or –8 if you're not. If the attack hits,\
  \ the target takes damage from both bolts. Critical hits, sneak attack damage, and\
  \ other precision-based damage apply to only the first bolt. Reloading one bolt\
  \ is a standard action; the Rapid Reload feat reduces this to a move action. Crossbow\
  \ Mastery (Advanced Player's Guide) allows you to reload both bolts as a move action.\
  \ A double crossbow fires crossbow bolts."
