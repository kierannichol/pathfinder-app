description: "This large, portable spool of rope or cord contains a clockwork mechanism\
  \ to reel the rope back in. You can unspool the rope from the mechanism at a rate\
  \ of 30 feet per round. Activating the mechanism as a move action causes the rope\
  \ to retract at a rate of 100 feet per round, pulling up to 200 pounds of attached\
  \ weight. The mechanism works more slowly with increased weight, retracting the\
  \ rope at a rate of 50 feet per round with more than 200 pounds but up to 300 pounds\
  \ of attached weight. Weight in excess of 300 pounds prevents the mechanism from\
  \ functioning. A rope recaller is sold with 100 feet of hemp rope already attached,\
  \ but can hold up to 1,000 feet of rope. Replacing or adding rope to the device\
  \ requires 1 minute of work for every 100 feet of rope."
