description: "This +1 dagger is jet black and appears to drip grains of sand from\
  \ its blade. Once per day as an immediate action when the wielder unsuccessfully\
  \ attacks, he can activate the dagger to disappear in a whirlwind of black sand.\
  \ The wielder teleports as per dimension door to any unoccupied square within 30\
  \ feet and can attempt a Stealth check to hide as if he were not being observed.\
  \ The wielder cannot take any other creatures with him when he activates the dagger.\
  \ Activating the dagger does not provoke attacks of opportunity."
