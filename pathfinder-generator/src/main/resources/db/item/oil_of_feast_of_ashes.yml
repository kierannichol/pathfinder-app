name: "Oil of Feast of Ashes"
description: "You curse the target with a hunger no food can assuage. On a failed\
  \ saving throw, the target begins to starve. The effects of this spell cannot inflict\
  \ more nonlethal damage than the target has hit points. No amount of eating can\
  \ counter the effect and, further, even attempting to eat causes the target to become\
  \ nauseated for 1 round unless they make a DC 12 Fortitude save. The target still\
  \ experiences the other normal effects of anything consumed (such as poisons or\
  \ potions). Feast of ashescan be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish,\
  \ miracle, remove curse, or wishspell, but effects suffered as a result of starvation\
  \ must be healed by normal means."
