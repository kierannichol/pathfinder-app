description: "A luxurious crimson silk hammock embroidered with gold thread and gold\
  \ fringed tassels, a hospitality's hammock is a beauty to behold, but no self-respecting\
  \ seaman would ever be caught using it. Aside from the hammock's considerable looks,\
  \ a single night's rest in it eliminates any sign of seasickness (see page 26).\
  \ Additionally, a hospitality's hammock is so comfortable that those who sleep in\
  \ it for a full 8 hours regain hit points as if they had an entire day of bed rest.\
  \ Climbing into or out of the hammock is a fullround action. A successful DC 5 Dexterity\
  \ check reduces this to a move action.\nThe captain of the Man's Promise was particularly\
  \ susceptible to seasickness, and commissioned this item to make his long voyages\
  \ away from home more comfortable. Although he would never admit it to those under\
  \ his command, Mr. Plugg was pleasantly surprised to find the hospitality's hammock\
  \ in his cabin when he took command of the Man's Promise, and has slept in it every\
  \ night since.\nThe hospitality's hammock originally appeared on page 72 of Necromancer\
  \ Games' Dead Man's Chest."
