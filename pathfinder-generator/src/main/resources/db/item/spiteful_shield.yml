description: "This +2 mirrored heavy steel shield is infused with the spite of divs,\
  \ allowing its bearer to terrify and disgust foes with twisted reflections of themselves.\
  \ As a move action up to three times per day, the wielder can show an adjacent creature\
  \ its reflection in the shield's mirrored surface. As the creature looks at its\
  \ mirror image, the image changes to show the creature hideously warped, covered\
  \ with plague sores, or otherwise twisted. The creature must succeed at a DC 16\
  \ Will save or become shaken and sickened for 2d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting\
  \ fear effect, and it can be avoided as though it were a gaze attack."
