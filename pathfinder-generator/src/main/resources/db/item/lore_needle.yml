description: "This thick silver needle is approximately 6 inches long and can be carefully\
  \ inserted into the brain of a willing or helpless target in order to magically\
  \ expand the target's knowledge. Implanting a lore needle takes 10 minutes and requires\
  \ a successful DC 15 Heal check. A user can insert the needle into her own head\
  \ with a successful DC 25 Heal check. On a failure, the needle deals 2 points of\
  \ Constitution damage and 2 points of Intelligence damage to the target and is not\
  \ implanted. A creature with an implanted lore needle can, up to three times per\
  \ day when attempting a Knowledge check, apply to that check its bonus on any other\
  \ single Knowledge skill in which it is trained."
