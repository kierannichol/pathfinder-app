description: "This dark burgundy cloak shifts its hue and pattern to blend in against\
  \ its surroundings, granting the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks.\
  \ The cloak holds a concealed scabbard in which a light blade (as defined in the\
  \ fighter weapon group) can be hidden. The wearer can draw the blade as if from\
  \ a normal scabbard, but anyone searching the wearer for the item must succeed at\
  \ a DC 20 Perception check, as if he were looking for a secret door.\nIf a swashbuckler\
  \ is wearing the cloak, she can spend 1 panache point to vanish, as the spell."
