description: "A whip of cracking magical might appears in your hand, allowing you\
  \ lash spells from the mind of enemy spellcasters. With a lash of bluish-purple\
  \ energy, you strip many protective spells and effects from a single creature. If\
  \ the target of this spell is currently under the effects of any harmless spells\
  \ or effects, it must succeed at a Will save or all of those spells and effects\
  \ end, stripping the target of the benefit of those spells. If the target is not\
  \ currently under the effect of least one harmless spell, the target is instead\
  \ confused for 1d4 rounds."
