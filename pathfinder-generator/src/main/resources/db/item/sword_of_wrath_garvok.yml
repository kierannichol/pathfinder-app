description: "This scarred piece of crimson stained metal functions similarly to a\
  \ +5 returning throwing greatsword. Instead of the normal benefit of the throwing\
  \ weapon special ability, Garvok can be thrown with a 25-foot range increment. Additionally,\
  \ whenever Garvok strikes a foe, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save\
  \ or take an additional 5d6 points of fire damage. If the sword scores a critical\
  \ hit, it explodes in a fireball centered on the wielder's opponent. All creatures\
  \ within the fireball's 20-foot-radius spread—including Garvok's wielder and allies,\
  \ if within range—take 10d6 points of fire damage (DC 25 Reflex for half). The wielder\
  \ has no control over the sword's eruption and cannot prevent it from exploding.\
  \ The sword returns to its wielder's hand, fully reformed, just before the beginning\
  \ of his next turn.\nDormancy The Alara'hai were crafted to serve the runelords\
  \ of Thassilon. In modern times, however, these runelords lie dead or dormant. With\
  \ no lords to serve, the weapons of their champions lie dormant as well, reducing\
  \ each to a +2 weapon with the noted weapon special abilities (those detailed on\
  \ page 469 of the Core Rulebook) but no other properties. The only way to awaken\
  \ one of the blades is to restore its runelord master to active life or have some\
  \ other legitimate ruler take up its master's mantle (the weapon determines what\
  \ is considered legitimate). The swords can detect such restorations and f lare\
  \ to full power immediately, demanding their wielder seek out the restored runelord\
  \ and swear eternal fealty."
destruction: "Each of the Seven Swords of Sin can be destroyed merely if commanded\
  \ to break. That command, however, must come from the rightful runelord of the nation\
  \ and school of magic associated with the blade."
