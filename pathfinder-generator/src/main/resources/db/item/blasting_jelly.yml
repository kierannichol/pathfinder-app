description: "This volatile gray paste sticks to solid surfaces and creates a concentrated\
  \ blast when exposed to fire, making it a valuable excavation tool. You can apply\
  \ 1 dose of blasting jelly to a 5-foot square as a standard action. The paste can\
  \ be ignited with another standard action by striking it from an adjacent square\
  \ with a metal weapon or object. When thus ignited or otherwise exposed to fire,\
  \ the jelly explodes, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage to creatures and unattended\
  \ objects within the treated square. If the ignited square is adjacent to another\
  \ square containing blasting jelly, that square ignites as well. Blasting jelly\
  \ deals full damage to objects made of stone or softer material. Blasting jelly\
  \ decays relatively quickly when exposed to air, becoming inert after 4 hours if\
  \ not ignited."
