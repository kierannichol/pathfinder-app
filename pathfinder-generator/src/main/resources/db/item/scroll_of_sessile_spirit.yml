description: "You reach into the target creature and cause that spirits within to\
  \ become dormant and inactive. If the target is a medium with a spirit inhabiting\
  \ its body or a spiritualist with a phantom inhabiting its consciousness (or a member\
  \ of another class using the spirit or phantom class features), a failed save renders\
  \ that spirit or phantom powerless, suppressing any benefits the spirit or phantom\
  \ normally provides to its host, including bonus feats and spells known."
