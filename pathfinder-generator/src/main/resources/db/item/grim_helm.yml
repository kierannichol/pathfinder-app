description: "The matte surface of this pitted gray helm seems to absorb light, rather\
  \ than reflect it. The skull mask that serves as its visor is a constant reminder\
  \ of the fate that awaits all mortals. The wearer of the helm is immune to fear\
  \ effects but cannot gain the benefit of any morale bonuses.\nA creature that comes\
  \ within 20 feet of the wearer must succeed at a Will save (DC 14) or lose the benefit\
  \ of morale bonuses while it remains in that area. A creature that succeeds at this\
  \ saving throw is immune to this ability for 24 hours."
