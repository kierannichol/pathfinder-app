description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis black gossamer cap is woven from ethereal\
  \ moonbeams and nightmares. Whenever the wearer would experience a nightmare, whether\
  \ magical or mundane (including the dream haunting ability of a night hag), the\
  \ cap absorbs it without effect.\nOnce per day, when a changeling wearer sleeps\
  \ with her face covered by the cap, she can send a nightmare (DC 17). If the victim\
  \ fails his saving throw against the nightmare, the wearer can target him with major\
  \ curse as well, but must describe to the victim a condition under which the curse\
  \ will be lifted. The victim automatically understands the terms of the curse even\
  \ if he does not share a language with the wearer. The condition must be possible\
  \ to the wearer's knowledge given what she knows of the victim's resources, but\
  \ may be extremely difficult to achieve and may require significant luck or assistance\
  \ (at the GM's discretion). A cap of darkest dreams can maintain only one curse\
  \ at a time; if the wearer uses the cap to curse a new victim, any previous curse\
  \ ends. Once per day by uttering the command word, a changeling wearer can unleash\
  \ the vile essence of nightmares upon all creatures around her. She emanates a cloak\
  \ of dreams as per the spell. Any creature sent to sleep by this aura automatically\
  \ suffers a nightmare (DC 17) evoking its deepest fears."
