description: "Larger even than a longbow, these bows are often made from the horns\
  \ of great beasts. Though they have a shorter range than other bows, their greater\
  \ destructive power is highly favored by orcs and their kin. All hornbows are composite\
  \ bows and can be modified to benefit from high Strength scores in the same way\
  \ as other composite bows. Any effect that applies to both longbows and shortbows\
  \ also applies to hornbows."
