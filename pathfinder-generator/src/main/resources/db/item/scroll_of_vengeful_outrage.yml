name: "Scroll of Vengeful Outrage"
description: "You place a magical command upon a creature to seek out and destroy\
  \ a single enemy that has inflicted some perceived or actual harm to the target.\
  \ You designate the enemy at the time of casting, which must be known by the target\
  \ (such as “your brother's murderer\") or can easily identify by sight (such as\
  \ “the hill giant king\"). The target is under the effect of a geas to find and\
  \ capture or kill this enemy, and the target takes the penalties of that spell as\
  \ long as it is not actively trying to reach the enemy. When the target enters combat\
  \ with the enemy, it gains a +6 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +3\
  \ morale bonus on Will saves, and is immune to the shaken and frightened conditions."
