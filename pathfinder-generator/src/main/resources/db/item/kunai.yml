description: "Crafted from a single piece of iron, a kunai has a leaf-shaped blade\
  \ and a ring for a pommel. Adapted from the common trowel, the kunai has a thick\
  \ blade that is sharpened only near the tip. Unlike finer weapons, the kunai can\
  \ readily substitute for a crowbar or piton without being damaged in the process."
