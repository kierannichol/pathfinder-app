description: "This triangular-shaped rod is made from metal tubes and is small enough\
  \ to fit into a pocket or a pouch. One tube on the item is inlaid with a line of\
  \ small emeralds, and the other is inlaid with a line of small sapphires. A primal\
  \ dowser can be activated as a standard action to detect and identify the presence\
  \ of variant magic within 60 feet for up to 10 minutes per day. In or near an area\
  \ of primal or wild magic, the emeralds glow, and in or near magic dead zones, the\
  \ sapphires glow. This item's duration need not be used all at once, but it must\
  \ be used in 1-minute intervals."
