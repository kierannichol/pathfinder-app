description: "Upon casting this spell, you turn invisible, as per the invisibility\
  \ spell, and you choose a second target. That creature can still see you as though\
  \ you were not invisible, and you can attack that creature without ending the invisibility\
  \ effect on you. However, if you attack any other creature, this spell ends. If\
  \ you cast this spell multiple times, you can attack any of the affected creatures\
  \ without ending the spell."
