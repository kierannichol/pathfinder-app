description: "Contract rings are crafted in pairs (the price is for both rings), establishing\
  \ a connection between the wearers. Each wearer must wear their ring for 24 hours\
  \ before they begin to work. Contract rings grant a +10 competence bonus on Sense\
  \ Motive checks made against the other wearer, and creatures wearing linked contract\
  \ rings can understand each other's language.\nOnce per day, Contract rings can\
  \ seal a contract. The two wearers join hands and willingly state what each is agreeing\
  \ to. Once both agree, each wearer accepts a lesser geas (no save) to fulfill the\
  \ terms of the contract. This function does not occur if either character is under\
  \ a mind-affecting effect or threat that forces her agreement. This compulsion lasts\
  \ 7 days, starting immediately. While the lesser geas remains in effect, neither\
  \ wearer can remove her ring, and neither ring can establish another lesser geas.\
  \ If either ring is destroyed, the effects of any active lesser geas remain for\
  \ both creatures, but the surviving ring becomes nonfunctional once the lesser geas\
  \ expires until the missing ring is repaired or replaced. If one wearer's lesser\
  \ geas is broken, the other wearer's is removed."
