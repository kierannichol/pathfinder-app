description: "Fashioned from the salvaged mechanical \"bones\" of the first gearsmen\
  \ that issued forth from Silver Mount, this gear-jointed, metal exoskeleton can\
  \ be affixed to or removed from a suit of medium or heavy armor in 10 minutes. While\
  \ attached, the enchanted frame bears some of the armor's burden, reducing the armor's\
  \ check penalty by 2. In addition, three times per day, the wearer of a medium or\
  \ heavy suit of armor attached to a steelbone frame can ignore the armor's reduction\
  \ to his speed for 1 round."
