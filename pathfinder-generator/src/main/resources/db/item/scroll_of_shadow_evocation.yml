name: "Scroll of Shadow Evocation"
description: "You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to cast a quasi-real, illusory\
  \ version of a sorcerer or wizard evocation spell of 4th level or lower. Spells\
  \ that deal damage have normal effects unless an affected creature succeeds on a\
  \ Will save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth damage from the attack.\
  \ If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect\
  \ is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. If recognized\
  \ as a shadow evocation, a damaging spell deals only one-fifth (20%) damage. Regardless\
  \ of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed\
  \ any save (or spell resistance) that the spell being simulated allows, but the\
  \ save DC is set according to shadow evocation's level (5th) rather than the spell's\
  \ normal level."
