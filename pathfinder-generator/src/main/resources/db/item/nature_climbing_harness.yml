description: "A nature climbing harness is a series of buckles, straps, and trusses\
  \ that can be worn over clothing or light armor. As a standard action, you can secure\
  \ yourself in place on a vertical surface so that both your hands are free. You\
  \ can remain in this position without needing to attempt additional Climb checks,\
  \ and you don't lose your Dexterity bonus to your AC as long as you remain anchored.\
  \ As long as you are anchored in this way, you cannot move, but you gain a +5 circumstance\
  \ bonus on Climb checks to avoid falling whenever you take damage. You can release\
  \ yourself to start moving again as a move action."
