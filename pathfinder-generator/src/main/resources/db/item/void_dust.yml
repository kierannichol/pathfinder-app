description: "Infused with the essence of destruction, a pinch of void dust unmakes\
  \ force effects. If sprinkled on or thrown at a force effect, it acts as a dispel\
  \ magic, unless the force effect is immune to dispel magic, in which case it acts\
  \ like disintegrate. Void dust can be sprinkled on an adjacent force effect or thrown\
  \ up to 10 feet. No attack roll is required. A single pinch affects only a single\
  \ force effect. A found container holds three pinches."
