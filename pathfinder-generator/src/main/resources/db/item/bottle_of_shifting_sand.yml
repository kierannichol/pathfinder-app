description: "This ornate glass bottle is filled with loose sand. A bottle of shifting\
  \ sand can be thrown as a splash weapon targeting a specific grid intersection (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Core Rulebook 202). Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range\
  \ increment of 10 feet. If thrown on an earthen or sandy surface, the bottle breaks,\
  \ creating an area of churning, shifting sand in a 20-foot spread that obliterates\
  \ tracks and is considered difficult terrain. Acrobatics checks in the area take\
  \ a â€“5 penalty. Creatures entering or beginning their turn in the affected area\
  \ must succeed at a DC 14 Reflex save each round or become entangled until the beginning\
  \ of their next turn. If they attempt to move while entangled, they must succeed\
  \ at a second Reflex save or fall prone. At the end of 5 rounds, the sand disappears,\
  \ leaving no aftereffects.\nIf a bottle of shifting sand is thrown at a creature,\
  \ a direct hit instead throws up a cloud of whirling sand that surrounds the creature.\
  \ This cloud of sand provides concealment to the target and any creatures in adjacent\
  \ squares for 1 round, but has no effect on the surrounding terrain."
