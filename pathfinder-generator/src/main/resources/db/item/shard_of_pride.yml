description: "The Shard of Pride is made of coppery horacalcum. As long as the Shard\
  \ of Pride is carried, its owner can use major image as a spell-like ability once\
  \ per day, gains a +2 insight bonus on saves versus illusion spells, and gains a\
  \ +2 insight bonus on all skill checks.\nCurse: The owner suffers delusions of grandeur,\
  \ and is sickened whenever she must serve another creature as a subordinate of any\
  \ sort for as long as that arrangement persists. She cannot gain the benefit of\
  \ the aid another action, nor can she take the aid another action."
destruction: "A shard of the Sihedron cannot be destroyed individually. Only by recombining\
  \ them into the Sihedron and then using that artifact's method of destruction can\
  \ one destroy the shards."
