description: "A clockwork key has two uses, but one functions only if Abadar is your\
  \ patron. Constructs avoid attacking the bearer of the clockwork key, directing\
  \ their attacks toward other targets if possible, unless they are directly threatened\
  \ by the bearer or are ordered by their creator to attack. If there are no targets\
  \ other than a clockwork key's bearer, a construct will act and attack as normal.\
  \ If Abadar is your patron, you can use the clockwork key as an improvised weapon\
  \ that deals 1d2 points of damage. If you strike a construct with a clockwork key,\
  \ it takes 1d4 points of damage and must make a DC 12 Will save. If the construct\
  \ fails, it is paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. Once the key has successfully paralyzed\
  \ a construct, it is destroyed."
