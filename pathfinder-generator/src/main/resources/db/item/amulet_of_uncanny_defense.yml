description: "This heavy, cold-iron amulet depicts a bear's head with jaws open in\
  \ a roar. It increases the wearer's uncanny dodge ability, causing it to function\
  \ as improved uncanny dodge. (The amulet has no benefit for characters who do not\
  \ have uncanny dodge). If the wearer already has improved uncanny dodge, treat his\
  \ class level as 4 higher for the purpose of determining the number of rogue levels\
  \ an attacker must have in order to sneak attack the wearer by flanking him."
