description: "Currently hidden at the heart of the Eye of Avarice in a demiplane lodged\
  \ between Leng and the Material Plane, Karzoug's runewell of greed is the key to\
  \ both his escape from the destruction of Thassilon and his eventual return to life.\
  \ The runewell itself is a core part of the Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path,\
  \ but by the time the PCs arrive at the Eye of Avarice, the circular well (which\
  \ appears to be filled with molten gold) has already done its job absorbing fragments\
  \ of greedy souls and is in the process of using that energy to finalize Karzoug's\
  \ escape.\nBeyond this effect, though, Karzoug can utilize the runewell in other\
  \ ways. It grants him the ability to use scrying at will, although the runewell\
  \ 's range is limited to the Xin-Shalast region or to specific agents like Mokmurian,\
  \ Xanesha, and Lucrecia. Creatures that wear magic items marked with the Sihedron\
  \ take a –4 penalty on saves against this effect. The runewell allows Karzoug to\
  \ see through the eyes and speak through the mouths of anyone who wears a Sihedron\
  \ medallion (see page 426). He can also, given time, call up from the runewell a\
  \ live adult blue dragon minion to serve him as an ally or mount. This essentially\
  \ functions as a gate spell, save that the dragon is actually created by the runewell\
  \ rather than called. Karzoug can only have one such dragon in existence at any\
  \ one time, and must wait 8 hours after a previous dragon's death before calling\
  \ a new blue dragon to serve him.\nThe runewell itself is 10 feet in diameter and\
  \ 10 feet deep. The liquid it contains functions in all ways as molten gold—dealing\
  \ damage is if it were lava upon creatures splashed or immersed within it. Gold\
  \ drawn from the runewell cools normally and is permanent—the runewell immediately\
  \ replenishes gold taken from its supplies—yet this gold cannot exist more than\
  \ 30 feet from the runewell's rim. If brought beyond this range, it vanishes in\
  \ an instant.\nRunewells associated with other runelords and sins exist throughout\
  \ the ruins of Thassilon; each of these artifacts is a unique item with its own\
  \ powers."
destruction: "The runewell of greed is linked to Karzoug, and as long as he lives,\
  \ the runewell cannot be destroyed. If Karzoug is slain, the molten gold within\
  \ the runewell itself immediately hardens and turns to chalky, worthless stone,\
  \ destroying the runewell in the process."
