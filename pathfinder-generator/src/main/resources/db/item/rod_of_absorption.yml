description: "This rod absorbs spells or spell-like abilities into itself. The magic\
  \ absorbed must be a single-target spell or a ray directed at either the character\
  \ holding the rod or her gear. The rod then nullifies the spell's effect and stores\
  \ its potential until the wielder releases this energy in the form of spells of\
  \ her own. She can instantly detect a spell's level as the rod absorbs that spell's\
  \ energy. Absorption requires no action on the part of the user if the rod is in\
  \ hand at the time.\nA running total of absorbed (and used) spell levels should\
  \ be kept. The wielder of the rod can use captured spell energy to cast any spell\
  \ she has prepared without expending the prepared spell itself. The only restrictions\
  \ are that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod must be equal to or greater\
  \ than the level of the spell the wielder wants to cast, that any material components\
  \ required for the spell be present, and that the rod be in the wielder's hand when\
  \ he casts the spell. For casters such as bards or sorcerers who do not prepare\
  \ spells, the rod's energy can be used to cast any spell of the appropriate level\
  \ or levels that they know.\nA rod of absorption can absorb a maximum of 50 spell\
  \ levels and thereafter can only discharge any remaining potential it might have.\
  \ The rod cannot be recharged. The wielder knows the rod's remaining absorbing potential\
  \ and current amount of stored energy.\nTo determine the absorption potential remaining\
  \ in a newly found rod, roll d% and divide the result by 2. Then roll d% again:\
  \ on a result of 71â€“100, half the levels already absorbed by the rod are still stored\
  \ within."
