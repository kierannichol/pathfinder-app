description: "The subject becomes paralyzed and freezes in place. It is aware and\
  \ breathes normally but cannot take any actions, even speech. Each round on its\
  \ turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This is a\
  \ full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A winged creature\
  \ who is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can't swim and may\
  \ drown."
