description: "This potent preparation causes a creature who drinks it to fall madly\
  \ in love with the first creature he or she perceives after consuming it. The drinker's\
  \ attitude toward that creature becomes helpful. If a romantic attraction is possible\
  \ toward the first person viewed, the drinker falls in love with that person. Otherwise,\
  \ the drinker's love is a platonic adoration. The effects of the philter are permanent\
  \ unless removed by a break enchantment, dispel magic, limited wish, miracle, remove\
  \ curse, or wish."
