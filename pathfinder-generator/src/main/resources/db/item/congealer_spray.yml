description: "This volatile liquid is usually dispensed from a spray atomizer, which\
  \ disperses the liquid in a 15-foot cone. Congealer spray causes the surface of\
  \ an ooze creature to stiffen into a leathery material. Ooze and plant creatures\
  \ in the affected area become staggered for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude DC 15 negates).\
  \ If an affected creature has the split defensive ability (Bestiary 2 302), it cannot\
  \ benefit from that ability until the effects of the congealer spray wear off, regardless\
  \ of whether the creature succeeded at its saving throw."
