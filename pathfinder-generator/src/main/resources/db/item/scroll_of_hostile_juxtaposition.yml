name: "Scroll of Hostile Juxtaposition"
description: "You create a dimensional link to the target creature. When attacked\
  \ or the subject of a spell that deals damage to you, you can spend an immediate\
  \ action to cause yourself and the target creature to teleport and switch places.\
  \ The target then becomes the target of the triggering attack or spell instead of\
  \ you. If you fail to teleport out of the area of an effect, that effect might still\
  \ affect you. If the target creature cannot fit safely into the new space without\
  \ squeezing, or you try to teleport the target into an occupied space or a space\
  \ it could not normally stand within, the juxtaposition fails. Further, if the target\
  \ is unconscious or dead when you attempt to switch places, the juxtaposition fails.\
  \ Once you have used it to teleport once, this spell is discharged."
