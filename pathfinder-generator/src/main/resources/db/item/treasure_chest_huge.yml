description: "A treasure chest is a common wooden chest treated with resin to make\
  \ the wood water-resistant. Metal bands, usually bronze to prevent rusting, are\
  \ strapped around the treasure chest for extra reinforcement, and the lock is also\
  \ typically made of bronze. A treasure chest uses the statistics of an ordinary\
  \ wooden chest (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 62), but its hit points increase\
  \ by 25% and its break DC increases by 2. Treasure chests are waterproof and withstand\
  \ being buried better than ordinary chests"
