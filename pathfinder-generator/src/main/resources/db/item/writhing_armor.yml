description: "This elaborate +2 silken ceremonial armor is made of layers of silken\
  \ braids and is often worn by diplomats and royalty when more drab or utilitarian\
  \ armor is socially inappropriate. The wearer of writhing armor can cause it to\
  \ unravel long braids of silk that twist and lash out of their own accord. The wearer\
  \ can use one such braid to make attacks as a +1 whip. The constant writhing of\
  \ the braids also grants the wearer a +4 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round when taking\
  \ the withdraw action as a full-round action."
