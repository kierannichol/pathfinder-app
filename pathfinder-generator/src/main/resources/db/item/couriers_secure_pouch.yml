description: "A courier's secure pouch appears as a typical soft-sided leather satchel\
  \ with a shoulder strap and a fold-over flap with a buckle that can be fastened\
  \ to seal documents inside. The pouch allows for the safe transport of important,\
  \ sensitive, or secret documents from one place to another with minimal risk of\
  \ them falling into the wrong hands. When any type of letters, writs, contracts,\
  \ or even scrolls are placed inside the pouch, the buckle is fastened, and the command\
  \ word is uttered, the pouch seals the documents safely inside, magically protecting\
  \ them from being removed again. Unless the answering command word is uttered before\
  \ unbuckling the flap, the magic of the pouch instantly and completely erases all\
  \ the text, leaving behind only blank pages, as per the erase spell. Attempting\
  \ to cut or otherwise damage the pouch in order to bypass the buckle results in\
  \ the magical protection taking effect, but the pouch itself withstands damage as\
  \ normal for a magic item. Attempting to deactivate the pouch's magic without attempting\
  \ to open it doesn't trigger the erasure. The courier's secure pouch can protect\
  \ five pages of writing. If more pages (or an entire book) are placed inside, only\
  \ the first five pages are affected. Only paper, parchment, vellum, and similar\
  \ materials are affected; writing inscribed on wood, stone, or wax are not subject\
  \ to the pouch's magic."
