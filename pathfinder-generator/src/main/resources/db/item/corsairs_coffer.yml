description: "This huge-sized lacquered chest is bound in gold-plated steel, with\
  \ three hasps for securing locks and spadeshaped feet. The chest is airtight when\
  \ closed, and can be commanded to bury itself in dirt, loose soil, or sand. Once\
  \ per day, the chest can burrow down between 10 and 30 feet. The process takes 1\
  \ minute for every 10 feet the chest travels. The chest stops digging once it reaches\
  \ the desired depth, if it encounters solid stone, or if its path is blocked by\
  \ any other obstruction. A buried chest can be commanded to dig back to the surface\
  \ by a creature standing within 5 feet of the location beneath which it buried itself.\
  \ The chest doesn't leave a usable tunnel, nor does it dig any direction other than\
  \ down or back up.\nThe chest opens into an extradimensional space: its inside is\
  \ larger than its outside dimensions. This allows the chest to hold a large volume\
  \ of material, to a maximum of 3,000 pounds and 500 cubic feet. The contents of\
  \ the chest don't change its weight. Any effort to overload the chest fails, and\
  \ items must be drawn from the chest intentionally; it's not possible to tip the\
  \ chest over and spill its contents. Retrieving a specific item is a full-round\
  \ action. As with the secret chest spell, magic items placed inside a corsair's\
  \ coffer don't offer any benefit to characters carrying it. The chest is treated\
  \ as a bag of holding for the purpose of determining what happens if placed in another\
  \ extradimensional or nondimensional space. There's enough air for living creatures\
  \ placed within the chest to survive for 20 minutes, after which time they begin\
  \ to suffocate."
