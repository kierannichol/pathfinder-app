description: "The beauty of this red cloak hides its sinister nature, as at any moment\
  \ it is capable of shredding into numerous hideous creatures known as nightmare\
  \ bats. As a free action, you can release 1d4 nightmare bats. These bats remain\
  \ until destroyed and can be recalled into the cloak as a move action. Bats recalled\
  \ to the cloak are healed of all damage after 1 hour. A newly crafted cloak of nightmares\
  \ contains eight bats. When a bat is destroyed completely before it can be recalled,\
  \ it cannot be replaced and the cloak's upper limit is reduced by one."
