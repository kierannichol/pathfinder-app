description: "The wearer of this ring can make a melee touch attack against an undead\
  \ creature no more than one size category larger than himself, cutting off that\
  \ creature from undying energy. The wearer never suffers any ill effects that might\
  \ normally occur from coming into physical contact with an undead creature touched\
  \ in this way. On a successful hit, the undead cannot be healed or aided by the\
  \ effects of negative energy for 1d4 rounds. During this duration, positive energy\
  \ affects the undead creature normally."
