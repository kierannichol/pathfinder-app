description: "This handheld metal cylinder is embossed with traditional symbols tied\
  \ to protectiveness and has a handle that can be used to spin it. Mantra wheels\
  \ are often used by divine spellcasters who are blind or have difficulty with fine\
  \ gestures, or who simply enjoy using this traditional device. As a move action,\
  \ a scroll of a divine spell can be placed inside the wheel. The handle is then\
  \ spun, activating the scroll without the use of verbal or somatic components. If\
  \ the wheel's user would need to attempt a caster level check to activate the scroll\
  \ successfully, the wheel provides a +3 bonus on that check. Spinning the wheel\
  \ is part of the normal action required to activate the scroll (usually a standard\
  \ action or the spell's casting time, whichever is longer). Using the wheel to activate\
  \ a scroll provokes attacks of opportunity exactly as activating a scroll (or casting\
  \ the spell) normally would. The wheel can hold only one divine scroll at a time.\
  \ Removing an expended scroll from a mantra wheel is a swift action."
