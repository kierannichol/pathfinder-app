description: "Anyone peering into this bag of deep gray cloth sees nothing but empty\
  \ blackness. Within the bag exists an extradimensional space linked to the Plane\
  \ of Shadow. Three times per day, as a move action, the bearer can reach within\
  \ the bag and pull out 1d4 semisolid shards of shadow. The bag's bearer can use\
  \ each shard of shadow as a thrown weapon targeting a single 5-foot square. When\
  \ it hits, it acts as a darkness spell, but only affecting one 5-foot square. As\
  \ a move action, the bearer of the bag can move a shadow cloud up to 10 feet in\
  \ any direction. Whether or not they are thrown, the shards of shadow and shadow\
  \ clouds last 10 minutes before dissipating."
