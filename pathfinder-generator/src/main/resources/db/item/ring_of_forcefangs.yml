description: "This band negates any force spell or force spell-like ability targeted\
  \ at the wearer. Doing so gives the ring a number of charges equal to the spell\
  \ level of the incoming force effect. The ring can hold a maximum of 9 charges.\
  \ If an incoming force attack would charge the ring beyond this limit, the ring\
  \ does not negate the attack or gain charges, and the attack affects the wearer\
  \ normally. On command, the wearer can use the ring's charges to cast magic missile,\
  \ unleashing one missile (1d4+1 force damage) per charge but no more than five missiles\
  \ per round."
