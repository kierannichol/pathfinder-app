description: "This elegantly wrought +3 speed longsword remains pristine despite having\
  \ been sheathed in a submerged corpse's chest cavity for over 200 years. Given to\
  \ Bartolomae by an agent of Asmodeus in return for the warlord's (initially) secret\
  \ allegiance to the arch fiend, this weapon carries within it the cruel soul of\
  \ a long-dead high priest of Asmodeus. The weapon begins in a state of dormancy,\
  \ at which point all of its intelligent weapon powers are unavailable, and it functions\
  \ as nothing more than a +3 speed longsword. See the description of area L4 for\
  \ details on how the sword can be awakened."
destruction: "To destroy the weapon, you must immerse it in a bath of Asmodeus's tears."
