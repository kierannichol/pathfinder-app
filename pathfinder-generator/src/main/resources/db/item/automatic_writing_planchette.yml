description: "This finely crafted, heart-shaped wooden board has two delicate wheels\
  \ and a small aperture to hold a pencil, which acts as the board's third leg. Typically\
  \ used on a tabletop covered in butcher's paper, the device scribbles out mysterious\
  \ messages when employed by a creature using the automatic writing occult skill\
  \ unlock, and provides a +2 circumstance bonus on the Linguistics check. When used\
  \ to channel certain haunts capable of communication (see page 230), the planchette\
  \ doubles the rate of communication with the haunt, and grants the user a +4 circumstance\
  \ bonus on Linguistics checks to decipher the cryptic messages. These benefits do\
  \ not stack with those of other items that confer similar benefits (such as a talking\
  \ board)."
