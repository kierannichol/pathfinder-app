description: "Death bills are greatly coveted by redcaps, and the loss of a death\
  \ bill is considered a great shame punishable by exile or even death. A death bill\
  \ is a +1 scythe that leaves particularly unsightly wounds in its victims' fleshâ€”\
  these wounds do not bleed, and have dry, flaking edges, almost as if the wound had\
  \ been desiccated by desert winds. Three times per day, the wielder of a death bill\
  \ can swing the weapon as a standard action to create a scythe-shaped arc of dust\
  \ that sweeps out from the user in a 30-foot cone. All creatures in this area take\
  \ 2d4 points of slashing damage plus an amount of additional damage equal to the\
  \ user's Charisma modifier, and are staggered for 1 round by the pain of having\
  \ moisture drawn from their bodies by the supernatural effect. A successful DC 13\
  \ Reflex save halves the damage and negates the staggered effect. Once per day as\
  \ a swift action, as a death bill is used to reduce a foe to negative hit points\
  \ with a melee attack, the user may cast a death knell on that victim (Will DC 13\
  \ negates)."
