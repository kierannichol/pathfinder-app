description: "Most bags of devouring appear to be normal sacks, but Chomper is unlike\
  \ most bags of devouring. Sporting rows of vicious teeth, a bad attitude, and a\
  \ thirst to devour all things, this intelligent cursed item believes that it is\
  \ the favored maw and most important appendage of a creature it mysteriously refers\
  \ to as the Eater of All. Chomper hates all creatures except for demons, whom it\
  \ considers kindred spirits of destruction.\nChomper has all of the magical abilities\
  \ of a regular bag of devouring, along with the following additional powers."
