description: "This barbed +1 outsider (water) bane bolt is etched with runes of thirst\
  \ and desiccation. Any living creature struck by a dust bolt begins dying of thirst,\
  \ as the spell cup of dust (DC 14 Fortitude negates). Creatures with the aquatic\
  \ or water subtype save with a â€“4 penalty, and on a failed save they are also sickened\
  \ and staggered for 1 round."
