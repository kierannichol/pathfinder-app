description: "The shaft of this arrow is formed from numerous small bone fragments\
  \ that have been painstakingly glued together. On a successful hit, a splintercloud\
  \ arrow deals normal damage as it tears itself apart, creating a burst of razorsharp\
  \ bone shards centered on the target. These shards deal 1d3 points of piercing damage\
  \ to the target and any creatures adjacent to the target (Reflex DC 18 negates)."
