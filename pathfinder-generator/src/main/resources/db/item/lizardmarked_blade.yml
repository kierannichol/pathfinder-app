description: "The pommel of this +1 shocking gladius is shaped like the head of a\
  \ lightning-breathing linnorm. The wielder automatically detects any electrical\
  \ discharges within 100 feet, and as a move action can concentrate on a creature\
  \ within 60 feet to determine whether it has a resistance or immunity to electricity\
  \ damage.\nOnce per day, the wielder can speak the lizardmarked blade's command\
  \ word to cause the weapon to deal damage as if it's one size category larger than\
  \ it actually is (effectively increasing the gladius's damage die from 1d6 to 1d8).\
  \ This lasts for 10 minutes."
