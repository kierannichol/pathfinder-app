description: "These golden bracers are sculpted to depict a pair of mighty stags rearing\
  \ up in triumph. They grant a +4 bonus on all Strength ability checks and Strength-based\
  \ skill checks. As a swift action up to three times per day, the wearer can call\
  \ upon the power of these bracers to gain a +4 sacred bonus to Strength for 1 round.\
  \ The wearer can expend one use of mythic power to treat one Strength ability check\
  \ or Strength-based skill check as if he rolled a natural 20."
