description: "This mask is white on one side and black on the other, with glittering\
  \ gem lenses covering the eyes. Up to three times per day, the wearer can change\
  \ the energy damage of a fire spell she casts to cold, a cold spell to fire, an\
  \ acid spell to electricity, or an electricity spell to acid. All other effects\
  \ of the spell are unchanged (for example, an ice storm changed to fire damage still\
  \ deals bludgeoning damage and bestows a penalty on Perception checks). The mask\
  \ affects only spells up to 3rd level."
