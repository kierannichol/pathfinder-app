description: "This style of half-plate is specially crafted in a manner that allows\
  \ extra maneuverability for some physical activities. The armor check penalty for\
  \ Climb checks and jump checks is only â€“4 (masterwork and mithral versions of this\
  \ armor reduce this penalty as well as the normal penalty). In addition, unlike\
  \ with most heavy armors, the wearer can still run at quadruple speed instead of\
  \ triple speed."
