description: "Soon after the founding of Thassilon, the ancient emperor Xin crafted\
  \ the Alara'quin, seven icons symbolizing the runelords' mastery of rune magic and\
  \ dominance over their respective domains. Karzoug's +2 flaming dancing glaive is\
  \ one of these ancient weapons.\nKarzoug's burning glaive possesses a keen intellect,\
  \ granted to it by its imperial creator. Meant to embody all that is right and virtuous\
  \ about the luxury of wealth, the weapon is only concerned with the acquisition\
  \ of riches and safeguarding the treasures of the rightful runelord of Shalast.\
  \ It eagerly seeks to immolate non-spellcasters, which it sees as paupers likely\
  \ to steal what its master possesses. While the glaive endlessly fawns over Karzoug\
  \ (as it would over any rightful ruler of Shalast), it tirelessly berates other\
  \ wielders, constantly comparing their flaws to the perfection of its past runelord\
  \ owners."
destruction: "Karzoug's burning glaive can be destroyed by hurling it under the crushing\
  \ feet of the Oliphaunt of Jandelay, although only so long as no current runelord\
  \ of greed lives in the world."
