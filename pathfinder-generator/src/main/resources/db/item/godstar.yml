description: "This small star is made of a brittle metal alloy and attaches easily\
  \ to armor or a gauntlet. Each of the star's points is keyed to a specific god and\
  \ can serve as a holy symbol for that god. As a standard action, the wearer can\
  \ break off one of the star's points to activate an effect unique to that point.\
  \ Once a point has been broken off, it can't be activated again and can no longer\
  \ be used as a holy symbol for the deity to which it is keyed.\nWhen broken off,\
  \ each of the godstar's points provide effects as follows.\nAbadar: The point emanates\
  \ truth-telling magic in a 5-foot radius, as per zone of truth, for 10 minutes.\
  \ Any creature that succeeds at a DC 13 Will save ignores this effect.\nAsmodeus:\
  \ The wearer gains fire resistance 5 and her weapon attacks gain the flaming weapon\
  \ special ability for 1 minute.\nIomedae: If the wearer is under the effects of\
  \ a fear effect, she can attempt a new saving throw against it with a +4 sacred\
  \ bonus. The wearer can use this ability even if a fear effect would normally prevent\
  \ her from doing so.\nIrori: The wearer can attempt a Knowledge check to identify\
  \ a creature, even if she is untrained in the relevant Knowledge skill. She gains\
  \ a +8 bonus on this check.\nTorag: The point transforms into a +1 warhammer when\
  \ wielded by the owner of the godstar until it leaves her possession or after 1\
  \ minute. The wielder is considered proficient with this weapon for the duration\
  \ of this effect, after which the weapon becomes a nonmagical masterwork warhammer."
