description: "The repeating heavy crossbow holds 5 repeating crossbow bolts. As long\
  \ as it holds bolts, you can reload it by pulling the reloading lever (a free action).\
  \ Loading a new case of 5 bolts is a full-round action that provokes attacks of\
  \ opportunity.\nYou can fire a repeating crossbow with one hand or fire a repeating\
  \ crossbow in each hand in the same manner as you would a normal crossbow of the\
  \ same size. However, you must fire the weapon with two hands in order to use the\
  \ reloading lever, and you must use two hands to load a new case of bolts."
