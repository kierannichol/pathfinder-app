description: "This tiny glass bead transforms itself into a 10-foot-by-10- foot pile\
  \ of logs and kindling whenever its command word is spoken. A sturdy, 8-foot-tall\
  \ post juts out of the center of the log heap. This heap does not light upon coming\
  \ into being, but anyone who touches the heap and says a second command word causes\
  \ it to burst into flame (this also automatically activates any pyre salt in the\
  \ flame's area). The fire burns for 4 hours or until extinguished, at which point\
  \ it turns back into a bead. The owner of the item must wait twice as long as the\
  \ fire burned before she can order the bead to become a pile of logs again."
