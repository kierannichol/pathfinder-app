description: "When you apply this thin gel to your skin, armor, or clothing, it creates\
  \ a resistant barrier that protects you from fire or heat damage. You gain fire\
  \ resistance 5. The gel burns away as it absorbs fire damage; when it absorbs a\
  \ total of 20 points of fire damage, it is discharged. Fire ward gel counts as protection\
  \ from energy for the purpose of stacking multiple fire protection effects. Applying\
  \ fire ward gel takes 1 minute, and it lasts for 1 hour before losing its potency.\
  \ Multiple applications of fire ward gel do not stack; applying more while a dose\
  \ is active merely resets the potential amount of fire damage absorbed to 20 points."
