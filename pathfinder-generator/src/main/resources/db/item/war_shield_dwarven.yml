description: "This shield's sides are cut into jagged angles and honed to razor sharpness.\
  \ Dwarven skirmishers often wield these shields in pairs, savagely hacking opponents\
  \ to pieces, while some dwarven scoundrels enjoy the shields' imposing appearance\
  \ and ease of use. If you have the Two-Weapon Fighting feat and are wielding two\
  \ dwarven war-shields, increase the higher of the two shield bonuses by 1. You lose\
  \ this benefit for 1 round when you make a shield bash with one or both dwarven\
  \ war-shields (unless you have the Improved Shield Bash feat or a similar benefit).\
  \ A hand holding a dwarven warshield can't be used for anything else. A dwarven\
  \ war-shield gains no benefit from shield spikes."
