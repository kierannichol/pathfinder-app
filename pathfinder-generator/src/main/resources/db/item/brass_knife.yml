description: "Pirates often carry long brass knives for working aboard a ship. Though\
  \ brass doesn't hold as sharp an edge as steel, it isn't vulnerable to rust like\
  \ steel is. In a pinch, a pirate can use his brass knife as a weapon. Mostly, though,\
  \ they are used for cutting ropes, cleaning fish, and other sundry tasks.\nA brass\
  \ knife has the fragile quality. A fragile weapon gains the broken condition if\
  \ the wielder rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with the weapon. If a fragile\
  \ weapon is already broken, rolling a natural 1 destroys it instead."
