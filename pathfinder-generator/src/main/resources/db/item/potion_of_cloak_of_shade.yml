description: "This spell provides the subject with some degree of protection from\
  \ the harmful effects of the sun. The cloaked subject treats environmental heat\
  \ due to sun exposure as one level less: severe heat is considered very hot conditions,\
  \ while very hot is considered average temperature (see heat dangers). The cloak\
  \ of shadealso reduces any penalties from sunlight by 1. The spell does not, however,\
  \ eliminate the effects of direct sunlight on creatures vulnerable to sunlight.\
  \ Cloak of shadehas no effect on environmental heat from sources other than the\
  \ sun."
