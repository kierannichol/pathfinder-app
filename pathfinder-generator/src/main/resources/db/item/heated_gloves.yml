description: "These thick, fur-lined gloves have several internal pockets containing\
  \ segmented packets of alchemical reagents that produce heat for 4 hours when broken\
  \ and mixed. The wearer can massage the gloves to activate these heat packets as\
  \ a full-round action. While the heat packets last, the wearer ignores the Strength\
  \ and Dexterity penalties from the fatigued condition when performing Climb, Disable\
  \ Device, and Sleight of Hand checks. Replacement heat packets cost 1 gp, and the\
  \ heat packets in the gloves can be replaced with 1 minute of uninterrupted work."
