description: "This thick leather belt is adorned with several oversized iron plates\
  \ and disks depicting images of orc gladiators in battle. The wearer of a victor's\
  \ belt gains a +2 morale bonus on all combat maneuver checks and to Combat Maneuver\
  \ Defense. In addition, the wearer can enter a rage (as the rage spell) as a standard\
  \ action once per day. Whenever the wearer takes an amount of damage equal to at\
  \ least half his current hit points in a single round, there is a 50% chance that\
  \ the belt activates its rage ability automatically as an immediate action, provided\
  \ the power has not already been activated that day and the wearer is not already\
  \ raging. Regardless of how the rage is activated, it lasts for 5 rounds."
