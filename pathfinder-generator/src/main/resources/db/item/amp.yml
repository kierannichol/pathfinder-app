description: "This liquid intensifier can be added to a drug as a move action no more\
  \ than 1 round before the drug is taken. Amp increases all numeric effects of a\
  \ drug by 50%, including any bonuses, penalties, and ability damage inflicted by\
  \ the drug. Using amp with a drug increases the save DC to avoid becoming addicted\
  \ to that drug by 2 for 1d4 days; this increase stacks. If a drug combined with\
  \ amp is not consumed within 1 round, the amp spoils and the drug becomes tainted,\
  \ as if cut with bunk."
