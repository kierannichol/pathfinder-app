description: "These boots appear and initially function as one of the other kinds\
  \ of magic boots. When the wearer is in (or fleeing from) melee combat, boots of\
  \ dancing impede movement, making him behave as if irresistible dance had been cast\
  \ upon him. Only a remove curse spell enables the wearer to be rid of the boots\
  \ once their true nature is revealed."
