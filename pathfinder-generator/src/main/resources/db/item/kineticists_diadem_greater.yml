description: "This metal headband holds a glistening, diamond-shaped gem. A kineticist's\
  \ diadem includes one of five colors of gem, each corresponding to a different element:\
  \ blue (water), clear (aether), green (earth), red (fire), and white (air). The\
  \ diadem's gem grants the wearer greater control over its associated element.\n\
  While worn by a kineticist, this item increases the damage dealt by the kineticist's\
  \ simple and composite blasts that match the element of the inlaid gem by 1d6 points\
  \ (for a lesser kineticist's diadem), 2d6 points (for a kineticist's diadem), or\
  \ 3d6 points (for a greater kineticist's diadem). If the blast is a physical blast,\
  \ the extra damage dice from the kineticist's diadem increase to d8s instead of\
  \ d6s. These extra damage dice do not multiply on a critical hit, and the extra\
  \ damage dice do not apply to blasts with form infusions that do not apply the extra\
  \ damage from elemental overflow, like kinetic blade and kinetic whip."
