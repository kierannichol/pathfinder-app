name: "Scroll of Find the Path"
description: "The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical\
  \ route to a prominent specified destination, such as a city, keep, lake, or dungeon.\
  \ The locale can be outdoors or underground, as long as it is prominent. For example,\
  \ a hunter's cabin is not prominent enough, but a logging camp is. Find the path\
  \ works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale. The location\
  \ must be on the same plane as the subject at the time of casting."
