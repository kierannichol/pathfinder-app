description: "Hurling this crystalline, ember-filled vial at an enemy causes the vessel\
  \ to erupt in a burst of green smoke and burning ash that coalesces into a fire-blackened\
  \ skull with burning eyes. Wreathed in oily, acrid smoke and trailing hot embers,\
  \ the skull corkscrews around its target uttering biting insults and dire curses.\
  \ The black smoke left in its wake causes watering eyes and wracking coughs.\nWhen\
  \ a scourge vial is thrown as a ranged touch attack, the skull torments any single\
  \ struck creature of size Large or smaller. The skull moves with the target, distracting\
  \ it in combat with its chaotic orbit. Any combatant in melee with the target is\
  \ considered to be flanking with the skull.\nThe skull's trailing smoke and embers\
  \ cause the target (and any creature occupying the same square as the target) to\
  \ become dazzled. Furthermore, each round, the target must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude\
  \ save or become sickened by the smoke. Targets with the scent ability take a –\
  4 penalty on their Fortitude saves. Creatures with the fire subtype are immune to\
  \ the sickening effect. The skull and smoke dissipate in 5 rounds.\nIf an attack\
  \ roll made to throw a scourge vial fails, the vial is treated as a splash weapon\
  \ to determine where it lands instead. If there is creature of size Large or smaller\
  \ in the resulting square, make a touch attack against that target. If that attack\
  \ misses, or there is no valid target in that square, the skull shrieks harmlessly\
  \ before dissipating."
