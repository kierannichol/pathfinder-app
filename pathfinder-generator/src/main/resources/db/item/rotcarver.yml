description: "Though largely constructed in the image of Deskari's own terrible scythe,\
  \ Riftcarver, these +3 scythes bear tiny cracks and etchings that, upon close examination,\
  \ make the weapons appear like they're constructed of minute petrified maggots.\
  \ Once per day, upon scoring a successful critical hit with a Rotcarver, the wielder\
  \ can animate part of the blade as a rot grub that immediately attempts to burrow\
  \ into to the victim struck. The victim must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid\
  \ the grub; otherwise, it is affected as per the description of rot grubs on page\
  \ 245 of the GameMastery Guide. Additionally, once per week, the Rotcarver's wielder\
  \ can transform it into a swarm of rot grubs (see page 215 of Bestiary 3). The swarm\
  \ obeys the wielder's commands for 13 rounds before turning back into a weapon.\
  \ If the swarm is destroyed, it immediately reverts back to a weapon, which is undamaged.\
  \ The wielder takes no ill effects from a swarm under his control."
