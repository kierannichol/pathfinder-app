description: "This +1/+1 quarterstaff is hollow, drilled through with numerous tiny\
  \ holes, and whistles when swung and spun. Once per day as a standard action, the\
  \ wielder may spin the hurricane quarterstaff and create a gust of wind (DC 13 Fortitude\
  \ negates). A monk or ninja wielding a hurricane quarterstaff can also spend 1 ki\
  \ point to activate the staff's gust of wind power; the save DC when activating\
  \ this power with ki is equal to 12 + the wielder's Wisdom modifier."
