description: "This small copper lantern always glows with a faint green light equivalent\
  \ to a candle flame. If its reservoir is filled with oil as a full-round action,\
  \ it burns with the normal intensity of a lamp for 6 hours. A creature filling the\
  \ lantern can attune the foxfire lantern to a specific creature type (such as aberrations\
  \ or monstrous humanoids) with a successful DC 15 Knowledge check (appropriate to\
  \ the creature type). Once the lantern is attuned, its green flame will change to\
  \ red whenever creatures of that type approach within 50 feet. The creature filling\
  \ the lantern can choose a more specific type of creature (such as green hags),\
  \ but doing so increases the DC of the Knowledge check to 15 + the creature's CR."
