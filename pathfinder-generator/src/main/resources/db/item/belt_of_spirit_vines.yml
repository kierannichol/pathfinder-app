description: "This belt is constructed from woven vines. Its wearer can touch a willing\
  \ creature and cause a ghostly vine to grow from the belt, connecting the wearer\
  \ to the target creature. While connected to another creature, when the wearer casts\
  \ a druid, ranger, shaman, or witch spell with a range of touch on herself, both\
  \ the wearer and the connected creature gain the benefits of the spell for half\
  \ the spell's duration (rounded down); this has no effect on instantaneous or permanent\
  \ spells. The spell's effects on the connected creature end if the vine's range\
  \ is exceeded.\nThe vine can grow up to a length of 30 feet, and it vanishes if\
  \ the wearer or connected creature moves beyond its maximum range. The vine can\
  \ remain connected indefinitely, but the connection is broken if the wearer dismisses\
  \ it or connects the vine to another creature."
