description: "This small jeweled pendant looks like a tiny dagger set with handsome\
  \ blue gems, but it is too small to be used as a weapon in combat. While wearing\
  \ the pendant, the wearer does not provoke attacks of opportunity when delivering\
  \ a coup de grace. In addition, the pendant grants its wearer a +2 resistance bonus\
  \ on Will saves."
