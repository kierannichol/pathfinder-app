description: "The entirety of this thick hide belt is scarred with impressions of\
  \ fiendish visages, each shifting between a scowl and a smile. Commonly used by\
  \ the servants of Asmodeus in Cheliax, this belt grants its wearer a +2 enhancement\
  \ bonus to Constitution. Treat this Constitution bonus as a temporary ability bonus\
  \ for the first 24 hours the belt is worn.\nWhenever an enemy scores a critical\
  \ hit against the wearer, the wearer gains fast healing 1 for 1 minute. This ability\
  \ doesn't trigger if the critical hit deals only nonlethal damage. Damage caused\
  \ by silver weapons, good-aligned weapons, or spells or effects with the good descriptor\
  \ doesn't trigger the fast healing, and suppresses the fast healing for 1 round\
  \ if it's already active.\nThe wearer of an infernal cord can be detected as though\
  \ she were an evil creature, and can sense the item's evil while wearing it. This\
  \ belt imparts 1 negative level to any nonevil creature that wears it until the\
  \ belt is removed.\nGreater Infernal Cord: This item functions as an infernal cord,\
  \ but it grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution, and the fast healing effect\
  \ increases to fast healing 4. Treat the Constitution bonus as a temporary ability\
  \ bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn.\nThe wearer can be detected as\
  \ though she were an evil cleric, not just an evil creature."
