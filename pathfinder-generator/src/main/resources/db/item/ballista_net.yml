description: "This ballista bolt is specially equipped with a net which unfurls as\
  \ the bolt flies toward its target. Unlike a standard ballista bolt, a ballista\
  \ net requires only a touch attack to hit. If a ballista net hits, it deals no damage,\
  \ but causes the target to become entangled. An entangled creature takes a –2 penalty\
  \ on attack rolls and a –4 penalty to Dexterity, can move at only half speed, and\
  \ cannot charge or run."
