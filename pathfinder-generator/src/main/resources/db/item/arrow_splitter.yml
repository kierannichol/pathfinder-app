description: "This +5 second chance longbow is made of supple willow that forever\
  \ looks freshly carved. When the wielder hits a foe multiple times with the bow,\
  \ the arrows land in the same spot, driving their way deeper. A creature struck\
  \ by an arrow fired from an arrow splitter takes an additional 1d6 points of precision\
  \ damage for each arrow fired from an arrow splitter that has struck the creature\
  \ within the same round. For example, if a creature is struck by three arrows fired\
  \ from an arrow splitter in the same round, the first arrow deals damage as normal,\
  \ the second arrow deals an additional 1d6 points of precision damage, and the third\
  \ arrow deals an additional 2d6 points of precision damage."
