description: "The antennae on this mask of the mantis (Pathfinder Campaign Setting:\
  \ The Inner Sea World Guide 298) have been truncated. Bloody Mantis has three charges\
  \ per day, which replenish automatically every 24 hours. Each charge grants the\
  \ wearer two of the following abilities for 30 minutes: darkvision to a range of\
  \ 60 feet, the effects of see invisibility, the effects of deathwatch, or a +5 competence\
  \ bonus on Perception checks. Additionally, three times per day the wearer can also\
  \ use disguise self, although he always retains the mask's nublike antennae and\
  \ must cover them with her hair or a hood to conceal them. Finally, if the wearer\
  \ strikes a target with a melee attack during a surprise round, the target can't\
  \ speak or cast spells with verbal components for 1 round.\nBloody Mantis contains\
  \ the spirit of a haughty assassin lord, and has the special purpose of slaying\
  \ insurrectionists, traitors, and other challengers to rightful monarchs. Bloody\
  \ Mantis can use geas/quest once per day, but it rarely does so at the behest of\
  \ its wearer. Instead, the mask targets its wearer with the effect whenever it dominates\
  \ the wearer in a personality conflict, tasking the wearer to assassinate a target\
  \ appropriate for its special purpose. So long as the wearer pursues this goal,\
  \ Bloody Mantis uses its abilities to aid the wearer. The mask can spend its charges\
  \ to improve its own senses rather than the wearer's, and is likely to waste charges\
  \ in this way if its wearer resists its will."
