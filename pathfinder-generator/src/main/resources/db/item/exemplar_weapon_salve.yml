description: "This alchemical salve strengthens the material of a weapon, improves\
  \ its balance, gives it greater flexibility without sacrificing resilience, and\
  \ enhances its ability to hold an edge or point and survive an impact. An application\
  \ turns a typical nonmagical melee weapon into a masterwork weapon. A double weapon\
  \ requires 2 doses of exemplar weapon salve, and 50 arrows, bolts, or similar ammunition\
  \ can be enhanced by a single application."
