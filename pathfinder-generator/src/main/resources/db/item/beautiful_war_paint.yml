description: "This pot of multicolored makeup was created by warpriests of Shelyn\
  \ who wanted to be beautiful as well as deadly in battle. It can be used as conventional\
  \ makeup, stage makeup, or war paint. It can be applied quickly for a lesser effect,\
  \ but its true power is revealed when it's applied with great care. If the wearer\
  \ applies the makeup as a full-round action, she gains the effects of bless and\
  \ expeditious retreat. If the wearer applies the makeup over the course of 10 minutes,\
  \ she gains the effects of good hope and haste. Applying the makeup provokes attacks\
  \ of opportunity. The finished makeup has no effect until the wearer activates it\
  \ as a swift action, at which time its magic lasts either 5 minutes or 5 rounds,\
  \ depending on the duration of the activated spells (thereafter, the makeup lasts\
  \ as long as high-quality nonmagical makeup). The magic of the makeup fades after\
  \ 24 hours if not activated.\nThe makeup uses only the head magic item slot when\
  \ applied (the pot does not use a magic item slot). The pot contains enough makeup\
  \ for three uses."
