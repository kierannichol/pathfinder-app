description: "Eight sharp points jut from the circumference of this eye-shaped +1\
  \ shuriken. Once thrown, as long as the target cannot see the user or detect her\
  \ through other senses, the weapon is completely imperceptible to the target creature\
  \ (except via true seeing). If a prying star strikes a target and would normally\
  \ deal damage, it instead embeds itself in the target and functions as a magical\
  \ sensor that can see 30 feet (normal vision only) in all directions. The sensor\
  \ is invisible and has no discernible magical aura. If the attack misses or the\
  \ damage is entirely negated by damage reduction, the target becomes aware of the\
  \ attack as normal.\nWhen the character who threw the prying star closes her eyes,\
  \ she can view what the sensor can see, provided the sensor remains on the same\
  \ plane of existence. The sensor remains active for 9 minutes, after which the prying\
  \ star vanishes without a trace."
