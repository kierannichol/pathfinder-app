description: "Upon his 100th birthday, a lizard king's status is officially acknowledged,\
  \ and he is honored with the presentation of a special weapon, the war trident,\
  \ reserved exclusively for the use of his kind. These large, two-handed tridents\
  \ are much heavier than normal (12 pounds) in order to take advantage of their wielders'\
  \ great strength, and as a result they lose their range increment but deal 1d10\
  \ points of damage and have a Ã—3 critical hit multiplier. In addition, extensive\
  \ ritualistic practice with this weapon gives the lizard king the Improved Critical\
  \ (war trident) feat as a bonus feat. A war trident is worth 20 gp, although most\
  \ are masterwork and many are inlaid with precious metals and fetch higher prices."
