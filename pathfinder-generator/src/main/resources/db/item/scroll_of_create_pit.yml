name: "Scroll of Create Pit"
description: "You create a 10-foot-by-10-foot extradimensional hole with a depth of\
  \ 10 feet per two caster levels (maximum 30 feet). You must create the pit on a\
  \ horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since it extends into another dimension,\
  \ the pit has no weight and does not otherwise displace the original underlying\
  \ material. You can create the pit in the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon\
  \ floor or the ground of a forest. Any creature standing in the area where you first\
  \ conjured the pit must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid falling into it. In\
  \ addition, the edges of the pit are sloped, and any creature ending its turn on\
  \ a square adjacent to the pit must make a Reflex saving throw with a +2 bonus to\
  \ avoid falling into it. Creatures subjected to an effect intended to push them\
  \ into the pit (such as bull rush) do not get a saving throw to avoid falling in\
  \ if they are affected by the pushing effect."
