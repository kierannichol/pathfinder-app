description: "These crystalline fragments are all that remains of an orb of dragonkind\
  \ that was destroyed by the great wyrm gold dragon Mengkare at the outset of his\
  \ grand experiment. The owner of a shard receives a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy\
  \ checks with citizens of Hermea. The individual shards are nonmagical, but many\
  \ believe that were they to be reunited into a complete sphere, the item would regain\
  \ its powers over gold dragons, including Mengkare himself."
