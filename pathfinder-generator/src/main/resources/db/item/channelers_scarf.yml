description: "This bladed scarf is made of fine, silvery blue silk. Members of the\
  \ mystery cult of Ashava—the True Spark and a deified azata—first created channeler's\
  \ scarves, but spiritually inclined members of many other faiths also prize them.\n\
  A channeler's scarf is a +1 mithral bladed scarf. When one is wielded by a spiritualist\
  \ whose phantom is currently harbored in her consciousness, some of the phantom's\
  \ emotional energy is channeled into the scarf. As long as the wielder's phantom\
  \ is harbored in her consciousness, once per day she can activate the scarf as a\
  \ standard action to affect it with a greater magic weapon spell, using the wielder's\
  \ spiritualist level as the spell's caster level. This effect's duration is equal\
  \ to 1 minute per the wielder's spiritualist level. This duration need not be used\
  \ all at once, but must be used in 1-minute increments.\nIn addition, while the\
  \ scarf is under this greater magic weapon effect, it gains a single weapon special\
  \ ability based on the emotional focus of the wielder's phantom, as though affected\
  \ by a spirit-bound blade spell. If the phantom's emotional focus does not have\
  \ an entry for spirit-bound blade, the weapon gains the heartseeker special ability.\
  \ This effect does not grant the scarf any other benefits of the spirit-bound blade\
  \ spell."
