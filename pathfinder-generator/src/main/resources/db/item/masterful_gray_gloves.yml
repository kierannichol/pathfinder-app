  \ among the worshipers of Norgorber. They grant a +10 bonus on Sleight of Hands\
  \ checks to take something from a creature unnoticed.\nAdditionally, three times\
  \ per day, when a creature notices the wearer's Sleight of Hand check to take something\
  \ from it, the wearer can cause the object to become invisible as an immediate action,\
  \ allowing the wearer to disavow the theft."
