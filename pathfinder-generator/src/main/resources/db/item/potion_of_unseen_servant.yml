name: "Potion of Unseen Servant"
description: "An unseen servant is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs\
  \ simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors,\
  \ and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity\
  \ at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do\
  \ so as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers,\
  \ lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20\
  \ pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only\
  \ 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and\
  \ other devices. It can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC\
  \ higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can't be used untrained.\
  \ This servant cannot fly, climb, or even swim (though it can walk on water). Its\
  \ base speed is 15 feet."
