description: "These goggles are made of polished rock crystal, with frames of polished\
  \ brass and a simple leather strap and buckle sized for a giant's head (but easily\
  \ adjustable for smaller wearers). The goggles allow the wearer to see through magical\
  \ and normal fogs, mists, and similar obscurement. They do not confer darkvision\
  \ or low-light vision. Further, the goggles distort and skew vision strangely, imposing\
  \ a â€“4 penalty on Perception checks."
