description: "The daemonic chapters of the Book of the Damned are bound between covers\
  \ of perpetually frozen, compressed ashes that seem to suck ambient light into their\
  \ material. The pages appear to be a palimpsest, with the words written over the\
  \ intentionally erased words of an earlier draft, though it is unknown who redacted\
  \ it and when this redaction occurred. In each case, the edited portions describe\
  \ specific events related to the earliest history of the plane of Abaddon, sometimes\
  \ with entire pages being censored. Scholars suspect this is akin to the magic the\
  \ Horsemen use to scour their own records and history in cycles when one of the\
  \ Four has been replaced.\nA good-aligned creature that touches this section of\
  \ the Book of the Damned gains 1 negative level. This level cannot be restored until\
  \ the character has remained more than 10 feet away from this section of the book\
  \ for 24 hours. A creature that is not neutral evil and attempts to read this section\
  \ of the book must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have his alignment permanently\
  \ shift one step toward neutral evil.\nThe text is written in a mixture of Abyssal\
  \ and Infernal, sometimes changing from one to the other midsentence, so readers\
  \ must be fluent in both languages to fully understand the nuances and true meaning\
  \ of the text. As a reader proceeds, he becomes aware of a dull pressure on the\
  \ back of his skull and a buzzing static. Eventually the text begins to \"speak\"\
  \ to him, conveying telepathic impressions and images to complement the text. A\
  \ telepathic creature can \"read\" the text without actually opening this volume\
  \ merely by holding it and concentrating.\nThis portion of the Book of the Damned\
  \ contains copies of every spell with the evil descriptor, as well as awaken the\
  \ devoured, Charon's dispensation, sacrifice, and soul transfer (see pages 183,\
  \ 185, and 186). The user gains a +4 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks when using\
  \ this portion as a resource (consulting it for at least an hour regarding a question),\
  \ and its descriptions of Abaddon are so accurate that any teleportation to or within\
  \ that plane always brings the caster to the desired location (no familiarity roll\
  \ needed). Spells cast by the bearer that inflict negative levels inflict 1 additional\
  \ negative level on affected targets.\nThe daemonic portion of the Book of the Damned\
  \ serves as the focal point for a permanent unhallow effect and sympathy attuned\
  \ to attract neutral evil creatures. As long as the book's owner is carrying it,\
  \ he casts all evil spells as if he were 2 caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus\
  \ on Charisma-based skills and checks when interacting with neutral evil creatures\
  \ (these bonuses are considered to be profane bonuses and do not stack with similar\
  \ bonuses granted by other partial Books of the Damned). Three times per day, the\
  \ tome can be used to cast one of the following spells: blasphemy, circle of death,\
  \ death knell, energy drain, soul bind, or soul transfer (see page 186). It is believed\
  \ that the bearer can be subject to scrying at any time, without a saving throw,\
  \ by the Four Horsemen or their elite agents."
destruction: "The daemonic Book of the Damned can be destroyed by washing away the\
  \ text on each page with the tears of a good outsider, at which point the book crumbles\
  \ to ashes. Unless the other three portions of the Book of the Damned are also destroyed\
  \ within 24 hours, the daemonic Book of the Damned reappears unharmed at some random,\
  \ obscure point in the multiverse."
