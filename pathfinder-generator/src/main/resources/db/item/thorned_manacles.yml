description: "When placed on a helpless, twoarmed creature of size Tiny to Huge, these\
  \ barbed manacles transform to match the creature's size and prevent the captive\
  \ from utilizing any extradimensional magic, as dimensional anchor (no save). Removing\
  \ the manacles—whether as an escape attempt or by the owner— requires a successful\
  \ DC 30 Strength check or a successful DC 37 Escape Artist check; regardless of\
  \ whether such an attempt succeeds, the manacles deal 2d6+7 points of piercing damage\
  \ to the victim. The manacles have hardness 12 and 20 hit points."
