description: "A blend of finely ground plaster, burning spices, and insect secretions,\
  \ houndbane dust deters tracking animals. A single pouch can be spread over a 5-foot\
  \ area as a standard action. For 24 hours thereafter, any creature with the scent\
  \ ability that enters that square takes 1d2 points of damage and loses its sense\
  \ of smell for 24 hours. Creatures that succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw\
  \ take no damage and lose their sense of smell for only 3d6 minutes. Crafting a\
  \ pouch of houndbane dust requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
