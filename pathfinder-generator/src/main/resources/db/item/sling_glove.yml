description: "This curved, scooped-shaped, 2-foot-long wicker basket attaches to your\
  \ wrist, allowing you to throw fist-sized stones at great speed merely by whipping\
  \ your arm forward. Loading a sling glove is a free action that does not provoke\
  \ an attack of opportunity so long as you have a free hand. You take â€“4 penalty\
  \ when throwing a stone at an adjacent target and cannot use the weapon to attack\
  \ creatures in your space."
