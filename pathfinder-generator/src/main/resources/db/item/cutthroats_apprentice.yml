description: "This simply made +1 dancing shortsword leaps to hand at the slightest\
  \ touch. It can be drawn as a free action as though using the Quick Draw feat. The\
  \ cutthroat's apprentice dances for 8 rounds instead of 4 when activated, but can\
  \ only dance twice per day. When dancing and attacking a creature, it moves into\
  \ the target's space and provides the person who activated it (but no other creatures)\
  \ with flanking during his turn if he attacks the same target in melee. Once the\
  \ sword's activator completes his turn, the sword moves back to her space. If directed\
  \ to attack multiple creatures in the same turn, the cutthroat's apprentice provides\
  \ a flank against only the last creature attacked."
