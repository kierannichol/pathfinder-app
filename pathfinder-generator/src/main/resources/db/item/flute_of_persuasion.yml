description: "This slender flute inscribed with diabolical symbols grants additional\
  \ control over charmed creatures. When played by a person who succeeds at a DC 13\
  \ Perform (wind instruments) check, the flute allows the player to issue a telepathic\
  \ command to a single creature within 30 feet he has previously charmed, per the\
  \ suggestion spell. If the player issues a suggestion that would put the charmed\
  \ creature in harm's way, the creature receives a DC 13 Will save to resist. A successful\
  \ save prevents the victim from following the order that round, but the creature\
  \ remains charmed in any case."
