name: "Scroll of Sonic Form"
description: "Upon casting this spell, you keep your relative shape, but you and your\
  \ equipment are transformed into semisolid sound. While in this sonic form, you\
  \ take no penalties for squeezing, and you can move through spaces without penalty\
  \ as if you were a creature three size categories smaller. You can make a melee\
  \ touch attack once per round that deals 1d6 points of sonic damage + 1 point per\
  \ caster level. You are considered incorporeal (although you cannot move through\
  \ solid objects). Any nonmagical attacks you make deal half damage. Magical attacks\
  \ are unaffected, and you can use your magic items and other equipment as normal."
