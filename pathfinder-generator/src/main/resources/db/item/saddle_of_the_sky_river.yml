description: "This nacreous saddle is carved from giant mollusk shells, lashed with\
  \ braided kelp, and designed to be worn by aquatic mounts. On command, an arcing\
  \ torrent of water rises up from an existing body of water, allowing the mount to\
  \ use its swim speed to move through the air. This functions as air walk and can\
  \ be used a total of 7 minutes per day, usable in 1-minute increments. The arc of\
  \ water trails behind the mount and rider and can be used by other swimming creatures\
  \ to move through the air (Swim DC 15). When the effect ends, the suspended water\
  \ disappears with a negligible amount of water falling on creatures underneath the\
  \ path of the arc.\nThe sky-river created by the saddle does not harm creatures,\
  \ though it does extinguish nonmagical fires in areas it overlaps with them. As\
  \ a standard action, the rider can expend 2 minutes of the sky-river's duration\
  \ to produce a hydraulic torrent with a CMB of +9."
