description: "A smoke bomb appears as a polished ceramic sphere that can be held comfortably\
  \ in one hand. Many crafters of these alchemical weapons take pride in painting\
  \ or etching these bombs with complex scenes, or even making them look like small\
  \ humanoid skulls, despite the fact that the bombs shatter when thrown. When thrown\
  \ as a splash weapon, a smoke bomb bursts and fills the 5-foot square it detonates\
  \ in with a cloud of thick, foul-smelling gray smoke (treat this area as if affected\
  \ by a fog cloud spell, except that the cloud lasts only 1 round before dissipating).\
  \ A creature that is struck by a smoke bomb or that passes through the cloud a bomb\
  \ creates must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round and\
  \ sickened for 3 rounds after that. Creatures within 5 feet of where the flask hits\
  \ are sickened for 1 round if they fail this saving throw. This is a poison effect.\
  \ Crafting a smoke bomb requires a successful DC 22 Craft (alchemy) check."
