description: "Manacles can bind a Medium creature. A manacled creature can use the\
  \ Escape Artist skill to slip free (DC 30, or DC 35 for masterwork manacles). Breaking\
  \ the manacles requires a Strength check (DC 26, or DC 28 for masterwork manacles).\
  \ Manacles have hardness 10 and 10 hit points.\nMost manacles have locks; add the\
  \ cost of the lock you want to the price of the manacles.\nFor the same price, you\
  \ can buy manacles for a Small creature. For a Large creature, manacles cost 10\
  \ times the indicated amount, and for a Huge creature, 100 times the indicated amount.\
  \ Gargantuan, Colossal, Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine creatures can be held only by\
  \ specially made manacles, which cost at least 100 times the indicated amount.\n\
  Mithral Manacles: These bindings are more difficult to break than standard manacles\
  \ and are particularly useful against lycanthropes. They have hardness 15, 30 hit\
  \ points, and a break DC of 30. They are otherwise treated as masterwork manacles."
