description: "This +1 heavy steel shield is often stylized by its dwarven crafters\
  \ to look like a door or archway. Once per day after uttering a command word, the\
  \ wielder can press this shield against a portal to secure it as per the hold portal\
  \ spell. The shield remains adhered to the portal for 3 minutes, after which the\
  \ shield comes free. The wielder can remove the shield from her arm as a move action,\
  \ leaving the shield attached to the portal for the remainder of the duration. Before\
  \ the end of the duration, the wielder can pull the shield from the portal, automatically\
  \ ending the effect."
