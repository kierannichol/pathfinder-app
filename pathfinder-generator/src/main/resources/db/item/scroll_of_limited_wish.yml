name: "Scroll of Limited Wish"
description: "A limited wish lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example,\
  \ a limited wish can do any of the following things. Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard\
  \ spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your\
  \ opposition schools. Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower,\
  \ provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools. Duplicate\
  \ any sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of\
  \ your opposition schools. Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 4th level\
  \ or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools. Undo the harmful\
  \ effects of many spells, such as or insanity. Produce any other effect whose power\
  \ level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically\
  \ hitting on its next attack or taking a â€“7 penalty on its next saving throw.A duplicated\
  \ spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DC is\
  \ for a 7th-level spell. When a limited wish spell duplicates a spell with a material\
  \ component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition\
  \ to the 1,500 gp diamond component for this spell)."
