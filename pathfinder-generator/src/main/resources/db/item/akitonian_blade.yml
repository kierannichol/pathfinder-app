description: "This delicate-looking +1 bill imparts to its wielder the grace and agility\
  \ of one born in the low gravity of the red planet Akiton. When holding the blade,\
  \ the wielder triples the result of any Acrobatics checks to determine how far she\
  \ can jump. In addition, a successful DC 15 Acrobatics check allows the wielder\
  \ to negate any damage from the first 30 feet of falling damage and converts any\
  \ damage from the second 30 feet to nonlethal damage."
