description: "This silver ear trumpet resembles the popular mundane item used for\
  \ listening to Chelish opera and has elaborate spirals carved along its 1-foot length.\
  \ While held to the ear, the trumpet makes it easier to hear sounds in a 200-foot\
  \ cone emanating from the trumpet; the user ignores the DC increase for distance\
  \ applied to sound-based Perception checks. However, this does not negate the DC\
  \ modifiers for listening through closed doors, walls, or the like."
