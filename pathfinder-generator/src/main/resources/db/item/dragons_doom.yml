description: "This polearm's axe blade is shaped like a snarling dragon, its maw stretched\
  \ wide as it closes for the killing blow. The haft is engraved with the circling\
  \ image of a dragon in flight. The head of this +2 dragon bane halberd glows when\
  \ a creature of the dragon type is within 100 feet of the weapon. Three times per\
  \ day, when the halberd hits a dragon, the wielder can have that attack ignore the\
  \ dragon's DR as a free action."
