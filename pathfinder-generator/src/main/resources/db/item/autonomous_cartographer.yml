description: "Upon command, this item draws your surroundings, out to the limits of\
  \ your normal vision, rendering them as if depicted by a competent but unexceptional\
  \ artist. It does not record any details you cannot see. The autonomous cartographer\
  \ creates the map as needed to fit upon a 1-foot-by-4-foot parchment or scroll contained\
  \ within the item. A second command erases the scroll, allowing you to use it again.\
  \ You may insert or remove a scroll as a full-round action."
