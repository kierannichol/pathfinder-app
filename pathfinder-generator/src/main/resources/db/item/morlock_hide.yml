description: "This +1 shadow leather armor causes the wearer's skin to warp and distort\
  \ into a welter of horrid scarification. The armor itself disappears from view under\
  \ this coat of scars and the wearer's face appears as a loathsome, eyeless veil\
  \ of flesh. This change is illusory, similar to glamered armor; however, morlock\
  \ hide does cause the wearer's arms and legs to extend and her posture to become\
  \ hunched. She gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, and Escape Artist\
  \ checks, and she can move through narrow spaces while squeezing at normal speed\
  \ and with no penalty to AC or on attack rolls."
