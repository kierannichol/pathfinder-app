description: "The following weapon is generally available only to members of the indicated\
  \ race or ethnicity.\nThis +2 adamantine heavy pick more closely resembles a common\
  \ digging implement than a weapon of war. It bears enchantments intended to aid\
  \ the wielder in chipping tunnels from the stone and moving earth, increasing its\
  \ effectiveness against creatures tied to the earth. It effectively has the bane\
  \ property against all creatures with the earth subtype (even non-outsiders such\
  \ as gargoyles)."
