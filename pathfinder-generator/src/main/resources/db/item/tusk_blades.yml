description: "These metal caps must be specially fitted to a creature's horns or tusks;\
  \ a blade reminiscent of a sword or axe head projects from each cap. If the creature\
  \ makes a gore attack (including as part of a powerful charge), the attack deals\
  \ both piercing and slashing damage, and has a critical threat range of 19â€“20 (this\
  \ range can be increased by other effects). Tusk blades can be enhanced as melee\
  \ weapons; the enhancement is applied to the creature's gore attack."
