description: "This silk cape is constructed of many carefully arranged overlapping\
  \ layers that are loosely stitched together. When exposed to a sudden influx of\
  \ air, like that caused by falling, the cloak unfolds like a crude parachute. When\
  \ falling, a creature wearing a billow cape is treated as if he had deliberately\
  \ jumped from the height. When worn in areas of strong wind or greater, a billow\
  \ cape hampers movement. In such wind conditions, the wearer treats all terrain\
  \ as difficult terrain and takes a â€“4 penalty on Fly checks. Because of the strange\
  \ and somewhat fragile construction of this cape, only Small or smaller billow capes\
  \ function properly. Larger billow capes take all the penalties resulting from high\
  \ winds, but grant none of the benefits when the wearer falls."
