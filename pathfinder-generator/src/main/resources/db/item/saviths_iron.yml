description: "This large iron shield acts as a +1 animated light fortification heavy\
  \ steel shield. The shield's bearer is immune to poison, although poisons in effect\
  \ before the shield is wielded still run their course. While Savith's Iron is wielded,\
  \ poisoned attacks instead bolster the bearer: if the bearer is subjected by a foe\
  \ to a poison that deals ability score damage, the bearer gains a +4 enhancement\
  \ bonus to the ability score the poison would normally damage. This bonus lasts\
  \ for 1 minute; each additional dose of the same poison extends the effect for 1\
  \ additional minute. The bearer can benefit from only one bonus at a time, but can\
  \ choose to benefit from a new poison in place of an old one. For example, when\
  \ the bearer of Savith's Iron is stung by a wyvern, she gains a +4 enhancement bonus\
  \ to her Constitution score for 1 minute; if she then comes in contact with terinav\
  \ root, she must to decide whether to maintain her Constitution bonus or swap it\
  \ out for a +4 enhancement bonus to her Dexterity. Savith's Iron does not grant\
  \ the wielder bonuses from poisons she takes willingly or those applied by an ally,\
  \ and poisons that don't inflict ability score damage have no effect."
