description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis silver locket contains two scraps of parchment\
  \ with inspirational quotes from holy or philosophical texts written on them in\
  \ fine lettering. Once per day, with a command word, the words transform momentarily\
  \ into the names of the last creature to lie to the wearer and the last creature\
  \ to perform a favor on her behalf. It can see only 1 day into the past. Each person\
  \ whose name would be revealed attempts a DC 17 Will save, with success indicating\
  \ that the locket skips that person and moves to the next-mostrecent creature.\n\
  If the wearer is a half-elf, she gains a +2 insight bonus to AC and on saving throws\
  \ and Sense Motive checks against allies, people pretending to be her allies, and\
  \ former allies who changed allegiance no more than 1 week ago."
