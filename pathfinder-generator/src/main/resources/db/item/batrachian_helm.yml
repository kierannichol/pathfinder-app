description: "This oily bronze helm is fashioned in the shape of a frog's head. Three\
  \ times per day as a swift action, the helm fires an unerring tongue of force at\
  \ a visible target within 20 feet.\nIf the target is an unattended object weighing\
  \ 250 pounds or less, it is pulled 20 feet toward the wearer. If the target is a\
  \ creature of the wearer's size or smaller, the wearer may make a combat maneuver\
  \ check as a free action to pull the target 20 feet toward him.\nIf the target is\
  \ a creature larger than the wearer, an unattended object weighing more than 250\
  \ pounds, or an immobile structure such as a wall, the wearer is pulled 20 feet\
  \ toward the target. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and\
  \ the object or creature stops if the movement would move it into a solid object\
  \ or creature."
