description: "A waster is a heavily weighted wooden practice weapon, used as a way\
  \ to build endurance and expertise with a specific weapon. All wasters are designed\
  \ to emulate a specific melee weapon (such as a kukri waster or a greatsword waster),\
  \ and weigh twice as much as the weapons they emulate.\nUsing a waster to hone your\
  \ combat techniques requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 15 combat maneuver check.\
  \ If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your CMD against\
  \ combat maneuvers targeting weapons you wield that match the waster your practiced\
  \ with. This bonus lasts for 24 hours."
