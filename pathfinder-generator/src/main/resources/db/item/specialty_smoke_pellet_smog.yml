description: "Like standard smoke pellets (Ultimate Equipment 105), these specialty\
  \ pellets fill a single 5-foot square with opaque smoke for 1 round when broken.\
  \ They can also be thrown as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10\
  \ feet. However, unlike standard smoke pellets, these pellets produce smoke that\
  \ confers additional effects.\nPepper Pellet: The smoke from a pepper pellet is\
  \ an ocular and respiratory irritant, and creatures that are hit by a pepper pellet\
  \ or pass through the smoke must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be sickened\
  \ for 1 round.\nSmog Pellet: The smoke from a smog pellet is oily, and creatures\
  \ that are hit by a smog pellet or pass through the smoke are covered in thick residue.\
  \ This residue makes invisible creatures visible for 1d4 rounds."
