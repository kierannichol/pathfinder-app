description: "Jagged teeth stud the length of this falchion's blackened steel blade.\
  \ Warped and twisted by the daemonic spirit trapped within, this former +2 merciful\
  \ falchion now tears the life's essence from its victims. The Ravenous Blade acts\
  \ as a +2 wounding falchion, and grants its wielder a +2 profane bonus to Charisma\
  \ so long as it remains in her possession. Bleed damage dealt by the Ravenous Blade\
  \ takes the form of nonlethal starvation damage, as the blade slowly consumes the\
  \ fat and meat of creatures it has tasted. Anyone who takes nonlethal damage from\
  \ the sword's wounding property becomes fatigued, just as if he had begun starving\
  \ normally.\nWhenever the wielder kills or subdues a creature in combat (whether\
  \ she does so with the Ravenous Blade itself or not), she must succeed at a DC 18\
  \ Will save or she is overcome by hunger pangs, and is compelled to consume the\
  \ flesh of her victim. Sating this compulsion is a full-round action that provokes\
  \ attacks of opportunity."
destruction: "The Ravenous Blade must be driven into the heart of a good cleric, who\
  \ must then gorge herself for 3 days and 3 nights uninterrupted until the sword\
  \ has eaten its fill, at which point it rusts and crumbles."
