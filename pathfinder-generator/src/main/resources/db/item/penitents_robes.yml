description: "This humble, threadbare robe grants a +1 resistance bonus on all saving\
  \ throws. A mythic wearer can unlock additional powers by upholding vows. The wearer\
  \ selects up to five vows, but no more than she has mythic tiers. For each vow taken,\
  \ the wearer must expend one use of mythic power. This use can't be regained as\
  \ long as the vow is kept and the wearer retains the robe. After 24 hours adhering\
  \ to one or more vows, the wearer gains additional benefits from the robe."
