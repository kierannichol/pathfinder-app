description: "A touch from your hand, which is engulfed in darkness, disrupts a creature's\
  \ vision by coating its eyes in supernatural darkness. Each touch causes the target\
  \ to become blinded for 1 round unless it makes a successful Fortitude saving throw.\
  \ You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per caster level. Any touch\
  \ attack not used after 1 round per caster level is lost."
