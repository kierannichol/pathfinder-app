description: "This bubbling purple gel eats through adhesives. Each vial can cover\
  \ a single 5-foot square. It destroys most normal adhesives (such as tar, tree sap,\
  \ or glue) in a single round but takes 1d4+1 rounds to deal with more powerful adhesives\
  \ (alchemical glue, tanglefoot bags, spider webbing, and so on). It has no affect\
  \ on fully magical adhesives, such as sovereign glue."
