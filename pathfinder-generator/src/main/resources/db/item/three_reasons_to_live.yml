description: "The horns of three disparate creatures (chimera, dire ram, and satyr)\
  \ make up this magical instrument, interlocking into one shofar about 2 feet long.\
  \ Once per day the horn can be blown to affect all allies within 30 feet that can\
  \ hear it. Affected creatures gain sonic resistance 10 and a +2 bonus on saves against\
  \ spells and effects that deal sonic damage, are language-dependent, or must be\
  \ heard to be effective. This protection lasts for 10 minutes. If a bard uses the\
  \ horn to start a bardic performance, all effects of that performance are calculated\
  \ as if the bard were 6 levels higher. This doesn't grant the bard access to new\
  \ bardic performances; it only enhances those to which the bard already has access."
