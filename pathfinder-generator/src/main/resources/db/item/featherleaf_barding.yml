description: "This enchanted sleeve is made of tiny, feather-shaped leaves and is\
  \ designed to fit birds. Once fitted over the body of a Tiny or smaller avian creature,\
  \ featherleaf barding automatically shrinks to snugly fit the creature's torso and\
  \ neck, serving as +1 leather armor (granting a total bonus to AC of +2). The maximum\
  \ fly speed of a creature wearing featherleaf barding is 60 feet with average maneuverability.\
  \ In forests, jungles, and thickly wooded areas, the wearer can fly through branches,\
  \ brush, and even whole tree trunks as if they weren't there, though its fly speed\
  \ and maneuverability remain the same."
