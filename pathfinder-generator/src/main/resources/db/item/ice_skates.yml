description: "Each of these calf-high boots bears a vertical blade on the bottom,\
  \ allowing you to travel swiftly on ice. Wearing ice skates allows you to move on\
  \ ice at normal speed with a successful DC 5 Acrobatics check (including running\
  \ and charging), but your movement is reduced to half speed on all other terrain.\
  \ Donning or removing an ice skate is a full-round action. Skating with only one\
  \ is possible, but the DC of the Acrobatics check rises to 15."
