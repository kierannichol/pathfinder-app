description: "This +1 disruption/+1 invigorating quarterstaff is a sturdy shaft of\
  \ yew with heavy metal rings at each end. The quarterstaff is thinner in the center\
  \ than at the ends, giving it the appearance of a very elongated hourglass. The\
  \ wielder of the hourglass quarterstaff can use threefold aspect once each day,\
  \ but this spell expires if the hourglass quarterstaff leaves the wielder's hand\
  \ for more than 1 minute. The wielder instantly knows the age step of any humanoid\
  \ creature she views; for most creatures, this is young, adult, middle age, old,\
  \ or venerable. This ability penetrates mundane disguises but not illusions or magical\
  \ disguises. For example, the wielder would identify a middle-aged halfling masquerading\
  \ as a human child as middle-aged, but would identify a doppelganger in the form\
  \ of an old woman as old."
