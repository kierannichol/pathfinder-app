description: "This fine silver circlet is often set with a milky moonstone. When a\
  \ wearer places it on his head, the stone quickly goes dark like the waning moon,\
  \ and the wearer must make a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or immediately go blind.\
  \ The saving throw must be made each round that the crown is worn until the wearer\
  \ succumbs to the blindness. Removing the circlet requires breaking the curse. In\
  \ addition to a remove curse spell or similar effect, remove blindness/deafness\
  \ can be used to end the circlet's curse long enough to remove the item."
