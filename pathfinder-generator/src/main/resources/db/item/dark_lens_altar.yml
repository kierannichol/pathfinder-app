description: "Set in the center of this dark steel altar is an eye-shaped, obsidian\
  \ lens. Many-eyed horrors from dark spaces between the stars stare back through\
  \ the lens. When viewed from different angles, the altar's proportions seem to change\
  \ as though space were bent around the object.\nWhenever a creature within 60 feet\
  \ of the altar casts a summon monster or summon nature's ally spell (or uses either\
  \ spell as a spell-like ability), the creature can use the altar as a focus for\
  \ the spell. Any creatures summoned this way emerge from the dark lens, appearing\
  \ adjacent to the altar. The creatures are strangely mutated, gaining the benefit\
  \ of lesser evolution surge as though they were eidolons with no base form. They\
  \ still must meet all prerequisites for an evolution, including having particular\
  \ natural attacks, and they count as the eidolons of a summoner with a summoner\
  \ level equal to the level of the summoning spell for the purposes of satisfying\
  \ prerequisites and determining how many total attacks per round they can use. There\
  \ is a 25% chance that any creature summoned through the lens attempts to kill the\
  \ summoner rather than obeying the summoner's commands. Roll once per casting for\
  \ all creatures summoned, and if the creatures turn on their summoner, the summoner\
  \ can't dismiss the spell as normal (though it still expires when the duration ends).\n\
  When the summoned creature appears, the planar rift through which it passes creates\
  \ a vacuum near the altar for 1 round. Each creature within 5 feet per level of\
  \ the summoning spell is affected by a severe blast of air (as per gust of wind)\
  \ directed toward the altar. A summoning spell of 4th level or higher creates a\
  \ more powerful vacuum; all creatures within the area are treated as one size category\
  \ smaller for the purpose of determining how the vacuum affects them. If the summoning\
  \ spell is 7th level or higher, the creatures are treated as two size categories\
  \ smaller. If a creature summoned through the altar is ever forced into the altar's\
  \ space, including by the vacuum effect, the summoning instantly ends as the creature\
  \ is sucked back to its home dimension."
