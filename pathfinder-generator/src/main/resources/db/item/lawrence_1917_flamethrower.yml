description: "One of the most infamous devices to evolve as a result of trench warfare,\
  \ the flamethrower is still in its infancy in the early twentieth century. The British\
  \ military produced the Lawrence 1917, which found its way into the hands of Russia's\
  \ soldiers. The device consists of a cumbersome backpack of two tanks and a swivelmounted,\
  \ handheld projection unit, or \"lance.\" When the device is aimed and a small hand\
  \ lever depressed, a small gas burner ignites the oil, which is propelled forth\
  \ in a blazing stream of intense flame. A f lamethrower with full tanks is capable\
  \ of unleashing up to 6 charges of ignited oil, to devastating effect.\nWhen using\
  \ a flamethrower, the wielder projects a 60-foot-long line of fire, attempting a\
  \ separate attack roll against each creature within the line. Each attack roll takes\
  \ a –2 penalty, and its attack damage cannot be modified by precision damage or\
  \ damage-increasing feats such as Vital Strike. Effects that grant concealment,\
  \ such as fog or smoke, or the blur, invisibility, or mirror image spells, do not\
  \ foil this line attack. If any of the rolls threatens a critical hit, the wielder\
  \ confirms the critical for that roll alone.\nAll affected creatures take 4d6 points\
  \ of damage, and any creature hit by the flaming stream must also succeed at succeed\
  \ at a DC 20 Ref lex save or catch fire, taking an additional 2d6 points of damage\
  \ each round until the flames are extinguished. A burning creature can attempt a\
  \ new save as a full-round action, and dropping and rolling on the ground grants\
  \ a +2 bonus on this save.\nThe device's tanks and backpacks are awkward, and the\
  \ wielder takes a –4 armor check penalty when wearing the cumbersome device. In\
  \ addition, the tanks have hardness 10 and 5 hit points, and if the tank is ruptured\
  \ in the presence of any adjacent flame (including the device's own gas igniter),\
  \ a mighty conf lagration erupts, the wielder takes 6d6 points of fire damage, and\
  \ all creatures within a 20-foot radius take 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC\
  \ 20 for half). Any creatures who take damage must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save\
  \ or catch on fire."
