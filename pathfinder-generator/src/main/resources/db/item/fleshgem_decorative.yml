description: "An oread adventurer discovered these small green gemstones when, after\
  \ suffering a wound from falling on some jagged stones while exploring a cavern,\
  \ she noticed pieces of beautiful green crystal growing from her skin. Oread jewelers\
  \ found that these crystals, dubbed fleshgems, seemed to feed on the elemental energy\
  \ that permeates an oread's flesh, growing from tiny chips of stone into large,\
  \ elaborate gemstones. Essentially harmless, implanting fleshgems became a unique\
  \ racial method of body alteration among oreads, equivalent to tattoos and piercings\
  \ among other humanoids. Decorative fleshgems cost 1 gp and are merely ornamental.\
  \ Fleshgem spikes, on the other hand, grow into elaborate crystalline shards that\
  \ function as armor spikes, but the oread wearing them cannot wear armor over the\
  \ spikes and even normal clothing requires special holes or seams to allow the spikes\
  \ to stick out. Implanting a set of fleshgem spikes takes 10 minutes, and the resulting\
  \ shard takes about a week to grow to full size. Removing a fleshgem takes 1 minute;\
  \ the person removing the gem must make a successful DC 15 Heal check to avoid dealing\
  \ 1d4 points of damage to the oread. The fleshgem spikes can be sundered or destroyed\
  \ as if the growths were a worn object (hardness 1, 5 hp), but unless the embedded\
  \ root of the fleshgem is removed, the shards grow back 1 week later."
