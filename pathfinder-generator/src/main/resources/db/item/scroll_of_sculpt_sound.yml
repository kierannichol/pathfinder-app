description: "You can change the sounds that creatures or objects make. You can create\
  \ sounds where none exist, deaden sounds, or transform sounds into other sounds.\
  \ All affected creatures or objects must be transmuted in the same way. Once the\
  \ transmutation is made, you cannot change it. You can change the qualities of sounds\
  \ but cannot create words with which you are unfamiliar yourself."
