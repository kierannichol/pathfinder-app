description: "This Large +1 tetsubo (see page 27) is banded in corroded iron bearing\
  \ brass studs that are embossed with wicked Tien characters of punishment and pain.\
  \ Once per day, the wielder can bestow a blood geas upon a willing subject who swears\
  \ an oath to the wielder (the wielder and the subject must agree on the exact nature\
  \ of the oath). The blood geas functions as a mark of justice that activates if\
  \ the subject of the blood geas breaks his oath, dealing 12d6+9 points of damage\
  \ to the subject. If the subject survives, the blood geas is removed, though the\
  \ subject can swear a new oath and receive a new blood geas if he chooses. A character\
  \ can be under only one blood geas at a time. A blood geas is permanent unless removed\
  \ by the wielder."
