description: "This +2 cold iron bastard sword becomes a +2 unholy cold iron bastard\
  \ sword in the hands of an antipaladin sworn to the demon lord Nocticula. In the\
  \ hands of a good creature, Iron Lash bestows one permanent negative level as though\
  \ it were unholy while granting none of the associated benefits of the unholy special\
  \ ability.\nOnce per day, the wielder of this sword can cast finger of death with\
  \ a range of 60 feet, dealing 150 points of damage on a successful hit. If the target\
  \ succeeds at a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw, the attack instead deals 3d6+15 points\
  \ of damage. This is a death effect."
