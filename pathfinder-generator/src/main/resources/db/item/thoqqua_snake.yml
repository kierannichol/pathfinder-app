description: "When burned, this firework produces smoke as a smokestick. It also expands\
  \ into a tube of ash that, after 1 round, takes the form of a thoqqua (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Bestiary 2 262). The thoqqua attacks the user's opponents to the best of its\
  \ ability. If the user speaks Ignan, she can direct the thoqqua to not attack, to\
  \ attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. After 5 rounds or when\
  \ it is reduced to 0 hit points (whichever comes first), the thoqqua collapses into\
  \ a pile of nonmagical ash."
