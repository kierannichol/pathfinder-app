description: "You spit a poisonous stinger around the size of a quill at a creature\
  \ within range, as though you had fired a dart from a blowgun. You must succeed\
  \ at a ranged attack to hit your target. The stinger deals 1d2 points of piercing\
  \ damage and poisons the target, causing it to become nauseated for 1 round unless\
  \ it succeeds at a Fortitude save."
