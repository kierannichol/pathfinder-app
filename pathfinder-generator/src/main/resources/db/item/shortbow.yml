description: "A shortbow is made up of one piece of wood about 3 feet in length. You\
  \ need two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a shortbow while\
  \ mounted. If you have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when\
  \ you use a shortbow. If you have a bonus for high Strength, you can apply it to\
  \ damage rolls when you use a composite shortbow, but not a regular shortbow. A\
  \ shortbow fires arrows."
