description: "The Inheritor herself carried this crimson banner into battle during\
  \ the Shining Crusade. An army commander who carries the Sword of Valor increases\
  \ the DV and OM of her army by 4 against armies of undead or evil outsiders. Yet\
  \ the Sword of Valor's greatest power lies not in offense but in defense. Mounted\
  \ firmly upon an interior wall in a visible, public place, the Sword of Valor creates\
  \ a 10-mile-radius area that bars demons and those who worship demons from using\
  \ teleportation spells and effects and imparts on such creatures a –4 penalty to\
  \ Armor Class and on all saving throws. Once per month while the banner is mounted\
  \ on a wall, a worshiper of Iomedae within 30 feet of the banner can use it to summon\
  \ a planetar to protect the banner and its surroundings for 1 day. Any nonevil creature\
  \ that sleeps within a 1-mile radius becomes immune to fear effects from demons\
  \ and demon worshipers for 24 hours."
destruction: "The Sword of Valor can be destroyed by Iomedae herself, but only if\
  \ she chooses to do so and rips it apart with her bare hands."
