description: "The Diadem of Nod is a slender, platinum headband adorned with a large,\
  \ perfectly cut diamond that rests on its wearer's forehead. When the wearer sleeps,\
  \ she can create a pocket dream dimension and move herself there. The qualities\
  \ of the dream dimension can be chosen by the wearer, as the create demiplane spell.\
  \ Once inside the dream dimension, the wearer is considered awake and in control\
  \ of her creation. The pocket dimension lasts for up to 7 days, whereupon it ends\
  \ and the diadem must recharge for 1 week before it can be used again, regardless\
  \ of the time spent inside.\nThere is one inherent risk in using the Diadem of Nod.\
  \ The GM should roll a secret DC 20 Will save on behalf of the wearer each time\
  \ the diadem is used. Failure indicates that some rogue element not of the wearer's\
  \ creation or under her control has been added to the pocket dream dimension. This\
  \ might be an animate dream (Bestiary 2 29) or some other outsider of any alignment\
  \ that traffics the Ethereal and Astral planes. The rogue element is not necessarily\
  \ hostile or unfriendly."
destruction: "The Diadem of Nod can be destroyed if its wearer uses it to create a\
  \ dream inside of another pocket dream dimension. It can't be destroyed from within\
  \ a dream it created."
