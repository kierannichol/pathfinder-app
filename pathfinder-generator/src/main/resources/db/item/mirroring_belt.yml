description: "This broad belt is constructed of steel plates polished to a gleaming\
  \ finish. The belt grants its wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity. Treat\
  \ this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn.\nThree\
  \ times per day, the wearer can use mirror image to bring forth illusory duplicates\
  \ that persist for 6 minutes or until destroyed. These function as normal images\
  \ from that spell, except any ranged attack (including ranged touch spells) that\
  \ strikes and destroys an image rebounds onto the attacker, using the attacker's\
  \ original result to determine whether the attack hits.\nIf the wearer expends one\
  \ use of mythic power to activate the belt, the mirror images replenish when the\
  \ wearer is hit. This functions as above, except each time an attack hits the wearer\
  \ instead of an image, the belt creates a new image, up to the spell's limit of\
  \ eight images. Unlike mirror image, the effect doesn't end when the images are\
  \ gone. If there are no more images, the belt continues to create new images for\
  \ the effect's full duration."
