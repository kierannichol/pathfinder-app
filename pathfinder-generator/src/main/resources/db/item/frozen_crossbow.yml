description: "When this +2 frost repeating heavy crossbow is empty and underwater,\
  \ pulling the reloading lever as a free action creates and loads a bolt of solid\
  \ ice. The icicle bolt and its wielder ignore all penalties for using a ranged weapon\
  \ underwater. The icicle bolt deals an amount of cold damage equal to that of a\
  \ normal bolt and melts 1 round after leaving the crossbow."
