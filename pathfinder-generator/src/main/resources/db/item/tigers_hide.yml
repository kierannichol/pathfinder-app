description: "This +3 hide armor is made from tiger skin. It is magically treated\
  \ to make it easier to move in, reducing its armor check penalty to 0, reducing\
  \ its arcane spell failure chance to 10%, and increasing its maximum Dexterity bonus\
  \ to +6. It grants DR 5/â€” against natural weapon attacks. In addition, the wearer\
  \ can use the pounce special attack, but only during the first round she can act\
  \ in any combat."
