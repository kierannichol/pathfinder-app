description: "Through a 15-minute assembly period, the components of this kit fit\
  \ together into a tentlike structure. Able to fit a single Medium-sized creature,\
  \ this tent doesn't allow space for sleeping. Instead, a privacy shelter offers\
  \ standing or sitting room only. The shelter is mostly used as either a meditation\
  \ space or a latrine shelter."
