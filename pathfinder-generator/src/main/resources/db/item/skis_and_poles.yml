description: "These polished wooden slats enable the wearer to glide across level\
  \ snowy surfaces at his full speed. His speed is halved when moving up a snowy slope,\
  \ but he may run or charge downhill on gentle or steep snowy slopes at quadruple\
  \ speed. Any skill check penalties for traversing rough snowy terrain while wearing\
  \ skis are doubled, and the wearer takes a â€“4 penalty on combat maneuver checks\
  \ to bull rush, drag, or trip, and to CMD against these maneuvers. Characters cannot\
  \ climb while wearing skis. Donning or removing skis takes 1 minute."
