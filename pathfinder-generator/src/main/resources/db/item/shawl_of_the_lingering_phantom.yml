description: "This ghost-white shawl is partially transparent and flutters elegantly\
  \ with every motion its wearer makes. If the wearer has the shared consciousness\
  \ class feature (Occult Adventures 73), she gains the Skill Focus feat in both skills\
  \ determined by her phantom's emotional focus while the phantom is manifested in\
  \ ectoplasmic or incorporeal form. While her phantom is confined in her consciousness,\
  \ she instead gains a +4 competence bonus on skill checks with those skills."
