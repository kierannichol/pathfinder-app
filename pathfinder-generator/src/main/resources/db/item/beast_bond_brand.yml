description: "This sticky henna paste is used to stamp a rust-colored handprint onto\
  \ the body of a familiar or animal companion, and a hoof, claw, or paw print from\
  \ that creature onto its master. These brands demonstrate a bond of friendship and\
  \ balance, not ownership and subservience. Applying the brand requires a full-round\
  \ action each for master and companion. The brand enhances the share spells ability\
  \ of druids, wizards, and other classes with animal companions or familiars, allowing\
  \ these characters to cast spells with a range of personal or touch on the marked\
  \ companion at a range of 30 feet, provided the character has line of effect to\
  \ the creature. Each spell cast at range in this way drains one charge from the\
  \ beast-bond brand for each spell level of the spell cast. A newly applied beast-bond\
  \ brand has 10 charges. When all charges are consumed, the brand vanishes. For the\
  \ purposes of teleportation spells and effects, the master may treat a marked companion\
  \ as an object or a creature, whichever is more favorable (weight restrictions still\
  \ apply).\nA character may have only one creature marked in this way at any time.\
  \ The brand lasts until all charges are expended or the master marks another companion\
  \ in this way."
