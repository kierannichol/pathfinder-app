description: "This +1 club is often decorated with large teeth and carved with stylized\
  \ images of different animals. As a standard action, the wielder may transform the\
  \ club into the head or limb of an animal; the weapon's damage does not change but\
  \ the type of damage changes to one of the following to suit the shape of the club:\
  \ bite (piercing), claw (slashing), gore (piercing), slam (bludgeoning), sting (piercing),\
  \ or talon (slashing). When transformed, the club counts as a natural weapon and\
  \ a manufactured weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve\
  \ either manufactured or natural weapons. The club also counts as the natural weapon\
  \ of its current shape for the purpose of feats and spells that rely on specific\
  \ natural weapons, such as Weapon Focus (bite) or the bloody claws spell (Advanced\
  \ Player's Guide). If the wielder has the wild shape ability, she can expend one\
  \ use of wildshape to increase the weapon's damage by one step (Core Rulebook 145)\
  \ for the duration of that wild shape as long as the druid remains in contact with\
  \ the weapon; if the wielder can wild shape at will, the club's damage is always\
  \ increased in this fashion. If unattended, the club reverts to its normal shape."
