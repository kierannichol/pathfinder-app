description: "Despite its ragged appearance, Saint Cuthbert's Mace is a +5 axiomatic\
  \ holy disruption heavy mace that allows the bearer to cast the spell searing light\
  \ at will. Any evil creature that attempts to wield the Mace is damaged as though\
  \ it were struck by the weapon's searing light ability every round it wields the\
  \ artifact.\nOn the 20th of Pharast every year, the mace makes use of greater teleport,\
  \ interplanetary teleport (The Inner Sea World Guide), or plane shift to instantly\
  \ travel to a location anywhere in the multiverse where it is needed, typically\
  \ appearing where a worthy lawful good wielder will soon pass. The mace's bearer\
  \ has no control over this effect and is not included in the artifact's teleportation."
destruction: "One who has borne Saint Cuthbert's Mace for a total of 3 years must\
  \ use it to slay an evil demigod or greater power, causing the weapon to shatter."
