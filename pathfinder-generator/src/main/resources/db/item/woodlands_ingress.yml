description: "This small, smooth stone is made of a delicate, light blue larimar polished\
  \ to a sheen. It glows very faintly, and its edges are rimmed with delicate Sylvan\
  \ script of couplets that exalt life in a primeval forest. Once per day, the bearer\
  \ can say the command word and designate up to 10 creatures (including herself)\
  \ to be affected by a tree stride spell, allowing each creature affected to enter\
  \ a tree at some point in the next 10 hours and teleport as per the spell. Each\
  \ affected creature can teleport only once, after which it no longer gains the benefit\
  \ of tree stride until targeted by a woodlands' ingress again."
