description: "This beautifully made concert harp features intarsia butterflies on\
  \ its walnut frame and column, golden pedals, and silver strings. It produces a\
  \ warm, mellow tone.\nIf played for a full hour during a starry night, the Harp\
  \ of Night's Hope grants restful sleep and heartening, reassuring dreams to all\
  \ good-aligned creatures within 1,200 feet, granting those creatures a +1 morale\
  \ bonus on all saving throws and skill checks for the next 24 hours. This morale\
  \ bonus does not stack with itself. Additionally, when the harp grants its morale\
  \ bonus, each creature of any alignment within range that is subject to an ongoing\
  \ negative effect (such as possession, a spell of the compulsion subschool, or a\
  \ similar effect) can immediately attempt a new saving throw with a +1 bonus to\
  \ break free of the effect. If the effect does not ordinarily allow a saving throw\
  \ to resist it, the harp does not grant one.\nIf the harp is played for an hour\
  \ in the same place on a second consecutive night (24 hours later), in addition\
  \ to extending the duration of the morale bonus provided to good-aligned creatures,\
  \ the harp grants a new saving throw to creatures under ongoing negative effects\
  \ as described above, this time with a +3 bonus. If the harp is played for an hour\
  \ in the same place on a third consecutive night, the morale bonus is again extended,\
  \ and creatures suffering from ongoing negative effects receive a new saving throw\
  \ to break free, this time with a +5 bonus.\nAfter being played for 3 consecutive\
  \ nights, the harp cannot be used again to grant morale bonuses or new saving throws\
  \ for a month."
destruction: "The Harp of Night's Hope crumbles into ash if a kyton takes it to Zon-Kuthon's\
  \ stronghold of Xovaikain on the Shadow Plane and there severs each of its strings\
  \ with a blade made from the sharpened finger bones of a Desnan who committed a\
  \ heresy and did not atone before death."
