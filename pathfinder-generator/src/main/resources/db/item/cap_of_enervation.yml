description: "This floppy leather hat allows a boggard or other froglike creature\
  \ to drain the strength of those it strikes with its tongue attack. If the wearer\
  \ ends its turn with its tongue attached to or grappling another creature, the grappled\
  \ creature takes a –1 penalty to Strength, and the wearer's tongue gains 5 temporary\
  \ hit points. The penalty and temporary hit points last for 1 minute. For each round\
  \ that the target remains attached, the Strength penalty increases by 1, the tongue\
  \ gains an additional 5 temporary hit points (maximum 10), and the duration resets."
