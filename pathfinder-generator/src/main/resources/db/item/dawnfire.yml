description: "This +1 scimitar has a twisted hilt that evokes a stylized version of\
  \ Sarenrae's holy symbol. The blade is etched with a prayer to the goddess to redeem\
  \ the repentant and consume the unremorseful. Once per day, the wielder can use\
  \ spell combat (as a magus) to make a full attack with the scimitar in one hand\
  \ (with a –2 penalty on all attacks) and project a 15-foot cone of flame from the\
  \ other hand that deals 3d4 points of fire damage to creatures in the area. This\
  \ cone of fire does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and is otherwise identical\
  \ to burning hands, except the flames are yellow-white and undead creatures in the\
  \ area take 3 additional points of damage from the fire. The hand projecting the\
  \ fire must be free—not wielding a weapon or holding an object—for the wielder to\
  \ use this ability."
