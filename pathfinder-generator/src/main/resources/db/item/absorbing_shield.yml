description: "This +1 heavy steel shield is made of metal, but its color is a flat\
  \ black that seems to absorb light. Once every 2 days, on command, it can disintegrate\
  \ an object that it touches, as the spell but requiring a melee touch attack. This\
  \ effect only functions as an attackâ€”it can't be activated to target a creature\
  \ or weapon as it strikes the shield."
