description: "This sword appears to be a +2 greatsword. However, whenever it is used\
  \ in battle, its wielder goes berserk (gaining all the benefits and drawbacks of\
  \ the barbarian's rage ability). He attacks the nearest creature and continues to\
  \ fight until unconscious or dead or until no living thing remains within 30 feet.\
  \ Although many see this sword as a cursed object, others see it as a boon."
