name: "Wand of Sunstalker"
description: "A touched creature becomes invisible (as per invisibility) as long as\
  \ it is in direct sunlight (or bright light shed by a daylight spell). If an action\
  \ the target creature takes causes the invisible creature to become visible but\
  \ does not end the sunstalker spell's duration, the creature can use this spell's\
  \ magic to become invisible again as a standard action as long as it stands in an\
  \ area of sunlight (as defined above). The creature gains only concealment (20%\
  \ miss chance) in normal light."
