description: "You reinforce a weapon or armor suit to give it a temporarily upgrade\
  \ or mitigate the fragile quality. A suit of armor or weapon touched that has the\
  \ fragile quality is not considered to have the fragile quality for the spell's\
  \ duration. Normal armor suits or weapons subjected to this spell instead gain the\
  \ masterwork quality for the spell's duration and their hardness is doubled. If\
  \ this spell is cast on masterwork or magical armor or weapons, their hardness is\
  \ doubled for the duration of the spell."
