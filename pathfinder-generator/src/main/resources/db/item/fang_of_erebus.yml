description: "This +1 shortspear gleams as if newly polished and shimmers with threads\
  \ of inlaid gold dust. Strangely light for its size, the shortspear has a range\
  \ increment of 30 feet. Once per day, the wielder may entreat Mammon as the shortspear\
  \ deals damage as part of a ranged attack. Doing so causes the area within 30 feet\
  \ of the creature struck to be a!ected as per the spell deeper darkness. This darkness\
  \ lingers at the point where the target was damaged, not moving with the target.\n\
  In addition, the gold dust embedded in the shortspear sparkles if the spearhead\
  \ is touched to an object or treasure valued at 1,000 gp or more. The wielder can\
  \ determine if an object is worth 1,000 gp or more, 10,000 gp or more, or 100,000\
  \ gp or more just by observing the level of this scintillation. Once per day, the\
  \ spear can also be laid on the ground and commanded to point to the most valuable\
  \ object within 30 feet."
