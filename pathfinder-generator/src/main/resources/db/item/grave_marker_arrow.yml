description: "This +1 arrow is crafted from human bone by agents of the Whispering\
  \ Way. When it strikes a target, all mindless undead within 300 feet are compelled\
  \ to attack the creature struck. This effect ignores the immunity to mind-affecting\
  \ effects normally granted by the undead creature type. Undead under the control\
  \ of another creature can be forced to ignore this command if their master succeeds\
  \ at a DC 11 caster level check. Sentient undead are unaffected. The compulsion\
  \ lasts for 1 minute, after which the undead revert to their normal behavior."
