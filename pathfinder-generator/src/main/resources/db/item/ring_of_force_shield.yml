description: "This ring generates a shield-sized (and shield-shaped) wall of force\
  \ that stays with the ring and can be wielded by the wearer as if it were a heavy\
  \ shield (+2 AC). This special creation has no armor check penalty or arcane spell\
  \ failure chance since it is weightless and encumbrance-free. It can be activated\
  \ and deactivated at will as a free action."
