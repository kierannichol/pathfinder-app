description: "When a mythic creature uses this +6 keen vorpal greataxe forged from\
  \ a dull black alloy to decapitate his foes, the axe's head glows with dozens of\
  \ mysterious runes. The wielder of a black iron axe can claim any heads he decapitates\
  \ with the artifact, and use them as batteries for mythic power. The axe's wielder\
  \ can place a single use of mythic power into the head as a full-round action for\
  \ later use. A decapitated head rots and become useless in 1d6 days. Only the creature\
  \ that placed the use of mythic power in a head can use the power stored within\
  \ it, and she must be in physical contact with the head to do so. Each head weighs\
  \ 10 pounds."
destruction: "If a mythic hero uses a black iron axe to decapitate herself, the artifact\
  \ loses all of its magical properties and becomes a plain iron axe. The uses of\
  \ mythic power remain in the affected heads after the black iron axe is destroyed."
