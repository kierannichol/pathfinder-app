description: "Standard M1914 grenades can be fitted with an optional fragmentation\
  \ sleeve. This sleeve converts the normal concussive blasts into a cloud of deadly\
  \ shrapnel at the expense of a decreased damage radius. The device is armed and\
  \ detonated in the same manner as a regular M1914 grenade, though the explosion\
  \ radius is reduced to a 15-foot radius and the grenade instead deals 4d6 bludgeoning,\
  \ piercing, and slashing damage (Ref lex DC 15 for half)."
