description: "Created by the Arcanamirium, this plain wooden rod is capped with steel,\
  \ with 10 buttons along its length; it looks rugged and is usually scratched and\
  \ stained. Pushing any of the buttons is an action equivalent to drawing a weapon.\
  \ Unless otherwise stated, pressing a button a second time reverts the rod to its\
  \ basic form. The following functions have no limit on the number of times they\
  \ can be employed.\nBrace/jack: The end caps flatten into 2-foot-diameter discs\
  \ and the wooden haft extends up to 10 feet, creating a brace for a tunnel ceiling\
  \ or lifting a heavy object 10 feet into the air.\nBridge: The rod flattens and\
  \ extends to 1 foot wide, 1 inch thick, and 12 feet long. This form can support\
  \ 4,000 pounds.\nClimbing pole/ladder: A spike that can anchor in stone extrudes\
  \ from one end, while the other sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to\
  \ anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single round. Horizontal bars 3 inches long\
  \ fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly\
  \ held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds.\nCrowbar: This functions\
  \ like a normal crowbar.\nDrill: One metal cap extends to a drill-like point and\
  \ begins to spin, easily drilling a 3-inch-diameter hole through 3 feet of wood\
  \ or 1 foot of stone per minute.\nMallet: Though not intended as a weapon, a character\
  \ can attack with the rod in this form as if it were a Medium warhammer with a â€“\
  2 penalty.\nPortable ram: This functions like a normal portable ram, except up to\
  \ three people are needed to help the wielder.\nSaw: This works like a normal two-person\
  \ saw.\nShovel: Pressing this button makes the rod cycle between a short-handled\
  \ shovel, a long-handled shovel, and its basic form.\nWedge: One metal cap extends\
  \ to form a flat chisel shape, such as for cutting wood or breaking stone (normally\
  \ a hammer or mallet is used with it for this task)."
