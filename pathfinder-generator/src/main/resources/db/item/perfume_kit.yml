description: "A perfume kit consists of an atomizer and a diverse array of perfumes,\
  \ scented oils, wild flowers, and herbs. Applying scents from a perfume kit takes\
  \ 1 minute, and grants you a +1 circumstance bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise,\
  \ Handle Animal, Intimidate, or Perform checks, subject to GM discretion. You must\
  \ choose the type of check when you apply the fragrances. This bonus typically doesn't\
  \ apply in combat or against hostile creatures, and might not work on creatures\
  \ without olfactory senses or who would be more offended than entranced by your\
  \ scent. The bonus lasts for 4 hours. You can gain only one bonus from a perfume\
  \ kit at a time, and the bonus from perfume does not stack with bonuses from any\
  \ masterwork tools you possess for the same skill. A perfume kit is exhausted after\
  \ 10 uses."
