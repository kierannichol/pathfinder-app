description: "This spell functions like grease, except as noted here. When you use\
  \ this spell to cover a solid surface with slippery grease, the 10-foot squares\
  \ must form a continuous area, each part of which must be within the spell's range.\
  \ When you use this spell to create a greasy coating on items, no two of the targeted\
  \ items can be more than 30 feet apart. You cannot target both items and surfaces\
  \ with a single casting of this spell."
