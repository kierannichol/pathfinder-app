description: "By wrapping your hands and forearms in thin but tough hemp ropes and\
  \ then soaking the makeshift gloves in water for weight and expansion, you can transform\
  \ your fists into rock-hard weapons easily capable of killing in a fistfight. Each\
  \ rope gauntlet takes a full minute to wrap and another minute to soak, but once\
  \ applied the gauntlet can be worn for a day; removing a rope gauntlet takes 1 full\
  \ round. When wearing rope gauntlets, you are considered armed and your attacks\
  \ deal normal damage. If you are proficient with rope gauntlets, you may use the\
  \ rough edges of the ropes to deal slashing damage rather than bludgeoning damage.\
  \ Your fingers are mostly exposed, allowing you to wield or carry items in your\
  \ hands while wearing rope gauntlets, but the constriction of the weapon at your\
  \ knuckles gives you a â€“2 penalty on all precision-based tasks involving your hands\
  \ (such opening locks)."
