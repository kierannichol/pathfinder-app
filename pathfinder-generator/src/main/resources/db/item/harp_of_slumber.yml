description: "Despite having the strength and texture of unhewn stone, this pale white\
  \ harp is sculpted from solid glass. A harp of slumber has several effects when\
  \ played. At will, the user can produce a lullaby effect by plucking a single string.\
  \ Up to three times per day, the user can strum the harp to produce a sleep effect.\
  \ If the performer succeeds at a DC 13 Perform (string instrument) skill check,\
  \ this use of the harp functions as deep slumber instead. The DC for these effects\
  \ increases by 2 against creatures with the giant subtype.\nMythic: A mythic performer\
  \ can expend one use of mythic power when strumming a harp of slumber in order to\
  \ augment the effect it creates to mythic sleep, or mythic deep slumber if the performer\
  \ also succeeds at a DC 13 Perform (string instrument) check."
