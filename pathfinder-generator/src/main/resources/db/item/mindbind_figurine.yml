description: "This 2-foot-tall marble statue has the exact appearance of a mortal\
  \ creature, constantly reflecting any changes to its appearance from injury, age,\
  \ or even reincarnation. The creature represented may be identified only if you\
  \ are already familiar with the creature, and until activated, the creature exhibits\
  \ no evidence of its connection to the mindbind figurine.\nAn unsculpted mindbind\
  \ figurine appears as a featureless humanoid, but can be linked to a creature in\
  \ a complex demonic ritual overseen by a chosen acolyte of the demon lord Nocticula,\
  \ at which point the statue takes on the form of the creature and is bound inexorably\
  \ to the creature's mind while awaiting its activation.\nWhen broken, a mindbind\
  \ figurine triggers a delayed dominate monster effect in the mind of the sculpted\
  \ creature, causing it to play its designated role in Nocticula's sinister plans.\
  \ The creature gets no save against this effect, as the save is made at the time\
  \ of the figurine's creation."
destruction: "A mindbind figurine can only be destroyed by physical damage. Destroying\
  \ one in such a manner activates the linked creature."
