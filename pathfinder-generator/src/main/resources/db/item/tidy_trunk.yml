description: "This small-sized trunk is bound in polished metal and lined with velvet\
  \ fabric. While the trunk is latched, items contained within are kept free of mold,\
  \ moths, water damage, and other undesirable effects of long-term storage, though\
  \ perishable items still eventually decay. If the trunk is kept latched for at least\
  \ 8 hours, the items inside are neatly cleaned. The trunk folds and presses clothing,\
  \ polishes crystalline and metal tableware, removes stains from items, and so on.\
  \ Items are not repaired of any preexisting damage; they're simply kept clean and\
  \ organized."
