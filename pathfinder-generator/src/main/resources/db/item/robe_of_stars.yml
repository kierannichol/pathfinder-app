  \ white or silver stars. The robe has three magical powers.\nIt enables the wearer\
  \ to travel physically to the Astral Plane, at will and on command as if using the\
  \ plane shift spell. Once he has done so, the wearer can also return to his plane\
  \ of origin on command, also as per the plane shift spell.\nThis robe also grants\
  \ its wearer a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws.\nFinally, the wearer can use\
  \ up to six of the embroidered stars on the chest portion of the robe as +5 shuriken.\
  \ The robe grants its wearer proficiency with such weapons. Each shuriken disappears\
  \ after it is used. The stars are replenished once per month."
