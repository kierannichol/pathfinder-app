description: "This small bugle allows its possessor to blow forth a thick cloud of\
  \ heavy fog similar to that of an obscuring mist spell. The fog covers a 10-foot\
  \ square next to the horn blower each round that the user continues to blow the\
  \ horn; a fog cloud travels 10 feet each round in a straight line from the emanation\
  \ point unless blocked by something substantial such as a wall. The device makes\
  \ a deep, foghorn-like noise, with the note dropping abruptly to a lower register\
  \ at the end of each blast. The fog dissipates after 3 minutes. A moderate wind\
  \ (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the\
  \ fog in 1 round."
