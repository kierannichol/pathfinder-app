description: "The perfect golden lute is said to be a flawless instrument; its tone\
  \ and clarity are unrivaled. It is an instrument so fine it practically performs\
  \ itself, granting anyone who plays it a +10 competency bonus on Perform (string\
  \ instruments) checks with it. A character with ranks in Perform (string instrument)\
  \ can play the lute to activate countersong, distraction, or fascinate (as the bardic\
  \ performance abilities) as if he were a 1st-level bard, performing a number of\
  \ rounds per day equal to his Charisma modifier. If the user of the perfect golden\
  \ lute is a bard, he adds +2 to the DC of all bardic performance abilities using\
  \ the lute, and can use bardic performance with the lute for an additional 6 rounds\
  \ per day."
destruction: "The perfect golden lute shatters into splinters if a day passes in which\
  \ no music is played within 1,000 miles of it, or if its bearer is killed by a bard\
  \ spell or bardic performance."
