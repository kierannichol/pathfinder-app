description: "The gleaming, gold scepter bears elegant boughs and leaves, blooming\
  \ into a miniature, flowered treetop at one end. The scepter's rod has four slots,\
  \ onto which four large rings can be slotted. Each ring is engraved with a phrase\
  \ in Sylvan, and can be placed upon or removed from the scepter as a standard action.\n\
  Ring 1: \"Daughters of the Fangwood green.\"\nRing 2: \"Hear my ardent call.\"\n\
  Ring 3: \"Discharge now to oaths long sworn.\"\nRing 4: \"For Accressiel glory,\
  \ live or fall.\"\nDryad's Song grants anyone holding it a +5 morale bonus on all\
  \ Diplomacy and Intimidate skill checks against fey that live within Fangwood Forest.\
  \ Dryad's Song allows its wielder to cast diminish plants, entangle, plant growth,\
  \ and wood shape at will, though these spells affect plants only within Fangwood\
  \ Forest. Up to three times each day, by reciting the poem on its rings as a full-round\
  \ action, Dryad's Song allows its wielder to either summon 40 HD worth of dryads,\
  \ nymphs, and satyrs, or allows its wielder and up to 19 additional Medium or smaller\
  \ creatures to teleport anywhere within the Fangwood Forest as if they were very\
  \ familiar with the destination. Summoned fey remain for 20 hours, can be dismissed\
  \ at will, and are not obligated to obey the wielder's command; dryads summoned\
  \ by Dryad's Song lose their tree dependence weakness while they serve on the wielder's\
  \ behalf. Unlike the corrupted version of the artifact, the fully restored Dryad's\
  \ Song grants access to its magic whether its various rings are slotted into the\
  \ scepter or not. Just like the corrupted version, Dryad's Song can purge the Darkblight\
  \ from a living creature within 60 feet as a full-round action.\nA ring from the\
  \ scepter may be gifted to another person. The ring can be worn as a bracelet or\
  \ on a necklace (occupying the appropriate magic item slot), and grants a +3 resistance\
  \ bonus on its wearer's saving throws. Once per day, the ring can be used to contact\
  \ the wielder of Dryad's Song via sending.\nThe glaistig Gendowyn maintains a powerful\
  \ connection to the artifact, and can summon Dryad's Song to her hand as a standard\
  \ action."
destruction: "Dryad's Song crumbles into ash if it is wholly submerged in a mixture\
  \ of glaistig blood and a traitor's tears of regret."
