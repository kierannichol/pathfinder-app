description: "This roll of tanned horsehide contains pockets that hold ceremonial\
  \ gear such as incense, candles, and tiny bells as well as a small, carved stone\
  \ idol in the shape of a totem spirit such as a dragon or other creature known for\
  \ its wisdom. Anyone who unrolls the kit and spends 10 minutes performing a special\
  \ ritual either increases her caster level by 1 for any divination spell she begins\
  \ casting immediately after concluding the ritual, or gains a +3 insight bonus to\
  \ any one skill check she makes in the next hour. Alternatively, she may spend all\
  \ remaining uses of the kit in an hour-long ritual to cast commune, asking one question\
  \ for every two remaining uses in the kit.\nA newly created set of prophetic paraphernalia\
  \ has 10 uses. When all of the uses are expended, the stone idol crumbles into powder."
