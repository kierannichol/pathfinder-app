description: "This 12-foot-high, 10-foot-diameter cauldron is made of solid iron,\
  \ cast in one piece and thick enough to withstand great heat. Its side is marked\
  \ with the Sihedron Rune, while many other Thassilonian runes grace its rim.\nA\
  \ runeslave cauldron has the ability to infuse the body of a freshly slain giant,\
  \ reviving it and transforming it into a runeslave (see page 412). Before it can\
  \ be used, the runeslave cauldron must first be activated by filling it with a specially\
  \ prepared broth of rare necromantic ingredients and rainwater collected from several\
  \ open graves. The cost of the special ingredients is 10,000 gp, but once the cauldron\
  \ is filled, a fire lights under it automatically and keeps the broth bubbling and\
  \ functional for 1 year.\nOnce the cauldron is filled with broth, one need only\
  \ sacrifice a giant (the method of killing the giant is incidental) and then place\
  \ the giant's corpse wholly or partially within the cauldron's bubbling contents.\
  \ One hour later, the sacrificed giant rises from the cauldron as if true resurrection\
  \ had been cast on it. In addition, the newly revived giant gains the runeslave\
  \ template (see page 412). The cauldron can revive up to five giants a day in this\
  \ manner. Non-giant corpses placed in the broth are unaffected by the cauldron's\
  \ magic.\nAny living creature (save for a runeslave) completely immersed in the\
  \ boiling broth inside a functional runeslave cauldron immediately takes 6d6 points\
  \ of fire damage per round. In addition, the smoke produced by the cauldron as it\
  \ boils is particularly noxious to good-aligned beings. It spreads to a radius of\
  \ 30 feet around the cauldron, and while the smoke isn't thick enough to obscure\
  \ vision, its foul-smelling vapors sting and burn those of good alignment. Each\
  \ round such a creature remains in the smoke, he must make a DC 20 Fortitude save\
  \ or be blinded and nauseated for as long as he remains in the area plus an additional\
  \ 1d6 rounds after leaving the area."
destruction: "By brewing a certain variant mixture of broth and then attempting to\
  \ use the runeslave cauldron to transform a good-aligned giant who volunteers for\
  \ the job, the cauldron can be caused to crack open across the Sihedron carving.\
  \ This immediately destroys the cauldron and slays all living runeslaves it has\
  \ created."
