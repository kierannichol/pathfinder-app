name: "Scroll of Clashing Rocks"
description: "You create two Colossal-sized masses of rock, dirt, and stone and slam\
  \ them together against a single creature between them. The clashing rocksappear\
  \ up to 30 feet away from the target on opposite sides and rush toward it with a\
  \ mighty grinding crash. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target with\
  \ the rocks. The clashing rocksignore concealment and cover, and if there is a solid\
  \ barrier between the target and either of the clashing rocks, the spell has a +28\
  \ bonus on the Strength check to burst through the barrier and continue unimpeded\
  \ to the target. A creature struck by the clashing rockstakes 20d6 points of bludgeoning\
  \ damage and is knocked prone. If the target fails a Reflex saving throw, it is\
  \ also buried under the resulting rubble as if by a cave-in (see Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Core Rulebook415)."
