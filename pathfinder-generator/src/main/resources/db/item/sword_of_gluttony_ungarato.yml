description: "This +5 ghost touch vicious falchion has a misty, ethereal quality that\
  \ makes it appear to be spectral in nature despite being perfectly tangible to the\
  \ touch. Anytime Ungarato's wielder takes damage from the weapon's vicious special\
  \ ability he adds an amount equal to that damage to his next attack roll. Ungarato\
  \ faintly glows a sickly, unsettling green anytime there is an undead creature within\
  \ 50 feet of the wielder. Whenever the falchion strikes a foe, the target must succeed\
  \ at a DC 20 Fortitude save or take an additional 1d6 points of damage, which the\
  \ sword's wielder gains as bonus hit points that last for the next hour. If the\
  \ sword scores a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save\
  \ or be slain outright, with half of its remaining hit points passing to the sword's\
  \ wielder as bonus hit points. Any creature slain by Ungarato —either as the effect\
  \ of a critical hit or otherwise—reanimates as a juju zombie (see Bestiary 2) 1d4\
  \ rounds later under the control of the sword wielder. The sword can control up\
  \ to 32 HD worth of juju zombies in this way. If this amount is exceeded, undead\
  \ are released from control as per animate dead.\nDormancy The Alara'hai were crafted\
  \ to serve the runelords of Thassilon. In modern times, however, these runelords\
  \ lie dead or dormant. With no lords to serve, the weapons of their champions lie\
  \ dormant as well, reducing each to a +2 weapon with the noted weapon special abilities\
  \ (those detailed on page 469 of the Core Rulebook) but no other properties. The\
  \ only way to awaken one of the blades is to restore its runelord master to active\
  \ life or have some other legitimate ruler take up its master's mantle (the weapon\
  \ determines what is considered legitimate). The swords can detect such restorations\
  \ and f lare to full power immediately, demanding their wielder seek out the restored\
  \ runelord and swear eternal fealty."
destruction: "Each of the Seven Swords of Sin can be destroyed merely if commanded\
  \ to break. That command, however, must come from the rightful runelord of the nation\
  \ and school of magic associated with the blade."
