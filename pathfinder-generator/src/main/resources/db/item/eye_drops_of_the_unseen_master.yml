description: "This bright pink liquid can be added to the eyes of a willing homunculus\
  \ as a standard action. If you are the homunculus's master, you gain the ability\
  \ to see through the homunculus's eyes by closing yours and concentrating, and the\
  \ homunculus can see through yours in the same fashion. The eye drops also extend\
  \ the range of the homunculus's telepathic link to 1 mile. The effects of the eye\
  \ drops fade after 1 day."
