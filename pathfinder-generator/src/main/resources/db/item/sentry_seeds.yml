description: "Sentry seeds are small, hollow, ovoid glass beads with flat sides. A\
  \ specially crafted pouch, containing enough seeds to fill eight 5-foot squares,\
  \ allows the user to evenly scatter these seeds across any flat, hard, mostly level\
  \ surface. When stepped upon, the glass beads break with audible pops (Perception\
  \ DC 10), warning of potential intruders. Although they are easy to see in the light\
  \ (Perception DC 10), sentry seeds are difficult to spot in dim light or darkness\
  \ (Perception DC 20)."
