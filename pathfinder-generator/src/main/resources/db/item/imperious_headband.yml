description: "Adorned with stylized bronze feathers, these headbands are prized by\
  \ treacherous nobles who fear an assassin's dagger in the back. While worn, an imperious\
  \ headband grants its wearer a +4 deflection bonus to his AC against any attack\
  \ made by a hireling, a slave, a servant, or any other sentient creature in his\
  \ employ. In addition, such creatures must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or treat\
  \ their master as if he were affected by a sanctuary spell. If such creatures are\
  \ subject to magical compulsion to attack the wearer, they must roll all attack\
  \ rolls and checks to overcome spell resistance against the wearer twice and take\
  \ the lower result."
