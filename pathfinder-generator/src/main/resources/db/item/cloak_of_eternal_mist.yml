description: "Cool, damp mist constantly emanates from beneath this billowing, floor-length\
  \ cloak. The cloak's wearer gains a +4 bonus on Stealth checks in fog or mist. Furthermore,\
  \ the cloak's wearer is treated as being submerged in water for purposes of racial\
  \ water dependency. If the cloak's wearer does not move in a given round (and is\
  \ not otherwise moved, such as when the wearer is on a moving ship or wagon or subject\
  \ to a successful bull rush combat maneuver), she gains concealment at the end of\
  \ her turn. The concealment lasts until the wearer moves from her position."
