description: "This small statuette—carved from the tusk of a dire boar, chunks of\
  \ twisted metal, or some manner of dark stone—is a simplistic depiction of a pregnant\
  \ deity, fiend, or orc. Dark stains mark the face of the crude icon, typically smears\
  \ of a fallen orc's blood. A simple strand of leather affixes the amulet around\
  \ the neck.\nThe figurine allows the wearer to act normally for a single round after\
  \ being reduced to less than 0 hit points, as though he had the orc ferocity half-orc\
  \ racial ability. A wearer with orc blood is instead treated as though he had the\
  \ Diehard feat. If the wearer is of orc blood and already has the Diehard feat,\
  \ he may act normally for an additional round after being reduced to below 0 hit\
  \ points.\nWhenever the wearer of the talisman is reduced to less than 0 hit points,\
  \ the amulet weeps tears of blood. Should the wearer be slain, the talisman screams\
  \ and shatters."
