description: "Typically crafted from hollowed-out animal horn, but increasingly crafted\
  \ from metal in a wide variety of shapes, a powder horn can hold up to 10 doses\
  \ of black powder. A powder horn protects black powder stored within in it from\
  \ exposure to fire, electricity, firearm misfires, and water, and the narrow end\
  \ of the horn is useful in funneling the expensive powder carefully into the barrel\
  \ of a firearm."
