description: "Sigils of the great cataclysm are collections of items designed to bring\
  \ about doom and suffering, usually to a city or large town. A set of sigils consists\
  \ of seven seals of stone, clay, or black iron.\nThe sigils' foul magic takes effect\
  \ only when they are buried or hidden on the points of an imaginary seven-pointed\
  \ star covering up to a 3-mile radius. Once the final sigil is set in place, the\
  \ sigils create a sequence of effects, one per week, each lasting for 1 week. For\
  \ the first four sigils' effects, each living creature in the area has a certain\
  \ chance to be targeted each day. Each affected creature suffers the effects at\
  \ a different random time during the day. The final three sigils' effects each last\
  \ for a full week and target the entire area as described below.\nFirst Sigil: Each\
  \ living creature in the area has a 10% chance of being affected by feast of ashes\
  \ (Will DC 17 negates).\nSecond Sigil: Each living creature in the area has a 20%\
  \ chance of being affected by rage (Will DC 18 negates).\nThird Sigil: Each living\
  \ creature in the area has a 30% chance of being affected by contagion with a random\
  \ disease (Fortitude DC 19 negates).\nFourth Sigil: Each living creature in the\
  \ area has a 40% chance of being surrounded a deadly miasma and affected as per\
  \ cloudkill (Fortitude DC 20 negates).\nFifth Sigil: The area experiences severe\
  \ storms as if under the effects of control weather.\nSixth Sigil: Random 40-foot-radius\
  \ spaces within the area are affected as if by earthquake. The earthquake affects\
  \ a single 40-foot-radius space each round, then moves to a new location.\nSeventh\
  \ Sigil: Fiery spheres fall from the sky. One sphere affects a 40-foot-radius area\
  \ for 1d6 rounds, then vanishes; the next round another sphere affects a new location.\
  \ A sphere deals 2d6 points of damage + 1d6 points of fire damage to creatures and\
  \ objects each round (Reflex DC 23 half) and can ignite flammable materials.\nOnce\
  \ the cycle of destruction begins, each sigil's effect can be stopped only by moving\
  \ that sigil from its spot on the seven-pointed star. Moving a seal ends its effects\
  \ immediately."
destruction: "Sigils of the great cataclysm can be destroyed by placing a complete\
  \ set in a silk bag, submerging the bag at the bottom of a nixie's pool, and casting\
  \ bless water on the pool at each sunrise for 1 month."
