  \ and 4 feet long) meant to be carried and displayed on a lance, polearm, frame,\
  \ or staff. It has no effect unless it is mounted properly, and a wielder is carrying\
  \ the object bearing it. It normally depicts the insignia or heraldic symbol of\
  \ a particular noble.\nA character with the tactician class feature carrying a commander's\
  \ banner can use her tactician ability one additional time per day, she can use\
  \ it to grant the teamwork feat granted by the tactician ability to allies within\
  \ 60 feet (rather than 30 feet), and allies can use the granted feat for 2 rounds\
  \ longer than normal."
