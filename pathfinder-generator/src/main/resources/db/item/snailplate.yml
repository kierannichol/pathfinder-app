description: "This breastplate made from the shell of a flail snail functions as a\
  \ +1 reflecting breastplate (even though that shield property cannot normally be\
  \ added to armor). Once per day, the wearer can cause a spell targeted at him to\
  \ reflect back at the caster, exactly like spell turning. At the GM's discretion,\
  \ the wearer can instead expend this one use per day to roll on the flail snail's\
  \ chart, randomly warping the spell in question."
