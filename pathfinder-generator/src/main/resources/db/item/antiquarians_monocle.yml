description: "This lens, mounted in a round silver frame, fits snugly in the eye orbit\
  \ of any Medium or Small user. Three times per day on command, the monocle allows\
  \ the user to read magical inscriptions (including scrolls) as if affected by read\
  \ magic.\nOnce per day, by speaking a second command word, the user can activate\
  \ a 1stlevel spell from a scroll even if she doesn't have the spell on her class\
  \ list or meet the other requirements. Activating a scroll with the monocle is a\
  \ full-round action (or the spell's casting time, whichever is longer)."
