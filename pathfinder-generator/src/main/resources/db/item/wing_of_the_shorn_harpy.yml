description: "This talisman is made from the bloody tip of a harpy's wing, its end\
  \ capped in gold and its stringy black feathers still spackled with dried gore.\
  \ No larger than a human hand, it served as a good luck charm for Celeste Wynne,\
  \ a famed harpy hunter from Varisia. Celeste traveled throughout Golarion hunting\
  \ the cruel creatures after one attacked and killed her mother; she is best known\
  \ as the slayer of the Harpy Queens, a contingent of three powerful harpy rangers\
  \ who once laired in the Kodar Mountains.\nSome say Celeste developed an immunity\
  \ to harpies' captivating songs, allowing the sorcerer a distinct tactical advantage\
  \ when she was fighting these dangerous beasts. Others say she learned how to use\
  \ sonic magic to turn the tides against the monsters. Regardless, the wing tip still\
  \ carries the psychic energy of one who had mastered fighting such enemies.\nAn\
  \ occultist of 10th level or higher who has learned the evocation implement school\
  \ and uses the wing of the shorn harpy as an implement can replace the evocation\
  \ spells he knows with the following: 1st— ear-piercing scream, 2nd— sonic scream,\
  \ 3rd— blast barrier, 4th— shout, 5th— sonic thrust, 6th— leashed shackles. The\
  \ occultist cannot use the wing to cast spells whose level is higher than that of\
  \ the highest-level spell he knows."
