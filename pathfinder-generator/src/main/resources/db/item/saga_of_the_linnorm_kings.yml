description: "This heavy book contains a collection of epic tales of mighty Ulfen\
  \ heroes and the wondrous deeds they performedâ€”and entwined within the words is\
  \ a powerful magical effect. If anyone reads this book, which takes a total of 48\
  \ hours over a minimum of 6 days, she gains a +5 competence bonus on Diplomacy and\
  \ Intimidate checks and a +4 morale bonus on saves against fear. This is a permanent\
  \ magical effect that can be dispelled as normal. Once the book is read, the magic\
  \ disappears from the pages and it becomes a normal book."
