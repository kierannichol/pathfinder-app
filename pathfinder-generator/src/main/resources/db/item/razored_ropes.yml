description: "A razored rope is a +1 lasso made out of tightly braided lengths of\
  \ fine chain, used to help restrain cowards attempting to flee a battle. It can\
  \ be used to entangle an opponent as normal, but deals 1d4 points of damage to a\
  \ creature that attempts to slip free and fails. The razored rope is also more difficult\
  \ to escape from, requiring a DC 18 Escape Artist check to slip free from and a\
  \ DC 28 Strength check to break.\nIf Gorum is your patron, as a standard action\
  \ you can cause the lasso to constrict around a creature already entangled by the\
  \ rope, dealing 1d4 points of damage. If Gorum is not your patron and you attempt\
  \ to make the lasso constrict, it lashes up and strikes you for 1d4 points of damage."
