description: "These silver rings are always sold in uniquely crafted pairs— usually\
  \ one made in a Varisian style and one in an old Korvosan style. Originally made\
  \ to celebrate the uniting of the Korvosan dissidents and Varisian locals at the\
  \ city's outset, they are now commonly sought by young lovers, very close friends,\
  \ and other intimate pairs. When two emotionally intimate creatures each wear one\
  \ of the rings in a set, both wearers gain a +1 bonus on saving throws against fear\
  \ effects. This bonus ends if the creatures' emotional bond is severed (at the GM's\
  \ discretion), one of the creatures removes a ring and returns it to the other creature,\
  \ or a bonded creature is no longer wearing the ring (or is no longer alive or on\
  \ the same plane)."
