description: "This golden badge has a snake etched onto it that shimmers slightly\
  \ in the sunlight. Twice per day as a standard action, the wearer can tap the badge.\
  \ When she does, the badge transforms into one identical to those worn by the local\
  \ law enforcement of the city or town in which the wearer is located. This effect\
  \ lasts for 3 hours each time it is activated, though the wearer can dismiss the\
  \ effect as a free action. Additionally, while this badge's magic is active, it\
  \ provides the wearer with a +5 competence bonus on Bluff checks. Once the badge's\
  \ magic has been activated, any creature can wear it in its transformed form and\
  \ receive the bonus on Bluff checks, though only the original wearer can end the\
  \ effect before its duration has elapsed.\nIf members of the town or city's law\
  \ enforcement do not wear badges, activating this item has no physical effect, but\
  \ the wearer still receives the bonus on Bluff checks while the effect lasts. A\
  \ creature that interacts with the badge while its magic is active (such as by examining\
  \ it closely or touching it) can recognize that the badge is fake with a successful\
  \ DC 14 Will saving throw."
