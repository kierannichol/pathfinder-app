description: "This gritty, gray ointment weakens rocky materials. When applied to\
  \ an object made of stone, it reduces the object's hardness by 3 for 10 minutes.\
  \ As a standard action, a creature can apply the paste to affect one 5-foot-square\
  \ or a Medium or smaller creature. The paste only affects hardness, not damage reduction\
  \ or similar defenses."
