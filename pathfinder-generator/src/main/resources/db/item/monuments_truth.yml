description: "After standing above the remains of a creature for many years, a headstone\
  \ or grave marker often develops a psychic resonance for the spirit of the creature\
  \ as it was in life. When this aromatic salve is applied to the surface of a gravestone\
  \ or similar monument, the user can ask six questions of the monument and receive\
  \ answers as if she had successfully cast speak with dead on the creature that was\
  \ buried beneath. The user of the monument's truth need not have shared a language\
  \ with the creature interred beneath the stone for the item to function, but the\
  \ monument can speak only about what the creature knew in life. It cannot answer\
  \ any questions that pertain to events that occurred after the creature's death.\n\
  A creature with an Intelligence score of at least 3 while it was alive must have\
  \ been buried beneath the monument for at least 1 year for monument's truth to function.\
  \ If more than one such creature is buried beneath the monument, the effect fails,\
  \ the psychic impressions having become too tangled to transmit comprehensible information."
