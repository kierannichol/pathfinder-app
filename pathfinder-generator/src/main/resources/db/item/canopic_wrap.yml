description: "Tattered and yellowed, this belt is made up of dozens of interwoven\
  \ linen wraps bound together by a simple stone buckle at the front. Crafted from\
  \ mummifies' wrappings, these belts are commonly used by explorers in the vast deserts\
  \ of what was once Ancient Osirion. While worn, the belt grants a +4 resistance\
  \ bonus on saving throws against disease, including supernatural diseases such as\
  \ mummy rot.\nA canopic wrap also causes strange internal shifts in key organs,\
  \ moving them randomly within the body. Because of this odd effect, the wearer gains\
  \ the benefits of the light fortification armor special ability. This effect also\
  \ plays havoc on trained healers, however, increasing the DC of any Heal check used\
  \ on the wearer by 5."
