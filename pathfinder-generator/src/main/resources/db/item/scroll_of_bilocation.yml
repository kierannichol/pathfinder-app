name: "Scroll of Bilocation"
description: "The spell creates an identical copy of you, along with everything you\
  \ wear and carry, anywhere you choose within range; you exist in two places at once\
  \ until the spell ends. You and the duplicate use the same statistics and share\
  \ the same resources. If the duplicate takes damage, for example, you deduct the\
  \ damage from your hit point total. Similarly, if your duplicate expends a charge\
  \ or daily use from a magic item you both wield, the charge or daily use is expended\
  \ from the item you carry. If you or the duplicate drops or gives away something\
  \ you're carrying, the item disappears from the other body as well. This spell doesn't\
  \ duplicate artifacts; any you possess remain on you."
