name: "Scroll of Summoner Conduit"
description: "You exploit the invisible, mystic connection between the target creature\
  \ and its summoner to harm that summoner. Whenever the target's summoned creature\
  \ is the target of a spell that deals damage, the target's summoner is also considered\
  \ to be a target of that spell. Such a summoner gains his normal defenses against\
  \ the spell, such as a saving throw and spell resistance, and cannot be affected\
  \ if he is on another plane of existence."
