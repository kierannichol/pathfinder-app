description: "This long, gnarled staff looks like several bones fused together and\
  \ encased in desiccated, gray skin. It appears as if grown from living flesh and\
  \ bone, then mummified. At the top of the staff, a clump of sinew clasps a spherical\
  \ object. When the command word is spoken and two charges are expended, the sinew\
  \ folds back revealing the petrified eyeball of some mammoth beast. The petrified\
  \ eye functions in a similar fashion to a crystal ball, allowing the user to see\
  \ events through the eyes of his minions. Drazmorg can use his staff to project\
  \ his voice from any minion he is currently scrying through, allowing him to usher\
  \ warnings and threats over great distances, as well as command his spawn. It loses\
  \ this ability after its charges are consumed.\nIn addition, the staff allows the\
  \ use of the following spells:"
