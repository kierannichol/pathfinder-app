description: "Equal parts grisly and lovely, this unusual harp-like musical instrument\
  \ is crafted from a corpse, with a bone frame, skin stretched around the soundbox\
  \ for percussion, and strings of twisted hair. When played, it can summon forth\
  \ a soul bound to it. Initially, the soul is that of the person whose corpse was\
  \ used to make the instrument. The spirit manifests in an adjacent square as a translucent,\
  \ intangible image of the person as he was in life. The image cannot attack or be\
  \ attacked in any way. It is clearly distressed by the musician's playing; it wails\
  \ an eerie, pained accompaniment that nonetheless enhances the music's quality,\
  \ granting a +4 circumstance bonus on Performance checks made with the instrument\
  \ and (if the performer is a bard) adding 1 to the DC of a dirge of doom, frightening\
  \ tune, or deadly performance played on the instrument.\nIf an undead is within\
  \ 30 feet, the musician can command the bound soul to seize it as a standard action.\
  \ The undead must attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it's successful, the image dissipates\
  \ for 1 day; if it fails, the soul rides the undead for 1d4+1 rounds, acting as\
  \ control undead cast by the musician. If the musician has the bardic performance\
  \ ability, she can continue playing and spend a round of bardic performance as a\
  \ free action each round to prevent that round from counting toward the duration\
  \ of this effect. The soul dissipates for 1 day after the effect ends.\nCrafting\
  \ the instrument destroys the original body; that creature cannot be brought back\
  \ to life via raise dead. As long as the instrument exists, resurrection and true\
  \ resurrection can revive the creature only if they're cast on the instrument itself;\
  \ doing so destroys the instrument. The instrument cannot be affected by spells\
  \ that target corpses, such as animate dead or decompose corpse."
