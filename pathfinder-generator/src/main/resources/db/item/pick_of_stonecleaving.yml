description: "When this +1 adamantine heavy pick is used to damage unattended objects,\
  \ it deals an additional 2d6 points of damage. If the wielder expends one use of\
  \ mythic power when making such an attack, the pick bypasses the object's hardness\
  \ and deals 4d6 additional damage instead of 2d6."
