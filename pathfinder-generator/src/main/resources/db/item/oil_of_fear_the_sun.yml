description: "Each target that fails its saving throw gains light blindness, as per\
  \ the universal monster rule. When exposed to bright light, affected targets are\
  \ blinded for 1 full round and are dazzled in successive rounds. If you cast this\
  \ spell in the presence of bright light, any target that fails its save is blinded\
  \ immediately, and dazzled starting at the beginning of its first turn."
