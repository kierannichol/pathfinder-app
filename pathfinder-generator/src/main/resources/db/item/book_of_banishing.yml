description: "This immense tome contains dozens of banishing rituals, each written\
  \ in an ever-changing mix of languages. It can be read only by way of comprehend\
  \ languages or a similar translating effect. As a full-round action, a mythic creature\
  \ can flip to and read an appropriate ritual of banishment for a particular category\
  \ of extraplanar creatures, such as angels or devils. Creatures not of that category\
  \ are unaffected. The reader's caster level for this ritual is double her mythic\
  \ tier.\nOnce the ritual is read, the book counts as an object that the chosen creatures\
  \ hate and fear, granting a +2 bonus on the reader's caster level check to overcome\
  \ the chosen creatures' spell resistance. If other objects and substances that can\
  \ affect the caster level check to overcome spell resistance are available, the\
  \ book's user can apply those objects and substances when using the banishment ritual,\
  \ further increasing her bonus.\nA book of banishing can be safely read once per\
  \ day. If read additional times during that period (regardless of who reads it),\
  \ the reader must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or suffer the effects of a feeblemind\
  \ spell. This save DC increases by 5 each additional time the book is read that\
  \ day."
