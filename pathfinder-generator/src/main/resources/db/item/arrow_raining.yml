description: "This thick-shafted arrow contains a reservoir of holy water and is designed\
  \ to burst upon impact. A raining arrow damages the target as normal, and also treats\
  \ the target as though it had been struck by a direct hit from a thrown vial of\
  \ holy water; adjacent creatures take splash damage from this effect. A raining\
  \ arrow imparts a –2 penalty on attack rolls because of its weight. A raining arrow\
  \ costs 30 gp, and can be crafted with a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
