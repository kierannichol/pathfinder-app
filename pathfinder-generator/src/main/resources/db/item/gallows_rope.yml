description: "This grisly, knotted rope is tied into a noose, and at first glance\
  \ appears to be nothing more than a gruesome memento of a hanging. While the noose\
  \ is worn tightly around the neck, any time the wearer is reduced below 0 hit points\
  \ he gains DR 10/â€” and fast healing 5 until he regains consciousness. While the\
  \ wearer is unconscious, his breathing stops and he appears dead. If the wearer\
  \ would be killed due to hit point loss while wearing the noose, he can expend any\
  \ number of uses of mythic power to heal 10 hit points per use spent. This doesn't\
  \ require an action. If that healing would bring him above the threshold for death,\
  \ the wearer doesn't die."
