description: "A sucker's barrel is constructed to appear to the casual eye exactly\
  \ like a normal barrel. However, an inner barrier installed near one of the barrel's\
  \ ends hides a cavity containing a bladder filled with water. This creates a false\
  \ bottom such that, when the barrel is full, it weighs and feels the same as a barrel\
  \ filled completely with more valuable liquid, such as alcohol or oil. In this way,\
  \ a merchant can \"fill\" a barrel with a smaller quantity of a liquid (typically\
  \ 75% of the barrel's total capacity) and then sell it as if it were a full barrel's\
  \ worth."
