description: "This snakeskin belt is crafted from the hides of brightly hued serpents.\
  \ When buckled, it immediately binds tightly to the wearer's waist. Once per day,\
  \ the wearer can command the serpentform belt to transform her lower half into that\
  \ of a serpent. While in this form, the wearer gains a +4 bonus on combat maneuver\
  \ checks to grapple or pin a foe. Once a foe is grappled, the wearer can constrict\
  \ the opponent with any successful subsequent grapple checks, dealing an amount\
  \ of bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 + her Strength modifier, if Medium (1d6 if\
  \ Small). The snake form lasts until another command is given, or for a maximum\
  \ of 10 minutes, whichever is shorter."
