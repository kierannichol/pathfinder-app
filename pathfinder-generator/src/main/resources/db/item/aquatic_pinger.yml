  \ of the chime from above and ring the instrument with a successful DC 5 Perform\
  \ (percussion) check. An aquatic pinger can be heard clearly from up to a half-mile\
  \ away by underwater creatures (Perception DC 0). For each halfmile beyond, Perception\
  \ checks to hear an aquatic pinger take a -2 penalty."
