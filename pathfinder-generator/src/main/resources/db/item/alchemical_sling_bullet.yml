description: "Used by hobgoblin alchemists to equip their comrades, these spherical\
  \ glass vials can each be filled with 1 dose of an alchemical splash weapon, allowing\
  \ them to be used as ammunition for a sling. On a hit, an alchemical sling bullet\
  \ shatters, affecting the target with the alchemical solution within. This deals\
  \ only the splash weapon's damage (if any), not the damage a sling bullet would\
  \ normally deal. This attack resolves against the target's normal AC (rather than\
  \ touch AC) as with a standard sling bullet, and uses the sling's range. An alchemical\
  \ sling bullet does not deal splash damage to squares adjacent to the target. If\
  \ an attack roll with an alchemical sling bullet misses, the bullet and its alchemical\
  \ contents are destroyed, and do not risk detonating in another square.\nFilling\
  \ an alchemical sling bullet is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity,\
  \ and you must succeed at a DC 15 Craft (alchemy) or Sleight of Hand check to avoid\
  \ spilling the alchemical item on yourself. On a failed check, the splash weapon\
  \ explodes in your square as though you were targeted by the item (including any\
  \ splash effects on adjacent squares)."
