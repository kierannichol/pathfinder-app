description: "This whistle produces sound at a pitch that can only be heard by aberrations,\
  \ animals, dragons, fey, and magical beasts. The sound can be detected easily (Perception\
  \ DC 0) from a quarter-mile away. If the user makes a successful DC 15 Perform (wind\
  \ instruments) check, all creatures within 30 feet that can hear the whistle must\
  \ succeed at a DC 10 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1 round (the –1 penalty applies\
  \ to hearing-based, rather than sight-based, Perception checks)."
