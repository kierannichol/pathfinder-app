description: "These gloves are covered in fish scales and always feel cold and wet\
  \ to the touch. While wearing these gauntlets, after a 24-hour attunement period,\
  \ the wearer can throw a weapon that deals piercing damage underwater without penalty,\
  \ using the weapon's normal range increment. When the wielder attacks a target in\
  \ water from land, regardless of the weapon the wielder is using, the target doesn't\
  \ benefit from cover or total cover for being in water."
