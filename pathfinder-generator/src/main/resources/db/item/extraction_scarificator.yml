description: "An extraction scarificator is a horrid variant of the more common bloodletting\
  \ device used by healers and doctors. An extraction scarificator can be used only\
  \ on a willing or helpless target. When placed against exposed flesh, the extraction\
  \ scarificator's blades deal 1d4 points of damage plus 1d4 bleed.\nOnce per day,\
  \ an extraction scarificator can be used to extract and concentrate one of the four\
  \ bodily humors from its target as well. The humor to be extracted can be adjusted\
  \ as needed, and must be immediately poured into a potion vial or the extracted\
  \ humor is lost. Extracting a humor takes a variable number of roundsâ€”as soon as\
  \ the victim has taken a total of 6 points of damage in all from the bleed effect,\
  \ the extraction is complete. For 24 hours after extraction, this purified humor\
  \ has an additional effect, functioning as one of four potions as listed below (all\
  \ function at caster level 3rd).\nBlack Bile: potion of lesser restoration\nBlood:\
  \ potion of cure moderate wounds\nPhlegm: potion of calm emotions"
