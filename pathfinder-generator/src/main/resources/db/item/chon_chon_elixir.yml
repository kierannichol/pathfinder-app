description: "When a humanoid imbibes this foul-tasting green fluid, its ears grow\
  \ to 10 times their size, and its head separates from its body. This effect is similar\
  \ to beast shape II, shifting the drinker's consciousness into a Tiny form cosmetically\
  \ similar to that of a chon chon, with the same powers of flight, constant detect\
  \ magic sight, and +4 racial bonus on Perception checks made to listen, but lacking\
  \ the creature's acid spit or jabber abilities. The duration of this transformation\
  \ proves highly unpredictable, though. The GM should roll on the following chart\
  \ to determine how long the effect lasts.\n"
