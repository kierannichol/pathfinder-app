description: "This finely crafted +2 bastard sword has three blood-red gems embedded\
  \ in its pommel. When the wielder kills a living creature (even herself) with the\
  \ sacrificial sword, she can transfer the life force of that creature into the body\
  \ of a dead or dying ally up to 50 feet away as a swift action. The transferred\
  \ life force acts as a reach breath of life spell. Each time this ability is activated,\
  \ all color drains from one of the embedded gems. When all three gems are clear,\
  \ the sacrificial sword can no longer transfer life energy, but it can still be\
  \ used as a +2 bastard sword."
