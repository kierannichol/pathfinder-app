description: "This dark-gray tunic allows a character to make a single jump of up\
  \ to 40 feet per day, or four jumps of 10 feet each per day. All jumps must begin\
  \ and end in an area that has at least some dim light. If the wearer has at least\
  \ 4 levels in the shadowdancer prestige class, the tunic instead adds 40 feet to\
  \ the total number of feet he can shadow jump in 1 day."
