description: "Crafted from the tailbones of Kazavon, the Staff of the Slain is an\
  \ intelligent +5 spell storing shock quarterstaff that grants its wielder a +4 enhancement\
  \ bonus to Intelligence. In addition, the staff allows the wielder to change the\
  \ energy type of any spell he casts that deals energy damage to electricity (such\
  \ as causing a fireball to deal electricity damage). The staff harbors two personalities:\
  \ the neutral good wizard Kolwyddon (dominant during the day) and the dragon Kazavon\
  \ (dominant at night). Some of the staff's powers change depending on the time of\
  \ day and which personality is in control."
destruction: "Unknown to either personality, destroying the staff requires submerging\
  \ it for 24 hours in a pool of silver dragon tears."
