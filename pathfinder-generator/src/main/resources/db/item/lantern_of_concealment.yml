description: "This black lamp has a wooden frame wrapped with a cover made from white\
  \ linen, on which are drawn numerous spidery runes and constellations. While lit,\
  \ a lantern of concealment creates a hide campsite effect in a 20-foot cube centered\
  \ on the lantern that lasts for 10 hours. This effect moves with the lantern, but\
  \ only functions while the lantern is stationary. If the lantern is moved while\
  \ its concealment effect is active, it must take 10 minutes to adjust to its new\
  \ location before continuing the hide campsite effect. A lantern of concealment\
  \ can only be used in this way once per day."
