description: "Often used by the halflings of Segada looking to escape their insular\
  \ home city and satisfy their wanderlust, these maps appear as ordinary parchment.\
  \ A user of a wanderlust map can spend 1 uninterrupted hour holding the map and\
  \ thinking about exploring a region within 1,000 miles. After this time has passed,\
  \ the wanderlust map turns into a detailed map of that area, granting a +5 bonus\
  \ on exploration checks in that region. A wanderlust map shows only geographical\
  \ features of a specific area. Once a wanderlust map has turned into a detailed\
  \ map, it cannot be used to map a different region."
