description: "This specialized magnet straps onto a gauntlet and is powerful enough\
  \ to attract metal even through leather or cloth. A gauntlet magnet provides a +2\
  \ bonus to your CMD against disarm attempts while holding a magnetic metal weapon,\
  \ shield, or item (such as one made from steel or iron). It also provides a +1 bonus\
  \ on disarm attempts made with the gauntlet against magnetic objects. Attaching\
  \ one of these magnets to a gauntlet or removing it is a full-round action."
