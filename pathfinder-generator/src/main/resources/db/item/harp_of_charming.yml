description: "This beautiful and intricately carved harp can be held comfortably in\
  \ one hand, but both hands are required to utilize its magic. When played, a harp\
  \ of charming enables the performer to work one suggestion (as the spell, Will DC\
  \ 14 negates) into the music for each 10 minutes of playing if she can succeed on\
  \ a DC 14 Perform (string) check. If the check fails, the audience cannot be affected\
  \ by any further performances from the harpist for 24 hours."
