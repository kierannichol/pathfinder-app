description: "This small talisman is comprised of teeth, fingers, ears, or other grotesque\
  \ trophies taken from the freshly dead. Each talisman is imbued with an intense\
  \ animosity toward a particular type of creature, chosen from the ranger favored\
  \ enemy list when the fetish is created. Once per day, the talisman can impart this\
  \ animosity to a ranger (or other character with the favored enemy class feature),\
  \ replacing one of his favored enemies with the fetish's designated creature type.\
  \ This lasts 24 hours. To activate the fetish, the ranger must spend 10 minutes\
  \ quietly holding it; he then may select one of his favored enemies to replace with\
  \ the item's favored enemy. For example, a ranger with a +6 favored enemy bonus\
  \ against orcs may use a dragon-hating fetish, gaining a +6 favored enemy bonus\
  \ against dragons and losing the bonus against orcs for 24 hours. Alternatively,\
  \ once per day, the bearer can activate the fetish as a swift action, but its effects\
  \ only last 10 minutes and the bearer only gains half his favored enemy bonus (for\
  \ example, the ranger would lose his orc bonus and only gain a +3 favored enemy\
  \ bonus against dragons for 10 minutes)."
