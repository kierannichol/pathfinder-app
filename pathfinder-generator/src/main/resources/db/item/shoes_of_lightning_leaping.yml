description: "These short black shoes fit tightly around the wearer's feet and bear\
  \ designs of leaping arcs of lightning and wild winds. Once per day on command,\
  \ a creature wearing these boots can transform into lightning and move up to 50\
  \ feet in a straight line, re-materializing at the far end of the lightning bolt.\
  \ Creatures in the path of the lightning take 6d6 points of electricity damage and\
  \ objects take damage as per the lightning bolt spell. If the lightning strikes\
  \ an object or barrier and fails to burst through it, the creature wearing the boots\
  \ appears next to the impacted object and is staggered for 1 round. Movement while\
  \ in lightning form does not provoke attacks of opportunity."
