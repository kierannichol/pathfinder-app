description: "This cunningly designed bundle of wooden slats unfolds and interlocks\
  \ to form a 3-foot-by-3-foot frame. Once per day you may place the unfolded frame\
  \ upon a solid surface to form a passage up to 10 feet deep, as if using a passwall\
  \ spell. The passageway lasts for 1 hour unless the frame is removed earlier.\n\
  Folding or unfolding the frame is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.\
  \ Using the unfolded frame to create a passage is a standard action. Medium or smaller\
  \ creatures can easily pass through the tunnel, while Large creatures require an\
  \ Escape Artist check. The eldritch egress can only be removed from outside the\
  \ surface it was placed on, so careful planning is required when using it."
