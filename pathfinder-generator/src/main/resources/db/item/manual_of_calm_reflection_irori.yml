description: "Some of the manuals ascribed to Irori deal with physical regimens, teaching\
  \ the reader how to hone his body as a fighting weapon. Others teach mental exercises\
  \ to hone the wits and sharpen the senses. The manual of calm reflection, a thick\
  \ book of 30 chapters, aids the reader in centering his spirit and anchors him within\
  \ himself. After spending 1 hour reading the book, the reader gains a +1 bonus on\
  \ saves against mind-affecting spells for the duration of that day. If Irori is\
  \ your patron, this bonus increases to +2."
