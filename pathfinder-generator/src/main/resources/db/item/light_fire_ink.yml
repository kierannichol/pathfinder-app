description: "This alchemically infused ink ensures secret messages destroy themselves\
  \ after being read. If light strikes the ink after it has dried, chemicals cause\
  \ it to spontaneously combust within about a minute. The combustion is small—not\
  \ significant enough to ignite anything but paper. Ink used on other materials such\
  \ as stone or wood simply vanishes, leaving no trace of the writing. A vial of this\
  \ ink holds enough to write 10 brief messages of no more than 50 words each."
