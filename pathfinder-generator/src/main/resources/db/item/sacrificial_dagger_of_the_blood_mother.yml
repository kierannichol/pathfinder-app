  \ are made of sharpened mammoth bone. Its hilt is especially long, as if created\
  \ for a Large creature, and the blade is carved with a symbol of a woman holding\
  \ meat in one hand and a stone tablet in the other. The dagger is symbolic, and\
  \ cannot be used as an actual weapon. Once per day, the wielder can use detect animals\
  \ or plants.\nIf the giant goddess Fandarra is the wielder's patron, once per day\
  \ the wielder can use death knell if he offers the target's blood to the goddess."
