description: "This +1 boarding pike (Pathfinder Player Companion: Pirates of the Inner\
  \ Sea 18) is an 8-foot-long pole topped with a tapered metal spearpoint and a backward-facing\
  \ hook, used to draw vessels closer together or repel boarders. A metal skull caps\
  \ the butt of the pike. On command, a boarding pike of repelling can be extended\
  \ as a swift action, giving its wielder a reach of 20 feet for 1 round. While the\
  \ pike is extended, the wielder does not threaten adjacent creatures or creatures\
  \ up to 15 feet away. A boarding pike of repelling can also be extended in this\
  \ way to draw vessels closer together for boarding."
