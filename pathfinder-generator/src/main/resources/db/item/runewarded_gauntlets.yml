description: "A set of runewarded gauntlets helps to protect the wearer from the influence\
  \ of intelligent magic items, an effect that immediately becomes apparent to a wearer\
  \ when the gauntlets are first put on. While worn, the gauntlets suppress all magical\
  \ qualities of a single intelligent weapon carried. They have no effect on nonintelligent\
  \ magic weapons or nonweapon intelligent magic items. Runewarded gauntlets make\
  \ spellcasting more difficult when worn, imparting a 10% spell failure chance to\
  \ all spells cast while worn (not just arcane spells). This spell failure chance\
  \ does not stack with spell failure chances from other worn items."
destruction: "If a creature wears a set of runewarded gauntlets and then plunges his\
  \ hands into the runeforge pool, where the gauntlets were created ages ago, any\
  \ blow struck against the submerged gauntlets by a character currently controlled\
  \ by an intelligent weapon of a different alignment than the wearer of the gauntlets\
  \ destroys the gauntlets (and the wearer's hands). Missing hands can be restored\
  \ via regenerate or similar effects."
