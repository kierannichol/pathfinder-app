description: "A recondite holy symbol is a silver amulet depicting an old or obscure\
  \ religious symbol that has long fallen out of common use within the religion in\
  \ question. Each religion has its own unique obsolete emblems, but older religions\
  \ are likely to have a greater variety of emblems than newer religions. For example,\
  \ a recondite holy symbol of Desna might depict a single shining star (as she was\
  \ sometimes depicted in ancient Azlant) or a silhouetted woman astride an elk (as\
  \ she is depicted by ancient Kellid tradition), rather than her common butterfly\
  \ symbol. A successful DC 15 Knowledge (religion) check is required to identify\
  \ the deity or religion associated with a recondite holy symbol, allowing the wielder\
  \ to utilize the holy symbol without identifying her faith to the uninformed. When\
  \ the wielder uses an appropriate recondite holy symbol to channel energy, she gains\
  \ a +3 competence bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks related to her deity or religion\
  \ for 1 minute."
