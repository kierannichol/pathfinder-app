description: "These ceremonial clothes are worn when performing priestly functions\
  \ within a church or temple, and aren't well suited to adventuring. A cleric's vestments\
  \ typically include a cassock, stole, and surplice. The colors usually correspond\
  \ to the deity worshiped, and while some priests may choose elaborate embroidery\
  \ with ecclesiastical themes, others find merit in humble simplicity."
