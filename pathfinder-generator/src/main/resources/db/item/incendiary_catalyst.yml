description: "Incendiary catalyst can be thrown at a creature as a ranged touch attack\
  \ with a range increment of 10 feet. On a hit, the target is doused with accelerants\
  \ that give the target vulnerability to fire (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 305) for 1\
  \ round. Incendiary catalyst does not affect creatures that are already vulnerable\
  \ to fire, and the target's fire immunity and resistances apply as normal. Crafting\
  \ this item requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
