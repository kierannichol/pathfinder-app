description: "The neverspill goblet was designed for one very simple purpose: to never\
  \ have to worry about wasting Cayden Cailean's gifts. A goblet holds up to 1 cup\
  \ of liquid (or 1 dose of a magic potable, such as a potion), and no matter how\
  \ it is held or shaken, it never spills a drop, except down the throat of a willing\
  \ drinker. A neverspill goblet does not dispense its contents for someone unwilling\
  \ to drink from it. The magic of the goblet also keeps fluids from accidentally\
  \ entering the goblet. This does not prevent poisoning (since the poisoner's addition\
  \ is intentional), but means if a neverspill goblet is placed underwater and removed,\
  \ its original contents remain undiluted. It is therefore possible to drink a potion\
  \ from a neverspill goblet while underwater. Most neverspill goblets are made from\
  \ light, portable materials such as wood or pewter, or come in larger sizes. Its\
  \ magical nature does not prevent it from corrosion by acid. Liquids placed in a\
  \ neverspill goblet do not succumb to the ravages of temperature or time, a fact\
  \ that more than one adventurer has taken advantage of on journeys."
