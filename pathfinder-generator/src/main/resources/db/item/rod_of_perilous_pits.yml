description: "This rod roughly resembles a torch with a small brass cage at the end.\
  \ The wielder can cast any spell of 3rd level or lower into the rod. The rod can\
  \ contain one spell at a time; casting a new spell into it replaces the older one.\
  \ As long as a spell is contained within the rod, the brass cage glows as brightly\
  \ as a candle. The wielder of a rod of perilous pits can use the rod when casting\
  \ a pit spell (create pit, hungry pit, and similar spells with \"pit\" in their\
  \ names). Doing so changes that spell's casting time to a full-round action (or\
  \ adds 1 round, if the casting time is already at least 1 full round). After successfully\
  \ casting the pit spell, the rod's wielder can choose to manifest the contained\
  \ spell inside the summoned pit. The contained spell manifests at the bottom of\
  \ the pit, but does so after creatures have attempted their initial saves to avoid\
  \ falling in. This allows the caster to center spells with a duration of instantaneous\
  \ (such as fireball) or spells with longer durations (such as stinking cloud) within\
  \ the pit."
