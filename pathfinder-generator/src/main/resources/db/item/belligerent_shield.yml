description: "This +1 animated bashing heavy steel shield rattles in anticipation\
  \ during battle. When loosed into the air to defend its wearer, the belligerent\
  \ shield attacks as well as defends. Each round starting the round after animation,\
  \ the shield makes a single shield bash attack against a foe of its wearer's choice\
  \ within the wearer's reach. This works as a standard shield bash attack using the\
  \ wearer's normal attack bonus with the shield, except that the wearer retains the\
  \ shield bonus to AC, and while the shield's attack is treated as an off-hand attack,\
  \ the wearer does not take offhand penalties on her own attacks unless she is fighting\
  \ with two weapons herself. If the wearer has any feats or abilities that benefit\
  \ shield bashing attacks, they apply to attacks made by the belligerent shield."
