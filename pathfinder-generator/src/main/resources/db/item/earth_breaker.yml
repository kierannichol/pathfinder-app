description: "The crude metal of this massive hammer's head ends in multiple blunt\
  \ spikes that help concentrate the force of a powerful swing down into a smaller,\
  \ more focused area, allowing it to smash through armor with greater ease. Due to\
  \ the tremendous size and weight of its head, an earth breaker is poorly balanced,\
  \ and requires two hands to properly lift and control."
