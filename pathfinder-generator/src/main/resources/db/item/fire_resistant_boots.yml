description: "These heavy leather boots contain a layer of brick dust that protects\
  \ your feet from heat. You gain fire resistance 2 against fire attacks directed\
  \ at or under your feet, such as walking across hot coals. Repeat or prolonged exposure\
  \ to fire damage eventually burns the outer leather of the boots, ruining them (typically\
  \ after about 1d10+20 rounds of exposure)."
