description: "This +1 bashing heavy steel shield resembles a bull's head with a complex,\
  \ maze-like rune inscribed on the creature's forehead. In addition to the shield's\
  \ bashing ability, the shield allows the wielder to use know direction at will and\
  \ find the path once per week. As long as the shield is equipped, it also grants\
  \ the wearer immunity to the maze spell."
