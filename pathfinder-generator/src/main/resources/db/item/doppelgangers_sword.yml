description: "Once per day as a standard action, the wielder of this +1 short sword\
  \ can appear as a specific humanoid enemy the blade has injured within the previous\
  \ 7 minutes. The target must be within one size category of the wielder. The wielder\
  \ can appear as that humanoid for up to 7 minutes and can dismiss the effect as\
  \ a free action. Anyone interacting with the wielder of a doppelganger's sword who\
  \ is familiar with the impersonated humanoid can attempt a DC 14 Will saving throw\
  \ to disbelieve the illusion."
