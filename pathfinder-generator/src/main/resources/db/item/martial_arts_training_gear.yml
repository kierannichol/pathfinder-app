description: "This armor consists of several sections of curved padding held together\
  \ by an assembly of leather straps. Meant to be worn during martial arts sparring\
  \ contests, the armor absorbs blows from training weapons and unarmed strikes. The\
  \ wearer reduces nonlethal damage caused by physical attacks, including natural\
  \ attacks, by 2 points of damage. The wearer also ignores the first point of lethal\
  \ bludgeoning damage from natural attacks."
