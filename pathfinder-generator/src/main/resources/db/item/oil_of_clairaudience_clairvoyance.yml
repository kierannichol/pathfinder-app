name: "Oil of Clairaudience/Clairvoyance"
description: "Clairaudience/clairvoyance creates an invisible magical sensor at a\
  \ specific location that enables you to hear or see (your choice) almost as if you\
  \ were there. You don't need line of sight or line of effect, but the locale must\
  \ be known--a place familiar to you, or an obvious one. Once you have selected the\
  \ locale, the sensor doesn't move, but you can rotate it in all directions to view\
  \ the area as desired. Unlike other scrying spells, this spell does not allow magically\
  \ or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is\
  \ magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in\
  \ a 10-foot radius around the center of the spell's effect. Clairaudience/clairvoyance\
  \ functions only on the plane of existence you are currently occupying."
