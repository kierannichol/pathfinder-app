description: "A silhouette of a miniature Varisian dancer graces the center of this\
  \ simple music box. When opened, the music box plays a delicate tune only a few\
  \ notes long. Although worth 200 gp as a work of art, the music box's true value\
  \ is as a spell repository. A spellcaster can store a single targeted mind-affecting\
  \ spell of up to 4th level into a closed music box trap that is not currently storing\
  \ a spell. Thereafter, when the music box trap is opened and allowed to play for\
  \ 1 round, the stored spell targets the creature that opened the box. If this would\
  \ result in the spell being cast at an inappropriate target, or if the creature\
  \ moves farther than the spell's range away from the music box during the 1-round\
  \ delay, the spell is discharged with no effect.\nThe original spellcaster remains\
  \ the caster of the stored spell; for example, a charm person spell successfully\
  \ delivered onto a target from a music box trap makes the creature well disposed\
  \ to the spellcaster, even if the spellcaster is long gone.\nThere is no obvious\
  \ indicator that the music box trap delivers a stored spell onto the creature opening\
  \ the box, but while the box is open, those who succeed at a DC 25 Perception check\
  \ notice that the miniature dancer is keeping her gaze fixed upon the pending target.\
  \ Closing the music box trap is a move action. If the music box is closed before\
  \ its stored spell is delivered, the spell remains stored within the music box trap\
  \ to await the next creature to open the box."
