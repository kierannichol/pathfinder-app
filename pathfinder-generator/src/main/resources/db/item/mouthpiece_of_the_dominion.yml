description: "The snakelike mouthpiece of the Dominion has a fanged mouth for a \"\
  head\" and a trachea for a \"tail.\" Though not mobile, the mouthpiece periodically\
  \ thrashes and bites. As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity,\
  \ a mouthpiece of the Dominion can be forced into or pulled out of the throat of\
  \ a Small or Medium creature that is willing or helpless. Installing or removing\
  \ a mouthpiece deals 2 points of Constitution damage to the wearer.\nThe mouthpiece\
  \ of the Dominion merges with the wearer's own mouth and throat. The wearer gains\
  \ a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if the wearer is Small). If\
  \ the wearer already has a natural bite attack, its damage is increased by one step.\
  \ In addition, the wearer gains a +1 bonus to the DC of his audible bardic performances\
  \ and any sonic or language-dependent spells and spell-like abilities he uses.\n\
  Any neh-thalggu within telepathic range of the wearer can speak audibly through\
  \ the mouthpiece of the Dominion. If multiple creatures wish to speak at the same\
  \ time (either the wearer or one or more neh-thalggus), they must make opposed Charisma\
  \ checks to determine who controls the mouthpiece each round. When speaking through\
  \ the mouthpiece, a nehthalggu can have any audible bardic performance or any sonic\
  \ or language-dependent spell or spell-like ability it uses originate from the wearer\
  \ instead of itself. These effects have their DC increased by the mouthpiece."
