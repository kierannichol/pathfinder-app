description: "A traveling spellbook is less cumbersome than a normal one, but holds\
  \ fewer spells. It has 50 pages. Some wizards prefer to travel with a smaller spellbook,\
  \ omitting specialized spells that are rarely used on adventures. Others hide a\
  \ traveling spellbook containing their most important spells, just in case."
