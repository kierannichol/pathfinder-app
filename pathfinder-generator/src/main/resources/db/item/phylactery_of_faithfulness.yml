description: "This item is a tiny box containing religious scripture. The box is affixed\
  \ to a leather cord and tied around the forehead, worn so that the box sits upon\
  \ the wearer's brow. There is no mundane way to determine what function this religious\
  \ item performs until it is worn. The wearer of a phylactery of faithfulness is\
  \ aware of any action or item that could adversely affect her alignment and her\
  \ standing with her deity, including magical effects. She acquires this information\
  \ prior to performing such an action or becoming associated with such an item if\
  \ she takes a moment to contemplate the act."
