description: "This mummified dwarf hand hangs on a steel chain around a character's\
  \ neck, bringing the wearer more in tune with the earth beneath her feet. If the\
  \ wearer spends a standard action concentrating on the hand, she gains tremorsense\
  \ out to a range of 30 feet until the start of her next turn. This ability only\
  \ allows her to sense creatures and objects that are in contact with earth or stone."
