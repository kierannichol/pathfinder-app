description: "These well-worn boots act as boots of speed combined with boots of striding\
  \ and springing. The wearer can expend one use of mythic power as a move action\
  \ to take a 7-league step. The steps functions as teleportation with a 21-mile range,\
  \ except the wearer must have an uninterrupted path to her intended destination,\
  \ though this path doesn't have to follow a straight line. Harmful environments\
  \ between the wearer and the destination cause her no harm.\nIf the wearer's path\
  \ is blocked, her travel ends just short of the obstacle blocking her. If she tries\
  \ to step too far, she appears in the closest available space to her destination\
  \ without going beyond 21 miles of where she started."
