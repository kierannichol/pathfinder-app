description: "This long cloth is wrapped around the chest multiple times like a bandage.\
  \ Once per round, the wearer may add an enhancement bonus of +1 to +5 on one attack\
  \ and damage roll for an unarmed strike or natural attack (for one specific attack,\
  \ not all attacks made with an unarmed strike that round). The wearer may use this\
  \ item an additional time per round when his BAB reaches +6, +11, and +16.\nChoosing\
  \ to enhance an unarmed strike is not an action and may occur when it is not the\
  \ wearer's turn (such as when making an attack of opportunity). The wearer must\
  \ decide to use the item before the attack roll is made, but does not have to expend\
  \ all uses at the same time. For example, if the wearer can use the item twice per\
  \ round, he can use it once on his turn when making an attack and save the second\
  \ for the possibility of making an attack of opportunity.\nAdditionally, the bodywrap\
  \ can grant melee weapon special abilities to a creature's unarmed attacks, so long\
  \ as those special abilities to be added apply to unarmed attacks. See Table 3â€“\
  8: Melee Weapon Special Abilities (page 137) for a list of abilities. Special abilities\
  \ count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of the item, but\
  \ do not modify attack or damage bonuses. Any special abilities are set at the time\
  \ of creation. A bodywrap of mighty strikes cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement\
  \ bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +7. Unlike an amulet\
  \ of mighty fists, a bodywrap needs to have a +1 enhancement bonus to grant a melee\
  \ weapon special ability."
