description: "This simple fiber or leather cord has a knot at either end. One end\
  \ is wound once around the notch of a throwing arrow (see New Ammunition, below).\
  \ The cord runs taut along the shaft to the front of the arrow, where you hold the\
  \ arrow to throw. The remainder of the cord wraps around your hand. The cord dramatically\
  \ increases the throwing arrow's range. Attaching the cord to a throwing arrow is\
  \ a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity. The\
  \ Rapid Reload feat can be taken for throwing arrow cords, allowing you to load\
  \ a throwing arrow as a free action."
