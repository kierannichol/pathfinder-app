description: "This small knife has a bone handle and a blade that seems to be made\
  \ of clear blue ice. Commonly found in the hands of an Irriseni winter witch, a\
  \ shard of winter is a +1 frost dagger. Once per day, a witch can use a shard of\
  \ winter to cast any one spell with the cold descriptor that the witch has stored\
  \ in her familiar and is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared.\
  \ This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the witch, including casting\
  \ time, duration, and other effects dependent on the witch's level. This spell can't\
  \ be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities."
