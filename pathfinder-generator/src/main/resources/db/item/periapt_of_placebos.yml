description: "What at first appears to be a fine gem dangling from a long, silver\
  \ chain is in fact a cut and polished bezoar. This necklace—often mistaken for a\
  \ periapt of health or a periapt of proof against poison —inspires its wearer with\
  \ the utter conviction that he has been rendered immune to both disease and poison.\
  \ While the necklace imparts no genuine protections, the strength of belief it imparts\
  \ nonetheless grants its wearer a +2 morale bonus to all Fortitude saving throws\
  \ against diseases and poisons.\nUnless the person identifying a periapt of placebos\
  \ succeeds at her Spellcraft check by 5 or more, she mistakenly believes it to be\
  \ a more powerful protective necklace rather than discerning its true nature."
