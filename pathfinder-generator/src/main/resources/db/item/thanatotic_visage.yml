description: "This jet-black helm completely masks the wearer's face above the mouth,\
  \ giving him a grim aspect. A thanatotic visage has no effect unless worn with thanatotic\
  \ plate. When the wearer would be reduced to 0 hp or fewer, the visage casts breath\
  \ of life on her; this does not require an action or even conscious effort. Casting\
  \ breath of life this way destroys the thanatotic visage."
