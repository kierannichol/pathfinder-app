description: "This +3 cold iron longsword becomes a +5 holy defiant cold iron longsword\
  \ in the hands of a paladin or a lawful good mythic creature. If the creature wielding\
  \ this weapon is a paladin with mythic tiers, she can also grant the weapon the\
  \ brilliant energy special ability on command. Dismissing the brilliant energy ability\
  \ is a free action.\nWhen wielded by a paladin or a lawful good mythic creature,\
  \ this weapon provides spell resistance equal to 5 + the character's paladin class\
  \ level (if any) + the character's mythic tier (if any) to the wielder and anyone\
  \ within 10 feet of her. It also enables the wielder to use mythic greater dispel\
  \ magic once per round as a standard action, with a caster level equal to either\
  \ the wielder's paladin class level or double her mythic tier, whichever is higher.\
  \ Mythic greater dispel magic functions as greater dispel magic including the benefits\
  \ of the mythic dispel magic spell, but when the wielder dispels a spell, she heals\
  \ 1d6 points of damage for every spell level of the dispelled spell instead of healing\
  \ 1d4 points of damage."
