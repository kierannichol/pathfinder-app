description: "This leather pouch is usually decorated with a druidic motif. Within\
  \ is an extradimensional space that can hold 4 cubic feet or 40 pounds worth of\
  \ items and otherwise functions as a small bag of holding. If the bearer uses a\
  \ polymorph effect or wild shape to transform into an animal, dragon, elemental,\
  \ magical beast, plant, or vermin, the pouch never merges with her body. It automatically\
  \ relocates to an easily-accessible place on her body (such as on a belt or a cord\
  \ around her neck), allowing her to access the pouch and items within it while she\
  \ is transformed."
