description: "This iron grappling hook is attached to a 50-foot length of silk rope.\
  \ When a steadfast grapple is thrown, it automatically hits and attaches to any\
  \ targeted object or structure within range of its rope. Against creatures, the\
  \ wielder must make attack rolls as normal. Once attached, a steadfast grapple can\
  \ only be removed with a DC 30 Strength check, the command word, or magic such as\
  \ dispel magic."
