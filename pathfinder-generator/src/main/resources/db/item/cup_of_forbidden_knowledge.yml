description: "This ivory goblet is decorated with carvings of impossibly tall towers\
  \ rising above modest abodes. The goblet is always filled to the brim with wine.\
  \ Any drops spilling from the cup vanish into nothingness before they touch the\
  \ ground.\nOnce per day, the cup grants a permanent +1d4 insight bonus on all Knowledge\
  \ checks to a creature that drinks from it, but it permanently reduces the drinker's\
  \ Wisdom score by the same amount. If your campaign uses the sanity rules (see page\
  \ 12), this instead reduces the drinker's sanity score by double the amount. The\
  \ bonus on Knowledge checks and reduction to Wisdom stack with multiple drinks from\
  \ the same cup, but the bonus can never exceed +10. If the insight bonus ever becomes\
  \ greater than the drinker's Intelligence modifier or reaches +10, she must succeed\
  \ at a Will save with a DC equal to 20 + the amount by which the insight bonus exceeds\
  \ her Intelligence modifier (or DC 20 if the bonus reaches +10 but she has an Intelligence\
  \ modifier of +10 or greater). If the user fails, she becomes insane (as per insanity).\
  \ Even if the user succeeds, the inescapable feeling of knowing too much continues\
  \ to vex her, and she must repeat the saving throw once per day. Only spells that\
  \ can remove insanity can put her mind at ease. However, curing the effect (or the\
  \ insanity that it causes) permanently removes the insight bonus and Wisdom reduction\
  \ and makes the user unable to ever again be affected by a cup of forbidden knowledge."
destruction: "A creature with an Intelligence score of 7 or lower can destroy a cup\
  \ of forbidden knowledge by beating it savagely with physical attacks that deal\
  \ a total of 100 points of damage or more within 1 round. The creature must not\
  \ know that the item is the cup of forbidden knowledge, nor can it be commanded,\
  \ influenced, or tricked into destroying the cup by another creature that knows\
  \ of the cup and its destruction condition."
