description: "A flying blade is a large, crescent-shaped blade anchored to a 10-foot\
  \ chain. You fight with a flying blade by spinning it about your head or by snapping\
  \ it toward an opponent. Because the flying blade is a clumsy weapon, you receive\
  \ a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls with it, but when you make attacks of opportunity\
  \ provoked by movement, you receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls instead of the penalty."
