description: "This appears to be a complex wooden chest of immense sizeâ€”at least 5\
  \ feet long and 3 feet wide and tall, with numerous drawers, side-compartments,\
  \ hatches, and lids and ornately carved feet and scrollwork trim. In spite of its\
  \ size, a chest of defending has an interior volume of 6 cubic feet. It has permanent\
  \ alarm and arcane lock spells cast on it, which can be set to acknowledge a specific\
  \ creature as the effective caster of the spells with a command word (thus allowing\
  \ that creature to determine the details of the chest's spells as if she had cast\
  \ them). This password is normally carved in one of the small drawers. All the compartments\
  \ of the chest have average quality locks, and can be further locked with padlocks\
  \ (not included).\nIf the chest's alarm spell is triggered, the chest's most impressive\
  \ magic property comes into effect: it alters shape and composition to become a\
  \ Medium wood golem (the chest's contents are unharmed by the transformation). Unless\
  \ given different instructions by someone who uses the chest's command word, the\
  \ golem attacks the creature that triggered its alarm, then folds back into a normal\
  \ chest once the trespasser is defeated. All the items within the chest count against\
  \ the golem's encumbrance."
