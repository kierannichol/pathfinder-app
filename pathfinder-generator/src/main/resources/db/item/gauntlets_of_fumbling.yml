description: "These gauntlets perform according to their appearance until the wearer\
  \ finds herself under attack or in a lifeand- death situation. At that time, the\
  \ curse is activated. The wearer becomes fumble-fingered, with a 50% chance each\
  \ round of dropping anything held in either hand. The gauntlets also lower the wearer's\
  \ Dexterity score by 2 points. Once the curse is activated, the gloves can be removed\
  \ only by means of a remove curse spell, a wish, or a miracle."
