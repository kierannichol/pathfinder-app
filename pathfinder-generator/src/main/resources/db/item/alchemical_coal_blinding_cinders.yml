description: "A kobold who chews and swallows this alchemically treated piece of coal\
  \ (a full-round action) can make one breath weapon attack during the next minute.\
  \ If the kobold fails to make a breath attack before this minute expires, it is\
  \ sickened for 1 hour. Other humanoid creatures that eat alchemical coal are sickened\
  \ for 1 hour (though certain other creatures may be able to use them, at the GM's\
  \ discretion). Creatures that are immune to poison are immune to the sickened effect.\
  \ The type of breath weapon depends on the type of alchemical coal that is chewed\
  \ by the kobold.\nBlinding Cinders: This jagged bit of dusty red coal allows a kobold\
  \ to breathe a 30-foot line of coarse cinders. The breath weapon deals 1d6 points\
  \ of fire damage and blinds creatures in the area for 1 round. A creature that succeeds\
  \ at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw takes half damage and is not blinded.\nChoking\
  \ Smoke: This crumbling chunk of chalky white coal allows a kobold to breathe a\
  \ 15-foot cone of foul vapor that deals 1d6 points of acid damage and sickens a\
  \ creature for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw\
  \ takes half damage and is not sickened."
