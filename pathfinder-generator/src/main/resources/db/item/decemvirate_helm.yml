description: "The members of the Pathfinder Society's administrative body, the Decemvirate,\
  \ retain their anonymity by wearing closefaced, magically empowered helmets while\
  \ fulfilling their official roles. The helms not only mask the wearers' faces, but\
  \ also function as helms of telepathy combined with amulets of proof against detection\
  \ and location. The wearer of a Decemvirate helm can use disguise self at will and\
  \ benefits from discern lies and true seeing at all times. The helm provides 100%\
  \ protection from all gaze attacks and all forms of magical control. Specific Decemvirate\
  \ helms may have additional powers and all are said to be unique in physical appearance."
destruction: "Whatever their original purpose, Decemvirate helms seem designed to\
  \ function as mantles of office. If one of these helms is worn by five or more individuals\
  \ in one 24-hour period, it ceases to function for 1 day. If it is again worn by\
  \ five or more individuals within 24 hours of regaining its properties, the helm\
  \ permanently loses its magic properties."
