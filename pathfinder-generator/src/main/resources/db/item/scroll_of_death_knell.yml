description: "You draw forth the ebbing life force of a creature and use it to fuel\
  \ your own power. Upon casting this spell, you touch a living creature that has\
  \ â€“1 or fewer hit points. If the subject fails its saving throw, it dies, and you\
  \ gain 1d8 temporary hit points and a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength. Additionally,\
  \ your effective caster level goes up by +1, improving spell effects dependent on\
  \ caster level. This increase in effective caster level does not grant you access\
  \ to more spells. These effects last for 10 minutes per HD of the subject creature."
