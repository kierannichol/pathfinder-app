description: "This +1 light steel shield is fashioned in the shape of a scarab beetleâ€”\
  a creature that functions as a psychopomp for Pharasma, guiding the souls of the\
  \ departed into the afterlife. Scarab shields are especially favored by archaeologists\
  \ and tomb raiders for the protection they grant against guardians and vermin frequently\
  \ found in ancient ruins and forgotten tombs.\nOnce per day on command, a scarab\
  \ shield grants its wielder a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws against fear and\
  \ death effects for 3 minutes. At any time while this bonus is in effect, the wielder\
  \ can end the effect as a swift action for a burst of healing energy. The wielder\
  \ loses the saving throw bonus, but is healed of 1d8+3 points of damage.\nIn addition,\
  \ a scarab shield can protect its wielder from swarms. If a mindless swarm attempts\
  \ to enter the wielder's space, the swarm must attempt a DC 11 Will save. If the\
  \ save succeeds, the swarm can enter the wielder's space and attack the wielder\
  \ normally. If the save fails, the swarm instinctively avoids the space occupied\
  \ by the wielder, completely ignoring the wielder for 3 rounds. This effect ends\
  \ if the wielder makes any attacks, but the wielder may use non-attack spells or\
  \ otherwise act without ending the effect. This ability functions once per day."
