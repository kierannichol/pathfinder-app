description: "This gold-plated +1 mithral full plate armor has images of Iomedae's\
  \ symbol etched into its immaculately gleaming surface. The armor requires 24 hours\
  \ to attune itself to the wearer and her patron deity, after which point the images\
  \ on the armor shift to match the symbol of the wearer's patron deity (or remain\
  \ associated with Iomedae if the wearer doesn't worship a deity). Thereafter, once\
  \ per day the armor's wearer can offer a prayer to her deity (or Iomedae) as a swift\
  \ action to increase the armor's enhancement bonus to +2 for 10 rounds. For this\
  \ duration, the armor also grants a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws. A paladin\
  \ wearing armor of the pious can use her lay on hands ability one additional time\
  \ per day; a mythic paladin wearing armor of the pious also gains one additional\
  \ use of mythic power per day. An evil character who wears armor of the pious gains\
  \ 2 negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the armor is worn and\
  \ disappear when the armor is removedâ€”they never become permanent but can't be overcome\
  \ in any way as long as the armor is worn."
