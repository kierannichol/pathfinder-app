description: "Created by Rasputin and the Russian inventor Viktor Miloslav, this carbon-arc\
  \ spotlight provides normal light in a 360- foot line and increases the light level\
  \ by one step in the area beyond that, out to a 720-foot line (darkness becomes\
  \ dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A spectral searchlight also reveals\
  \ ethereal or invisible creatures or objects in its area of effect. Spectral searchlights\
  \ are normally mounted in watchtowers or atop two-wheeled carts for easier transport."
