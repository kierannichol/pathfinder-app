description: "When placed upon the lips, these thin, translucent sheets of wax melt\
  \ invisibly onto the user's mouth. The user is aware of-but unaffected by-any magical\
  \ attacks or effects that might harm him through the lips or mouth (such as a succubus's\
  \ energy drain attack). In addition, the next time he would be exposed to an ingested\
  \ poison, the warding lips instead absorb the toxin and leave him unharmed. Once\
  \ exposed to a magical attack or ingested poison, a set of warding lips loses its\
  \ magic and becomes useless."
