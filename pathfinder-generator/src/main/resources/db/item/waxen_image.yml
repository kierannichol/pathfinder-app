description: "This poorly formed wax figure resembles an unfinished sculpt of a humanoid.\
  \ It can be bound to a living humanoid in a similar way to a ganji doll, but must\
  \ be sculpted into the shape of that humanoid and have a piece of that creature's\
  \ hair, teeth, blood, bone, or flesh pressed into the wax. Those familiar with the\
  \ target notice the waxen image's resemblance to the target with a DC 15 Perception\
  \ check.\nA waxen image can be blinded, damaged, or targeted with a touch spell\
  \ in the same way as a ganji doll, except that the bound creature is unaffected\
  \ if it's farther than 100 feet from the waxen image. A waxen image can be used\
  \ only once, and melts as soon as it's used."
