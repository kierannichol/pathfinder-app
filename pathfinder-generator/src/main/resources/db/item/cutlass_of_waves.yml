description: "This +1 cutlass is constantly soaked with brine. The wielder's attacks\
  \ with a cutlass of waves don't take penalties from being underwater, as if the\
  \ cutlass were a piercing weapon. While a creature holds the cutlass in its hand,\
  \ a low-cresting wave of water carries the cutlass's holder along the deck of a\
  \ ship or through the water, otherwise as per slipstream."
