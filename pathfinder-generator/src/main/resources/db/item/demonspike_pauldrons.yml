description: "These black iron pauldrons are studded with jagged spikes of various\
  \ lengths. Demonspike pauldrons act as +2 armor spikes and also deal 1d2 bleed damage\
  \ on a successful grapple attack or melee attack made with the pauldrons. If these\
  \ pauldrons are worn with normal armor spikes, increase the damage done by the armor\
  \ spikes to 1d6 (Small) or 1d8 (Medium), and use the greater of the two enhancement\
  \ bonuses to attack and damageâ€”either from the armor spikes (if any) or the demonspike\
  \ pauldrons."
