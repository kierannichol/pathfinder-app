description: "Originally brewed from waters adjacent to one of the Plane of Water's\
  \ subaquatic suns, a vial of light of Axtarr glows like a candle until expended.\
  \ A vial of light of Axtarr that is emptied underwater as a move action forms a\
  \ small orb that sheds light like a sunrod for 1d6 hours, after which the item is\
  \ expended. Such an underwater orb remains suspended in place, not sinking, floating,\
  \ or drifting away unless moved by a creature. Above water, shaking a vial of light\
  \ of Axtarr as a move action also makes it shed light like a sunrod for 1d6 hours,\
  \ after which it is expended. Any area of normal light created by light of Axtarr\
  \ protects creatures within it from cold temperatures as per endure elements. Alternatively,\
  \ a spellcaster holding an unused vial of light of Axtarr can expend it as a free\
  \ action to automatically succeed at a caster level check to cast a fire spell underwater.\
  \ (Fire spells successfully cast underwater produce steam that still deals fire\
  \ damage; for more details, see page 46 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Aquatic\
  \ Adventures.) This alternative use does not cause the light of Axtarr to produce\
  \ light. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 30 Craft (alchemy) check."
