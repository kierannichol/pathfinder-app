description: "An explosion pocket looks like a cloth pouch just large enough to contain\
  \ a Small or Medium humanoid's hand. When placed against a shirt, vest, jacket,\
  \ trousers, or similar piece of clothing, this ragged green patch attaches to the\
  \ clothing, creating a loose pocket. The pocket functions as a normal pocket, but\
  \ once per day the pocket's wearer can, as a standard action by speaking a command\
  \ word while his hand is in the pocket, cause the pocket to create a single vial\
  \ of alchemist's fire. If a vial of alchemist's fire is in the explosion pocket\
  \ when it is commanded to create a vial of alchemist's fire, the pocket instead\
  \ supercharges the existing vial within so that it inflicts double the normal fire\
  \ damage a vial of alchemist's fire would normally inflict. An explosion pocket\
  \ can be removed as a full-round action, allowing it to be placed on a different\
  \ piece of clothing as the owner wishes. A vial of alchemist's fire created or supercharged\
  \ by an explosion pocket reverts to a vial of inert bitter-tasting water 1 minute\
  \ after it is created or supercharged."
