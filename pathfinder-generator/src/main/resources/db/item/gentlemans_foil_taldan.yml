description: "The following weapon is generally available only to members of the indicated\
  \ race or ethnicity.\nThis bejeweled +1 keen rapier has gilt edges and appears to\
  \ be merely ornamental. It bears an enchantment that is intended to ensure its bearer\
  \ is never bested by sheer weight of numbers. As long as the wielder is threatening\
  \ an opponent with the foil, other foes must succeed at a DC 12 Will save to move\
  \ to a space where they would also be threatened by the foil; those who fail this\
  \ save end their movement just outside the foil's reach."
