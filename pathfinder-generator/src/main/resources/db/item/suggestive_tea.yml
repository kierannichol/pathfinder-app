description: "A single dose of these dried tea leaves is enough to brew a cup of savory\
  \ tea for one creature, who then becomes susceptible to suggestion for 1 hour after\
  \ drinking the tea. During this time, anyone can suggest a course of activity to\
  \ the drinker, who carries out the order to the best of his ability, as suggestion\
  \ (Will DC 14 negates). In addition, the character drinking the tea has no recollection\
  \ of the time spent carrying out the compulsion."
