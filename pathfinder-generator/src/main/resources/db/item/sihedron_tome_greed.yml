description: "The first Sihedron Tomes were said to have been crafted by a dragon\
  \ in the service of Emperor Xin. Each of these books has a unique appearance, and\
  \ hold an infinite number of pages for spellcasters to inscribe spells upon. Any\
  \ wizard who prepares spells from a Sihedron Tome, which potentially holds libraries\
  \ worth of arcane knowledge, may prepare bonus spells as if her Intelligence were\
  \ 6 points higher. This is not an actual bonus to Intelligence and grants the user\
  \ no additional benefit. Karzoug's Sihedron Tome contains all sorcerer/wizard spells\
  \ (save for those of the schools of Enchantment and Illusion) found in the Core\
  \ Rulebook and this book—at the GM's discretion, it can certainly hold more spells."
destruction: "A special 9th-level spell must be designed that exists only to destroy\
  \ the specific and particular Sihedron Tome into which it is inscribed. This spell,\
  \ which has numerous expensive and rare material components, must then be cast on\
  \ the Sihedron Tome by its owner."
