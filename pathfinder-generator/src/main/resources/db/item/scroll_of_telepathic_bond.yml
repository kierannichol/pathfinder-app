name: "Scroll of Telepathic Bond"
description: "You forge a telepathic bond among yourself and a number of willing creatures,\
  \ each of which must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. Each creature included\
  \ in the link is linked to all the others. The creatures can communicate telepathically\
  \ through the bond regardless of language. No special power or influence is established\
  \ as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although\
  \ not from one plane to another)."
