description: "This drab leather tome is stamped plainly with elven lettering, appearing\
  \ at first glance as little more than a journeyman's treatise on spellcasting. Penned\
  \ into almost every margin, however, are copious notes by an author who identifies\
  \ herself only as \"Arrowsong.\" These annotations discuss numerous spellcasting\
  \ fallacies made by the tome's original authors and simple (yet effective) countermeasures\
  \ that more martially inclined persons can use to disrupt spellcasting. The overall\
  \ tone of Arrowsong's notes is one of bitter melancholy, and an equal amount of\
  \ space is dedicated to slanderous poetry directed toward Arrowsong's parents and\
  \ the book's writers, who might be the same people."
