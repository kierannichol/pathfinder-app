description: "A greater assassin's sight is similar to the standard assassin's sight,\
  \ but it has a noticeably sleeker design and provides its wielder greater range.\
  \ It has three settings: 0–30 feet, 30–60 feet, and 60–90 feet. In addition, setting\
  \ the range on a greater assassin's sight is a standard action (though it still\
  \ provokes attacks of opportunity). Finally, a greater assassin's sight grants a\
  \ +4 competence bonus on attack rolls to confirm critical hits within the set range"
