description: "This serum transfers a homunculus's loyalty from one master to another.\
  \ In order for this to work, the homunculus's current master and its master-to-be\
  \ must each place a drop of their blood into the serum. When an appropriate homunculus\
  \ drinks this concoction, it thereafter treats the master-to-be as its master. The\
  \ change in ownership also causes the homunculus's alignment to change to match\
  \ that of its new owner."
