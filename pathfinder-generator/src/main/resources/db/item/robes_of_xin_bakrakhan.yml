description: "The traditional robes of the Runelord of Wrath are known as the robes\
  \ of Xin-Bakrakhan. Woven of the finest of crimson silks and accented with precious\
  \ gold, the robes are surprisingly light and easy to move in. The robes of Xin-\
  \ Bakrakhan aid and accentuate their wearer's spellcasting ability. They grant a\
  \ +5 shield bonus and spell resistance 24, and the wearer casts all spells at +1\
  \ caster level. Two of the robe's pockets function as handy haversacks. The wearer\
  \ of these robes is immune to the effects of calm emotions and can use all skills\
  \ and abilities that require patience or concentration when under the effects of\
  \ a rage spell or similar effect."
