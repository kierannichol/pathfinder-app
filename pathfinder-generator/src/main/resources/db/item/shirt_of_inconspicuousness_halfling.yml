description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis drab shirt helps its wearer blend in with\
  \ the background even while accomplishing important things, the better to avoid\
  \ any trouble that results. The wearer is visible, but easy to overlook, and observers\
  \ explain away or forget her presence. An observer must succeed at a DC 11 Will\
  \ save to notice the wearer; a success renders that observer immune to the shirt's\
  \ effect for 24 hours. An observer automatically notices the wearer if the wearer\
  \ attacks that observer or an ally of that observer."
