description: "This fist-sized blue sponge absorbs up to 1 pint of water; squeezing\
  \ the water out of the sponge filters and purifies it, making it safe for drinking,\
  \ washing, and similar activities. Filling and emptying the sponge is a full-round\
  \ action. The filtration is enough to remove mundane impurities and common diseases,\
  \ but does nothing to protect against poisons, magic, and other exotic threats.\
  \ Each sponge can cleanse 25 pints of water before deteriorating and becoming useless."
