description: "This hole-ridden burlap robe would appear completely worthless if not\
  \ for the immaculate red velvet lining its interior. When worn inside out, a liar's\
  \ robe enshrouds the wearer in a continually shifting array of colors, features,\
  \ and faces that obscure his entire appearance and make physical recognition all\
  \ but impossible. This effect lasts for 1 hour, during which time the wearer can\
  \ go back and forth between wearing the robe inside out (disguising himself) and\
  \ right side out (revealing his true form) any number of times. Witnesses to a creature\
  \ wearing a liar's robe must use true seeing or a similar effect in order to pierce\
  \ through this disguise; otherwise, they see the wearer only as a continually shifting\
  \ humanoid form. The wearer's voice, scent, and other tangible cues are also continually\
  \ altered and distorted, though indirect magical means of identification (such as\
  \ detect thoughts or locate creature) may still be used to recognize the individual.\
  \ Since even the most magically disinclined individuals can clearly tell that the\
  \ wearer is enshrouded in an illusion, a liar's robe is typically used in circumstances\
  \ when it's appropriate to protect the wearer's anonymity without the wearer feigning\
  \ another identity or hiding her presence."
