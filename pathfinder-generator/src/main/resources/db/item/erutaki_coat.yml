description: "Used by the Erutaki human tribes and snowcaster elves native to the\
  \ arctic tundra of the Crown of the World, this heavy parka is treated as an armored\
  \ coat. It provides the benefits of a cold-weather outfit, and it can be donned\
  \ or removed as a move action. In addition, the fluffy white fur of the parka blends\
  \ into arctic landscapes, providing a +2 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks in\
  \ snowy environments."
