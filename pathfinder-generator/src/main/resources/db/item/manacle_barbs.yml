description: "Barbs added to these manacles wound a captive who does more than move\
  \ slowly and with care. A creature secured in barbed manacles takes 1 point of piercing\
  \ damage if it takes more than a single move action during a round. Rough movement\
  \ of any kind, such as being struck in combat or falling prone, likewise causes\
  \ 1 point of damage. Attempting to break out of barbed manacles with a Strength\
  \ check deals 1d4 points of piercing damage to the captive regardless of the success\
  \ of the attempt.\nFetters can also be fitted with barbs, but the wearer can avoid\
  \ damage by not taking actions that involve moving its legs. Hobgoblins often use\
  \ such fetters to secure artisans to their worktables. Securing a captive with multiple\
  \ sets of manacles and/or fetters doesn't cause additional damage."
