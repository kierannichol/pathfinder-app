description: "The silvery glass of this oval mirror displays many alluring sights.\
  \ Its dark wooden frame is studded with many small green gems and is carved with\
  \ the shapes of a male figure on one side of the glass and a female figure on the\
  \ other side.\nWhenever an intelligent creature looks in this beautiful mirror,\
  \ the mirror shows an image of a person, creature, or item that the observer finds\
  \ irresistible—most often one that the observer finds sensually arousing. The specific\
  \ image shown varies from person to person, even when more than one person looks\
  \ into the mirror at the same time. The mirror's effect functions as a gaze attack\
  \ that affects everyone who sees the surface of the mirror, which the bearer can\
  \ actively direct at a target as a standard action. Unless an observer succeeds\
  \ at a DC 27 Will save, she is fascinated, staring blankly at the mirror for as\
  \ long as it remains in view and for 2d4 minutes thereafter, during which she continues\
  \ to stare in the direction she last saw the mirror. Unlike the normal fascinated\
  \ condition, the effect created by the mirror is not automatically broken by an\
  \ obvious threat; instead, a fascinated creature receives a new saving throw for\
  \ each such threat, with a +6 circumstance bonus. At the GM's discretion, a truly\
  \ innocent creature or a character who has renounced all worldly pleasures may be\
  \ immune to the mirror's fascination effect.\nWhile a creature is fascinated by\
  \ the Mirror of Sorshen, the artifact's bearer can speak a command word to compel\
  \ her service for 30 days (as per dominate monster with no saving throw). There\
  \ is no limit to the number of such thralls a bearer can have. The domination effect\
  \ ends for a victim after 30 days, but if the victim sees the mirror again at any\
  \ point before this duration expires, it is automatically extended for an additional\
  \ 30 days from the moment it caught sight of the mirror anew."
destruction: "The Mirror of Sorshen shatters into a thousand pieces if an intelligent\
  \ but completely innocent creature first resists the mirror's attraction and then\
  \ later accidentally drops it."
