description: "This finely wrought iron slave collar is embedded with flecks of pyrite\
  \ and resembles a stylized rendering of a snake eating its own tail. To function,\
  \ it must be placed around the neck of a helpless living creature of up to Large\
  \ size. A creature that speaks the command word while touching the collar can hold\
  \ the wearer accountable to a single service or course of action (as if affected\
  \ by geas/quest, DC 19) for the next 11 days.\nInstead of the penalties associated\
  \ with that spell, if the wearer deviates from this action or attempts to remove\
  \ the collar before the service ends—either directly or by encouraging others to—\
  the collar tightens and begins to choke the wearer into submission (as if affected\
  \ by suffocation). The choking effect ends once the wearer falls unconscious. A\
  \ serpentine choker can be removed safely if the controlling creature speaks the\
  \ command word again while touching the collar, or as if it were a cursed item."
