description: "Concocted from samples of elemental earth drained of vitality, this\
  \ fine powder damages creatures with the earth subtype, as well as constructs made\
  \ from earth, stone, or precious metals (brass, bronze, copper, gold, mithral, or\
  \ silver), like holy water damages undead. Deadground dust can also be applied to\
  \ a stone door to reduce its break DC by 10 (multiple doses don't further lower\
  \ the DC), and it affects devices and mechanisms made from precious metals or stone\
  \ like rusting powder does. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 25 Craft\
  \ (alchemy) check."
