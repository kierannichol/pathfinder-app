description: "This wooden board bears a number of narrow, thin holes large enough\
  \ to hold by the fingertips. The board mounts to a wall, allowing climbers to practice\
  \ their technique and improve their grip by hanging from the board. Using a hanging\
  \ board to improve your grip requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 18 Climb check.\
  \ If you succeed at the check, you gain a +10 circumstance bonus on Climb checks\
  \ to catch yourself while falling and a +5 bonus to catch a falling character while\
  \ climbing. This bonus lasts for 24 hours."
