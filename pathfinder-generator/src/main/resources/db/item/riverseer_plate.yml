description: "This disc of thick green glass is 12 inches in diameter and has a small,\
  \ stylized image of a boat acid-etched into its center. When set against the deck\
  \ of a waterborne vessel, the plate warns of nearby obstacles on or under the water,\
  \ presenting them as glowing green silhouettes on the glass in relation to the boat\
  \ etched on the plate's center. A riverseer plate warns of inanimate dangers within\
  \ a 300-foot radius beyond the vessel in which it is set, providing a +6 competence\
  \ bonus on sailing checks to navigate the vessel around potential dangers (see Ultimate\
  \ Combat for the full rules on sailing checks).\nOnce per day, a creature can apply\
  \ a drop of blood to a riverseer plate's surface. For 5 minutes thereafter, the\
  \ plate marks the location of Small or larger animate creatures in the water around\
  \ the vessel, presenting them on the plate's surface as glowing red dots."
