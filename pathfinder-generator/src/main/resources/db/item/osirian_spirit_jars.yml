description: "Typically found in sets of three, these clay jars are decorated with\
  \ the heads of animals and monsters. Though they once likely contained the preserved\
  \ viscera of ancient Osirian scholars, nobles, and priests, the jars now hold little\
  \ more than dust. Their true value lies in the benefits they provide spellcasters\
  \ seeking to transpose their souls via the spell magic jar. Osirian spirit jars\
  \ serve as focus items for the spell magic jar, forgoing the spell's need for another\
  \ focus. All three jars function in this way, allowing a caster to move his soul\
  \ or that of a nearby target into any one of the three jars, or his own soul between\
  \ jars and bodies as he pleases. The jars do not allow him to shuffle souls other\
  \ than his own into different bodies, though he can shift souls between jars.\n\
  Souls within Osirian spirit jars are permanently affected by magic jar, and can\
  \ potentially be kept trapped within forever. A caster can only move his soul between\
  \ bodies while his casting of magic jar is in effect. If his spell expires while\
  \ he is within an Osirian spirit jar, his soul and those in the other jars are trapped.\
  \ A soul within an Osirian spirit jar can be freed by opening the jar, allowing\
  \ the spirit within to try to swap souls with that of the jar's holder as per the\
  \ spell magic jar (a DC 17 Will save to resist), or return to its body if it is\
  \ within range. Alternatively, casting magic jar on an Osirian spirit jar containing\
  \ a spirit, rather than an individual creature, allows that spirit to swap bodies\
  \ as if it were the target of the spell. Should a spirit within an Osirian spirit\
  \ jar no longer have a body or be outside its jar when its magic jar spell ends,\
  \ it returns to one of the empty Osirian spirit jars if one is in range, or dies\
  \ if one is not."
