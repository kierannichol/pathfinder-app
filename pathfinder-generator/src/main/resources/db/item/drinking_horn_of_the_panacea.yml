description: "This drinking horn is made from the highly polished tusk of some great\
  \ beast. Etched around the rim are stylized waves and sea creatures. The horn typically\
  \ appears empty, but once per day a creature holding it can command it to fill with\
  \ a liquid that has the effect of one of four spells when consumed: cure serious\
  \ wounds, neutralize poison, remove disease, or lesser restoration. Consuming a\
  \ drink from the horn is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.\
  \ No matter the spell chosen, the drink in the horn has the appearance and honeyed\
  \ fragrance of summer mead. If the liquid is not consumed within 1 minute or is\
  \ spilled from the horn, its effects are wasted."
