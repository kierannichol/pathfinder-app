description: "Most broadsheets circulate the latest news in the city where they were\
  \ printed. Most cities in technologically developed nations with printing presses\
  \ have multiple wealthy or government-backed publishers that put out broadsheets.\
  \ A broadsheet typically provides information as if the reader had attempted a Diplomacy\
  \ check to gather information about the topic of the broadsheet (usually news of\
  \ current politics, scandals, or business) and the result of the check were 10.\
  \ Rather than 1d4 hours, gathering information in this way takes only as long as\
  \ is required to read the broadsheet. Broadsheets printed with engraved-plate printing\
  \ presses are at least a few weeks out of date, but those printed with movable-type\
  \ presses can contain news from as recently as yesterday."
