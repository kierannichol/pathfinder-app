name: "Scroll of Greater Teleport"
description: "This spell functions like teleport, except that there is no range limit\
  \ and there is no chance you arrive off target. In addition, you need not have seen\
  \ the destination, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description\
  \ of the place to which you are teleporting. If you attempt to teleport with insufficient\
  \ information (or with misleading information), you disappear and simply reappear\
  \ in your original location. Interplanar travel is not possible."
