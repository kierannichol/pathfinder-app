description: "These clothes are designed specifically to be expensive and gaudy, letting\
  \ everyone know exactly how expensive they are. Precious metals and gems are worked\
  \ into the clothing, along with elaborate embroidery, and some outfits may contain\
  \ impractical concessions to high fashion. A would-be noble also needs a signet\
  \ ring and jewelry (worth at least 100 gp) to accessorize this outfit."
