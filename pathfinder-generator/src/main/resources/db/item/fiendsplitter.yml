description: "This well-made weapon acts as a +1 demon-bane battleaxe and constantly\
  \ emits a susurrus of faint, overlapping voices. In the presence of demons, this\
  \ murmur increases to a cacophony of angry cries. These voices are individually\
  \ unintelligible; the item communicates by empathy rather than speech because its\
  \ intelligence is a collection of several dozen essences rather than a single powerful\
  \ personality. The battleaxe has the destruction of demons as its special purpose\
  \ and the dedicated power to detect demons within 60 feet, even when the demons\
  \ are hidden or in disguise.\nFiendsplitter is embossed with the symbol of Torag\
  \ and can be used as a holy symbol by followers of that stern dwarven god. Three\
  \ times per day, Fiendsplitter can affect itself with bless weapon. Additionally,\
  \ to combat the foul poisons and life-sapping magic employed by many demons, Fiendsplitter\
  \ can affect its wielder with lesser restoration three times per day."
