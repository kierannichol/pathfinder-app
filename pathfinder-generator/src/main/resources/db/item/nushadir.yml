description: "This reagent is often stored in the form of small, salty pellets in\
  \ a dry container, though it can also be mixed with a flask of water and carried\
  \ that way. Nushadir neutralizes acid; a vial of pellets or a flask of nushadir-water\
  \ is enough to render a cubic foot of acid safe to touch in 1 minute, though this\
  \ is usually too slow to prevent damage from a thrown vial of acid or the contents\
  \ of a large monster's gullet. Nushadir vapors are slightly irritating to the eyes,\
  \ nose, and mouth, causing nausea for 1d4 rounds after close exposure (Fortitude\
  \ DC 10 negates)."
