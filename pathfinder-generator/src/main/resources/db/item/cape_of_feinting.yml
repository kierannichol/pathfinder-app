description: "This hooded cape is crafted from fine fabric with colorful embroidery\
  \ and elegant weasel-fur trim. Three times per day, the wearer can spend a standard\
  \ action to purposely miss an opponent, performing a dramatic feint that causes\
  \ that opponent to lose its Dexterity bonus to AC until the wearer's next turn.\
  \ If a swashbuckler wearing the cloak of feinting performs the superior feint deed\
  \ or uses this cape's ability, the opponent is also dazed until the start of the\
  \ swashbuckler's next turn if the foe fails a DC 13 Will save."
