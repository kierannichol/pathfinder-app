description: "Used by warband leaders in Nirmathas, a guerrilla bandanna is a plain\
  \ brown and green bandanna that can be tied around the forehead. The wearer gains\
  \ a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks while traveling in forested terrain, and\
  \ can extend this bonus to up to 10 allies while they remain within 100 feet of\
  \ the wearer.\nIf the wearer is a ranger, the guerrilla bandanna increases his favored\
  \ enemy bonus on attack rolls by 1 for each of his favored enemies. If the ranger\
  \ has the hunter's bond (companions) class feature, this increase also applies to\
  \ the attack roll bonus his allies gain from that ability."
