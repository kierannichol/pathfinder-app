description: "These unusual hand-mirrors allow the user to communicate with the spirits\
  \ of the recently deceased, although such communication comes with great risk. On\
  \ command, the user can look into the mirror and name a recently deceased individual,\
  \ attempting to conjure the image of that person's spirit into the mirror.\nThere\
  \ is a 70% chance that an attempt to contact a specific spirit succeeds. For each\
  \ week that the specified creature has been deceased, this chance decreases by 10%\
  \ (to a minimum of 0%). If the attempt is unsuccessful, the spirit mirror ceases\
  \ to function for 1d4 days and can never contact that particular spirit. If the\
  \ attempt is successful, the deceased person's image appears in the mirror, and\
  \ the user can ask her up to three questions, as call spirit. The spirit also has\
  \ the ability to telekinetically move objects within 20 feet of the mirror, as unseen\
  \ servant.\nThis form of communication is highly dangerous, and allows malevolent\
  \ spirits to attack the user. Each time the spirit mirror fails to contact a spirit,\
  \ another spirit comes in its stead. Usually this spirit makes mischief by either\
  \ giving inaccurate answers or by moving objects around, but there is a 10% chance\
  \ that the spirit manifests as a random incorporeal undead and attacks the mirror's\
  \ user."
