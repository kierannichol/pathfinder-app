description: "This tall, blue candle is shot through with swirls of an amber color\
  \ and puts off a pleasant fragrance similar to honeysuckle when lit. Any creature\
  \ within 10 feet of the candle gains a +5 bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks,\
  \ while at the same time taking a â€“5 penalty on Bluff and Intimidate checks. These\
  \ bonuses and penalties apply only on checks against other creatures within the\
  \ candle's influence. It is a favorite for use during negotiations and parleys.\
  \ The candle can burn for a total of 8 hours. These hours don't need to be used\
  \ consecutively, but must be used in 1-hour increments. Once all 8 hours are used,\
  \ the candle is destroyed."
