description: "Drow alchemists of House Tracinoa developed this mixture to function\
  \ as a lure for mindless oozes. You can throw a flask of ooze attractant as a splash\
  \ weapon. On a direct hit, each mindless ooze within 60 feet must succeed at a DC\
  \ 12 Will save or be compelled to approach the target for the next 1d4+1 rounds.\
  \ On a miss, an ooze still attempts a Will save, but on a failure it instead approaches\
  \ the square in which the flask landed. Once an ooze moves adjacent to the targeted\
  \ creature or into the targeted square, it resumes its normal behavior. An ooze\
  \ can be affected by ooze attractant only once in a 24-hour period."
