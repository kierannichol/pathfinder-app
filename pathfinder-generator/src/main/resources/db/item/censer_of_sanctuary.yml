description: "When a block of incense is placed inside this censer and ignited, the\
  \ bearer gains the benefits of a heightened 2nd-level sanctuary spell for as long\
  \ as the incense burns (1 hour per stick of incense) or until the bearer breaks\
  \ the effect by attacking. Placing the incense is a move action, and igniting it\
  \ is a standard action. If incense of meditation is burned instead of normal incense,\
  \ the sanctuary effect is heightened to 7th level.\nWhile lighting the censer, the\
  \ bearer can expend one use of mythic power to grant the benefits of the censer's\
  \ sanctuary to all allies within a 20-foot-radius emanation of the censer for 10\
  \ minutes. Allies who attack break the sanctuary effect only for themselves. The\
  \ incense extinguishes 1 round after the bearer ceases to use. If incense of meditation\
  \ is extinguished before 8 hours of burning, the remainder becomes normal incense."
