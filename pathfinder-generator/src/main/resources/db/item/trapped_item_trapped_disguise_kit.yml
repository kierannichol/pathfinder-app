description: "Kobold artisans are constantly looking for new ways to increase the\
  \ effectiveness of their traps, all while decreasing their setup time. To fit these\
  \ two needs, kobold inventors have created a series of small and easy-to-use trapped\
  \ items. These replica items have traps built into them, and can be armed in a standard\
  \ action. They're self-contained, single-use, and as easily transportable as the\
  \ items they mimic."
