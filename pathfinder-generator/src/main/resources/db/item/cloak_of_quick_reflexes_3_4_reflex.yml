description: "The wearer of this light, short cloak gains a bonus on all saving throws,\
  \ as with a cloak of resistance, but the resistance bonus on Reflex saves is one\
  \ greater. Furthermore, if the wearer fails a Reflex saving throw, she can expend\
  \ one use of mythic power as an immediate action to reroll that saving throw. If\
  \ the wearer fails the saving throw on the reroll, she can't use this ability again\
  \ for 24 hours."
