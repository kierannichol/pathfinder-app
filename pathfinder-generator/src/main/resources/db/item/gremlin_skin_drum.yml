description: "These small hand drums have pitted metal frames, with dark skin bearing\
  \ furry patches or rough scales stretched across it. The flaws in the drum's skin\
  \ render the drum difficult to play, imposing a –4 penalty on the user's Profession\
  \ (percussion) checks. Though undesirable as musical instruments, gremlin-skin drums\
  \ are icons of ill luck and therefore prized by followers of Zyphus. These drums\
  \ are usually planted in an area to encourage accidents or other misfortune there.\
  \ As a standard action, the user can activate a gremlin-skin drum by setting it\
  \ down and beating it three times. Once activated, the gremlin-skin drum's effect\
  \ (see below) continually targets all creatures within 30 feet until the drum is\
  \ picked up or moved, at which point the effect ends. A gremlin-skin drum can be\
  \ activated up to five times before it becomes a nonmagical drum of poor craftsmanship.\n\
  Several types of gremlin-skin drums exist, and each drum's powers depend on the\
  \ type of gremlin flesh used as its skin. These effects appear to be mere mischance\
  \ upon casual observation; an observer must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check\
  \ to notice that whenever a creature suffers a gremlin-skin drum's effect, the skin\
  \ of the drum shudders slightly. The effects of multiple versions of the same type\
  \ of gremlin-skin drums don't stack.\nGrimple-Skin Drum: The diseased-looking skin\
  \ of this drum occasionally oozes maggots. The penalties from the sickened condition\
  \ increase by 1 (from –2 to –3) for any creatures within 30 feet of a grimple-skin\
  \ drum.\nHaniver-Skin Drum: The skin of this drum is leathery and moist. Any creature\
  \ within 30 feet of the drum that attempts to draw or sheathe a weapon must succeed\
  \ at a DC 13 Reflex save to avoid dropping the weapon.\nJinkin-Skin Drum: The thin\
  \ skin of this drum has cartilaginous striations throughout. Creatures within 30\
  \ feet of the drum take a –1 penalty on saving throws to avoid curses and pit traps.\n\
  Monaciello-Skin Drum: The skin of this drum is red and warty. Creatures within 30\
  \ feet of the drum find their thinking muddled, and take a –5 penalty on all Knowledge\
  \ checks.\nNuglub-Skin Drum: The skin of this drum is dotted with tufts of long,\
  \ oily hair. Any creature tripped within 30 feet of the drum takes 1d6 points of\
  \ nonlethal damage from a painful fall.\nPugwampi-Skin Drum: The skin of this drum\
  \ has patches of mangy fur. Luck bonuses are reduced by 1 (minimum 0) for any creatures\
  \ within 30 feet of the drum.\nVexgit-Skin Drum: The skin of this drum has patches\
  \ of rough scales. Creatures within 30 feet of the drum that fail to avoid a trap\
  \ take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage in addition to the usual effects of the trap."
