description: "The Book of the Damned contains the greatest collection of profane lore\
  \ in the multiverse. This blasphemous book consists of numerous scattered chapters\
  \ divided into three volumes: daemonic, demonic, and diabolic. These three sections\
  \ are typically discovered on their own, as complete works in their own right. A\
  \ fourth volume of unbound pages impaled on a bloody spike of metal—a collection\
  \ of apocryphal notes—exists as well; its pages explore the nature and realms of\
  \ evils other than daemons, demons, and devils. Should all three volumes and their\
  \ apocrypha be brought together, they merge into a compiled compilation that exhibits\
  \ the following abilities.\n0 The Book of the Damned radiates an unhallow effect\
  \ in a 150- foot radius and a sympathy effect tuned to attract all evil creatures.\
  \ Any good creature that willingly touches the tome must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude\
  \ save or be slain (this is a death effect). While the Book of the Damned is outside\
  \ of its repository (see below), any fiendish demigod or greater fiendish power\
  \ can use scry or a similar spell to view the Book of the Damned and its reader\
  \ with no risk of being detected by the bearer. Finally, a creature that makes use\
  \ of any of the tome's abilities is itself damned, condemned to an evil Outer Plane\
  \ after death regardless of its other deeds. Only the intervention of a deity can\
  \ prevent this punishment.\nThe complete Book of the Damned can be used as a profane\
  \ talisman, as an obscene reference volume, and as a gate to the multiverse's most\
  \ complete repository of unholy lore.\nTalisman: As long as the book is carried,\
  \ its bearer casts spells with the evil descriptor as if she were 2 caster levels\
  \ higher and gains a +5 bonus on all Charisma-based checks when interacting with\
  \ evil outsiders. The bearer can also use these spell-like abilities.\nAt will—\
  \ align weapon (evil only), bestow curse, detect evil, speak with dead 3/day— banishment,\
  \ blasphemy, dictum, magic circle (all variants), unhallow, unholy aura, unholy\
  \ blight, word of chaos 1/day— dimensional lock, gate, greater planar binding, soul\
  \ bind\nReference: Any character who can read Abyssal, Celestial, and Infernal and\
  \ who spends a total of 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) studying the tome\
  \ learns soul-tainting secrets. She gains a +10 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks\
  \ whenever she consults the book for 1 hour regarding a particular question. Additionally,\
  \ the book's descriptions of Abaddon, the Abyss, and Hell prove so vivid that teleportation\
  \ effects she uses to reach or move within those planes always bring her to the\
  \ desired location (no mishap roll required). The bearer of the Book of the Damned\
  \ also gains a +5 bonus on the opposed Charisma check required by the planar binding\
  \ spell (this bonus stacks with the +5 bonus the tome grants on interactions with\
  \ evil outsiders).\nOnce per day, the bearer can ask the tome a question relating\
  \ to any profane topic; she then opens the book to a random page to find the answer,\
  \ revealed as if the bearer had cast vision.\nThe book also contains every spell\
  \ with the evil spell descriptor. Repository: Once per day, the bearer of the Book\
  \ of the Damned can cause the tome to disappear into its own internal demiplane,\
  \ leaving behind a sinister, shimmering portal. This allows the bearer and those\
  \ she chooses to enter an unnerving but semisafe library filled with countless volumes\
  \ of blasphemous records, as detailed on pages 167–170 of this book. The book and\
  \ creatures within the repository are affected by a powerful nondetection effect,\
  \ shielding all within from the sight of even the gods. Creatures don't age while\
  \ inside the library, although upon leaving, they immediately age an amount equal\
  \ to the time they spent inside. While within the demiplane, visitors can access\
  \ any of the powers described in Reference above.\nNonevil creatures find the macabre\
  \ surroundings and eerie servants within the repository unsettling and must succeed\
  \ at a DC 30 Will save or be afflicted as if by the spell nightmare every time they\
  \ attempt to rest within. Nothing can prevent this effect.\nCreatures other than\
  \ those the bearer chooses can enter the Book of the Damned 's repository during\
  \ lunar eclipses and the midnight hour on the night of a new moon. The barely visible\
  \ portal manifests as a normal door at these times."
destruction: "The Book of the Damned must be divided into its three chapters and apocryphal\
  \ notes using a dangerous ritual known as the quartern disjunction (see page 187).\
  \ Each section must then be destroyed separately within the span of 1 day. Details\
  \ on how each of these sections can be destroyed appear under their individual descriptions\
  \ in Chapter 3 of this book. If not all of the sections are destroyed at the end\
  \ of 1 day, destroyed sections are restored to full functionality and all the sections\
  \ vanish, reappearing in separate obscure corners of the multiverse."
