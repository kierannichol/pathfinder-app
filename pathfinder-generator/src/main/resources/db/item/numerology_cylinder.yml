description: "This cylindrical puzzle has eight faces and a dozen rings along its\
  \ length that can be spun individually, each with different numbers on each face.\
  \ The user of a numerology cylinder can twist and turn these rings into a multitude\
  \ of combinations. As a full-round action, the user can try to find a new combination\
  \ with particular numeric significance by attempting a DC 25 Knowledge (arcana)\
  \ or DC 20 Intelligence check. If she finds one, she gains a +2 insight bonus on\
  \ caster level checks (such as to overcome spell resistance) for 24 hours. On a\
  \ failed check, the faces lock and the cylinder can't be used again for 24 hours."
