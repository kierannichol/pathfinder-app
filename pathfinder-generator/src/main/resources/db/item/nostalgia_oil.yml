description: "Pathfinders pride themselves on their camaraderie, and among the worst\
  \ threats are those that can magically compel agents to fight among themselves.\
  \ Nostalgia oil is a vial of concentrated aromatics that evoke positive memories\
  \ of the Grand Lodge and common trials overcome during a Pathfinder's training.\
  \ By dabbing this oil on her face, neck, or arms as a standard action, a Pathfinder\
  \ gains a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws against effects with the emotion\
  \ descriptor and on secondary saving throws made to resist dominate person and similar\
  \ compulsion effects that would force her to harm her allies or betray her mission.\
  \ Applied in this way, a vial of nostalgia oil remains potent for 8 hours or until\
  \ washed off with soap and water. Nostalgia oil can also be thrown as a splash weapon,\
  \ extending its benefits for 1 hour to any Pathfinder struck with a direct hit.\
  \ Alternatively, a creature can mix it with a pint of lantern oil or piece of incense,\
  \ which grants half the nostalgia oil's benefits to all Pathfinders within 20 feet\
  \ of the lantern or censor for 1 hour; any strong wind (21+ mph) dissipates the\
  \ aroma for 1 minute.\nCrafting a vial of nostalgia oil requires a successful DC\
  \ 25 Craft (alchemy) check. Although most nostalgia oil is mixed to benefit only\
  \ Pathfinder agents, other mixtures might be created to benefit only members of\
  \ another clan, neighborhood, or organization."
