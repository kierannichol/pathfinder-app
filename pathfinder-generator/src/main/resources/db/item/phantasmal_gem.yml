description: "This small cut crystal appears to be filled with hazy, indistinct images\
  \ that constantly shift and vary. If a spellcaster holding the phantasmal gem casts\
  \ an illusion spell with a duration of concentration (or concentration + a number\
  \ of rounds), the illusion lasts up to an additional 10 rounds after the spellcaster\
  \ ceases concentrating on it. The spellcaster may end the illusion early as a swift\
  \ action. The phantasmal gem can be used multiple times in a day, but cannot grant\
  \ more than a total of 10 additional rounds of illusion spells per day. A gnome\
  \ using a phantasmal gem can recharge it by expending uses of spell-like abilities\
  \ gained through the gnome magic racial trait. Each spell-like ability expended\
  \ as a standard action recharges 1 round of duration to the phantasmal gem (up to\
  \ a maximum of 10 rounds)."
