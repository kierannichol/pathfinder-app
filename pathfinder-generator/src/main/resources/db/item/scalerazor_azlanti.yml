description: "The following weapon is generally available only to members of the indicated\
  \ race or ethnicity.\nThe Azlanti devised this +2 longsword during their ancient\
  \ wars with the serpentfolk. It has the bane property against reptilian humanoids,\
  \ but this power also manifests against lizardlike or snake-like monstrous humanoids\
  \ (at the GM's discretion), such as serpentfolk. Once per day, when the wielder\
  \ fails a saving throw against an effect that would exercise mental control over\
  \ her, she can immediately reroll that saving throw. She must use the new result,\
  \ even if it is worse."
