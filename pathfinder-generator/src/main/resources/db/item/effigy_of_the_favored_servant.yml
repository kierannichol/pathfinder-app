description: "An effigy of the favored servant is a thumb-sized figurine of wondrous\
  \ power depicting a marble, toga-wearing slave. When commanded, the statue grows\
  \ and animates with the same statistics as a hill giant. The giant has no hint of\
  \ personality, but is capable of telepathically receiving orders from the item's\
  \ possessor up to a range of 100 feet. The item can be used twice a week for up\
  \ to 6 hours per use. If animated in an area too small for the giant to appear in,\
  \ the figurine simply doesn't animate, with no weekly use expended.\nIn addition\
  \ to its use as a figurine of wondrous power, an effigy of the favored servant can\
  \ be used as the repository of a dying soul once per day. By spending a full round\
  \ action on a sentient, living creature reduced to –1 or fewer hit points, the effigy's\
  \ bearer can draw its soul into the statuette, killing the creature if it fails\
  \ a DC 22 Will save. From that time forward, the giant summoned by the figurine\
  \ has the same personality as the killed creature. The creature must obey the figurine\
  \ bearer's commands, and the effigy functions as normal. The creature retains none\
  \ of the skills or abilities it had in life, being effectively trapped within the\
  \ statuette. The creature cannot be resurrected or otherwise returned to life unless\
  \ the effigy is destroyed. If the effigy is used to trap another dying soul, the\
  \ first is released and may be raised normally."
