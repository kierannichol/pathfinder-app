description: "This articulated mask resembles a specific type of humanoid monster,\
  \ such as a bugbear, goblin, orc, or hobgoblin. The mouth opens and closes when\
  \ you move your jaw and its skin is actually carefully-painted cloth. Though such\
  \ masks are usually intended for theater performances where an actor plays the role\
  \ of a monster, adventurers have been known to use them to help blend in with monsters\
  \ of the appropriate type. The mask negates the â€“2 Disguise DC for disguising yourself\
  \ as a different race, but only at a distance of at least 20 feet or when you have\
  \ concealment; closer than this distance or in clearer circumstances, the mask is\
  \ obviously a false representation. It only covers your face and is normally worn\
  \ with a wig or helmet to disguise or cover the rest of your head. Each mask is\
  \ most suitable for a wearer of a particular size, though some size and monster\
  \ combinations are less believable than others (a Small creature in an orc mask\
  \ may be able to pass as an orc child, but a Medium creature in a goblin mask at\
  \ best looks like a deformed hobgoblin)."
