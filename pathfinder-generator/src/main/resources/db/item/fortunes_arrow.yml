description: "While this +3 seeking arrow is carried, it grants its bearer a +2 luck\
  \ bonus on saving throws and skill checks. The wielder doubles her favored enemy\
  \ bonus on attack and damage rolls against any creature of that type she attacks\
  \ with the arrow.\nWhen taking a full-round action to fire a single shot using the\
  \ arrow, the wielder ignores all range penalties for that attack. By expending one\
  \ use of mythic power while such an attack, the wielder scores an automatic critical\
  \ hit if the attack hits, and the arrow bypasses any damage reduction the target\
  \ possesses.\nFortune's arrow can always be recovered if searched for. Even if lost,\
  \ it finds its way back to its previous owner within 1d6 days as long as she still\
  \ lives. Fortune's arrow fails to return to its owner only if she dies or freely\
  \ gives it to another."
destruction: "Fortune's arrow can be destroyed by burying it within the heart of a\
  \ being of pure chaos at the center of the realm of purest law."
