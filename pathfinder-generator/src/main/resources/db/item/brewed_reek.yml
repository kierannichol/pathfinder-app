description: "Animal musk, spoiled meat, pungent plants, and any other foul-smelling\
  \ substances on hand go into a batch of brewed reek. When boiled, this mixture becomes\
  \ a thick alchemical slime that adheres to anything it touches. You can hurl brewed\
  \ reek as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. A creature struck with\
  \ a direct hit must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 2d6 rounds.\
  \ If the target fails its save, it must make a second Fortitude save or be nauseated\
  \ for 1 round. Creatures in the splash area must make a Fortitude save or be sickened\
  \ for 1 round. A creature that drinks brewed reek does not get a saving throw and\
  \ is sickened for 2d6 rounds and nauseated for 1 round."
