description: "Alchemist's fire is a mix of several volatile liquids that ignite when\
  \ exposed to air. You can throw a flask of alchemist's fire as a splash weapon.\
  \ Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.\n\
  A direct hit deals 1d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the\
  \ point where the flask hits takes 1 point of fire damage from the splash. On the\
  \ round following a direct hit, the target takes an additional 1d6 points of damage.\
  \ If desired, the target can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the\
  \ flames before taking this additional damage. Extinguishing the flames requires\
  \ a DC 15 Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the\
  \ save. Leaping into a large body of water or magically extinguishing the flames\
  \ automatically smothers the fire. Crafting this item is a DC 20 Craft (alchemy)\
  \ check."
