description: "The brass hilt of this curved +1 dagger resembles a snake coiled around\
  \ a bone. When a new user unsheathes the dagger for the first time, the weapon lets\
  \ out a long, ominous hiss.\nWhen the user places the tip of the dagger in a vial\
  \ of injury poison, the dagger absorbs the dose of poison and stores it in an extradimensional\
  \ space. The stored toxin retains its save DC, effects, and all other properties.\
  \ The dagger can hold a maximum of 5 doses of poison.\nAs a swift action, the user\
  \ can whisper the name of one of the poisons stored in the dagger, releasing the\
  \ poison from its extradimensional space onto the blade of the dagger. When poisoning\
  \ the dagger in this manner, the wielder can't accidentally poison himself, though\
  \ he still poisons himself if he rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll."
