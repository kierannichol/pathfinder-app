description: "While worn, this pair of plain steel armbands limits the ability of\
  \ the wearer to strike out against his comrades with weapon attacks, in the event\
  \ he is unable to control his own actions (such as if confused or dominated) or\
  \ unable to distinguish friends from foes (such as if blinded). The armbands grow\
  \ heavier and hinder the wearer's momentum under these circumstances, causing him\
  \ to take a –4 penalty on attack rolls against creatures he would otherwise consider\
  \ allies.\nAlternatively, two creatures can each wear one of the armbands, occupying\
  \ the wrists slot for both. Under these conditions, the bands apply only half the\
  \ normal penalty on attack rolls against allies. However, the two wearers ignore\
  \ each other for any effects that would cause them to attack the closest creature,\
  \ unless one wearer purposefully attacks the other. Even if the wearers do attack\
  \ one another, their attacks take the full –4 penalty, always fail to confirm critical\
  \ hits, and deal nonlethal damage only."
