description: "This book-sized stone tablet is a recreation of the famous Laws of Man\
  \ from the nation of Rahadoum. The tablet lists the anti-religious teachings of\
  \ the First Law, along with several related verses that have been transcribed along\
  \ the edges. When the tablet is read—a process that takes 10 minutes—its text glows\
  \ with a golden light, providing the illumination of a candle, and the reader gains\
  \ a +1 bonus on Will saving throws against all effects that come from a divine source\
  \ for 24 hours. Only one person can benefit from this bonus at a time.\nA reader\
  \ who possesses the Godless Healing feat (The Inner Sea World Guide 287) can use\
  \ the healing granted by that feat while reading the tablet. In this case, at the\
  \ completion of the reading, the reader rolls twice and chooses the better roll\
  \ when determining the amount of healing granted by Godless Healing."
