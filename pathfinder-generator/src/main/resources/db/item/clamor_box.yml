description: "This delicate tin music box can produce a great volume of noise at a\
  \ specific time determined by its owner. Four command words determine what sorts\
  \ of sounds it is to play (battle, fire, massacre, or riot), and a fifth determines\
  \ the delay (anywhere from 1 round to 20 minutes) until the box begins to produce\
  \ the desired sound. The noise from the box is as loud as 40 people. The sound persists\
  \ for 2d6 rounds."
