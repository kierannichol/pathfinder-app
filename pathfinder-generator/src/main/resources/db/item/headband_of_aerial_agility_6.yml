description: "This headband is decorated with feathers from a number of colorful birds.\
  \ It grants boons to flying magic, and more powerful versions grant the power of\
  \ flight. The wearer of a headband of aerial agility +2 treats his caster level\
  \ as if it were one level higher when casting spells or creating extracts that grant\
  \ flight. A headband of aerial agility +4 gains the same benefits and, on command,\
  \ grants the wearer the ability to fly (as the fly spell) three times per day. A\
  \ headband of aerial agility +6 functions like a +4 version, but the headband grants\
  \ the ability to use fly at will.\nAll versions also grant the wearer an enhancement\
  \ bonus to one mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) of +2, +4,\
  \ or +6. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the headband\
  \ is worn. This bonus is chosen when the headband is created and cannot be changed.\
  \ If the headband grants a bonus to Intelligence, it also grants skill ranks as\
  \ a headband of vast intelligence, usually granting ranks in Fly, Acrobatics, or\
  \ Knowledge (planes)."
