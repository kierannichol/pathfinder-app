description: "This sharpened hollow tube looks like the narrow proboscis of some giant\
  \ insect, but it actually comes from a carnivorous plant. A bleeding arrow deals\
  \ normal damage when it hits a creature and deals 1 point of bleed damage. A critical\
  \ hit does not multiply the bleed damage."
