description: "This +1 bashing heavy steel shield burns with an internal fire upon\
  \ its boss, gaining the flaming weapon special ability when used to make shield\
  \ bash attacks. On command, the wielder can make the shield belch forth smoke as\
  \ a smokestick, but this smoke does not impair the shield user's vision. Once per\
  \ day, the wielder may cause the volcanic shield to erupt in a cascade of brimstone\
  \ as the flaming hands spell."
