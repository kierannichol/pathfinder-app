description: "This stuffed rag doll might resemble a child's toy if not for the vital\
  \ organs depicted on its cloth. By dabbing the doll with a few drops of blood from\
  \ a living creature (a standard action), the bearer can form a sympathetic link\
  \ between the doll and the victim. If the chosen victim has spell resistance, the\
  \ doll must beat the target's spell resistance to create the link. As a standard\
  \ action, the bearer can twist or stab the doll; this gives the target the sickened\
  \ condition for one round and deals 1 point of negative energy damage plus 1 point\
  \ for each die of the doll bearer's sneak attack damage (if any). Each time the\
  \ target is affected by the doll, it receives a DC 14 Will save to end the link.\
  \ The doll's holder needs line of effect to the victim, but not line of sight. Once\
  \ linked to a particular creature, an anatomy doll cannot be linked to another creature,\
  \ but the bearer can re-establish a broken link by anointing it with more of the\
  \ target's blood."
