description: "A summoner's robe is a finely crafted garment of silk the same color\
  \ as the endless sky of the Astral Plane. Once per day when casting a summon monster\
  \ or summon nature's ally spell, the wearer can have the robe absorb one of the\
  \ creatures summoned rather than have it appear within the spell's range. When this\
  \ occurs, the robe gains a defensive aura and takes on visual aspects of the absorbed\
  \ creature (such as becoming red and spiked if absorbing a demon, or manifesting\
  \ flame patterns if absorbing a fire elemental). The creature does not exist outside\
  \ its effect as a defensive aura of the robe as detailed below, and cannot be damaged\
  \ or targeted by most spells. It is still a magical effect, and any spell or ability\
  \ that could dispel or disrupt a creature summoned by summon monster can dispel\
  \ or disrupt the defensive aura. The defensive aura is also dispelled if the robe\
  \ enters an area a summoned creature could not enter, or at the end of the duration\
  \ of the spell that summoned the absorbed creature. If the wearer takes an amount\
  \ of damage equal to or greater than 5 hit points per level of the spell that summoned\
  \ the absorbed creature, the defensive aura ends.\nAs long as the robe has a defensive\
  \ aura, its wearer gains some of the absorbed creature's defenses and powers. These\
  \ abilities are determined as if the wearer were using a transmutation (polymorph)\
  \ spell to assume the absorbed creature's form. Unlike a normal polymorph effect,\
  \ it does not grant her the appearance of the creature (or any bonus to Disguise),\
  \ any movement type, natural attacks (or proficiency with them), or size change.\
  \ The wearer does not change form, gain any ability score modifiers, have her gear\
  \ meld into her body, or lose any abilities based on her form. She is considered\
  \ to be under the effects of a polymorph spell, and cannot be under the effects\
  \ of another polymorph spell or size-altering magic for the duration of the defensive\
  \ aura. The abilities the defensive aura grants are otherwise determined by the\
  \ type of creature absorbed. If the creature is an elemental, the wearer gains the\
  \ abilities listed in elemental body III; if it's a plant, the wearer gains the\
  \ abilities listed in plant shape II; if it's an undead, the wearer gains the abilities\
  \ listed in undead anatomy III. If the creature is of any other creature type, the\
  \ wearer gains the abilities it possesses listed in beast shape IV."
