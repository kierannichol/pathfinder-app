description: "This long-barreled firearm is powered by a removable compressed air\
  \ reservoir. A misfire while an air repeater has the broken condition does not cause\
  \ the firearm to explode, but it does destroy the air reservoir. An air repeater\
  \ can fire 6 shots before the air reservoir is depleted. An air repeater comes with\
  \ three air reservoirs. Replacing the air reservoir requires 1 minute. The Rapid\
  \ Reload feat reduces this to a full-round action."
