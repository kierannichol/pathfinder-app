description: "This 1-foot-square piece of paper is coated on one side with a weak\
  \ glue or sticky material such as tree sap or even honey. It is stored folded in\
  \ half. If you apply glue paper to a window before you break it, the broken pieces\
  \ stick to the glue rather than noisily falling to the ground. Glue paper is good\
  \ for a single use."
