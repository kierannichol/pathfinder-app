description: "These bracers are made of heavy iron and have a pattern of howling wolves\
  \ engraved upon them. Once per day on command, the wearer can clash the bracers\
  \ together rhythmically. This causes the wolves etched into the bracers to come\
  \ to life and let out a chorus of howls, with the effect of crushing despair (DC\
  \ 16). Additionally, for every two creatures under the effect of the wearer's raging\
  \ song when this ability is used, the DC increases by 1, up to a maximum increase\
  \ of 5."
