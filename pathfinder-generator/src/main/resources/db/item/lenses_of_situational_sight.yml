description: "These wire spectacles are fitted with several groundcrystal filters\
  \ on hinged arms, any combination of which can be moved in front of or away from\
  \ the lenses as a standard action (one, two, or all three lenses may be positioned\
  \ at the same time with one action). Each filter grants a specific sense to the\
  \ wearer when it is placed before one of the lenses. Each set of filters can be\
  \ used for 10 minutes in 1-minute increments before losing its magical properties.\
  \ The three sets of lenses are as follows.\nGreen Lenses: Grant the wearer the benefits\
  \ of detect magic. The wearer doesn't need to concentrate to gain the benefits of\
  \ the spell as long as a source of magic remains in her line of sight for the appropriate\
  \ number of rounds.\nPink Lenses: Grant the wearer the benefits of see invisibility.\n\
  Purple Lenses: Grant the wearer darkvision out to a distance of 60 feet. If the\
  \ wearer already has darkvision, the range of her darkvision increases by 60 feet\
  \ while she uses these filters."
