description: "This resplendent suit of +3 full plate shimmers and shifts between all\
  \ the colors of the rainbow. A single color dominates the others at any given time.\
  \ As a swift action, the wearer can change the dominant color. This color remains\
  \ dominant until the wearer changes it again. When the wearer of prismatic plate\
  \ is struck by a prismatic spray, or when he passes through a prismatic sphere or\
  \ prismatic wall, he ignores the effect that matches the dominant armor color. He\
  \ receives no special protection against the other colors of those spells. In addition\
  \ to this benefit, each color provides a unique type of protection."
