description: "This thin green headband is made entirely out of small metal scales\
  \ that shimmer in the sunlight, sparkling in turn with flashes of emerald, forest\
  \ green, and sea-foam depending on the angle from which the wearer is viewed. While\
  \ the wearer is taking damage or otherwise being negatively affected by a poison,\
  \ she can touch another creature and duplicate the poison's effects in that creature.\
  \ This requires a melee touch attack that provokes attacks of opportunity. When\
  \ the wearer makes a successful touch attack in this way, the target creature must\
  \ attempt a Fortitude saving throw against the duplicated poison's DC as if it were\
  \ the target of the initial poisoning. Failing this Fortitude saving throw subjects\
  \ the target to the full duration of the duplicated poison's effects. The initial\
  \ poison can be duplicated to only one additional target at a time."
