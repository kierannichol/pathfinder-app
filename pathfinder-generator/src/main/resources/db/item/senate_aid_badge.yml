description: "This brooch features the heraldry of a Taldan noble family, marking\
  \ the wearer as an aide to the associated senator. All senate aide badges are part\
  \ of a set, attuned to a single master senator badge during their creation. A creature\
  \ wearing the pinned brooch can receive telepathic communications sent from the\
  \ wearer of the master senator badge. Once the wearer of the senate aide badge receives\
  \ a message, she has 1 minute to send a telepathic reply of up to 25 words. Sending\
  \ a reply requires a full-round action of concentration. The wearer of the master\
  \ senator badge can send up to 10 telepathic messages per day, targeting either\
  \ a specific badge or broadcasting to all badge wearers, and knows the approximate\
  \ direction and distance to all wearers of senate aid badges attuned to the master\
  \ badge.\nSenate aide badges are often further enchanted with emergency effects\
  \ that mimic the spell, whisking endangered staff to safety or casting protective\
  \ magic. The exact conditions and effects vary, and their cost is added the badge's\
  \ construction cost."
