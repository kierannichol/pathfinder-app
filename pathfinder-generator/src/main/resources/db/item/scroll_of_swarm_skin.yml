name: "Scroll of Swarm Skin"
description: "You convert all of your soft tissue into swarms of insects or other\
  \ creatures and send them off to do your bidding, leaving nothing but your bones\
  \ and gear behind. These swarms have all their normal qualities and abilities but\
  \ also bear a tiny portion of your consciousness that allows you to perceive what\
  \ they do and to control their actions. While in this form, you cannot use any of\
  \ your own abilities or take any actions other than controlling the swarms."
