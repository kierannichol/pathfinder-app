description: "This rune-carved bracelet is made of thick, bright gold and allows the\
  \ wearer to manipulate time through electricity magic. As a swift action, the wearer\
  \ can activate the bracer, creating a nimbus of crackling blue energy that surrounds\
  \ the hand wearing the electro-temporal bracer for up to 3 minutes each day. This\
  \ duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. While\
  \ the nimbus is active, spells with the electricity descriptor cast by the wearer\
  \ have an additional effect, chosen by the wearer as each spell is cast: the spell\
  \ dazzles all targets of the spell for 1 round, the spell staggers a single target\
  \ of the spell for 1 round, or the spell provides a single target of the spell the\
  \ benefits of haste for 1 round. The staggered and haste effects affect only one\
  \ target selected by the caster as the spell is cast, even if the spell affects\
  \ multiple targets. There is no saving throw for these additional effects, but a\
  \ target that avoids the effects of the electricity spell entirely (such as by negating\
  \ the effect with a successful save, or by having immunity to the spell's damage)\
  \ is not subject to the additional effect. (A target of an additional effect that\
  \ successfully saves against the electricity spell but still takes partial damage\
  \ is still subject to the additional effect.)\nIf the wearer takes at least 50 points\
  \ of electricity damage from a single source (such as a trap or a spell), the wearer\
  \ immediately benefits from the effects of time stop, and the electro-temporal bracer\
  \ ceases functioning for 1 month."
