description: "This translucent longsword was first forged by Jistkan elemental binders.\
  \ It appears to have a blade crafted from solid wind, similar in appearance to the\
  \ matter that makes up an air elemental's body. It functions as a +2 longsword.\
  \ Three times per day, when the wielder confirms a critical hit with a sword of\
  \ tempests, as an immediate action he can will a fraction of the blade to break\
  \ off and transform into a Medium air elemental (this does not affect the sword\
  \ itself). The elemental fights as the wielder directs for 7 rounds, or until it\
  \ is destroyed. At the GM's discretion, similar weapons may exist that summon elementals\
  \ from different planes."
