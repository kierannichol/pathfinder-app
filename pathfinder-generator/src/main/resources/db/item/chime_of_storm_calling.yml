description: "This copper chime can be struck as a standard action, producing a cloud\
  \ of mist around the user equivalent to an obscuring mist spell. If struck again\
  \ before the mist disperses, the user can call down the fury of a storm on a single\
  \ target within the clouded area, either striking it with a bolt of lightning (3d6\
  \ electricity damage, Reflex DC 15 half) or buffeting it with a gust of wind for\
  \ 1 round, equivalent to the spell gust of wind. Either use immediately disperses\
  \ the cloud of mist and renders the chime of storm calling inert for 24 hours. If\
  \ the chime of storm calling is not struck again, the mist disperses after 5 minutes,\
  \ after which it may be used again to create new banks of mist.\nA chime of storm\
  \ calling cannot summon lightning or wind while underground, indoors, or in an arid\
  \ climate."
