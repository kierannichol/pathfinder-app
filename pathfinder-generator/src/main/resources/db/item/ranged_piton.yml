description: "This pointed metallic piton bears a ring the size of a gold piece. A\
  \ ranged piton is sized and designed so that it can be launched as easily as an\
  \ arrow. When fired from a bow as a standard action at an object or empty square,\
  \ the wielder makes a ranged attack against AC 5 to determine whether the piton\
  \ hits the intended target. Range penalties apply as normal. On a hit, the piton\
  \ attaches to the point struck, cleaving to vertical and horizontal surfaces alike.\
  \ An attached ranged piton can be recovered only by speaking a command word while\
  \ pulling on the piton's ring. Light rope, such as silk rope, can be threaded through\
  \ the piton's ring before it is fired to rapidly place rope lines."
