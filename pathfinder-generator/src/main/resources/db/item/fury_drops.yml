description: "Anointing a creature's eyes with a dose of fury drops causes it to immediately\
  \ fly into a rage for 1d6 rounds, granting it a +2 alchemical bonus to Strength\
  \ and Constitution, a +1 alchemical bonus on Will saves, and a -2 penalty to AC.\
  \ The effect is otherwise identical to a barbarian's rage, and creatures are fatigued\
  \ at the end of the rage. Only creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 can\
  \ be affected by fury drops."
