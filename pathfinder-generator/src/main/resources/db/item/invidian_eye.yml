description: "The Invidian Eye rewards devotion and punishes betrayal. When first\
  \ given to a creature, the necklace recognizes members of the creature's race and\
  \ gender—but not a specific individual— as its owner. The owner automatically fails\
  \ any saving throw made to resist the effects of divination magic, but the necklace\
  \ seeks to protect the owner against danger, reactively casting spells to defend\
  \ its wearer against effects that compromise her control. The spells the amulet\
  \ can cast (and when it does so) include freedom (in response to imprisonment, petrification,\
  \ paralysis, and similar effects described by this spell), greater dispel magic\
  \ (in response to any fear or mind-affecting effect), remove curse (in response\
  \ to curses), protection from chaos (in response to any form of possession or similar\
  \ control). The wearer has no control over when these spells are cast and the target\
  \ of these spells is always the wearer. The Invidian Eye can cast each spell 3 times\
  \ per day.\nIf the Invidian Eye is worn by a creature not of the race and gender\
  \ it recognizes as its owner, it ceases to use its defensive properties. In addition,\
  \ once every 1d6 days, the gem makes a self-destructive suggestion. The wearer must\
  \ succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or make a casual attempt to harm herself\
  \ during the course of the day. This suggestion does not dominate the wearer's actions,\
  \ but she might be compelled to cut herself if she's wielding a weapon or jump if\
  \ she passes a high window. If the wearer resists this compulsion three times in\
  \ a row, the Invidian Eye takes more serious measures, conjuring a miniature prismatic\
  \ sphere into the wearer's throat, which causes the wearer to begin suffocating\
  \ (Core Rulebook 445). The sphere can only be removed by targeting the wearer with\
  \ the same spells that normally remove a full size prismatic wall.\nThe race and\
  \ gender the Invidian Eye perceives as its owner can be reset by casting mage's\
  \ disjunction upon the artifact, though this carries the normal risk of destroying\
  \ the artifact. Whoever the necklace is next given to determines the artifact's\
  \ new owner.\nThe Invidian Eye is under the effects of a permanent nondetection\
  \ spell. This affects only the artifact, not the wearer."
destruction: "The Invidian Eye must be offered to 100 free-willed mortals who know\
  \ nothing of its powers and be rejected by each."
