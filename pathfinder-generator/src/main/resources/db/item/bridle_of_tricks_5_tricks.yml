description: "Appearing to be a finely crafted bridle of polished steel and blue-dyed\
  \ leather, a bridle of tricks can be placed on any animal or magical beast with\
  \ an appropriate shape to wear a bridle (creatures with unusual anatomies may be\
  \ affected with GM discretion). While wearing the bridle, a creature is treated\
  \ as knowing three, four, or five additional tricks, as if it had been taught the\
  \ tricks with the Handle Animal skill. The tricks granted by a bridle of tricks\
  \ are set when it is created, and cannot be changed. The most common tricks found\
  \ in a bridle of tricks are attack, defend, fetch, guard, and heel. See the Handle\
  \ Animal description on page 97 of the Core Rulebook for more information on tricks,\
  \ and Pathfinder Player Companion: Animal Archive for new additional tricks."
