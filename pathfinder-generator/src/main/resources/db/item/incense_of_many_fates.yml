description: "When used during meditation, this incense allows a samsaran's consciousness\
  \ to pass through past or future lives to learn more about an important person,\
  \ place, or thing. This functions like legend lore, but only works if the subject\
  \ is at hand. The transcendental state lasts 1 hour, during which she can take no\
  \ other actions. If she is disrupted during the meditation, the incense's effect\
  \ is lost. Creatures other than samsarans can use this incense, but the connections\
  \ to other lives are weaker and require a deeper meditation that takes 24 hours.\
  \ Each block of incense lasts for 1 use."
