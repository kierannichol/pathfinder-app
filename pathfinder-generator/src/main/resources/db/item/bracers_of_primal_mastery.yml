description: "Seven mithral strips weave their way around these steel bracers, which\
  \ thrum ever so faintly with the force of stabilizing magic. When the wearer activates\
  \ a magic item, casts a spell, or uses a spell-like ability that triggers a primal\
  \ magic event (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Magic 13), the resulting event\
  \ is rolled (or otherwise determined) twice, and the caster can choose which of\
  \ the two events occur. The bracers also allow the wearer to roll twice and choose\
  \ the result when using a rod of wonder."
