description: "A pitch-black powder made from pulverized marrowstone mixed with the\
  \ dust of the Negative Energy Plane, blackblot interferes with life energy and mythic\
  \ abilities. A handful of blackblot can be thrown onto a creature as a splash weapon.\
  \ Treat this as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. If the\
  \ target takes a direct hit, it must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be rendered\
  \ immune to positive energy, similar to the protection death ward offers against\
  \ negative energy. Spells and effects that heal or harm based on positive energy,\
  \ such as cure spells and channeled positive energy, have no effect on the target.\
  \ This effect lasts for 1 minute. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where\
  \ the blockblot hits must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or be immune to positive\
  \ energy for 1 round.\nA mythic creature that takes a direct hit from a dose of\
  \ blackblot must attempt an additional DC 16 Will save. If the creature fails, it\
  \ can't expend mythic power for 1 minute, though mythic abilities that don't require\
  \ the expenditure of mythic power function normally. The mythic creature can attempt\
  \ an additional Will save each round; if it's successful, this effect ends.\nBlackblot\
  \ is typically stored in small silk packets or hollow bone tubes. The listed price\
  \ is for 1 dose."
