description: "The helm of Ikimizi grants its wearer a +4 circumstance bonus on attack\
  \ rolls made to confirm critical hits. However, whenever the wearer threatens a\
  \ critical hit (regardless of whether or not he actually succeeds), he immediately\
  \ becomes berserk (gaining all the benefits and drawbacks of the barbarian's rage\
  \ ability). For 1d4+1 rounds, he is compelled to attack the nearest creature until\
  \ it has fallen, regardless of whether the target is friend or foe.\nIn addition,\
  \ whenever the wearer of a helm of Ikimizi slays a creature, he must spend at least\
  \ 1 full-round action feasting on the flesh of the fallen creature, heedless of\
  \ anything or anyone else around him.\nOnce it is equipped, the helm of Ikimizi\
  \ can only be removed by a remove curse spell."
