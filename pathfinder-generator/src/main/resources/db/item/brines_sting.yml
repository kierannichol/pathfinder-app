description: "Brine's Sting is a slim +1 rapier with a hilt guard in the shape of\
  \ a writhing purple sea snake. On a successful hit that deals damage, the target\
  \ must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or take a â€“1 penalty on attack and damage\
  \ rolls for 1 round as salty brine drips painfully onto the wound. A new saving\
  \ throw must be made each time the weapon deals damage. On a successful critical\
  \ hit against a creature with the aquatic or water subtype, the target takes an\
  \ additional 3d6 points of damage as its flesh cracks and withers from dehydration\
  \ as salt crystals form around the wound."
