description: "These supple, velvet gloves are the sort that might be thrown down in\
  \ challenge for a duel or other single combat. By removing a glove and using it\
  \ to make a melee or ranged touch attack against an opponent, the wearer of the\
  \ other glove gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against the target, and the\
  \ target gains a –1 penalty on attack rolls against the wearer. Both of these effects\
  \ last for 1 minute, but immediately end if anyone but the glove's wearer attacks\
  \ the challenged opponent. Both gloves must be worn by the same creature."
