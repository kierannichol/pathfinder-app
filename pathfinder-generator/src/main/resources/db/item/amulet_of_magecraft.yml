description: "A universalist wizard who selects the amulet as his bonded object may\
  \ choose one school of spells each day when he prepares spells. He then can use\
  \ the necklace to spontaneously convert any prepared wizard spell of that school\
  \ into any other wizard spell of that school he knowsâ€” though the desired spell\
  \ must be of the same level or lower than the prepared spell. For example, if the\
  \ wizard chooses evocation when he prepares his spells that morning, until the next\
  \ time he prepares spells, he can spontaneously convert a prepared fireball into\
  \ any other evocation wizard spell of 3rd level or lower that he knows."
