description: "This expertly crafted helmet has several small arms that hold magnifying\
  \ lenses near the wearer's face. They're kept in place by locking hinges and crude\
  \ gyroscopes that compensate for normal head movements. While the lenses are properly\
  \ aligned, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise and Craft checks\
  \ involving items that are small or highly detailed and on sight-based Perception\
  \ checks when she uses an action to inspect something within 5 feet. However, the\
  \ arms become misaligned if the wearer falls prone or is grappled, or if the helmet\
  \ is damaged (hardness 5, 2 hit points). If the arms are misaligned, they lose their\
  \ usefulness until readjusted (a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity)."
