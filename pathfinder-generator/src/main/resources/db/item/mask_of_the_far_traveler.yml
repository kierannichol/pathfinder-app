description: "This leather half-mask covers the wearer's nose and mouth, obscuring\
  \ her lip movements but not her voice. Creatures that are on their native plane\
  \ and have a language understand all words spoken by the wearer, as though her words\
  \ were spoken in the listening creature's native tongue. In addition, because the\
  \ mask replicates local idioms efficiently and skillfully, the wearer gains a +5\
  \ competence bonus on Diplomacy checks and on Bluff checks to tell a lie. A mask\
  \ of the far traveler does not function on the Material Plane."
