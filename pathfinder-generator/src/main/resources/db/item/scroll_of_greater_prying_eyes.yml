name: "Scroll of Greater Prying Eyes"
description: "This spell functions like prying eyes, except that the eyes can see\
  \ all things as they actually are, just as if they had true seeing with a range\
  \ of 120 feet. Thus, they can navigate darkened areas at normal speed. Also, a greater\
  \ prying eye's maximum Perception modifier is +25 instead of +15."
