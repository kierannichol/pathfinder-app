description: "This gold-plated watch is divided into five pieces. The weirding watch\
  \ keeps flawless time without ever needing to be wound or repaired. In addition,\
  \ the bearer of any piece of the watch can activate it to exercise power over time\
  \ for herself and her allies. Once a watch piece is activated, the bearer gains\
  \ the benefits of haste and lesser age resistance for 3 rounds. Anyone bearing a\
  \ piece from the same weirding watch within 30 feet receives the same effect. Each\
  \ piece of the watch can be activated once per day. The price of a weirding watch\
  \ includes all five pieces. Pieces are rarely sold separately."
