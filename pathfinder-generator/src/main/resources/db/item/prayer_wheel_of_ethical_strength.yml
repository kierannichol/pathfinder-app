description: "Sacred or profane mantras cover the outer face of this cylindrical wooden\
  \ block, which rotates around a decorative brass spindle. By holding the spindle\
  \ in one hand while meditating or resting to regain ki, the bearer may attune his\
  \ ki points to the wheel. Once attuned, the bearer's ki strikes count as good (if\
  \ the wheel has sacred mantras) or evil (if the wheel has profane mantras) instead\
  \ of lawful for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This lasts until the\
  \ next time the bearer rests or meditates to regain ki points. A creature can only\
  \ be attuned to one prayer wheel at a time, and a prayer wheel can only be attuned\
  \ to one person at a time. Only creatures who can make lawfully-aligned ki strikes\
  \ can use a prayer wheel."
