description: "With the coming of the Eye of Abendego and the permanent change to the\
  \ coastline's environs, its inhabitants have been forced to look to strange new\
  \ places for resources. Hagfish hide may well be one of the most unusual replacement\
  \ materials. This suit of +1 slick hide armor appears to constantly drip a viscous\
  \ ooze. When immersed in water, the wearer gains a swim speed of 20 feet and the\
  \ ability to breathe underwater. The slime exuded by the armor is particularly unpleasant\
  \ and foul-tastingâ€”the first time a creature successfully bites a character wearing\
  \ hide of the hagfish in a 24 hour period, that creature must succeed at a DC 14\
  \ Fortitude saving throw to avoid being nauseated by the slime for 1 round."
