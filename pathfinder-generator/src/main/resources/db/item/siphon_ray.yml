description: "This parasitic, hand-sized, cartilaginous fish attaches to a creature\
  \ and filters nutrients directly from its host's bloodstream. However, a siphon\
  \ ray reoxygenates the blood in the process, allowing the host to hold her breath\
  \ for twice as long while underwater. A siphon ray must be attached for at least\
  \ 1 minute before providing this benefit, and every hour a ray remains attached\
  \ per day, the host must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or become fatigued.\
  \ While attached, a siphon ray avoids most attacks as though it were a piece of\
  \ equipment unless specifically targeted.\nA siphon ray must be kept in at least\
  \ 1 gallon of salt water when not in use. If it is out of salt water for 1 hour,\
  \ the siphon ray expires."
