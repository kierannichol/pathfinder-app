description: "The viscous turquoise oil in this fine glass vial bursts into a pearlescent,\
  \ silvery mist when exposed to air. You can throw a vial of silvercloud oil as a\
  \ splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit allows the mist\
  \ to enter the body of a target with DR/silver and eat away at the victim's defenses,\
  \ reducing its DR/ silver by 1 per round for 1d4+1 rounds (to a minimum of 0). Once\
  \ the duration of this effect ends, the target fully regains its damage reduction.\
  \ Each creature with DR/silver within 5 feet of the point where the vial struck\
  \ takes a â€“1 penalty to its DR/ silver for 1 round. Crafting this item requires\
  \ a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
