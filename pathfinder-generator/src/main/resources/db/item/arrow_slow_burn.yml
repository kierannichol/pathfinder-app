description: "Behind the head of this arrow is a small receptacle of alchemical material\
  \ that heats up when exposed to air and eventually combusts; barbs on the arrowhead\
  \ pierce the pouch when it hits a target. If you hit a target with a slow burn arrow,\
  \ it deals damage as normal, but at the beginning of your next turn, the arrow bursts\
  \ into flames and deals 1d6 points of fire damage to the target."
