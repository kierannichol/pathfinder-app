description: "Meant to be worn around the neck, this medallion made of braided, blue-tinged\
  \ white gold hangs from a silver chain. When a creature with the demon subtype uses\
  \ its summoning ability with 100 feet of the medallion's wearer, it must attempt\
  \ a concentration check with a DC equal to 15 + double the level of its summon ability.\
  \ If the summoner fails this concentration check, none of the summoned creatures\
  \ appear, and the use of the demon's summon ability is wasted. On a successful concentration\
  \ check, the number of creatures that the demon summons (if any) is reduced to 1."
