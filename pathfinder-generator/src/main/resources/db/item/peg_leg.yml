description: "A peg leg is a wooden stump with a socket built on one end to fit over\
  \ an individual's knee. Pirates who lose legs at sea often wear peg legs. A peg\
  \ leg reduces your base speed by 5 feet and imposes a –4 penalty on Acrobatics,\
  \ Climb, and Swim checks. You take half damage from caltrops. Pirates often carve\
  \ hidden compartments into their peg legs—these compartments can hold small items\
  \ weighing up to 1 or 2 pounds (or a few swigs of grog). If you have two peg legs,\
  \ your base speed is reduced to half and you take a –10 penalty on Acrobatics, Climb,\
  \ and Swim checks. You are immune to damage from caltrops.\nPeg legs presume that\
  \ the knee joint is intact. If the knee joint is not intact, use the prosthesis\
  \ statistics instead."
