description: "This richly colored, burnished brass ring appears to be crimson red,\
  \ sunset orange, or golden yellow depending on how it is held. Clerics of Sarenrae\
  \ prize glorious flame rings as facets through which they may channel their deity's\
  \ divine will. Once per day, the wearer may speak the ring's command word to create\
  \ a 5-foot-radius burst of flame centered on herself. This burst of flame deals\
  \ 1d6 points of damage to any adjacent creatures (Reflex DC 14 halves), though the\
  \ wearer is safe from this effect.\nIf the wearer is capable of channeling positive\
  \ energy, she may as a standard action expend one use of channeled energy to activate\
  \ the ring's burst of flame, even if she has already spoken the ring's command word\
  \ for the day. If the wearer also has the Selective Channeling feat, she may select\
  \ a number of allies equal to her Charisma modifier to exclude from the burst of\
  \ flame; these allies are not affected by the flame. This effect is otherwise identical\
  \ to creating the ring's burst of flame by speaking the command word."
