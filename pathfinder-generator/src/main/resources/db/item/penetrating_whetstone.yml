description: "This whetstone is made from finely worked obsidian. Sharpening a blade\
  \ with this whetstone requires 15 minutes of work and grants the weapon the ability\
  \ to ignore up to 3 points of natural armor for its next five attacks. If the target\
  \ of the weapon's attack has a natural armor bonus of less than +3, the weapon deals\
  \ 1 additional point of damage for each point of natural armor below 3 the target\
  \ has. The process of honing the blade shatters a portion of the whetstone's enchanted\
  \ obsidian, dispelling its magic and turning it into a mundane whetstone afterward."
