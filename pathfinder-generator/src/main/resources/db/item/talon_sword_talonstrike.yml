description: "Weapons like this alchemical silver +2 defending bastard sword are favored\
  \ blades of the Eagle Knights. Easily recognized by its notched blades and golden\
  \ quillons crafted like upswept eagle wings, its defending ability also protects\
  \ the wielder's mount. Wealthier Eagle Knights who frequently skirmish on the western\
  \ border against Chelish fiends sometimes have their swords crafted with the ability\
  \ to cast dimensional anchor on the target as a free action upon a successful hit;\
  \ these modified blades are called talonstrike swords."
