name: "Scroll of Condensed Ether"
description: "You condense the substance of the Ethereal Plane as it interpenetrates\
  \ the Material Plane. This thickened planar conjunction slows movement through the\
  \ area to a crawl. Creatures moving through condensed ether (even incorporeal creatures),\
  \ move at only half their normal speed and can't take 5-foot steps. This slowing\
  \ of movement doesn't stack with solid fog or similar effects. Creatures within\
  \ condensed ether take a â€“2 penalty to Armor Class and on Reflex saves, and condensed\
  \ ether prevents effective ranged weapon attacks. Even magic rays and similar ranged\
  \ attacks suffer a 20% miss chance on attacks into or passing through condensed\
  \ ether. This miss chance is not based on concealment, and Blind-Fight, true seeing,\
  \ and similar effects do not reduce it."
