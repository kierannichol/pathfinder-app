description: "This clockwork device is powered by heatstones and seawater and can\
  \ turn a ship's oar with tireless mechanical strokes. When installed on a water\
  \ vehicle that uses muscle as a means of propulsion (see pages 180 and 184 of Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Ultimate Combat), a clockwork oar performs the function of one Medium rower.\
  \ A broken clockwork oar functions only half as well as an unbroken one, so two\
  \ broken clockwork oars are required to perform the function of one Medium rower.\n\
  For driving checks with a water vehicle powered with only clockwork oars, the driver\
  \ must attempt Disable Device or Knowledge (engineering) checks instead of the skill\
  \ checks listed in the vehicle's driving check entry in its stat block. (These checks\
  \ represent the sailor ensuring that all of the oars are moving in unison and without\
  \ impediment.) If a water vehicle is powered with one or more clockwork oars but\
  \ not solely with clockwork oars, the skills used for driving checks remain unchanged."
