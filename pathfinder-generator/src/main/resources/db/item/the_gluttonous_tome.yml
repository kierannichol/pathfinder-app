description: "Karzoug is not alone in his restless sleep of the ages. Zutha, The undead\
  \ lord of Gastash and Runelord of Gluttony saw the end in the stars just as his\
  \ compatriots did and prepared accordingly. To ensure his vile soul's return, the\
  \ runelord crafted a tome of leathered flesh, bound in bone, and inked in the blood\
  \ of a thousand slaves. The Gluttonous Tome was Zutha's opus—the result of a decade's\
  \ toil and his plan to rise from the ashes of Thassilon.\nDividing his masterwork\
  \ into three parts—each a potent artifact in its own right—the Runelord of Greed\
  \ secreted the means of his resurrection away in three of his farthest-flung holdings,\
  \ protected by the stewardship of his most devout servants. Thassilon's cataclysmic\
  \ end disrupted Zutha's hopes of a swift return, though, as his minions deserted,\
  \ died, or betrayed their master, resulting in the sections being scatted across\
  \ Avistan. For millennia, the potent abjurations protecting its pages saved the\
  \ parts of the Gluttonous Tome from destruction, with each having been lost and\
  \ rediscovered countless times. Throughout the centuries the evil tripartite book\
  \ has schemed to rejoin its pages.\nThe three portions of the text and the abilities\
  \ they confer are as follows:\nThe Kardosian Codex: Named for a sinister devourer\
  \ wizard who became its custodian a thousand years ago, this is the middle portion\
  \ of Zutha's masterpiece, a 4-inch-thick sheaf of bone-white blank parchment, indestructible\
  \ and completely impossible to mark. The Codex's power is a secret only told in\
  \ blood. Soaking its pages in fresh gore reveals it to be a spellbook containing\
  \ spells from the necromancy school. The only marring the book's pristine pages\
  \ suffer is the addition of more necromancy spells penned in blood. The book contains\
  \ every arcane necromancy spell of 1st to 7th level. Any necromancy spell prepared\
  \ from the Codex is cast at +1 caster level. The book also absorbs necromantic energy,\
  \ granting the bearer a +4 bonus on saves versus necromancy effects and immunity\
  \ to energy draining effects of any kind (such as from enervation or a vampire's\
  \ slam attack). Finally this section of the Gluttonous Tome includes a flesh golem\
  \ manual that re-scribes itself one year after it's used.\nThe Codex's hunger passes\
  \ to the bearer as well. Although he does not notice this, the bearer begins eating\
  \ far more than before and rapidly puts on weight, his physical form beginning to\
  \ emulate Zutha's in life.\nThe Bone Grimoire: This portion of the tome bears the\
  \ leathery flesh front-cover, twisted rib binding, and a hundred pages of blood-scripted\
  \ verse and grisly diagrams. Anyone who reads the entire text of strange runic code\
  \ (requiring 1 week of uninterrupted study and a DC 25 Decipher Script check) must\
  \ make a DC 20 Will save, or gain a +2 inherent bonus to Intelligence and begin\
  \ to take on traits of the undead (see below). Regardless of this save's result,\
  \ the bearer acquires a deep understanding of necromancy, gaining a permanent +4\
  \ insight bonus on all Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks involving this school\
  \ of magic. In addition, this section includes a flesh golem manual identical to\
  \ the one in the Kardosian Codex.\nAfter reading the Grimoire, the bearer's flesh\
  \ takes on a pale cast and, if he failed his Will save, his life force is slowly\
  \ replaced by necromantic unlife. After reading the entire text of the Bone Grimoire,\
  \ the bearer is no longer healed by positive energy, but rather harmed by it. Negative\
  \ energy now heals him. If the bearer channels energy (if he is a cleric for example)\
  \ he now channels negative energy. Only a wish or miracle reverses this condition.\n\
  The Black Book: This portion of the Gluttonous Tome consists of a charred flesh\
  \ back-cover and 100 pages of smoked skin scrawled with blood runes in Zutha's erudite\
  \ hand. Anyone reading the Black Book and keeping it on their person gains the ability\
  \ to rebuke or command undead as a cleric of his total character level. If the bearer\
  \ already possess this ability, he doubles the amount of undead he can control at\
  \ any one time. This section also includes a flesh golem manual, just like the others.\n\
  The Black Book corrupts its reader's mind and heart. Every day the GM should make\
  \ a secret Will save for the bearer— the DC starts at 10 but increases by +1 for\
  \ every consecutive successful save the bearer makes. Every failed save shifts the\
  \ bearer's alignment one step toward chaotic evil.\nRebinding the Gluttonous Tome:\
  \ If two or more portions of the Gluttonous Tome are brought within 10 feet of each\
  \ other, they surge together, tearing free from anyone holding them and bathing\
  \ a 30-foot radius spread with ghoulish green light. This light causes all living\
  \ creatures within it to become nauseated for 1d6 rounds (no save). The sections\
  \ mesh and meld, flesh knitting with flesh and bones grinding together. If two or\
  \ more individuals control a portion of the tome when they fuse together, the one\
  \ with the highest total character level gains control (determined randomly if there\
  \ is a tie). Two fused sections grant the bearer the effects of both parts and the\
  \ following spell-like abilities at a caster level equal to the bearer's HD:\nAt\
  \ will— detect undead, gentle repose\n3/day—empowered ray of enfeeblement, false\
  \ life\n1/day— bestow curse\nIf all three parts of the Gluttonous Tome are brought\
  \ together, their bearer is granted the benefits noted above as well as the following:\n\
  3/day—maximized vampiric touch, create undead\n1/day— create greater undead, waves\
  \ of exhaustion\nThe Gluttonous Tome is Zutha's phylactery, a slow-burning vessel\
  \ of hate that infests any who read it. It corrupts everyone it touches, offering\
  \ them great power over life and death, but at a secret price. Once the tome is\
  \ fully rejoined, its bearer is slowly seduced and devoured by Zutha, the Runelord\
  \ of Gluttony. The tome manifests an insidious, seductive intellect (see below),\
  \ which it uses to tempt its bearer to feats of greater and greater depravity. Zutha's\
  \ soul feeds on the necromantic power embraced by the bearer. Every month, the bearer\
  \ must make a DC 30 Fortitude save or gain a +1 inherent bonus to Intelligence (this\
  \ stacks with that bonus granted by the Bone Grimoire to a maximum gain up to Intelligence\
  \ 26) and permanently lose 1 point of Constitution. This reduction in Constitution\
  \ cannot be restored by mortal magic as long as the Tome is retained. Despite this\
  \ wasting away, the bearer becomes addicted to the necromantic power the tome grants,\
  \ and must make a DC 40 Will save to part with the book. Once the tome slays the\
  \ bearer, Zutha gains complete control of the body, which soon transforms into the\
  \ runelord's original, bloated, undead body, freeing him to wreak his evil upon\
  \ Golarion once more.\nThe Gluttonous Tome: Al LE; Int 26, Wis 20, Cha 23; speech,\
  \ telepathy; 120 ft. darkvision and hearing; Ego score 35.\nLesser powers: detect\
  \ magic at will, major image 1/day, 10 ranks in Bluff (total modifier +16), 10 ranks\
  \ in Knowledge (arcana) (total modifier +18).\nGreater powers: clairvoyance 3/day,\
  \ detect undead at will, fear 3/day."
