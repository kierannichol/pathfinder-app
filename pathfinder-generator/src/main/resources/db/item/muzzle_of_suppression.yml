description: "A muzzle of suppression hardly resembles the long-snouted devices often\
  \ equipped to dogs or other dangerous creatures. More mask than anything, this leather\
  \ garment sports an orange metallic ball that's inserted in the creature's mouth,\
  \ after which the mask's straps and chains are secured around the back of the creature's\
  \ head and neck. The muzzle can be strapped around a humanoid-shaped head (such\
  \ as that of a capramace) to negate the creature's ability to speak, mumble, or\
  \ make any noise at all, identical to the effect of a silence spell. Not even muffled\
  \ cries for help can pierce the barrier created by a muzzle of suppression. The\
  \ garment's keystone strap can only be opened by the creature that placed the muzzle\
  \ on its subject; other creatures attempting to disassemble the strap must succeed\
  \ at a DC 30 Disable Device check to do so. A dispel magic or knock spell can also\
  \ unlock a muzzle of suppression."
