description: "Surcease of Sorrows is a +4 adamantineimpact repositioning heavy mace\
  \ that resembles a simple, key-shaped walking stick of bone. A gift from Asmodeus\
  \ to the fledgling usher Barzahk—and subsequently purged of a devastating curse\
  \ by Pharasma—the humble-seeming weapon is a beloved sign of the usher's station.\n\
  Surcease of Sorrows can function as a chime of opening with unlimited charges. Three\
  \ times per day, it can be used to dismiss any sort of magical barrier or wall.\
  \ This functions as greater dispel magic, but affecting only abjuration spells and\
  \ spells whose names contain \"wall of,\" and it uses an attack roll with the weapon\
  \ in place of a caster level check. If the spell to be broken is affecting a specific\
  \ creature, the result of the attack roll to dispel it must equal or exceed the\
  \ target spell DC or the creature's AC, whichever is higher."
destruction: "Asmodeus must crush the mace with his bare hands, but only if Barzahk\
  \ is first slain."
