description: "This larger version of a tanglefoot bag entangles its target as normal\
  \ and requires a successful DC 20 Reflex saving throw to avoid being stuck to the\
  \ floor. In addition, it can affect Huge and smaller creatures, and has a range\
  \ increment of 60 feet. A creature that is glued to the floor can break free by\
  \ succeeding at a DC 30 Strength check or by dealing 25 points of damage to the\
  \ goo with a slashing weapon."
