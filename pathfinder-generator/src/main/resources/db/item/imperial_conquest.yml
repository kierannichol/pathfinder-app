description: "This strategy game, best played with an elaborate ebony board and intricate\
  \ ivory pieces, follows deceptively simple rules with great strategic depth. While\
  \ the game can be played with less expensive sets, only a suitably intricate and\
  \ well-crafted game set can generate the state of mind necessary to gain the tactical\
  \ benefits of the game. Imperial conquest is a great intellectual pursuit across\
  \ the breadth of the Padishah Empire, but the game has only recently begun to spread\
  \ through the Inner Sea region.\nUp to four people can play a game of imperial conquest,\
  \ which generally takes 1â€“2 hours (4d20+20 minutes). At the end of an uninterrupted\
  \ game, each player attempts a DC 20 Intelligence check, with success granting tactical\
  \ insights. For the next 8 hours, any character who succeeded at the Intelligence\
  \ check gains a +1 bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity; when two players\
  \ who succeeded at the Intelligence check flank the same enemy during this time,\
  \ the bonus on attack rolls from flanking increases by 1."
