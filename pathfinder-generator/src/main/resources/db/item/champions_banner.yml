description: "A champion's banner is a cloth flag or standard (typically 2 feet wide\
  \ and 4 feet long) meant to be carried and displayed on a lance, polearm, frame,\
  \ or staff. It has no effect unless it is mounted properly and a wielder is carrying\
  \ the object bearing it. It depicts the insignia or heraldic symbol of its wielder;\
  \ if the wielder has no such symbol, it depicts a heraldic lion.\nA character with\
  \ the challenge class feature carrying a champion's banner treats his class level\
  \ as 4 levels higher when determining the effect of his challenge ability. This\
  \ does not alter the number of times per day the wielder may use his challenge ability,\
  \ only the value of the bonuses it grants when he does so."
