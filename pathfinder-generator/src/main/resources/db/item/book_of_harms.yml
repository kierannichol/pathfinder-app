description: "The leather wrapping of this book is of an indeterminate type, and gives\
  \ off a faint and unpleasant scent, as of charred meat. The writing inside is in\
  \ a jagged hand, and many notes on the ash-smudged pages indicate its previous owner\
  \ sought ever more damaging magic. A glittering rune in the cover's center is shaped\
  \ vaguely like a lightning bolt."
