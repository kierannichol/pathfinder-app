description: "This elbow-length, heavy leather glove's fine embroidery is marred by\
  \ dozens of claw marks. Once per day on command, its wearer can gesture toward a\
  \ creature within 30 feet. When he does, a featureless silhouette of a bird of prey\
  \ appears, swoops toward the target, and performs a disarm or steal combat maneuver\
  \ (wearer's choice, CMB +16). The shadow falcon is a magical effect, not a creature,\
  \ and this action does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the hand wearing the\
  \ glove is empty, the shadow falcon brings the item to the wearer's hand. If the\
  \ gloved hand is occupied, the shadow falcon deposits the item on the ground in\
  \ an unoccupied space adjacent to the wearer. The shadow falcon then disappears."
