description: "This tiny hourglass is filled with blood-red sand. The sand flows only\
  \ one way and turning it to start the flow activates its magic. It grants a target\
  \ creature within 30 feet the following benefits for a limited time— freedom of\
  \ movement (as the spell), and suspends any and all of the following conditions:\
  \ blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, feebleminded,\
  \ insanity, nauseated, poisoned, sickened, and stunned. These effects are suspended\
  \ rather than dispelled; they resume when the hourglass is deactivated or expended\
  \ and this suspended time does not count toward the duration of the suppressed effect.\n\
  Ending the hourglass's effects is a swift action. The hourglass can be used for\
  \ up to 5 rounds in total before its magic is consumed. These rounds need not be\
  \ consecutive."
