description: "Carved from a piece of bone from the kind of animal it depicts, this\
  \ primitive charm can hold (but not cast) up to 3 levels of spells as a minor ring\
  \ of spell storing. When the bearer uses a polymorph effect or other ability to\
  \ transform into an animal that matches the animal the totem depicts (including\
  \ dire versions), it can use one of the spells stored within on itself as a swift\
  \ action. This spell must be able to target the bearer in its animal form. The bearer\
  \ does not need to be able to cast the spell contained within a spell totem in order\
  \ to use this item. When the bearer changes shape again—either by taking the form\
  \ of a different creature or reverting to its natural form— the spell cast from\
  \ the totem immediately ends, as though the duration had expired. Spell totems can\
  \ be crafted in the form of animals or magical beasts."
