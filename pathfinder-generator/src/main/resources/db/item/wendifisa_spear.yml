description: "Adorned with bone fetishes, feathers, leaves, and gnarled branches,\
  \ each of which carries its own significance, this +1 shortspear is often found\
  \ in the hands of the tribal Mwangi who serve the powerful spirits known as wendifaâ€”\
  \ the juju oracles. Each wendifisa spear (literally \"spear of those who serve the\
  \ wendifa\") is created alongside a specially crafted onyx gem. If this gem is within\
  \ 100 feet of the wielder and the wielder's hit points are reduced below 0, the\
  \ gem shatters. When the gem shatters, the wielder of the wendifisa spear is immediately\
  \ slain, and animates 1 round later as a juju zombie (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2\
  \ 291).\nIf the gem is held by anyone other than the spear's wielder when the wielder\
  \ is slain (and the gem shatters), the creature holding the gem gains 1d8 temporary\
  \ hit points, a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength, and a +1 bonus to its effective\
  \ caster level. These bonuses last 1 hour.\nAfter the onyx shatters, the weapon\
  \ is treated as a +1 shortspear."
