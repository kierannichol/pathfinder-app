name: "Scroll of Shrink Item"
description: "You are able to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within the size\
  \ limit) to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension (to about 1/4,000 the original\
  \ volume and mass). This change effectively reduces the object's size by four categories.\
  \ Optionally, you can also change its now shrunken composition to a clothlike one.\
  \ Objects changed by a shrink item spell can be returned to normal composition and\
  \ size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command from\
  \ the original caster. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this spell.\
  \ Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition ends the spell."
