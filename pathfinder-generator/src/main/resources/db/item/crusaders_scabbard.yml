description: "This scabbard of vigor prominently bears the symbol of Iomedae. Three\
  \ times per day, the scabbard can cast bless weapon on any weapon sheathed within,\
  \ but does so reluctantly on any weapon other than a longsword. While the user is\
  \ in combat, the scabbard hurls threats of righteous retribution in a loud, clear\
  \ voice as it attempts to demoralize opponents (Intimidate bonus of +7). The consciousness\
  \ within the crusader's scabbard is valorous and stridently condemns displays of\
  \ cowardice or dishonesty."
