description: "This elegant silk ribbon gleams like mithral and feels like polished\
  \ steel. When wrapped around the grip of a one-handed piercing or slashing melee\
  \ weapon for 24 hours, the ribbon's magic permanently merges with the weapon, reducing\
  \ the attack roll penalty incurred by a wielder who is smaller than the weapon's\
  \ intended wielder by 2 (to a minimum penalty of 0).\nIf the weapon is wielded by\
  \ a creature whose size matches that of the weapon's intended wielder, the weapon\
  \ is treated as a light melee weapon when determining whether it can be used with\
  \ Weapon Finesse, as well as with any feat, spell, or special weapon ability that\
  \ can be used in conjunction with light weapons. Once an effortless lace's abilities\
  \ have been conveyed to a weapon, the ribbon must remain attached to the weapon\
  \ or its effects end immediately, its magic is permanently lost, and it is reduced\
  \ to worthless cloth. Effects that would dispel the magic of the weapon or cause\
  \ the weapon to gain the broken condition (such as sundering) destroy the ribbon\
  \ as well."
