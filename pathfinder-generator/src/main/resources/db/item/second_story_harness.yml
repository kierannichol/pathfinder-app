description: "A second-story harness is a series of straps, trusses, and buckles that\
  \ can be worn over clothing or armor. A second-story harness allows the wearer to,\
  \ as a move action, secure herself in place on a vertical surface so that both her\
  \ hands are free. The wearer can remain in this position without needing to make\
  \ additional Climb checks, and does not lose her Dexterity bonus to AC as long as\
  \ she remains anchored. As long as the wearer is anchored in this way, she cannot\
  \ move and gains a +5 circumstance bonus on Climb checks made to avoid falling whenever\
  \ she takes damage. The wearer can release herself to start moving again as a move\
  \ action. A second-story harness costs 55 gp and weighs 3 pounds."
