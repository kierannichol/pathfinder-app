description: "The possessor activates this well-worn gold coin by rubbing it between\
  \ her thumb and forefinger while willing it to function. The false coin can be activated\
  \ only by creatures with the Psychic Sensitivity feat or the ability to cast psychic\
  \ spells. Once activated, the coin maintains a link to the creature that activated\
  \ it, and if passed along to someone else, it shares empathic cues about its new\
  \ possessor with the creature that activated it. This empathic link gives the activator\
  \ a +2 insight bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks against\
  \ the coin's current possessor. In addition, the possessor takes a –1 penalty on\
  \ saving throws against spells with the emotion, fear, or scrying descriptors cast\
  \ by the coin's activator. While activated, the coin appears nonmagical as though\
  \ protected by magical aura (Will DC 11).\nThe link between the activator and the\
  \ coin persists for 1 week, after which the coin loses all of its powers and becomes\
  \ a mundane coin."
