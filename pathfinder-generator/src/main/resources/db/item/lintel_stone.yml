description: "This heavy granite brick has no effect until it is held at the top of\
  \ a door, window, or similar portal and touched with a forked metal rod attuned\
  \ to serve as the focus component for a plane shift spell as a standard action.\
  \ Once activated in this manner, the lintel stone remains affixed to the portal,\
  \ in defiance of gravity, and cannot be removed for 1 minute. During this time,\
  \ creatures stepping through the opening must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be\
  \ shunted to the plane to which the metal rod is attuned. All travelers appear in\
  \ the same location, stepping out of another portal somewhere on the destination\
  \ plane (which might be a constructed doorway or a natural arch, as befits the destination\
  \ plane). Unlike with plane shift, the creature activating a lintel stone has no\
  \ control over the arrival point on the destination plane, although the portal is\
  \ usually in a similar area (such as an urban one, if activated in a city). One\
  \ minute after activation, the lintel stone disappears, reappearing among the possessions\
  \ of the creature that activated it, regardless of the current location or plane\
  \ of that creature. A lintel stone can be activated once per day."
