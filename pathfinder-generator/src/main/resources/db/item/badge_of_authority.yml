description: "As a standard action, the wielder of this solid metal badge can transform\
  \ its appearance into that of any badge or symbol of authority she legitimately\
  \ holds. Once per day, the wielder can present the badge as a standard action to\
  \ reduce the base speed of up to three creatures within 30 feet, as per hobble (Fortitude\
  \ DC 11 negates). If the wielder uses an Intimidate check to force a creature to\
  \ act friendly and that creature recognizes her as a legitimate authority, its attitude\
  \ doesn't change to unfriendly after 1d6Ã—10 minutes, and it doesn't report her to\
  \ local authorities."
