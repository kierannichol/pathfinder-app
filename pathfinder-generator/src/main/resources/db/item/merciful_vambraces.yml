description: "These vambraces are constructed of polished steel. When a paladin wears\
  \ these vambraces, engravings of the holy symbol of a paladin's deity and other\
  \ religious iconography mystically appear upon the metal's surface. Once per day,\
  \ when the paladin uses her lay on hands ability, she can choose to apply an additional\
  \ mercy to that use of lay on hands that she did not already select. She must be\
  \ of sufficient level to use that mercy."
