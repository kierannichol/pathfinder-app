description: "This rod functions as a +1 light mace and resembles the distorted femur\
  \ of some monstrous creature. Up to three times per day when the wielder damages\
  \ a creature with the rod, as a free action, the wielder can force the target to\
  \ attempt a DC 14 Will save. On a failure, the creature suffers a minor curse. The\
  \ wielder selects which of the following curses affects the target: –2 penalty to\
  \ Strength (target's Strength cannot be reduced below 1); –1 penalty on attack rolls,\
  \ saves, ability checks, and skill checks; or target has a 20% chance to begin each\
  \ round with the staggered condition. On a successful critical hit, the wielder\
  \ can inflict two distinct curses if the target fails its save. Otherwise, a target\
  \ can be subject to only one curse at a time.\nCurses inflicted from the rod of\
  \ minor curses last for 5 minutes. They can also be removed with any spell that\
  \ can remove the effects of bestow curse."
