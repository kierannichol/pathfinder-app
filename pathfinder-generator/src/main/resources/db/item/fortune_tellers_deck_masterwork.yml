description: "This deck of illustrated cards is used by those in tune with the spirit\
  \ world to predict the futureâ€”and by charlatans to take money from the gullible.\
  \ A common deck only has simple drawings on simple wooden plaques. A quality fortune-teller's\
  \ deck usually consists of wooden plaques with painted color images; it is suitable\
  \ as a focus for the augury spell, and provides a +1 circumstance bonus on Profession\
  \ (fortune-teller), Profession (medium), and similar Profession checks. A masterwork\
  \ fortuneteller's deck may be wood, ivory, or even metal, with painted or carved\
  \ images, and is often highlighted with gold inlays or tiny gems; it has all the\
  \ benefits of a quality deck, except it provides a +2 circumstance bonus on the\
  \ listed skill checks."
