description: "This rugged black leather scabbard is wrapped in jet black chains that\
  \ allow it to easily be hung from one's belt. A scabbard of pain grants it bearer\
  \ knowledge of advanced torturing techniques used by depraved cultists of the Midnight\
  \ Lord. It grows or shrinks to fit any bladed weapon sized for a Medium or Small\
  \ creature. Three times per day, the bearer can declare that he is attempting to\
  \ deliver a painful strike with a melee attack. If the attack hits, the opponent\
  \ must succeed at a DC 11 Fortitude save or be affected by ray of sickening. The\
  \ bearer can expend one use of the scabbard's painful strike as an immediate action\
  \ to affect himself with the ray of sickening effect and voluntarily fail the saving\
  \ throw. Doing so allows the bearer to reroll a failed saving throw against a mind-affecting\
  \ effect."
