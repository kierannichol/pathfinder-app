description: "This ancient Thassilonian diadem is crafted in the shape of an enraged\
  \ face with an enormous ruby in the center. The gem allows its wearer to channel\
  \ her rage into pure flame. While under the effects of rage, as a standard action\
  \ the wearer can expend 1 round of rage or raging song to cause the ruby to release\
  \ a beam of fire like a miniature hellfire flume. If the wearer succeeds at a ranged\
  \ touch attack against a creature or object within 30 feet, the beam deals 2d6 points\
  \ of fire damage to that target. If the wearer instead expends 3 rounds of rage,\
  \ bloodrage, or raging song, the beam becomes a 60-foot line instead, dealing 5d6\
  \ points of fire damage to all creatures and objects along that line (Reflex DC\
  \ 14 negates)."
