description: "This wooden box contains a popular Osirian board game called senet,\
  \ a game which has been played since the earliest days of Osirion's First Age. Ten\
  \ pawns (two sets of five) carved from petrified wood are stored within the box.\
  \ The top of the box serves as the game board, with three rows of 10 squares each.\
  \ Two characters can play the game against each other, or a single character can\
  \ play against the game itself, which animates to play against its opponent.\nWhile\
  \ a mundane senet game emulates the journey into the afterlife, a game of fortunate\
  \ passing exerts genuine influence over a player's fateâ€”it's said that a winner\
  \ the protection and favor of the gods of Ancient Osirion. A game of senet takes\
  \ 30 minutes to play. At the end of this time, the players make opposed Intelligence\
  \ checks; whoever wins the check wins the game. If playing against the game itself,\
  \ the game has an effective Intelligence bonus of +4.\nWinning a game of senet with\
  \ the game of fortunate passing (either against another player or the game itself)\
  \ charges one of the game's pawns with magic. For the next 24 hours, the winner\
  \ gains a +2 luck bonus on skill checks and saving throws against fear and death\
  \ effects. Once used, a pawn loses all magic, becoming a normal playing piece. A\
  \ game of fortunate passing has 10 pawns; once all 10 pawns have been used, the\
  \ item becomes a mundane senet game set."
