description: "Four sunstone-embedded sunflowers adorn this golden diadem. The first\
  \ daylight diadems were created far to the east by Keleshite worshipers of Sarenrae,\
  \ but their usefulness in battling undead has seen them become quite widespread.\
  \ In the often overcast Sodden Lands, these magical diadems offer an additional\
  \ comfort to those who enjoy the sun as well, serving as a constant reminder that\
  \ regardless of the cloud cover above, the sun remains steadfast in its guardianship\
  \ over the day.\nAs part of a standard action taken to channel positive energy,\
  \ the wearer can activate a daylight diadem by removing a flower to extend the range\
  \ of her channel positive energy ability to 60 feet. The removed flower is consumed\
  \ upon use.\nThe wearer can also release the full brilliance of her daylight diadem\
  \ in a single burst. With a command word, she causes all of the sunflowers remaining\
  \ on the daylight diadem to be consumed and shed bright light in a 60-foot radius.\
  \ This light counters or dispels any darkness spells of 4th level or lower and is\
  \ treated as natural sunlightâ€”the effect persists for a number of rounds equal to\
  \ double the number of sunflowers consumed. While within the area of this light,\
  \ all weapons are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction\
  \ and deal an additional 1d6 points of damage to evil creatures. This additional\
  \ damage results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being\
  \ reduced by resistance to energy. Creatures that are specifically hindered or harmed\
  \ by sunlight take double this amount (2d6 points of damage per hit).\nOnce all\
  \ four flowers have been used, a daylight diadem can no longer be activated, but\
  \ each time the crown is exposed to the light of the rising sun, a new sunflower\
  \ (to a maximum of four sunflowers) blooms on the diadem."
