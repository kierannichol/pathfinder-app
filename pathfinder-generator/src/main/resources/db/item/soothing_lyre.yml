description: "This ornate string instrument looks as if it were crafted from gold\
  \ and silver but is as light as hollow wood. It grants a +2 circumstance bonus on\
  \ Perform (string instruments) checks. When the proper chords are struck (a standard\
  \ action), the bearer can target all creatures within a 30-foot-radius burst with\
  \ a lullaby spell (DC 13) that lasts as long as the bearer concentrates plus up\
  \ to 13 rounds.\nAdditionally, once per day as a standard action, she can strum\
  \ the lyre to affect up to nine creatures with mass cure light wounds, as per the\
  \ spell. If the character has the bardic performance class feature, instead of this\
  \ effect, she can perform a soothing performance once per day, even if she is not\
  \ of sufficient level to normally have access to that ability (this still requires\
  \ 4 rounds of continuous performance and still uses her bard level as the caster\
  \ level). A bard who can use soothing performance and who plays the lyre as part\
  \ of her performance increases her effective caster level for that ability by 1."
