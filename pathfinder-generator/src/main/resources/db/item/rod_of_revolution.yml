description: "This variant rod of rulership (Ultimate Equipment 183) looks like a\
  \ castoff piece of wood from a lumber mill. Originating from the earliest insurrections\
  \ of G alt, these rods have become symbolic among rebel leaders in the struggling\
  \ nation. A rod of revolution's wielder can activate the device as a standard action\
  \ to incite rebellious urges in creatures within 120 feet. The wielder can incite\
  \ a number of creatures totaling 300 Hit Dice, but creatures with a Wisdom score\
  \ of 12 or higher can attempt a DC 16 Will save to negate the effect. Incited creatures\
  \ gain the benefits of the rage spell, but adhere to only the most basic commands\
  \ issued by the wielder (such as directions about where to move and who to attack).\
  \ The rod can be used for 500 total minutes before it crumbles to dust. These minutes\
  \ need not be continuous."
