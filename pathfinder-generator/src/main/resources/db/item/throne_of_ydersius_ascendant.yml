description: "This huge, ornate throne, carved from white marble and inlaid with flickering,\
  \ smoking, multicolored spirals of serpentstone, is uncomfortably tall and thin\
  \ for most humans, as it is designed to seat a high priest of the serpentfolk. While\
  \ seated upon the throne, a divine caster who worships Ydersius may use a spell\
  \ slot or exchange any prepared divine spell (including domain spells) of 3rd level\
  \ or higher to cast dispel magic. Once per day, a divine caster of sufficient level\
  \ may instead cast greater dispel magic in place of a spell of 6th level or higher.\
  \ This ability is in most other ways identical to the spontaneous casting of clerics\
  \ and druids (see the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook), but may also be employed by\
  \ antipaladins, inquisitors, oracles, or other divine casters faithful to Ydersius.\
  \ The throne bestows one permanent negative level on any creature that sits upon\
  \ it, other than divine casters who worship Ydersius. This negative level remains\
  \ as long as the non-sentient or heretical creature sits upon the throne and disappears\
  \ when the throne is vacated. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way\
  \ (including by restoration spells) while the throne is occupied."
destruction: "The Throne of Ydersius Ascendant can only be destroyed by anointing\
  \ it with the blood of Ydersius, followed by a successful mage's disjunction spell\
  \ cast on the throne by a cleric of an Azlanti deity."
