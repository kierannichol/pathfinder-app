description: "A shadow urn is a simple clay pot that has been imbued with ashes that\
  \ have passed through the hourglass of shadows. When a shadow urn is broken, the\
  \ greater shadow that is contained within is released. This shadow is free-willed,\
  \ but it generally simply attacks the nearest creature, seeking to sate its hunger\
  \ for life energy."
destruction: "A shadow urn is consumed when it is used. Each urn contains only one\
  \ greater shadow. If the urn is broken in an area of full natural sunlight, the\
  \ shadow within the urn is destroyed instead of being released."
