description: "These magical sets of clothing can take many forms. In Segada, notable\
  \ examples range from the ornate costumes of the Festival of Flowers to the flamboyant,\
  \ birdlike costumes of the Waning Light Festival. When a wearer of a festival garment\
  \ dances, he can get onlookers into a festive, celebratory mood. A wearer of a festival\
  \ garment can attempt a Perform (dance) check instead of a Diplomacy check to influence\
  \ the attitude of a humanoid creature, but only if the creature's initial attitude\
  \ is unfriendly or better. In addition, if the wearer is at a festival or celebration,\
  \ he gains a +5 competence bonus on Perform (dance) checks."
