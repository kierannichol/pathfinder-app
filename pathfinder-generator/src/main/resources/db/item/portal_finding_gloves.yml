description: "These tight-fitting, black leather gloves have reinforced fingertips\
  \ marked with arcane sigils. The gloves prickle slightly when in the presence of\
  \ portals to other planes. The wearer gains a +5 bonus on Perception and Knowledge\
  \ (planes) checks to identify portals and planar connections and can automatically\
  \ learn where such connections lead by touching the portal or a connected area (such\
  \ as a wall) within 10 feet of it."
