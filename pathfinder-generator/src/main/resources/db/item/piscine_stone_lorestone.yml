description: "Weathered carvings of constellations, suns, and planets cover the surface\
  \ of this ancient, melon-sized stone sphere.\nThis smooth gray stone is constantly\
  \ damp, even in the driest climate. Its deeper levels tell of ichthyological biology\
  \ and rituals designed to thwart aquatic aberrations. A harmonized possessor (DC\
  \ 30) can breathe underwater and use detect aberration at will.\nThis stone is currently\
  \ held in the River Kingdoms by a pack of ratfolk (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 231)\
  \ , who value it as an icon of their patron deity, Hanspur."
