description: "Pazuzu's weapon is the Scepter of Shibaxet, a staff of black metal with\
  \ a large hook at its tip. The scepter functions as a rod of enemy detection that\
  \ can be used any number of times per day. If Pazuzu presents the scepter as a standard\
  \ action, all creatures within 30 feet who view it become panicked for 1d6 rounds\
  \ unless they succeed at a DC 23 Will save (this is a mindaffecting fear effect).\
  \ Once per day, Pazuzu can use the Scepter of Shibaxet as a rod of cancellation\
  \ (this does not deplete or harm the scepter). As a standard action, he can call\
  \ the scepter to his hand from any distance, even across planar boundaries. As an\
  \ immediate action, Pazuzu can transform the scepter into a +5 anarchic keen unholy\
  \ longsword or return it to its normal shape. None of its other powers can be used\
  \ in sword form."
destruction: "The Scepter of Shibaxet can be broken by a redeemed demon lord if the\
  \ regenerating towers of Shibaxet are already destroyed."
