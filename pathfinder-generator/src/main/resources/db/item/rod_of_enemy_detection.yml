description: "This device pulses in the wielder's hand and points in the direction\
  \ of any creature or creatures hostile to the bearer of the device (nearest ones\
  \ first). These creatures can be invisible, ethereal, hidden, disguised, or in plain\
  \ sight. The detection range is 60 feet. If the bearer of the rod concentrates for\
  \ a full round, the rod pinpoints the location of the nearest enemy and indicates\
  \ how many enemies are within range. The rod can be used to pinpoint enemies three\
  \ times each day, each use lasting up to 10 minutes. Activating the rod is a standard\
  \ action."
