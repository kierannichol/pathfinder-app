description: "This fetish is a small charm made of bound sticks and ornamental stones\
  \ worn around the neck on a thong. Wearing it toughens your body and flesh, giving\
  \ you an enhancement bonus to your natural armor bonus from +1 to +3, depending\
  \ on the kind of fetish, similar to an amulet of natural armor. in the creation\
  \ of one of these amulets, a portion of your spirit is bound up in it so that once\
  \ worn, if removed, you gain a negative level until this fetish or another ekujae\
  \ fetish is worn again. This negative level can be permanently removed and your\
  \ connection with the fetish broken with a restoration spell or a remove curse spell\
  \ immediately followed by a successful Dc 15 fortitude save. if you fail the save,\
  \ you must receive another remove curse before you can attempt another save."
