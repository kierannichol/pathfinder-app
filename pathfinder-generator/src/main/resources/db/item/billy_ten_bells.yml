description: "Bearing a marked resemblance to an anthropomorphic wind chime, this\
  \ complicated arrangement of strings, sticks, and bells is hung from a ceiling or\
  \ branch and has a purse or money-pouch deep inside. The trick is to silently steal\
  \ a coin from Billy Ten-Bells, as the slightest movement will set the bells ringing.\
  \ Veteran thieves sometimes decorate Billy with scraps of stolen clothing for good\
  \ luck. Training with Billy Ten-Bells requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 20 Sleight\
  \ of Hand check. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on\
  \ Sleight of Hand checks to pick pockets. This bonus lasts for 24 hours or until\
  \ you fail a Sleight of Hand check."
