description: "This sphere originates within the Negative Energy Plane as either a\
  \ naturally occurring phenomenon or a normal sphere of annihilation empowered or\
  \ even damaged by beings there. The sphere of bleeding snowflakes radiates a cold,\
  \ dense fog of black energy extending 60 feet into its surrounding area, infusing\
  \ the region with negative energy, and dealing 4d6 negative energy damage (as a\
  \ cleric's channeled energy) and 1 permanent negative level per round to everything\
  \ within 60 feet. While spells such as death ward may negate the energy's ill effects,\
  \ any who die as a result of these effects, or who die by other means within the\
  \ sphere's affected radius, cannot be returned to life by anything short of true\
  \ resurrection, wish, or miracle."
destruction: "The sphere of bleeding snowflakes can be destroyed by sending it through\
  \ one of the portals on the Positive Energy Plane leading into the heart of a star."
