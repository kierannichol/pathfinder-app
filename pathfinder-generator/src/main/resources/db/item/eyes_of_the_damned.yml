description: "These two clear crystal lenses fit directly over the wearer's eyes.\
  \ When the wearer activates the lenses by speaking a prayer to Asmodeus as a standard\
  \ action, her eyes appear to be replaced by orbs of impenetrable blackness. She\
  \ gains a gaze attack until the beginning of her next turn. The wearer can choose\
  \ a creature within 30 feet on which to gaze as part of the action of activating\
  \ the lenses. The target creature must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be affected\
  \ as per vision of Hell for 5 minutes, except that the effect is a phantasm, rather\
  \ than glamer, and it follows the affected creature rather than affecting an area.\
  \ An affected creature continues to see the terrifying hellscape for the duration,\
  \ regardless of the creature's location.\nAs with vision of Hell, devils and all\
  \ lawful evil creatures are immune to the effect caused by this item. The eyes of\
  \ the damned can be activated up to three times per day. Both lenses must be worn\
  \ by the same wearer for the magic item to take effect."
