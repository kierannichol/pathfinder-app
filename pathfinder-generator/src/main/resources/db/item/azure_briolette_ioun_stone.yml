description: "This pear-shaped ioun stone sparkles in a brilliant blue color. Whenever\
  \ a creature fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting spell cast by this ioun\
  \ stone's user, the user gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the targeted\
  \ creature's Charisma bonus (minimum 0) until the start of the user's next turn.\
  \ These temporary hit points do not stack. The user doesn't gain temporary hit points\
  \ from a creature that voluntarily fails its saving throw against the spell.\nResonance:\
  \ This stone allows the user to pick up on psychic resonance from corpses. So long\
  \ as the user has carried the ioun stone continuously for at least 24 hours, the\
  \ first three corpses touched by the user each day babble residual psychic impressions\
  \ into the bearer's mind. This functions as the grave words spell, except that only\
  \ the user can hear the corpse speak."
