description: "Created from the bodies of certain frogs whose poisons induce potent\
  \ hallucinations and delusions, these mummified husks are variously cited as the\
  \ invention of either grippli druids or an unusually cunning boggard priest-king.\
  \ Regardless, their powers are a boon to any caster favoring mental manipulation\
  \ and alteration.\nThree times per day while casting a targeted mind-affecting spell\
  \ that allows a Will save, a caster holding a fetish of the frog queen can lace\
  \ the spell's energies with a magical poisonous essence. Instead of affecting the\
  \ target's mind directly, the altered spell attacks through the victim's body as\
  \ a psychotropic toxin, requiring the victim to use his Fortitude modifier in place\
  \ of Will for the purposes of any Will saving throws the spell normally allows.\n\
  An altered spell is considered a poison effect, with the following conditions."
