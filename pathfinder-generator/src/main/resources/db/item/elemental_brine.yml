description: "This alchemical substance is produced from saltwater from the Plane\
  \ of Water. It has no effect on natives of that plane, but grants unusual properties\
  \ when consumed by creatures from the Material Plane.\nAny creature with the water\
  \ affinity racial trait, including undines, that drinks elemental brine finds her\
  \ innate magic bolstered. If the creature is a sorcerer with the elemental (water)\
  \ bloodline, she casts her bloodline powers and spells at +1 caster level. If the\
  \ creature is a cleric with the Water domain, she treats her Wisdom modifier as\
  \ 2 points higher for Water domain powers and spells. This does not grant early\
  \ access to level-based powers; it only affects powers that she could already use\
  \ without this trait. This benefit lasts 24 hours.\nCreatures with the aquatic subtype\
  \ that imbibe elemental brine become immune to poison, although poisons active when\
  \ the brine is imbibed still run their course. If the creature dwells in saltwater,\
  \ it also becomes undetectable by scent for the same duration. Both of these effects\
  \ last 24 hours.\nFinally, elemental brine can be used as a splash weapon with a\
  \ range increment of 10 feet. While it has little effect on most creatures (other\
  \ than soaking them in salty water) when used in this way, a bottle of elemental\
  \ brine is quite lethal if it's flung at a creature with the fire subtype. On a\
  \ direct hit, a creature with the fire subtype takes 2d6 points of damage, and creatures\
  \ with the fire subtype in adjacent squares take 1d4 points of damage. In addition,\
  \ a direct hit against a creature with the fire subtype creates a unique interplay\
  \ between elemental brine's salt and water and the creature's flames, making the\
  \ target more conductive and thus more susceptible to electrocution. Anytime the\
  \ target would take electricity damage within the next minute, it must succeed at\
  \ a DC 20 Reflex save or take 1-1/2 times as much electricity damage as normal."
