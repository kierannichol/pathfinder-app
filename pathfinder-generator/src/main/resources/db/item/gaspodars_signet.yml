description: "Gaspodar's signet ring still encircles the severed finger of this long-dead\
  \ king of Cheliax. Clipped from his hand almost a century ago by an unknown assassin,\
  \ both ring and finger are preserved in a small glass jar of honey that's sealed\
  \ with solder. The ring itself has a thick gold band, etched into the inside of\
  \ which is an Azlanti phrase that reads, \"Hail Aroden, Bringer of the Age of Glory.\"\
  \ The ring's large bezel is engraved with the seal of Cheliax.\nThe craftsmanship\
  \ of the signet is so intricate that it's extremely difficult to create a duplicate\
  \ capable of convincing those familiar with the original. A creature who has closely\
  \ observed Gaspodar's signet receives a +4 circumstance bonus on any Appraise skill\
  \ check to detect a forgery of the relic."
