description: "Song'o halflings often use these cloaks to evade larger creatures in\
  \ the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse. The wearer of an elusion cloak gains a +5 competence\
  \ bonus on Stealth checks against creatures of at least one size category larger\
  \ than she is. In addition, once per day as a free action when the wearer fails\
  \ a saving throw against a fear effect, she can gain the benefits of expeditious\
  \ retreat for 5 rounds or for as long as she is affected by the fear effect, whichever\
  \ is shorter."
