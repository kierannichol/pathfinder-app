description: "Leshys and other plant creatures have to be wary of hungry herbivorous\
  \ animals. A dose of animal repellent makes a plant creature smell unappetizing\
  \ for 24 hours. Animals do not attempt to consume a plant creature coated in animal\
  \ repellent if there are other food sources available, and in combat prefer to use\
  \ natural attacks that are not bite attacks against such a creature if they can.\
  \ Animal repellent counts as a strong scent, allowing creatures with the scent ability\
  \ to detect it at a greater range (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 304). Animal repellent\
  \ does not work on ghorans with the delicious racial trait. Crafting this item requires\
  \ a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
