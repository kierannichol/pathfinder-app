description: "Black feathers adorn the tips of this ebony +1 composite longbow (+5\
  \ Strength bonus). The bow gives off the faint scent of brimstone when the string\
  \ is drawn back.\nThree times per day as a swift action, the wielder of an angelfall\
  \ bow can imbue the next arrow she fires that round with the bow's inherent raging\
  \ energy. On a hit, the attack deals damage as normal and acts as a trip combat\
  \ maneuver to knock the target prone, treating the result of the wielder's attack\
  \ roll as the combat maneuver check result. If the target is flying, it must immediately\
  \ succeed at a DC 25 Fly check to stay aloft or plummet to the ground.\nOnce per\
  \ day when the wielder of an angelfall bow would be affected by a spell or spell-like\
  \ ability with the light descriptor, she can attempt an immediate dispel check (using\
  \ the caster level of the bow) to counter the effect. This manifests as a pulsating\
  \ darkness emerging from the bow and swallowing the light."
