description: "Spells and spell-like effects targeted on you are turned back upon the\
  \ original caster. The abjuration turns only spells that have you as a target. Effect\
  \ and area spells are not affected. Spell turning also fails to stop touch range\
  \ spells. From seven to ten (1d4+6) spell levels are affected by the turning. The\
  \ exact number is rolled secretly."
