description: "These clothes are of poor quality, the fabric little more than sack\
  \ cloth, often patched and mended many times over. A peasant's outfit consists of\
  \ a loose shirt and baggy breeches, or a loose shirt and skirt or overdress. Cloth\
  \ wrappings are used for shoes, causing significantly more wear on the feet."
