description: "The Scepter of Ages can be wielded as a +4 heavy mace with a critical\
  \ threat range of 18–20. In addition to the damage this weapon deals, any creature\
  \ struck by the scepter ages a number of years equal to the damage taken. On a critical\
  \ hit, not only does the scepter deal greater damage, but the victim ages 2 years\
  \ for every point of damage taken. Creatures aged in this manner might have their\
  \ physical ability scores reduced; consult Table 7–2 on page 169 of the Core Rulebook\
  \ for the effects of aging on common humanoids. For the wide range of unlisted humanoids\
  \ and non-humanoids this aging might affect, GMs should use their judgment, general\
  \ knowledge, and creature descriptions to decide how the effects of aging apply\
  \ on a race-byrace basis. GMs looking for a quick way to approximate the ages of\
  \ minor opponents should alter Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution by –1 for every\
  \ 10 years aged and consider +40 years to be a creature's maximum age. Any creature\
  \ aged to greater than its maximum age immediately dies. Constructs, outsiders,\
  \ and undead are immune to the effects of aging. The mental abilities of those affected\
  \ by this form of aging do not increase. Creatures that gain abilities dependant\
  \ on their age gain these abilities as normal (though, at the GM's discretion, these\
  \ abilities might not be immediately usable). The spell regenerate restores 1 year\
  \ of premature aging for every hit point it heals. Creatures killed by aging can\
  \ only be restored by true resurrection, miracle, or wish, but even these spells\
  \ do not heal aging, returning the target to life only 1 year younger than his maximum\
  \ age.\nIn addition to its use as a weapon, the Scepter of Ages can open a portal\
  \ through time. To do this, the scepter's bearer must spend 10 minutes precisely\
  \ aligning the delicate mechanisms within the artifact's head to the exact dates\
  \ she wishes to travel to. This requires the bearer to make either a DC 30 Knowledge\
  \ (history) check to program a precise date or a DC 30 Wisdom check to travel to\
  \ a general period. The bearer can rush through calibrating the scepter, activating\
  \ it in 1 minute, but doing so increases the associated DCs by +10. Regardless of\
  \ whether or not this check is successful, a 5-foot-wide glowing tear in time opens\
  \ within 15 feet. This rift cannot be used as a weapon or to destructive effect.\
  \ What time the passage opens to is determined by whether the bearer succeeds at\
  \ the check (opening a portal to the desired time) or fails (opening a portal to\
  \ the incorrect time, determined by how significantly he failed, as shown on the\
  \ Accidental Time Travel Results table on page 43). The time beyond the portal cannot\
  \ be viewed and can only be discovered by passing completely through. The rift remains\
  \ open for 1 minute before closing. What creatures or conditions lie beyond the\
  \ portal are determined by the GM (see the Ages of Golarion table on page 43 for\
  \ examples of different times on Golarion)."
destruction: "Adhering to laws beyond those of this reality, The Scepter of Ages cannot\
  \ be destroyed, only carried to a time beyond the reach of modern users. Some say\
  \ this has happened dozens of times, yet still the scepter has been rediscovered\
  \ ages later, unearthed among ancient ruins or by geological upheavals."
