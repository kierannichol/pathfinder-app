description: "This malevolent-looking doll is made out of cheap rags and embroidery\
  \ thread and is stuffed with straw or sawdust. A creature holding or carrying the\
  \ doll takes a â€“4 penalty on saving throws against witch hexes. Alternatively, if\
  \ the doll is stuffed with the hair of a creature, any witch holding the doll increases\
  \ the DC of her hexes by +2 when using the hexes against that creature. A doll used\
  \ in this way does not cause the witch to take a penalty on her saving throws."
