description: "This leather harness has four clockwork arms attached to it. When it's\
  \ worn, the arms are positioned behind the wearer's shoulders, with one pair slightly\
  \ higher than the wearer's and the other set slightly lower, and they spring to\
  \ life and move under the wearer's control. The arms lack the agility to aid in\
  \ casting spells, crafting, picking locks, or completing any other fine motor skill,\
  \ and can't use items placed in their hands. However, each arm's hand can hold any\
  \ item the wearer could hold in one hand, allowing the wearer to have up to six\
  \ total pieces of equipment ready for use at once. Once per round as a free action,\
  \ the wearer can switch which items are held by which hands. Weapons wielded by\
  \ the arms can't be used for most attacks but can take advantage of a foe's distraction\
  \ or lowered guardâ€”each clockwork arm wielding a weapon can make one attack of opportunity\
  \ per round, and all such attacks are treated as off-hand attacks."
