description: "This sketchbook has up to 100 pages full of scribbled notes and hasty\
  \ sketches about monsters. When the user focuses on a particular page, the text\
  \ and pictures start moving, revealing more details about the creature.\nThe user\
  \ must spend 10 minutes researching a particular type of monster to get any benefit\
  \ from the almanac. If the user is trained in the appropriate Knowledge skill to\
  \ identify a monster, he gets a +2 circumstance bonus on his check. He can attempt\
  \ a Knowledge check to identify a creature despite being untrained in the appropriate\
  \ skill (but without the +2 bonus) as long as thecheck's DC is no higher than 15."
