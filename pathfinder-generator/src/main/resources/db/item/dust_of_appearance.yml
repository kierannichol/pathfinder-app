description: "This powder appears to be a very fine, very light metallic dust. A single\
  \ handful of this substance flung into the air coats objects within a 10-foot radius,\
  \ making them visible even if they are invisible. It likewise negates the effects\
  \ of blur and displacement. In this, it works just like the faerie fire spell. The\
  \ dust also reveals figments, mirror images, and projected images for what they\
  \ are. A creature coated with the dust takes a –30 penalty on its Stealth checks.\
  \ The dust's effect lasts for 5 minutes.\nDust of appearance is typically stored\
  \ in small silk packets or hollow bone tubes."
