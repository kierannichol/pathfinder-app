description: "A copycat siphon is a simple-looking metal tube that can be connected\
  \ to two flasks, bottles, beakers, or vials of standard size. Three times per day\
  \ while two containers are connected to a copycat siphon, the user can speak the\
  \ item's command word while pouring a liquid (including magical liquids like potions\
  \ or elixirs) into one of the containers. In doing so, the other container attached\
  \ to the siphon also fills up with an exact replica of the poured liquid, appearing\
  \ to all normal senses (including touch, smell, taste, and sight) as if it were\
  \ an exact copy of the original liquid. However, when imbibed, the copy acts only\
  \ as fresh water, and has none of the other effects of the original liquid. The\
  \ created liquid registers to detect spells as if it were the original liquid (as\
  \ the magic aura spell, Will DC 14)."
