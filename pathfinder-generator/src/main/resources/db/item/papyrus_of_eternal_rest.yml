description: "This 12-inch-long scroll is scribed on papyrus that has been anointed\
  \ with holy water. Written on the scroll's face in Minkaian are three to four pictographs\
  \ that bid the reader a peaceful rest. A papyrus of eternal rest grants its owner\
  \ a gaze attack with a range of 30 feet whenever she wields the item in one hand\
  \ and clearly presents it before her. Haunts and incorporeal undead must succeed\
  \ at a DC 12 Will save or take 1d6 points of damage and become sickened for 1 round.\
  \ A successful Will save prevents the sickened condition and reduces the damage\
  \ by half. Haunts can't avoid looking at a papyrus of eternal rest, but incorporeal\
  \ undead can as normal.\nThe user of a papyrus of eternal rest cannot wield both\
  \ a weapon and the papyrus in the same hand, and the hand presenting the papyrus\
  \ cannot be used to complete the somatic components of spells. Because of the item's\
  \ light weight, however, wielding a papyrus of eternal rest does not count as having\
  \ an occupied hand for the purpose of the Fencing Grace, Slashing Grace, or Starry\
  \ Grace feats, a swashbuckler's precise strike deed, and similar effects."
