description: "When rubbed vigorously into the skin, this potent red liniment enhances\
  \ a Tiny or smaller creature's ability to make full use of its size and mobility.\
  \ Applying a dose of liniment is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity\
  \ (similar to applying an oil). A creature under the effects of the liniment no\
  \ longer provokes attacks of opportunity for moving through threatened squares or\
  \ for entering a larger creature's square. The balm lasts for 5 minutes before its\
  \ effects wear off. A newly created bottle of balm holds 5 doses."
