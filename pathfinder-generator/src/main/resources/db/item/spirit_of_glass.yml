description: "This fiber is composed of tiny strands of razor-sharp glass laced with\
  \ alchemical elements. Anyone who touches it finds her skin irritated by countless\
  \ tiny abrasions. Though it causes only minor discomfort, it opens the skin enough\
  \ for poison to seep through, allowing injury poisons to be delivered to the affected\
  \ creature as if they were contact poisons. The abrasions last for 1 hour or until\
  \ cleaned and treated with a successful DC 10 Heal check (a full-round action).\
  \ Poisoners sometimes place spirit of glass in a target's wardrobe or amid her personal\
  \ effects along with a rag soaked in poison. Spirit of glass is often mistaken for\
  \ lint or loose cloth, though it and the abrasions it causes can be identified with\
  \ a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check or DC 17 Heal check. Spirit of glass\
  \ can be used only once before it is expended."
