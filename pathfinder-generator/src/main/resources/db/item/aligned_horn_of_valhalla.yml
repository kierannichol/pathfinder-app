description: "This horn of Valhalla is crafted for service to a cause, whether lofty\
  \ or profane. Though not intelligent, it has an alignment as determined by the Intelligent\
  \ Item Alignment table on page 533 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook, and summons\
  \ barbarians of that alignment. A character who sounds the horn but is more than\
  \ one step away from the horn's alignment is attacked by the summoned barbarians.\
  \ The horn's minions also turn against an owner who gives them an order in strong\
  \ opposition to their ethos, such as ordering lawful good barbarians to attack helpless\
  \ villagers."
