description: "The wearer of this rough, gray cloak can, as a move action, grasp the\
  \ garment's edge and cause it to harden. The wearer can use the hardened edge it\
  \ as if it were a masterwork light wooden shield. Using the cloak in this fashion\
  \ imposes no armor check penalty, but does impose a 5% arcane spell failure chance.\
  \ The edge of the cloak can be dropped and made pliant again as a free action. Shield\
  \ enhancement bonuses and special abilities can be added to the cloak as if it were\
  \ a masterwork shield."
