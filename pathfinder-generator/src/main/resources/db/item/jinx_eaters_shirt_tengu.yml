description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis shirt is stitched with dozens of symbols\
  \ meant to attract bad luck, including bloodshot eyes and tengu skulls. Whenever\
  \ an ally within 60 feet is subject to a curse, hex, jinx, or effect that would\
  \ force her to roll multiple times for the same check and take the worse result,\
  \ a tengu wearer can attempt to eat the effect as an immediate action. The wearer\
  \ of the shirt attempts a caster level check with a DC of 11 + the effect originator's\
  \ caster level (or HD for an ability that has no caster level). If the attempt is\
  \ successful, the wearer suffers the effect instead of the original target, and\
  \ the wearer gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the effect's caster\
  \ level or the target's HD, whichever is lower. These temporary hit points last\
  \ for 1 minute. A jinx eater's shirt can successfully redirect an effect originating\
  \ from a given creature only once each day, but otherwise it has no limitation on\
  \ usage."
