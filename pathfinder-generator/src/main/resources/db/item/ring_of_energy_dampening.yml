description: "When the wearer is about to take acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage,\
  \ this band of braided copper and silver writhes like a snake. It provides resistance\
  \ 5 to acid, cold, electricity, and fire. The wearer can expend one use of mythic\
  \ power as an immediate action when taking damage of one of these types to upgrade\
  \ the resistance to immunity for that attack or effect only. Also, once per day\
  \ when the wearer takes damage of one of these types, the wearer can grant resistance\
  \ 5 to the energy type damaging him to all allies within 20 feet. This resistance\
  \ lasts for 1 minute."
