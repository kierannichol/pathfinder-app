description: "This 2-foot-long metal tube has right angles at each end with mirrors\
  \ inside; if you look in one end, you can see out the other end, allowing you safely\
  \ peer over obstacles, around corners, or into small spaces your head where wouldn't\
  \ fit. When using a periscope, the end of the tube counts as a Diminutive object,\
  \ making it much less likely that an observed creature notices you; if you have\
  \ total concealment from the creature except for the end of the periscope, use the\
  \ tube's Diminutive size modifier on your Stealth check instead of your own size\
  \ modifier. Distortion from the mirrors gives you a â€“4 penalty on Perception checks\
  \ while looking through the periscope. Though the tube is fairly sturdy (hardness\
  \ 5, 2 hit points), the mirrors inside are fragile (hardness 1, 1 hit point), and\
  \ any damage that gets through the tube's hardness applies to the tube and the mirrors."
