description: "This thick leather cloak is charred and blackened around the edges and\
  \ smells faintly of soot. Once per day, when subject to an effect that deals fire\
  \ damage, the wearer can spend an immediate action while obscured by the flames\
  \ to become invisible, leaving behind an illusory pile of ashes and bones, as if\
  \ he had been slain by the fire effect. The wearer's invisibility and his illusory\
  \ remains last for 5 rounds or until the wearer attacks any creature. Creatures\
  \ that study or interact with the ashes can make a DC 11 Will save to disbelieve\
  \ the illusion, though this does not end the invisibility effect."
