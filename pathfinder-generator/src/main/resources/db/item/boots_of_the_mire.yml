description: "These soft leather boots confer several powers upon the wearer. First,\
  \ he is granted the power to walk on water in swampy environments, provided the\
  \ water is no deeper than 5 feetâ€”this effectively lets him move through swampy terrain\
  \ and mud at no cost to his speed. He leaves no tracks or other signs of his passage\
  \ as long as he's in swampy terrain, and never becomes uncomfortable or wet from\
  \ rain, fog, or other forms of non-freezing precipitation. Finally, the boots grant\
  \ him a +2 resistance bonus on all Fortitude saves made against poison and disease."
