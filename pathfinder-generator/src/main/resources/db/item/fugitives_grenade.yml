description: "These small grenades are made from hollowed eggshells filled with assorted\
  \ powders and reagents and inscribed with magical glyphs. When broken, a fugitive's\
  \ grenade creates a 10-foot-radius cloud that lasts for 2 rounds. This cloud is\
  \ otherwise identical to a fog cloud. A single smoke tendril in the center of the\
  \ cloud forms a solid-feeling rope, 20 feet long, that functions as a rope trick\
  \ spell. When the smoke cloud dissipates, so does the smoke rope, though the rope\
  \ trick 's extradimensional space remains for its full duration. Once the smoke\
  \ rope disperses, any creatures inside the extradimensional space must jump or climb\
  \ out by other means. A fugitive's grenade may be thrown as a ranged touch attack\
  \ with a range increment of 10 feet."
