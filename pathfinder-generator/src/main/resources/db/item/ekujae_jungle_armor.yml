description: "Made of densely compacted jungle leaves by the Ekujae jungle elves of\
  \ the Mwangi, this +1 leaf armor has been delicately inscribed with elven script.\
  \ Prized by druids who venture out of the jungle, this armor counts as a plant for\
  \ the purposes of an entangle spell, allowing the spell to originate from the position\
  \ of the wearer.\nEkujae jungle armor is uniquely suited to jungle terrain, keeping\
  \ out the elements and granting the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks\
  \ in such terrain. This armor also allows the wearer to ignore the effects of a\
  \ hot climate as if under the effects of endure elements."
