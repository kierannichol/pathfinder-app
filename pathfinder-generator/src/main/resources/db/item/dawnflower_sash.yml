description: "This long strip of red Qadiran fabric is wrapped around the wearer's\
  \ waist or head several times and held in place by an ankh-shaped clasp of red gold.\
  \ The wearer is protected as if by endure elements, but only in warm environments.\
  \ If the wearer unwraps the sash to its full length and holds the clasp in her hand,\
  \ she can use feather fall once per day, briefly leaving behind a trail of pleasant\
  \ red-gold light as bright as a torch that lasts for 1 round.\nIf Sarenrae is the\
  \ wearer's patron, the wearer can use the sash to cast cure light wounds once per\
  \ day on command. The wearer can trigger this ability as an immediate action if\
  \ reduced to –1 hit points or fewer, though thereafter the sash must be recharged\
  \ by placing it in strong sunlight for 8 continuous hours. As a swift action, the\
  \ wearer can cause the clasp to shine as brightly as a torch or cease this illumination;\
  \ the light is warm, feels like sunlight, and is bright enough to make sun-fearing\
  \ creatures slightly uncomfortable but not so bright as to cause them harm."
