description: "Among the varied items crafted by the earliest Storm Kindlers were these\
  \ potent rods. Very few Storm Kindler's rods have been recovered, and today's Storm\
  \ Kindlers suspect that many of these potent magical rods have been lost forever,\
  \ for when they are wielded by those not of the Storm Kindler sect, they grow fragile.\
  \ The current generation of Storm Kindlers have been unsuccessful in determining\
  \ how their predecessors created these powerful minor artifacts, making the discovery\
  \ of existing Storm Kindler's rods all the more important to the society.\nA Storm\
  \ Kindler's rod acts as a +4 shocking burst spell storing club, but its spell storing\
  \ capabilities can store only druid spells. While carried in one hand, the rod grants\
  \ its wielder immunity to cold and electricity. The rod's other powers are as follows."
destruction: "A Storm Kindler's rod can be destroyed as easily as a typical +4 shocking\
  \ burst spell storing club after it has been carried for at least 24 hours by someone\
  \ not part of or affiliated with the Storm Kindlers."
