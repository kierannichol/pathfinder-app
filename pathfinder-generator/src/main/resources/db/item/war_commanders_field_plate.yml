description: "This immaculate +2 champion field plate is commonly used by military\
  \ commanders in Lastwall, Mendev, and Taldor. A sturdy metal bracket is built onto\
  \ the back of the armor, located just under the shoulder blades; if the wielder\
  \ has personal heraldry, this slot can hold a banner or flag bearing that heraldry\
  \ (such as a cavalier's banner).\nIf the wearer of the war commander's field plate\
  \ takes to the battlefield as an army commander (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign\
  \ 234), he gains the Hold the Line boon if he prominently displays his heraldry.\
  \ If the wearer already possesses this boon, he instead gains an additional +1 bonus\
  \ on Morale checks as army commander."
