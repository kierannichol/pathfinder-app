description: "The wearer of this helmet can see underwater. Drawing the small lenses\
  \ in compartments on either side into position before the wearer's eyes activates\
  \ the visual properties of the helm, allowing her to see five times farther than\
  \ water and light conditions would allow for normal human vision. (Weeds, obstructions,\
  \ and the like block vision in the usual manner.) If the command word is spoken,\
  \ the helm of underwater action gives the wearer a 30-foot swim speed and creates\
  \ a globe of air around the wearer's head and maintains it until the command word\
  \ is spoken again, enabling her to breathe freely."
