description: "This quarterstaff can unfold two sails on each side to become a simple\
  \ glider that takes up no more space than its wielder. With a successful DC 10 Fly\
  \ check as a full-round action, any Small or Medium creature holding the unfurled\
  \ glider can glide downward at a 45-degree angle in a straight or diagonal line\
  \ at a speed of 60 feet per round. Unfolding the wings is a full-round action. The\
  \ wing staff imposes a â€“4 penalty on Fly checks because of its poor maneuverability\
  \ and cannot be used to fly at other angles. A character may gain an advantage in\
  \ an appropriate terrain tile during a pursuit (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue\
  \ 142), such as taking a shortcut by gliding over a forest. A wing staff's sails\
  \ have AC 9 and hardness 0, and take double damage from acid and fire attacks. The\
  \ sails have 20 hit points; if they take 9 points of damage, the sails and the staff\
  \ gain the broken condition, and the sails don't function until repaired. When the\
  \ sails are furled, a wing staff functions as a normal quarterstaff and can be enhanced\
  \ as normal (this doesn't affect the sails), though if the staff gains the broken\
  \ condition, the sails are also broken."
