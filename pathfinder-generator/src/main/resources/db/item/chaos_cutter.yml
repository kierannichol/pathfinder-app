description: "This narrow, sleek sloop is made of an iridescent metal that glows a\
  \ pale white and is as hard as adamantine. It boasts a single mast with two translucent\
  \ planar sails and can plow across the tumultuous metaphysical seas of the Maelstrom\
  \ to reach any plane in the Great Beyond. When not in the Maelstrom, the vehicle\
  \ acts in all regards as a heavy chariot that hovers 5 feet off the ground instead\
  \ of standing on a pair of wheels.\nWhen piloted in the Maelstrom, a chaos cutter\
  \ can fly with a maximum speed of 100 feet and acceleration of 30 feet. Any creature\
  \ can sail and direct a cutter using its rudder with a successful DC 10 Profession\
  \ (sailor) check, which can be attempted untrained. Success at this check also counts\
  \ as success at a Wisdom check to change the direction of gravity (and thus the\
  \ cutter's trajectory); creatures on a cutter treat gravity as normal while in the\
  \ vehicle.\nA chaos cutter is reinforced with an imperceptible field that protects\
  \ against planar energies. While on a cutter, a passenger does not need to eat,\
  \ drink, or breathe, as though it were of the outsider type. Additionally, all creatures\
  \ on the vehicle are affected by planar adaptation (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's\
  \ Guide 236) and protection from chaos.\nA chaos cutter has 175 hit points and is\
  \ 15 feet long."
