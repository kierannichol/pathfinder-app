description: "This elixir turns its imbiber fiery red, making it easier to pass as\
  \ an efreeti. Unscrupulous efreet can sell fireskin elixir to guests who have been\
  \ barred from citizen-only districts and must rely on disguises. Fireskin is highly\
  \ addictive. Many once-savvy merchants have fallen into destitution as they scrambled\
  \ to maintain efreet favor and secure a steady supply of the drug. This item can\
  \ be crafted with a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
