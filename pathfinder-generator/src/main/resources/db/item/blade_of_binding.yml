description: "This +1 greatsword is decorated with a lock motif. On a successful hit\
  \ with the sword against a creature that is the wielder's size or smaller, the wielder\
  \ can attempt to start a grapple as a free action that doesn't provoke an attack\
  \ of opportunity. If the wielder succeeds at the grapple, the sword's blade transforms\
  \ into a metal chain and wraps around the target, giving the wielder a +5 bonus\
  \ on further grapple checks against the target. If the target escapes the grapple\
  \ or the wielder decides to release the target from the grapple, the chain reverts\
  \ to sword form (with the wielder holding the handle).\nThe wielder can also let\
  \ go of the chain's handle while grappling or pinning the target; if he does so,\
  \ the chain remains in place and the target gains the entangled condition (Escape\
  \ Artist DC 20 to slip free, break DC 28, hardness 10, 10 hit points, concentration\
  \ DC 17 to cast spells while entangled). Another creature can grab the chain's handle\
  \ as a standard action and will it to revert to sword form as a swift action, which\
  \ releases the bound creature. If the chain is destroyed, it reverts to sword form\
  \ and the weapon gains the broken condition."
