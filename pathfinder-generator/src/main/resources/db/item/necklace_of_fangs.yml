description: "The collected vampire fangs that make up a necklace of fangs emit a\
  \ strong warding aura against vampires. A creature wearing a necklace of fangs and\
  \ brandishing a mirror, holy symbol, or other object that is revolting to a vampire\
  \ (a standard action) keeps the vampire at bay as usual, but the Will save for the\
  \ vampire to overcome its revulsion and function normally during subsequent rounds\
  \ is DC 27, rather than DC 25."
