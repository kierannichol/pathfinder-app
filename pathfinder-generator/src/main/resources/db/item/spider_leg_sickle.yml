description: "This wickedly curved sickle is cast in the form of a segmented spider's\
  \ leg. It has the same statistics as a normal sickle and can trip opponents, but\
  \ deals piercing damage rather than slashing damage. The leatherwrapped handle contains\
  \ a hollow recess that can hold a single dose of poison. Filling the reservoir is\
  \ a full-round action that carries the usual risks of poisoning yourself. Once filled,\
  \ the reservoir keeps the blade saturated and viable for up to 2 hours. The first\
  \ successful attack made with the spider-leg sickle during this time administers\
  \ and expends the dose of poison. Mog-Lathar's deacons carry masterwork versions\
  \ of these weapons. The cult uses blue whinnis poison, and within the radius of\
  \ the dreamstone 's effects the unconsciousness effect may trigger lucid dreaming."
