description: "This rod is valued by treasure hunters and miners alike, for it pulses\
  \ and hums in the wielder's hand in the proximity of metal. As the wearer aims the\
  \ rod, the pulsations grow more noticeable as it points to the largest mass of metal\
  \ within 30 feet. However, the wielder can also concentrate on a specific metal\
  \ or mineral. If the specific mineral is within 30 feet, the rod points to any places\
  \ it is located, and the rod wielder knows the approximate quantity as well. If\
  \ more than one deposit of the specified metal or mineral is within range, the rod\
  \ points to the largest cache first. Each operation requires a full-round action."
