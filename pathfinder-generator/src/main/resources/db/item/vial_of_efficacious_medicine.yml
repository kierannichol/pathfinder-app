description: "This bulbous bottle is crafted of smoked glass and causes any liquid\
  \ contained within to take on a significantly darker cast and twinkle with motes\
  \ of beautiful white light. A vial of efficacious medicine can hold a single dose\
  \ of an alchemical remedy, such as antitoxin or antiplague. Loading a remedy into\
  \ the vial is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. When an alchemical\
  \ remedy is imbibed or applied from the vial, any alchemical bonus it grants on\
  \ saving throws or checks or to AC or CMD increases by 2. Treat this increase as\
  \ an enhancement bonus. In addition, the user is healed of 1d8+5 points of damage.\
  \ A vial of efficacious medicine can be used up to three times per day."
