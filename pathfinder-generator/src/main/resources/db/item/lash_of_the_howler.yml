description: "The lash of the howler is a +1 vicious scorpion whip tipped with quills\
  \ torn from a howler's mane. Each time a creature takes damage from the lash of\
  \ the howler, it must succeed at a DC 14 Reflex save or a quill breaks off and lodges\
  \ in its flesh. The whip instantly sprouts a new quill to replace the one lost.\
  \ The quill leaves the target sickened until it is removed. Removing a single quill\
  \ from a creature requires a DC 15 Heal check made as a full-round action. For every\
  \ 5 by which the check is exceeded, one additional quill can be removed. On a failed\
  \ check, a quill is still removed but the process deals 1d4+1 points of damage to\
  \ the victim."
