description: "The alchemists of Nex have found several uses for the toxic residue\
  \ left over from their massive ooze cultivating experiments, including a variety\
  \ of items known collectively as slime grenades. These ceramic ovoids are filled\
  \ with caustic sludge and capped with a stone plug. You can throw a slime grenade\
  \ as a splash weapon with a range increment of 5 feet. A successful ranged touch\
  \ attack coats the target with green slime, dealing 2d6 points of acid damage to\
  \ the creature. If the target is wearing wooden or metal armor or wielding a wooden\
  \ or metal shield, a slime grenade eats through the material on a hit, dealing 3d6\
  \ points of acid damage to the equipment and ignoring the items' hardness. Creatures\
  \ in the splash radius of a slime grenade take no damage, but any wooden or metal\
  \ armor or shields they are wearing take 1d6 points of acid damage (ignoring hardness).\
  \ Affected creatures can attempt DC 15 Reflex saves to halve the damage dealt to\
  \ their equipment."
