description: "These thick brass and leather bracers allow the wearer to tear through\
  \ bone and muscle like paper. Once per day, as part of a melee attack, the wearer\
  \ can activate the bracers to inflict a horrific injury on an opponent. If the attack\
  \ hits, the target must make a DC 14 Will save. If the save fails, the Wand reduces\
  \ the target's Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution (wearer's choice) by â€“6. This\
  \ penalty cannot reduce the target's ability score below 1. The injury heals over\
  \ time, reducing the penalty by 1 for each day that passes since the time of the\
  \ injury, and is immediately removed by heal, regenerate, restoration, or any magic\
  \ that can break a curse."
