description: "Horseshoes of crushing blows grant an enhancement bonus on attack and\
  \ damage rolls made with hoof attacks; this bonus varies based on the item's price.\
  \ Alternatively, as described for the amulet of mighty fists, they can grant hooves\
  \ melee weapon special abilities so long as they can be applied to unarmed attacks.\
  \ Horseshoes of crushing blows cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus\
  \ special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +5. Horseshoes of crushing blows\
  \ are crafted as sets of four, with each shoe in the set bearing the same enhancements.\
  \ All four shoes must be worn by the same animal to be effective.\nHorseshoes of\
  \ crushing blows may be crafted out of special materials, gaining the usual benefits.\
  \ For purposes of pricing, they count as a single one-handed weapon weighing 4 pounds\
  \ (for example, adamantine horseshoes of crushing blows would cost an additional\
  \ 3,000 gp). The materials needed to make cold iron horseshoes of crushing blows\
  \ add no extra costs in and of themselves, but enhancing cold iron horseshoes of\
  \ crushing blows increases the price by the usual 2,000 gp."
