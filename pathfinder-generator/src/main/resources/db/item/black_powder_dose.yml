description: "Black powder is the key explosive component within a firearm that enables\
  \ it to function, but in larger amounts this alchemical material can be quite destructive\
  \ on its own as well. A single dose of black powder is enough to power a single\
  \ shot from most one-handed and two-handed firearms, while 10 doses are required\
  \ to fire a cannon. Black powder is often stored and transported in kegs (which\
  \ hold 100 doses), but in this quantity the powder itself becomes dangerous. Exposure\
  \ to fire, electricity, or a misfire explosion causes black powder to explode—a\
  \ single keg that explodes in this manner deals 5d6 points of fire damage to anyone\
  \ within a 20-foot burst (DC 15 Reflex half). Storing black powder in a powder horn\
  \ protects the powder from explosion."
