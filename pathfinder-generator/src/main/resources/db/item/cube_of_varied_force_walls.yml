description: "This cube functions exactly like a cube of force except that each wall\
  \ of the cube can be activated independently and can even have different effects.\
  \ For example, one wall can block living matter, another wall can block magic, and\
  \ a third can keep out gases, while the other sides are open without any protection.\
  \ Activating each wall costs the price of activating that effect for an entire standard\
  \ cube of force â€”for instance, one wall against magic and one wall against living\
  \ matter cost a total of 7 charges per minute."
