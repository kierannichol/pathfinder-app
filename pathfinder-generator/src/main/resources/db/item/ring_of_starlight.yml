description: "This smooth mithral ring glimmers with light, and a close look reveals\
  \ the reflection of a starry night sky within the silvery metal. The wearer of a\
  \ ring of starlight can cause portions of her body or items in her possession to\
  \ glow with colorful light, as per faerie fire, by waving the hand adorned with\
  \ the ring over the item or body part as a swift action. This glow lasts for 1 hour,\
  \ until dismissed as a free action, or until the ring is removed. This duration\
  \ need not be used all at once, but must be used in 10-minute increments. (Each\
  \ time an increment of duration is used, the wearer can choose the portion of her\
  \ body or item in her possession that glows.) In addition, wearing the ring allows\
  \ the caster to use dancing lights on command three times per day as a standard\
  \ action."
