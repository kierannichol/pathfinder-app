description: "An amentum is a long leather thong that attaches to a standard javelin.\
  \ Before throwing, the amentum is wound about the javelin's shaft. You then throw\
  \ the javelin while gripping the amentum, imparting spin on the weapon and greatly\
  \ improving its range. Attaching an amentum to a javelin is a move action, and winding\
  \ it is a full-round action. Javelins can be stored with amenta already wound about\
  \ them. A javelin wound with an amentum is considered a martial weapon."
