description: "A creature coated with this glittering golden dust can interact with\
  \ any one item or object as if she had successfully used the Use Magic Device skill\
  \ to emulate a class feature or race (if the exact result of the check matters,\
  \ treat the character's result as a 25). If the user of the dust does not mentally\
  \ select the intended item or object while coating herself with the dust, the magic\
  \ of the dust applies to the first eligible object she encounters. She can apply\
  \ the result of this automatic check when dealing with the item or object for 1\
  \ hour after exposure to the dust."
