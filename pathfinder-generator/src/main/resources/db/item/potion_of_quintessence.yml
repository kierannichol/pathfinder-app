name: "Potion of Quintessence"
description: "You draw forth the idealized image of the target creature or object,\
  \ masking any flaws or damage. An injured or ill creature appears healthy, and a\
  \ damaged object or one with the broken condition appears intact. However, a corpse\
  \ masked by quintessence remains obviously dead, and a completely destroyed object\
  \ can't be made to seem whole. This illusion has visual and tactile components.\
  \ Careful examination of or handling the target grants a saving throw to disbelieve,\
  \ but casual observation does not. Using a broken object for its intended purpose\
  \ automatically reveals the deception. Appraise checks to assess the value of an\
  \ object affected by quintessence estimate the value as an item of its type in perfect\
  \ condition, unless the appraiser disbelieves the illusion."
