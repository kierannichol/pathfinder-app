description: "This +1 human bane seeking repeating heavy crossbow is carved from whalebone\
  \ decorated with green and gold lacquer, with fittings, lever, and bow of gilded\
  \ steel. On a successful hit against any creature who has just struck the wielder\
  \ with an attack within the previous round—whether with a melee, ranged, or natural\
  \ weapon, or a spell that requires an attack roll—ammunition fired from a crossbow\
  \ of retribution wracks the target with shooting pains that impose a –4 penalty\
  \ on attack rolls, skills checks, and ability checks for 7 rounds. On a successful\
  \ DC 14 Fortitude save, the penalty only lasts for 1 round. A target who worships\
  \ the same god as the wielder takes a –2 penalty on its saving throw."
