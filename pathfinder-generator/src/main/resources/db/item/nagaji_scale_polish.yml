description: "This small clay urn contains a scintillating paste which works like\
  \ imbue with spell ability, except the spell effect is not limited to cleric spells.\
  \ Any caster may casts spells into the jar. The creature that applies the paste\
  \ to its scales (a standard action) gains the ability to cast the imbued spells\
  \ (assuming it has enough Hit Dice and the requisite ability scores). Only a reptilian\
  \ creature (such as a dragon or a humanoid with the reptilian subtype) can use the\
  \ polish to cast spells."
