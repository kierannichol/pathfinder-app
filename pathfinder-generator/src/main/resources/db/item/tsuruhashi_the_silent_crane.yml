description: "The cross-guard and tines of this +2 adamantine sai are crafted of a\
  \ mysterious red metal, adorned with grinning skulls. The haft is wrapped with delicate\
  \ white crane feathers. Only a handful of tsuruhashi are known to exist, each one\
  \ crafted as a silent killer. The weapon grants a +1 bonus to the DC of Fortitude\
  \ saves made against an assassin's death attack or ninja's assassinate ability.\
  \ In addition, while executing such an attack, the wielder of a tsuruhashi may cast\
  \ silence upon his victim as a swift action. This ability can be used once per day\
  \ and affects only the victim of the attack."
