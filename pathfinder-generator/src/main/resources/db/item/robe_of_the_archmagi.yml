description: "This normal-appearing garment is attuned to one of three types of alignment.\
  \ It can be white (01–45 on d%, good alignment), gray (46–75, neither good nor evil\
  \ alignment), or black (76–100, evil alignment). To most wearers, the robe offers\
  \ no powers or has no effects unless the wearer's alignment doesn't match that of\
  \ the robe (see below). Only an arcane spellcaster can fully realize this potent\
  \ magic item's powers once the robe is donned. These powers are as follows."
