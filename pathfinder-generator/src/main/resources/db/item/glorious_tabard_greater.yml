description: "This sleeveless white tabard, worn over armor or other clothing, prominently\
  \ bears the symbol of the Glorious Reclamation and can be used as a divine focus\
  \ by members of the Glorious Reclamation who are followers of Iomedae. Once per\
  \ day, the wearer of a lesser glorious tabard can activate the tabard to gain a\
  \ +2 sacred bonus to her AC and on saving throws for 10 minutes. Both bonuses apply\
  \ only against attacks made or effects created by outsiders with the evil subtype\
  \ or creatures with an evil aura.\nA greater glorious tabard bears the symbol of\
  \ the Glorious Reclamation in gold. It has all the powers of a lesser glorious tabard\
  \ but can be used twice per day. In addition, whenever a greater glorious tabard\
  \ is activated, all longswords within 20 feet shed light as per a torch and ignore\
  \ the DR of evil creatures (except DR/epic) for 3 rounds. When a greater glorious\
  \ tabard is used as a divine focus to cast a spell, the wearer does not need any\
  \ material components that cost more than 5 gp.\nA glorious tabard functions only\
  \ for wearers who are both members of the Glorious Reclamation and followers of\
  \ Iomedae."
