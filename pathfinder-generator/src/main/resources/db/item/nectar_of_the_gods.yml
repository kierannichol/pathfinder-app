description: "This fragrant mead is made from the purest honey gathered from sunny\
  \ meadows, mixed with rare herbs in the moonlight, and fermented in earthen jars.\
  \ Consuming nectar of the gods is a standard action that restores 1d4+1 uses of\
  \ mythic power to a mythic creature (up to the creature's maximum). If a non-mythic\
  \ creature consumes this drink, it works like the heroism spell, lasting for 1 day.\
  \ A jar contains only a single draft of this potent beverage."
