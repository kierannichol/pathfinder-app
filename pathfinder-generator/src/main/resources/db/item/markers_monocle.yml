description: "A solid gold band encircles this intricate convex glass lens. Three\
  \ times per day as a standard action, the wearer can attempt an Appraise check against\
  \ a creature within 60 feet (DC = 10 + target's Hit Dice + target's Wisdom bonus).\
  \ With a successful check, the wearer knows the amount of currency the creature\
  \ is carrying, as well as the number of valuable objects (with a price greater than\
  \ 20 gp) the target carries (though the wearer doesn't know which items qualify,\
  \ or the exact value of the objects).\nIn addition, once per day, the wearer of\
  \ a marker's monocle can mark one creature with a melee touch attack, allowing up\
  \ to 3 allies within 30 feet to track the marked creature for 30 minutes, as if\
  \ the wearer's allies had the scent ability."
