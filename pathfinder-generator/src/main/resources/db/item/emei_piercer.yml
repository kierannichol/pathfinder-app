description: "This weapon is used to augment unarmed martial techniques. It consists\
  \ of an 8- to 10-inch-long, dual-pointed steel spike set on swivels and mounted\
  \ on a ring, so that it can be spun around at high speeds when slipped over the\
  \ wielder's ring finger. The ring prevents the wielder from being disarmed and turns\
  \ unarmed strikes into piercing attacks."
