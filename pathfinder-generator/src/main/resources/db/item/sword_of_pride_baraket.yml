description: "Although known as the Sword of Pride, Baraket appears to be nothing\
  \ more than an elegant basket hilt made of glass or highly polished crystal with\
  \ no blade, as the deadly length of this +5 spell storing speed rapier is invisible.\
  \ Baraket grants its wielder a +5 bonus on Bluff checks made to feint, so long as\
  \ his opponent cannot see invisible items. Additionally, on a critical hit, the\
  \ sword casts weird upon the target and all of that creature's allies within 30\
  \ feet.\nThe Swords of Sin were crafted to serve the runelords of Thassilon. In\
  \ modern times, however, these runelords lie dead or dormant. With no lords to serve,\
  \ the weapons of their champions lie dormant as well, reducing each to a +2 weapon\
  \ that retains any special abilities detailed on page 469 of the Core Rulebook,\
  \ but no other properties. The only way to awaken one of the blades is to restore\
  \ its runelord master to active life or have some other legitimate ruler take up\
  \ its master's mantle (the weapon determines what is considered legitimate). The\
  \ swords can detect such restorations and flare to full power immediately, demanding\
  \ their wielder seek out the restored runelord and swear eternal fealty.\nBaraket\
  \ woke for a few brief moments along with its master, then returned to dormancy\
  \ as Xanderghul was murdered. Although Xanderghul was immediately reborn in a specially\
  \ prepared simulacrum in the Temple of the Peacock Spirit, much of his power and\
  \ presence was diminished by the trauma of death and rebirth. As a result, though\
  \ Xanderghul is now technically active, Baraket remains dormant. Its link to Xanderghul\
  \ exists, but only in a form akin to a hazy, partially remembered dream. If a character\
  \ handles Baraket, the sword functions as dormant, but the character nonetheless\
  \ has a distinct feeling of being watched from afar. In this adventure, handling\
  \ the Sword of Sin without using the runewarded gauntlets should be unsettling but\
  \ relatively safe. This does not remain the case in the next adventure, as Xanderghul's\
  \ influence over the sword slowly grows."
destruction: "Each of the Swords of Sin can be destroyed merely by being commanded\
  \ to break. That command, however, must come from the rightful runelord of the nation\
  \ and school of magic associated with the blade."
