description: "This +1 kusarigama (Ultimate Combat 132) makes a shrill whistling sound\
  \ whenever it is used in combat. Once per day as a standard action, the wielder\
  \ of Dancing Wasp can whirl the weapon above his head as a full-round action to\
  \ summon a giant wasp (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 275). The wasp appears in the air\
  \ above the wielder's head and follows the wielder's mental commands to the best\
  \ of its ability as long as the user continues to twirl the weapon (requiring a\
  \ standard action each round), to a maximum of 5 rounds, after which the wasp vanishes."
