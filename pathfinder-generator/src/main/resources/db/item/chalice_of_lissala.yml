description: "The bowl of this elegant golden chalice resembles seven overlapping\
  \ feathered wings, while the stand is shaped like a coiled snake. The chalice is\
  \ inlaid with green gems that form spiky runes.\nThis large golden chalice glitters\
  \ and sparkles alluringly whenever a creature capable of using enchantment magic\
  \ is within 30 feet of it. While holding the Chalice of Lissala in hand, a spellcaster\
  \ increases her caster level for spells and spell-like abilities of the enchantment\
  \ school by 4 and increases the DC to resist them by 4. When the chalice's bearer\
  \ casts a spell of the enchantment school against targets with spell resistance,\
  \ she can roll her caster level check twice and use the better result. If a target\
  \ creature is normally immune to the enchantment spell (such as a mindless or undead\
  \ creature with a mind-affecting spell), the bearer can affect the creature as though\
  \ it weren't immune, though in this case the spell uses her normal caster level\
  \ and spell DC.\nAdditionally, the Chalice of Lissala grants its bearer a +5 competence\
  \ bonus on Charisma-based checks."
destruction: "If all of Lissala's remaining worshipers perish or renounce their faith,\
  \ the Chalice of Lissala twists upon itself, turning into a worthless piece of blackened\
  \ metal."
