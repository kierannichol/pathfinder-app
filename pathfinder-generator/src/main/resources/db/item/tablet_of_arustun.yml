description: "This ornate stone tablet measures 10 inches on each side and is approximately\
  \ 1 inch thick. It can store up to 3 levels of spells, per a minor ring of spell\
  \ storing, except each spell retains the caster level at which it is cast into the\
  \ tablet. When a spell is stored in the tablet, writing appears on the stone as\
  \ if carved onto the surface. While holding the tablet, a user can decipher and\
  \ activate spells from it exactly as though it were a scrollâ€”the user must meet\
  \ the requirements for activating a spell from a scroll, and a scroll mishap might\
  \ occur if her caster level is lower than that of the spell."
