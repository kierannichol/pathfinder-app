description: "This short, wide net is covered in barbed loops and slipknots. It works\
  \ like a typical net, except it has the trip weapon special feature. If you entangle\
  \ an opponent and hold the trailing rope, on your turn in place of a melee attack\
  \ you may make a combat maneuver check to trip against that opponent; if you succeed,\
  \ you may trip your opponent or deal 1 point of piercing damage to it. The concentration\
  \ DC to cast while entangled in a snag net is 17 + the spell's level. The Escape\
  \ Artist DC to escape a snag net is 22."
