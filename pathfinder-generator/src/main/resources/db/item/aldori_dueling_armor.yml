description: "These +2 armored coats are traditionally worn by the Aldori swordlords\
  \ of Brevoy. The wearer of this armor gains a +2 enhancement bonus on initiative\
  \ checks and a +2 circumstance bonus on attacks of opportunity if the attacks are\
  \ made with an Aldori dueling sword. Once per day when the wearer of Aldori dueling\
  \ armor is the target of a melee attack, she can make an attack with an Aldori dueling\
  \ sword as an immediate action. If the result of her attack roll is higher than\
  \ that of her attacker, the wearer of Aldori dueling armor parries the attack and\
  \ takes no damage."
