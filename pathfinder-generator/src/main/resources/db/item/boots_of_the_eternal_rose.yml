description: "These leather boots are found in a variety of styles but always have\
  \ a prominent engraving of a rose. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on Perform\
  \ (dance) and Stealth checks. The wearer may move through areas of flowers (whether\
  \ wild-growing or a garden) at normal speed and without suffering any impairment\
  \ or taking damage from thorns, brambles, or similar hazards; areas of flowers that\
  \ have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect the wearer.\nIf\
  \ Shelyn is the wearer's patron, the wearer may use daze monster once per day; if\
  \ the wearer is dancing, singing, or using some other Perform skill as part of a\
  \ performance lasting at least 1 minute, he may activate daze monster as a free\
  \ action during his performance. As a free action once per round, the wearer may\
  \ conjure a beautiful, nonmagical, common flower (such as a daisy, pansy, rose,\
  \ sunflower, or the like) that lasts for 1 day before crumbling into perfume and\
  \ dust."
