description: "This is a sheath designed to be strapped to your forearm and hidden\
  \ under a long sleeve. The sheath can hold one forearmlength item, such as a dagger,\
  \ dart, or wand, or up to five arrows or crossbow bolts. As a move action, you can\
  \ bend your wrist to cause some or all of these items to drop into your hand (provoking\
  \ attacks of opportunity as normal). You have a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks\
  \ made to oppose the Perception check of someone observing or frisking you to determine\
  \ items in the sheath. You can only wear one wrist sheath per arm."
