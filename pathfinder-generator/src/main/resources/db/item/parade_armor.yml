description: "Most wealthy countries with standing armies have a different uniform\
  \ for use in showy noncombat situations such as parades, coronation ceremonies,\
  \ and so on. The appearance of this armor varies by the country of origin and the\
  \ branch of the military, but still provides some protection in case the soldier\
  \ needs to fight while in parade dress. For example, one country's parade armor\
  \ may be a chain shirt, tabard, leather greaves, and a winged helm. If you're wearing\
  \ a country's parade armor, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate\
  \ checks to influence a person from that country. Depending on the country, parade\
  \ armor may be crafted from leather, metal, or a mixture of both."
