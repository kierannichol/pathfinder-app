description: "This 6-inch-wide, perforated metallic vessel resembles a thurible found\
  \ in a place of worship. The censer must be filled with incense to function. On\
  \ command as a full-round action, the bearer may summon an air elemental. If the\
  \ censer is filled with incense of meditation, it conjures a greater air elemental\
  \ as if using summon monster VII. If filled with any other incense, it conjures\
  \ a Large air elemental as if using summon monster V. Conjuring an elemental consumes\
  \ any normal incense in the censer, or one-fourth of a block of incense of meditation.\
  \ The censer cannot summon another elemental until the previous one is dismissed,\
  \ killed, or the duration of its summoning expires."
