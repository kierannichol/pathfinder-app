description: "This shard of quartz is roughly the size of a human finger and covered\
  \ in flowing sigils. It contains the knowledge of a psychic spell (chosen by the\
  \ creator when the item is crafted). If the bearer is a psychic spellcaster and\
  \ has that spell on her class spell list, she can use her spell slots to cast that\
  \ spell as if it were one of her spells known. A shard of psychic power is priced\
  \ based on the spell's psychic spell level. If the spell does not appear on the\
  \ psychic's spell list, it is based on the highest spell level it has on any other\
  \ spell list. For example, a spell that is on the 1st-level medium list and the\
  \ 2nd-level spiritualist list is priced as a 2nd-level spell."
