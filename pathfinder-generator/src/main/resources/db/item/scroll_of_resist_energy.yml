name: "Scroll of Resist Energy"
description: "This abjuration grants a creature limited protection from damage of\
  \ whichever one of five energy types you select: acid, cold, electricity, fire,\
  \ or sonic. The subject gains resist energy 10 against the energy type chosen, meaning\
  \ that each time the creature is subjected to such damage (whether from a natural\
  \ or magical source), that damage is reduced by 10 points before being applied to\
  \ the creature's hit points. The value of the energy resistance granted increases\
  \ to 20 points at 7th level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The spell\
  \ protects the recipient's equipment as well."
