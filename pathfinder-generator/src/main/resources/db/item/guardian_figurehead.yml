description: "This elegantly carved figurehead typically depicts a fantastic magical\
  \ creature, divine figure, or local hero, and it is either attached to the prow\
  \ of a sailing vessel or carved into the hull of the ship. Once per day, the figurehead\
  \ can be activated by speaking its command word as a swift action, awakening its\
  \ protective power for 1 minute. While the figurehead is active, all ranged attacks\
  \ originating from anywhere other than the ship have a 20% miss chance against the\
  \ vessel and anyone aboard it. This ability has no effect on melee attacks, rays,\
  \ or ranged attacks that do not require an attack roll to hit (such as magic missile)."
