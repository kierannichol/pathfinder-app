description: "This simple copper headband has a small yellow gem set so that when\
  \ it rests upon the forehead of the wearer, the yellow gem sits perched on the wearer's\
  \ brow as if it were a third eye in the middle of her forehead. Often, the headband\
  \ contains additional designs to further accentuate the appearance of a third, crystal\
  \ eye.\nThe headband grants the wearer an enhancement bonus to two mental ability\
  \ scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) of +2, +4, or +6. Treat this as a temporary\
  \ ability bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is worn.\nThese bonuses are\
  \ chosen when the headband is created and cannot be changed. If the headband grants\
  \ a bonus to Intelligence, it also grants skill ranks as a headband of vast intelligence."
