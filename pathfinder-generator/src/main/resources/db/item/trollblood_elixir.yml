description: "This rancid, bubbling tonic is mud-colored and reeks of sweat, gore,\
  \ and decay. Upon drinking a dose of trollblood elixir, the imbiber gains fast healing\
  \ 5. This fast healing is even capable of reattaching a severed limb that is pressed\
  \ against its stump for 1 round, as long as the limb has been severed for no more\
  \ than 1 hour and is essentially intact. The effects of trollblood elixir last 1\
  \ minute; during this time, the imbiber is nauseated. Each round, the imbiber can\
  \ choose to prematurely end the elixir's effects by succeeding at a DC 10 Fortitude\
  \ save as a full-round action. Trollblood elixir does not affect objects or nonliving\
  \ creatures such as constructs and undead."
