name: "Scroll of Invigorating Poison"
description: "The body of the target creature gains a metabolic response that allows\
  \ it to benefit from normally deadly toxins. When a poison would cause ability damage\
  \ to the target creature, the target instead gains a +4 alchemical bonus to that\
  \ ability score. The spell then immediately ends, but the bonus lasts for a number\
  \ of minutes equal to the amount of ability damage the poison would have caused.\
  \ If the poison would deal more than one type of ability damage, each bonus has\
  \ a separate duration. If the poison has effects other than ability damage (such\
  \ as unconsciousness or ability drain), these effects apply normally. This spell\
  \ affects only a single poison; if multiple poisons affect the target simultaneously,\
  \ this spell prevents only ability damage and grants the appropriate bonuses for\
  \ the poison that would cause the most damage."
