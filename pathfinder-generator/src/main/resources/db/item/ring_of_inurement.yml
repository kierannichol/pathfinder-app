description: "This humble ring is crafted from smooth red and blue porcelain and wrapped\
  \ with threads of copper. Each morning, the ring's wearer must select either hot\
  \ or cold, and for the next 24 hours the ring of inurement affords basic protection\
  \ from the selected condition as if she were using endure elements and superficially\
  \ alters the wearer's clothing to better accommodate her, growing fur linings and\
  \ extra layers in frigid environs or lightening fabric in response to high temperatures.\
  \ The ring protects only the wearer who determined its properties for the day, and\
  \ its protection immediately ends for the day if it is removed."
