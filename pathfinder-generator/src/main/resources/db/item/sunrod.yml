description: "This 1-foot-long, gold-tipped iron rod glows brightly when struck (a\
  \ standard action). It sheds normal light in a 30-foot radius and increases the\
  \ light level by one step for an additional 30 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes\
  \ dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A sunrod does not increase the\
  \ light level in normal light or bright light. It glows for 6 hours, after which\
  \ the gold tip is burned out and worthless."
