description: "This golden-bladed +1 glorious undead bane katana shines like the first\
  \ rays of the morning sun. Whenever the wielder of a blade of the rising sun threatens\
  \ a critical threat (regardless of whether the critical is confirmed or whether\
  \ the target is subject to critical hits), the target is surrounded by a halo of\
  \ golden sunlight equivalent to faerie fire until the beginning of the wielder's\
  \ next turn. Undead surrounded by this glow take 1d6 points of damage at the beginning\
  \ of their turn.\nThe wielder of a blade of the rising sun may declare a sacrificial\
  \ strike (similar to the retributive strike of a staff of power) as a standard action,\
  \ or as an immediate action before losing consciousness upon gaining the dying or\
  \ dead condition. A sacrificial strike converts the wielder's body and spirit into\
  \ raw energy equivalent to a sunburst (DC 22). Allies of the wielder within the\
  \ sunburst are not harmed, and the wielder may choose to affect all allies within\
  \ the sunburst as mass cure light wounds or all allies within 10 feet as breath\
  \ of life. The caster level for the effects of the sacrificial strike is equal to\
  \ the sword's caster level plus 1/2 the wielder's level (maximum 25th level).\n\
  A sacrificial strike destroys the wielder's body (as the spell disintegrate), but\
  \ she has a 50% chance of being reincarnated (as the reincarnate spell) 24 hours\
  \ after performing a sacrificial strike in a random safe location within 1 mile.\
  \ The wielder's gear is left behind unharmed after the sacrificial strike; however,\
  \ the blade of the rising sun is teleported to a random location at least 100 miles\
  \ distant."
