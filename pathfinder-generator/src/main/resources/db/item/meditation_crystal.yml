description: "Though this focus is usually a hand-sized crystal, the exact form (such\
  \ as a wooden idol, an iron disk, and so on) may vary for some religions. A monk\
  \ or paladin of the cleric's faith may concentrate upon an activated meditation\
  \ crystal, taking no actions for 1 minute, and regain 1 ki point or one use of lay\
  \ on hands. Once activated, the crystal retains its energy until a monk or paladin\
  \ uses it for this purpose or 24 hours pass."
