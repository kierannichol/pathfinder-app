description: "Gale armor is a suit of +3 silken ceremonial armor that floats weightlessly\
  \ when not worn. Gale armor has no weight of its own and confers limited weightlessness\
  \ on its wearer. The wearer of a suit of gale armor can use air walk up to 10 rounds\
  \ per day. Activating or deactivating this ability is a free action, and these rounds\
  \ need not be consecutive. Additionally, the wearer of a suit of gale armor is permanently\
  \ under the effect of glide, and if he's capable of flying, the armor increases\
  \ his maneuverability by one category."
