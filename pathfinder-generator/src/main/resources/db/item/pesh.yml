description: "The milk of this vibrantly green cactus, when mixed with resins and\
  \ other ingredients, congeals into sticky, black chunks with an exceedingly sour\
  \ taste. Though pesh comes in several different varieties, refined pesh is both\
  \ the most potent and expensive type. Taking refined pesh gives a person 15 temporary\
  \ hit points for 1 hour, a +2 morale bonus on saves versus fear effects for 1 day,\
  \ and a –4 penalty to Dexterity and Wisdom for 1 day. Pesh is addictive (Fortitude\
  \ DC 10 to resist), and long-term users suffer Dexterity and Wisdom damage."
