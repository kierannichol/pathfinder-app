description: "Accidents are common in the City of Smog, and in a place where healing\
  \ magic is distrusted at best and haphazard at worst, amputation is often the only\
  \ remedy for a mangled hand or smashed leg. For those who can afford them, clockwork\
  \ prostheses —miraculous metallic extremities fused with a small amount of primal\
  \ magic—offer an elegant solution to missing limbs.\nOnce purchased, a clockwork\
  \ prosthesis is attached to the area where a limb once was—a prosthesis can't be\
  \ added in addition to an already existing limb. Only humanoid creatures can equip\
  \ themselves with clockwork prostheses, which must be installed by a trained prosthesis\
  \ merchant. As a clockwork prosthesis is installed (a process that takes no less\
  \ than 1 hour), the bearer must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or the prosthesis\
  \ doesn't take hold. Either way, the bearer takes 2 points of Constitution damage\
  \ from the surgery. Clockwork prostheses commonly come in two types—arms and legs.\n\
  Clockwork Arm: A clockwork arm allows its bearer to lift up to 1-1/2 times his maximum\
  \ load over his head. A humanoid with two clockwork arms can lift up to twice his\
  \ maximum load over his head. In addition, a clockwork arm allows its bearer to\
  \ deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike and provides\
  \ a +10 bonus to its bearer's CMD against attempts to disarm a weapon held in that\
  \ hand. For the appropriate price, a clockwork arm can be enchanted with any weapon\
  \ special ability so long as the ability can be applied to unarmed attacks.\nClockwork\
  \ Leg: A clockwork leg allows its bearer to lift up to 2-1/2 times his maximum load\
  \ off the ground (instead of double). A humanoid with two clockwork legs can lift\
  \ up to 3 times his maximum load off the ground and stagger around with it. In addition,\
  \ each installed clockwork leg grants its bearer a +4 bonus to CMD against trip\
  \ and bull rush attempts.\nThe clockwork prostheses detailed here are only the most\
  \ common types of clockwork prostheses. Other, more specialized clockwork prostheses\
  \ capable of transforming into firearms, pinning opponents, and even channeling\
  \ magical energy are also rumored to exist."
