description: "The wearer of this slender white leather glove may, as a standard action,\
  \ press it against any surface or object and cause a luminous handprint to appear.\
  \ This print glows any color the wearer wishes, sheds light as a candle, and is\
  \ easily visible from a distance of up to 60 feet. Such handprints last for 1 day\
  \ before fading away. The glowing handprint matches the wearer's hand in terms of\
  \ size, position of fingers, and so on."
