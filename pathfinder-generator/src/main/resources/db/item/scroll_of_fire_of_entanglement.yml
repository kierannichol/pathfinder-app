  \ wreathed in flames that impede its movement. Until the end of the spell's duration,\
  \ the target is entangled. If the target starts its turn in a square adjacent to\
  \ you, it is considered to be entangled to an immobile object (you) and cannot move.\
  \ A target that saves against this spell is affected for only 1 round."
