description: "Most common among ratfolk alchemists, arcane stink ink is used to inscribe\
  \ formulae or spells into formula books and spellbooks. Like normal stink ink, the\
  \ arcane version can only be read by creatures with the scent ability (although\
  \ read magic works normally on spells and arcane formulae inscribed with stink ink).\
  \ Using arcane stink ink to inscribe a spell or formula into a book costs +10% of\
  \ the normal amount ."
