description: "A set of dragon herald vestments is covered in scales of one of five\
  \ different colors, and grants resist energy 5 of one type (as the resist energy\
  \ spell) to the wearer: acid for black or green, electricity for blue, fire for\
  \ red, or cold for white. If the wearer is a kobold with scales matching one of\
  \ those five colors, she can speak a command word in Draconic to change the vestments'\
  \ scales to the same color as her own, or back to the color chosen when the vestments\
  \ were constructed. Altering the scales' color is a standard action that provokes\
  \ attacks of opportunity."
