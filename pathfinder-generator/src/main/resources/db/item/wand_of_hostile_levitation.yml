name: "Wand of Hostile Levitation"
description: "You levitate the target a few inches off the ground, removing solid\
  \ footing and halving the target's speed. The target also takes a –4 penalty to\
  \ CMD against bull rush, drag, and reposition attempts. A targeted creature that\
  \ attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the\
  \ first attack has a –1 penalty on attack rolls, the second –2, and so on, to a\
  \ maximum penalty of –5. A full-round action spent stabilizing allows the creature\
  \ to begin again at –1."
