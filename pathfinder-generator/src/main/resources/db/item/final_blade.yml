description: "The guillotines known as the final blades have become symbols of Galt\
  \ and the bloody excesses of the Red Revolution, yet the first of these horrific\
  \ devices were actually built to serve the cause of justice. The final blades were\
  \ originally designed to provide a condemned prisoner a swift and painless death,\
  \ but also to prevent the resurrection of said victim by trapping her soul within\
  \ the guillotine's blade upon execution. Every blade has a unique appearance and\
  \ citizens speak of them as if they are people. In speaking of a condemned prisoner,\
  \ someone might say, \"He'll lie with Bloody Jaine before the sun falls.\"\nOnly\
  \ Large or smaller helpless (or willing) creatures can be executed by a final blade.\
  \ When a final blade scythes down to decapitate the target, treat this as a coup\
  \ de grace attempt on the victim that inflicts 6d6+12 points of damage. A final\
  \ blade 's damage penetrates all damage reduction (save epic damage reduction) and\
  \ negates all regeneration effects. A creature slain by this effect is immediately\
  \ targeted by a soul bind effect that automatically places her soul into the blade\
  \ itself (no save). A final blade has no limit to the number of souls it can hold.\
  \ It is possible to release a soul from a final blade to allow that creature to\
  \ be resurrected, but the ritual involved is a closely guarded secret known only\
  \ to the Gray Gardeners."
destruction: "Although the final blades are minor artifacts, they can be destroyed\
  \ by damage. The exact defenses of each vary, but all have hardness 20 and 200 hit\
  \ points. When one is destroyed, the trapped souls explode in a wave of necromantic\
  \ power— some of these souls manifest as incorporeal undead and immediately attack\
  \ all living creatures in sight. The number and nature of these angry souls varies,\
  \ but should usually consist of at least a CR 12 (or higher) encounter."
