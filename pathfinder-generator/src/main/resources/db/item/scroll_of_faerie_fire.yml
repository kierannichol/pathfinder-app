name: "Scroll of Faerie Fire"
description: "A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed\
  \ light as candles. Creatures outlined by faerie fire take a â€“20 penalty on all\
  \ Stealth checks. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally\
  \ provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical darkness effect functions\
  \ normally), blur, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects. The light is\
  \ too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable\
  \ to light. The faerie fire can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice\
  \ at the time of casting. The faerie fire does not cause any harm to the objects\
  \ or creatures thus outlined."
