  \ be of any alignment and each has its own unique personality and proclivities.\
  \ Each ring has a specific obsession. To determine a particular obsession ring's\
  \ obsession, roll on Table 6–10: Intelligent Item Purpose. When the ring is in pursuit\
  \ of its purpose, its Ego is 10 points higher than normal.\nGnomes with the obsession\
  \ racial trait have a unique understanding of the ring's mentality and gain a +5\
  \ bonus on Will saving throws to resist the obsession ring's attempts to dominate\
  \ the wearer.\nWhen an obsession ring is engaged in action directly related to its\
  \ obsession, it grants its wearer the following powers, but can choose to withhold\
  \ such powers if it does not believe their uses would further its obsession."
