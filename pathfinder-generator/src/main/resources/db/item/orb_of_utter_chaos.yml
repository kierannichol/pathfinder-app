description: "This globe of varicolored material constantly shifts hue and texture,\
  \ from steel-hard to spongy or even gelatinous. The bearer of the orb is constantly\
  \ protected by entropic shield. Three times per day, when the bearer holds the orb\
  \ and casts a spell with the polymorph subtype, chaotic descriptor, or one that\
  \ gives creatures the confused condition, she may modify her caster level for that\
  \ spell by 1d6â€“2.\nOnce per day the bearer may hold the orb and command it to dispel\
  \ magic. If the dispel check succeeds, the wielder absorbs the unraveled magical\
  \ energy through the orb and gains the benefit of an aid spell.\nThe orb bestows\
  \ one permanent negative level on any lawful creature holding or carrying it. The\
  \ negative level remains as long as the creature has the orb and disappears immediately\
  \ when the orb is no longer held or carried. This negative level cannot be overcome\
  \ in any way (including by restoration spells) while the bearer has the orb."
