description: "This snuff can be used to shake off the effects of nausea. If you take\
  \ it before being exposed to an effect that would give you the nauseated condition\
  \ and allows a saving throw, you attempt two saving throws against the effect and\
  \ take the higher result. A single dose provides this benefit for 1 hour."
