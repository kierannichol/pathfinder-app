description: "This large glass jar is vacuum-sealed with an airtight wax plug. Inside,\
  \ festering chunks of monkey meat are covered in fungal mycelium and seeded with\
  \ fly eggs, though the mixture's potency is not evident until it's exposed to air.\
  \ Once the jar is opened (a standard action), the stench quickly becomes overpowering\
  \ as the jar's contents swell and rot at an accelerated rate. Any living creature\
  \ within 15 feet of the jar when it is opened must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude\
  \ save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds.\nVermin and undead have a hard time distinguishing\
  \ carrion bait from rotten human flesh, but intelligent undead that succeed at a\
  \ DC 15 Perception check realize the difference. Regardless, any creature that spends\
  \ more than 1 round eating the carrion bait quickly realizes its error, since the\
  \ bait continues to swell and grow even as it's digested. One round after eating\
  \ carrion bait, an affected undead or vermin becomes staggered for 1d4 rounds as\
  \ its belly bulges to incredible proportions (other creature types cannot stomach\
  \ carrion bait and instead are nauseated for 2d4 rounds). If the affected creature\
  \ is already staggered, its movement speed instead decreases by 10 feet for the\
  \ duration of the carrion bait's effect. Crafting carrion bait requires a successful\
  \ DC 19 Craft (alchemy) check."
