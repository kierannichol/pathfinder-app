description: "As a standard action, this ornate rectangular jar can be vigorously\
  \ shaken to cause its contents to mix and activate. Once shaken, the contents of\
  \ the jar shed light as a sunrod for 6 hours. A jar of activated bottled sunlight\
  \ can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Upon striking\
  \ a solid object, the bottled sunlight creates a 30-foot-radius burst of natural\
  \ sunlight that persists for 1 round, after which all light from the jar fades.\
  \ Throwing an inactive jar of bottled sunlight destroys the item, leaving only a\
  \ smoldering pile of ashes where it struck. Crafting this item requires a successful\
  \ DC 30 Craft (alchemy) check."
