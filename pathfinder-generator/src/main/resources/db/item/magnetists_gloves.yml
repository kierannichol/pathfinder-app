description: "These thin leather gloves have delicate steel wires running through\
  \ them. Three times per day as a standard action, the wearer of these gloves may\
  \ attempt a disarm combat maneuver on a target within 30 feet. The target's item\
  \ must be mostly made of metal. If the combat maneuver check is successful, the\
  \ target is disarmed and the item falls to the ground in the target's square. For\
  \ every 5 by which the check exceeds the DC, the item lands 1 square closer to the\
  \ wearer. If this would place the item in the wearer's square, the wearer may attempt\
  \ to catch the item with a DC 10 Dexterity check; otherwise it lands in the wearer's\
  \ square. The wearer can only use this ability if she has at least one hand free.\
  \ If the wearer fails the combat maneuver check, she is not disarmed."
