description: "These shining, silvery horseshoes bear designs of swift-moving clouds\
  \ and anthropomorphized images of the wind. When affixed to a horse, these horseshoes\
  \ allow the horse to travel without actually touching the ground. The horse must\
  \ still run above (always around 4 inches above) a roughly horizontal surface. This\
  \ means that the horse can cross non-solid or unstable surfaces such as water, and\
  \ that it can move without leaving tracks on any sort of ground. The horse moves\
  \ at its normal base land speed. All four shoes must be worn by the same animal\
  \ for the magic to be effective."
