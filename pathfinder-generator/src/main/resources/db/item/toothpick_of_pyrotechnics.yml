description: "This simple wooden toothpick is useful for creating flashy diversions\
  \ on stage or in a fight. Breaking the toothpick causes a blinding flash and a dark\
  \ cloud of smoke to appear. Creatures other than the user within 20 feet must succeed\
  \ at a DC 13 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4+1 rounds. The cloud of smoke spreads\
  \ 20 feet in all directions, obscures all sight (including darkvision), and lasts\
  \ for 3 rounds."
