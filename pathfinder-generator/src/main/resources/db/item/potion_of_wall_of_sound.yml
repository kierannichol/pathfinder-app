name: "Potion of Wall of Sound"
description: "A translucent barrier of pure sound springs into existence. This wall\
  \ is silent except for a faint hum, but bursts with discordant noise when touched\
  \ by an object or creature. The wall deflects arrows, bolts, loose debris, and Small\
  \ or smaller flying creatures like a wind wallspell, except these things rebound\
  \ harmlessly rather than being directed upward. The burst of discordant noise deals\
  \ 2d4 points of sonic damage to creatures within 10 feet of the triggering object\
  \ or creature; touching or passing through the wall deals 2d6 points of sonic damage\
  \ + 1 point of sonic damage per caster level (maximum +20). If you evoke the wall\
  \ so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing\
  \ through the wall. A silencespell suppresses the wall within its area, but the\
  \ wall reappears when the silenceends."
