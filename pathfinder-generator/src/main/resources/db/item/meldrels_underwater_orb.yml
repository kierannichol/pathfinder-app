description: "This unpolished pearlescent stone, roughly 6 inches in diameter, contains\
  \ an airless cyst of seawater with the preserved, pink-and-yellow body of a tropical\
  \ fish, eyes agape, in the center. The stone once belonged to Meldrel Vallinia,\
  \ an elven arcanist from the Shackles obsessed with the theory that terrestrial\
  \ elves must have the unconscious ability to transform into aquatic elves.\nMeldrel\
  \ spent most of his long life trying to learn how to unlock this supposed ability.\
  \ He researched the locations of aquatic elven communities and magically traveled\
  \ to their depths, hoping his underwater kin possessed the forbidden knowledge he\
  \ sought. Ultimately, Meldrel found no real proof to support his theory, although\
  \ he managed to weave the strange magic he learned along the way into his orb. The\
  \ fish inside, Meldrel claimed, was a gift from an aquatic elven king.\nAn occultist\
  \ of 7th level or higher who has learned the transmutation implement school and\
  \ uses Meldrel's underwater orb as an implement can use the following focus power.\n\
  One with the Depths (Sp): As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental\
  \ focus to give yourself a swim speed of 30 feet, as well as a +8 bonus on Swim\
  \ checks and the ability to take 10 on Swim checks even if distracted or endangered.\
  \ You can also use the run action while swimming, provided you swim in a straight\
  \ line. Additionally, this effect allows you to breathe water freely. This effect\
  \ lasts for 1 hour per occultist level you have."
