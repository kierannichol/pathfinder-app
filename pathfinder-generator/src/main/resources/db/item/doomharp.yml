description: "Made from bone and sun-dried sinew, this masterwork harp produces a\
  \ vague sense of unease in anyone near it. If the owner of this item has the bardic\
  \ performance class feature he can use it to perform a dirge of doom even if he\
  \ is not of sufficient level to normally have access to that ability. A bard who\
  \ can use dirge of doom and who plays the harp as part of his performance increases\
  \ the effective radius to 60 feet."
