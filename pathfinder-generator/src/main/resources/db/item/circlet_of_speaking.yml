description: "This thin, silver circlet allows an animal wearing it to speak, even\
  \ if it is not normally capable of doing so because of its low Intelligence score\
  \ or lack of known languages. The creator of the item decides what language the\
  \ circlet's wearer can speak when she crafts the item (typically Common); once crafting\
  \ is complete, this cannot be changed. A circlet of speaking does not grant an animal\
  \ a bonus to Intelligence, and the wearer's general behavior remains largely the\
  \ same while it wears a circlet of speaking, though it can communicate its desires\
  \ and rudimentary knowledge as though being spoken to via speak with animals."
