name: "Potion of Aversion"
description: "You plant a revulsion in the mind of the subject, causing her to avoid\
  \ an object or location. You must choose a specific object or place. A location\
  \ chosen in this way can be no larger than a cube measuring 50 feet on a side. The\
  \ aversion is entirely in the target's mind, so the chosen object or location itself\
  \ isn't subject to any magical effect. If the target fails her saving throw, she\
  \ can't come within 60 feet of the chosen object or place. She makes every reasonable\
  \ effort to avoid the object of the aversion, but will not put herself in danger\
  \ in order to maintain the aversion. For example, if the object of the aversion\
  \ is a bridge but a forest fire is closing in and will likely kill the target, she\
  \ ignores the aversion and crosses the bridge to save herself. If the target must\
  \ ignore the conditions of the aversion, she is nauseated until she is no longer\
  \ violating the aversion."
