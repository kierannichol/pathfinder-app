description: "This primitive hyena mask is usually made of leather, but may be made\
  \ of soft metal like copper or carved from an animal's skull. The wearer gains a\
  \ +2 competence bonus on Handle Animal and Heal checks. The wearer can smell when\
  \ nearby creatures are in heat or otherwise especially fertile (creatures such as\
  \ humans that can breed at any time of the year always smell fertile unless they\
  \ are barren).\nIf Lamashtu is the wearer's patron, the mask counts as an unholy\
  \ symbol and a hole for a third eye appears in its forehead. The wearer can use\
  \ summon monster II once per day to summon a fiendish hyena, which obeys the wearer\
  \ as if they shared a common language. The wearer may interbreed with animals within\
  \ one size category of the wearer's size. The offspring of such unions are members\
  \ of the mother's race with the fiendish simple template and bear monstrous aesthetic\
  \ features of the father's race."
