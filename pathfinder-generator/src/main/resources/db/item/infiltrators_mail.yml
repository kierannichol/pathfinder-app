description: "This dull black suit of +2 scale mail does not impose an armor check\
  \ penalty on the wearer's Stealth checks, though other armor check penalties apply\
  \ as normal. Additionally, infiltrator's mail reacts to detect magic as though it\
  \ were nonmagical and, when worn, extends this effect to all other magic items worn\
  \ or held by the wearer unless the viewer uses identify or a similar effect while\
  \ examining the items."
