description: "This thick, syrupy, deep purple elixir contains within it the ability\
  \ to infuse a drinker with a tiny fragment of a dead demon lord's mythic power.\
  \ So potent is this elixir that it must be stored in a magically reinforced cold\
  \ iron flask capped with a mixture of lead and demon ichor—the flask itself is essentially\
  \ a wondrous magic item that does nothing else and costs 8,000 gp to craft. Even\
  \ then, the elixir's essence fills a 10-foot-radius area with unholy energies that\
  \ sicken all living creatures (this is a poison effect with no saving throw). If\
  \ the flask is opened, this radius expands to 30 feet. A thin sheet of lead, 1 inch\
  \ of common metal, or 1 foot of stone blocks this effect. Once the flask is opened,\
  \ the elixir must be imbibed within 1 minute; re-capping the elixir at this point\
  \ doesn't reset or pause this countdown. If the elixir has not been imbibed in that\
  \ time, the energy within explodes in a 30-foot-radius burst that deals 15d6 points\
  \ of unholy damage (Will DC 25 half) to all creatures in the area of effect, destroying\
  \ the elixir.\nIf a creature drinks a Nahyndrian elixir, it must succeed at a DC\
  \ 25 Fortitude save or take 4d6 points of Constitution drain (demons automatically\
  \ succeed). If a non-mythic chaotic evil creature succeeds, it undergoes mythic\
  \ ascension—gaining either the first tier in a mythic path or a mythic rank, at\
  \ the GM's discretion. A chaotic evil creature that is already mythic treats a Nahyndrian\
  \ elixir as nectar of the gods (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 155).\nNahyndrian\
  \ elixirs have the same strange immunity to teleportation effects as Nahyndrian\
  \ crystals."
destruction: "Merely opening the elixir ensures its destruction. Pouring the contents\
  \ out triggers its unholy explosion instantly."
