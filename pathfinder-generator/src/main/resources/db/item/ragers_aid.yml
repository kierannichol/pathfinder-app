description: "This packet filled with spikey-edged leaves has a pungent scent almost\
  \ strong enough to make your eyes water. While you chew the leaves, you ignore the\
  \ effects of fatigue. The leaves last for 6 rounds, at which point only a wad of\
  \ pulp remains. When the effect of rager's aid wears off, you are exhausted instead."
