description: "This copper clasp adorned with a piece of amber is used to fasten a\
  \ cloak or cape. When its wearer takes electricity damage, this brooch absorbs up\
  \ to 20 points of electrical damage and holds that electrical charged until it is\
  \ released by its wielder or harmlessly at the end of 10 minutes, whichever occurs\
  \ first. The brooch can absorb up to 50 points of electricity damage per day. The\
  \ wielder can release the charge on command, unleashing any electricity in the brooch\
  \ as if casting a shocking grasp spell (dealing 1d6 points of electricity damage\
  \ per 5 points of damage held)."
