description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis silk robe is covered in exquisitely detailed\
  \ embroidery depicting foxes frolicking in a pristine meadow. Four times per day,\
  \ the wearer can add 1d6 to the result of a Dexterity-, Intelligence-, or Charisma-based\
  \ skill check as a free action. The wearer can do this only once per check, and\
  \ the wearer can't benefit from both the lupine robe and the inspiration class feature\
  \ on the same check.\nIf the wearer is a kitsune, he can spend two of the robe's\
  \ daily uses to add 1d10 on a skill check instead of 1d6."
