description: "All three of these banners must be planted in the ground, with no two\
  \ banners more than 40 feet apart, before they activate. An illusory mastiff manifests\
  \ once all three banners are planted and walks a triangular circuit from banner\
  \ to banner, moving at a speed of 30 feet. The illusory hound lasts for as long\
  \ as the banners remain planted, to a maximum of 8 hours. After 8 hours, the ward\
  \ ceases to function. The banners cannot be replanted and reactivated for 12 hours.\n\
  Anytime a creature of Tiny or larger size crosses into the area delineated by the\
  \ banners, the mastiff erupts in earsplitting barks. At the same time, the banners\
  \ summon a riding dog (as per summon nature's ally I). The dog appears adjacent\
  \ to the square in which the ward was breached; if the ward was breached in multiple\
  \ areas, the dog appears adjacent to a randomly selected breached square. The dog\
  \ attacks the nearest intruder immediately.\nAny creatures standing within the warded\
  \ area when the third banner is planted are excluded from the effects of the item,\
  \ and can freely cross into and out of the area without triggering the mastiff's\
  \ attack."
