description: "This +1 chainmail looks like something a talentless dwarven apprentice\
  \ would make—ugly, asymmetrical, and finished quickly rather than with care. The\
  \ wearer gains a luck bonus or penalty equal to 1d6–3 on Craft checks to make armor\
  \ or weapons while wearing it. This bonus or penalty is determined the first time\
  \ the wearer attempts such a Craft check to determine a day's progress. If the wearer\
  \ removes the armor, this bonus or penalty persists for an additional 24 hours.\
  \ Once per day, the wearer can use magic weapon."
