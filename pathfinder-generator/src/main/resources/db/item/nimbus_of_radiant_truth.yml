description: "The Nimbus of Radiant Truth exists only when good has need of a great\
  \ champion. Such a champion can attain it only though a perilous quest that tests\
  \ mettle and righteousness. Rather than being a physical object, the Nimbus of Radiant\
  \ Truth manifests as a glowing halo of light around the wearer's head. It's ordinarily\
  \ as bright as continual flame, but in battle it brightens to the dazzling brilliance\
  \ of daylight. Its radiance is treated as resulting from a 9th-level spell for purposes\
  \ of interaction with other sources of light and darkness. The radiance of the nimbus\
  \ can be suppressed or resumed as a standard action.\nThe Nimbus of Radiant Truth\
  \ grants a +6 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and Charisma. Treat this as a temporary\
  \ ability bonus for the first 24 hours the nimbus is worn. Its wearer can't deliberately\
  \ utter a lie, though the nimbus doesn't prevent other forms of deception, evasiveness,\
  \ and giving incomplete answers within the boundaries of the truth. All of the wearer's\
  \ natural weapons and any weapons she wields overcome damage reduction as though\
  \ they were good-aligned. In addition, the Nimbus of Radiant Truth has the following\
  \ powers."
destruction: "The Nimbus of Radiant Truth can be destroyed by placing it on the head\
  \ of a person who was once completely good and innocent, but is now corrupted into\
  \ the vilest depths of evil and depravity."
