description: "This lustrous gold ring is highly malleable and always fits perfectly.\
  \ After being worn for 24 hours, the ring allows the wearer to resize one weapon\
  \ or suit of armor to her size. The ring can affect any item that is no more than\
  \ two size categories too big or too small and that weighs no more than 125 pounds.\
  \ The size change lasts until 1 round after the item leaves the wearer's possession.\
  \ A new item can be resized after it has been in the wearer's possession for 24\
  \ hours, causing the previously resized item to return to its normal size. The resizing\
  \ otherwise functions as the resize item spell."
