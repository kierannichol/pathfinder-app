description: "Covering your body from head to foot in light, airy cloth keeps you\
  \ cooler than baring your skin to the sun. This outfit typically consists of a loose\
  \ linen robe and either a turban or loose head covering and veil. The outfit provides\
  \ a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist warm or hot weather. This does not stack\
  \ with any bonuses gained from the Survival skill."
