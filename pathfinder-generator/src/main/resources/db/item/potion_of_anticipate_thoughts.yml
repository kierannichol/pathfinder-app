name: "Potion of Anticipate Thoughts"
description: "This spell taps into the target's mind so you get an impression of the\
  \ actions it will take. You gain a +2 insight bonus to AC against the target's attacks.\
  \ If the target fails its Will save, you also see how the target will react to your\
  \ attacks, and the bonus applies on your attack rolls and damage rolls against the\
  \ target. These bonuses apply only while the target is within range of the spell,\
  \ though if it goes out of range, the bonuses return once it's back in range. Whenever\
  \ the target misses you with an attack, the spell's bonuses increase by 1 until\
  \ the spell ends (to a maximum of +5)."
