description: "Small nautical flags measure 3 feet by 5 feet, while large ones measure\
  \ 6 feet by 10 feet. Most ships fly a large national flag (or \"ensign\") and a\
  \ small courtesy flag (the flag of the nation whose waters it's sailing in) as well\
  \ as a personal signal, but flag sizes depend on ship size and personal preference.\n\
  Flags can be made out of almost any material. Cotton and silk are common, though\
  \ any type of cloth degrades quickly at sea. Most captains replace their flags every\
  \ two or three voyages.\nEnsign and courtesy flags cost less than personal signals,\
  \ as they can be made in large quantities. Personal signals must be custom ordered."
