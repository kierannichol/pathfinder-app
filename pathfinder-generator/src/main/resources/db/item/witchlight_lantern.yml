description: "This black, skull-shaped, wrought-iron lantern has no container for\
  \ oil or space for a candle. When held in the user's hand, the lantern automatically\
  \ glows with green light when it comes within 60 feet of a magic aura (not including\
  \ its own), providing dim light as per a candle if the strongest aura in range is\
  \ faint, normal light as per a hooded lantern if the strongest aura in range is\
  \ moderate, or bright light within 30 feet and dim light for the next 30 feet if\
  \ the strongest aura in range is strong. No matter the amount of light, this counts\
  \ as a 2nd-level light spell for the purpose of determining interactions with light\
  \ and darkness magic.\nIf the lantern comes within 60 feet of an overwhelming aura,\
  \ the light flares up and blinds all creatures in a 30-foot radius from the lantern\
  \ for 1d4 rounds; a successful DC 16 Reflex save reduces this condition to dazzled.\
  \ This counts as a 4th-level light spell. After flaring up, the witchlight lantern\
  \ loses its ability to shine light for 1 hour."
