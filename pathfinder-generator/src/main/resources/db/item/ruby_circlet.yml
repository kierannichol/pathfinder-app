description: "This golden circlet is set with rubies and is small enough to fit under\
  \ the standard head regalia of a reigning pharaoh. It functions as a +6 periapt\
  \ of Wisdom and a circlet of persuasion. If you are the rightful ruler of Osirion,\
  \ you can use the Ruby Circlet to telepathically communicate with Janhelia, agent\
  \ of the elemental lords of the desert; this ability functions as long as you and\
  \ she are on the same plane."
