description: "Named after Sarenrae's herald, Sunlord Thalachos, this +1 flaming holy\
  \ arrow has a platinum arrowhead and brilliant white fletching. When the arrow successfully\
  \ strikes an evil-aligned creature, it explodes in a shower of golden sparks that\
  \ summons a swarm of celestial doves (treat as a celestial bat swarm; Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Bestiary 294, 30) that continues to attack the arrow's target for 10 rounds\
  \ or until destroyed or dismissed. If the target is slain before the duration expires,\
  \ the remaining doves fly off into the horizon."
