description: "This porcelain teacup is used by poisoners to administer lethal doses\
  \ to even the most suspicious of victims. When a dose of ingested poison is placed\
  \ in the toastmaster's teacup and a command word is spoken, the cup absorbs the\
  \ poison so it cannot be detected. When the teacup's user speaks a second command\
  \ word (it need not be the same user), the poison reappears and taints any liquid\
  \ within the cup."
