name: "Potion of Aspect of the Stag"
description: "When you cast this spell, you take on an aspect of a stag, including\
  \ some of its physical characteristics. Your features become elongated and sinewy,\
  \ and you grow a set of antlers you can use for defense. You gain a +2 dodge bonus\
  \ to AC against attacks of opportunity, your base speed increases by 20 ft., you\
  \ can move through any undergrowth (including magically manipulated undergrowth)\
  \ at your normal speed, and can even make a 5-foot step within such terrain. Furthermore,\
  \ when you are hit with an attack of opportunity, you can make a single attack with\
  \ your antlers against the opponent that hit you as an immediate action. This attack\
  \ uses your highest base attack bonus plus your Strength or Dexterity bonus (your\
  \ choice) and deals 1d8 points of piercing damage (if you are Medium; 1d6 points\
  \ of damage if Small) plus your Strength modifier on a successful hit. The antlers\
  \ have a critical multiplier of 19–20/×2."
