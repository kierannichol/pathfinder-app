description: "Used to carry out a private conversation even in a crowded room or public\
  \ place, this 5-foot-long, 1/2-inch-wide leather hose widens into a copper bell\
  \ at each end. To use it, one conversation partner holds her end to her ear while\
  \ her partner speaks into his end, switching their postures for each reply. Conversing\
  \ through a conversation tube increases the DC of Perception checks to eavesdrop\
  \ on the conversation by +5 and negates the risk of lipreading but takes twice as\
  \ long as conversing normally."
