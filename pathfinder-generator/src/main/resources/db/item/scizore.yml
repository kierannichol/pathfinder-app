description: "The scizore is a hardened tube that fits over the forearm, ending in\
  \ a semicircular blade used for devastating bladed punch attacks. The scizore grants\
  \ a +1 shield bonus to AC, but if you attack with the blade, you lose the AC bonus\
  \ that round and take a â€“1 penalty on attack rolls with it. While wearing a scizore,\
  \ you cannot use that hand for anything else. A scizore provides a +10 bonus to\
  \ your CMD against being disarmed of your scizore. Donning a scizore is a full-round\
  \ action."
