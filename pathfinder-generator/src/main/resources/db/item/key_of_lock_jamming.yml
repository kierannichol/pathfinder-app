description: "This ornate brass key automatically reshapes itself to fit any standard\
  \ keyhole (generally those in doors scaled for use by Small or Medium creatures,\
  \ not deliberately oversized locks like the main door to a dwarven fortress). Once\
  \ placed inside a lock, the key merges with the lock and fills up all open spaces\
  \ within it, creating a solid piece of metal and making it impossible to unlock\
  \ it, even with magic. While securing the lock, the key strengthens its materials,\
  \ adding +2 to the lock's hardness, +8 to its hit points, and +5 to its Break DC.\
  \ Touching the key and speaking the command word causes the key to disintegrate,\
  \ leaving the lock intact and rendering the mechanism operable again."
