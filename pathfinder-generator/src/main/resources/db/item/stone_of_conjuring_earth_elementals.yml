description: "A stone of this nature is typically an oddly shaped bit of roughly polished\
  \ rock. On command as a full-round action, the bearer may summon an earth elemental.\
  \ If there is an unbroken piece of unworked stone of at least Huge size nearby,\
  \ the stone conjures a Huge earth elemental as if using summon monster VI. If there\
  \ is no such stone available (for example, if there is only sand, earth, worked\
  \ stone, or smaller pieces of stone), the stone conjures a Large earth elemental\
  \ as if using summon monster V. The stone cannot summon another elemental until\
  \ the previous one is dismissed, killed, or the duration of its summoning expires."
