description: "Three times per day, the wearer can use these thick leather gloves to\
  \ make a melee touch attack against an undead creature, a construct, or a nonmagical\
  \ object and deal 3d4 points of damage to it. When the wearer deals damage in this\
  \ way, the gloves absorb part of the matter that makes up the target. This creates\
  \ dust that is stored within the gloves for 24 hours. The next time the wearer attempts\
  \ a dirty trick combat maneuver, the dust flies from the gloves, providing a +2\
  \ bonus on that attempt. If the wearer does not attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver\
  \ before 24 hours elapses, the dust disappears."
