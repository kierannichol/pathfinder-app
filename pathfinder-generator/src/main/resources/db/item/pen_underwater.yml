description: "Underwater pens fill the grooves carved into underwater paper with ink;\
  \ as such, they work somewhat like a syringe, drawing ink from a waterproof bladder\
  \ and then gently releasing it into the grooves as the writer traces them with the\
  \ pen. These pens function equally well at depositing ink into tablets, underwater\
  \ paper, walls, or anything with carved writing."
