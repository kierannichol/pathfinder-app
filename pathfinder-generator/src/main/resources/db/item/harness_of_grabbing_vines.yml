description: "This ivy harness allows the wearer's wings to manipulate objects or\
  \ grab on to handholds, as if they were extra arms, as long as the wearer isn't\
  \ flying. They do not grant additional attacks, but they can be used to hold items\
  \ or perform combat maneuvers without requiring the wearer's hands. On command,\
  \ the harness grows roots that anchor the wearer in place much like anchored step.\
  \ When thus anchored, the wearer can climb using only legs and wings with a climb\
  \ speed equal to the wearer's reduced base speed. The benefits of anchored step\
  \ apply while the wearer is climbing with the roots."
