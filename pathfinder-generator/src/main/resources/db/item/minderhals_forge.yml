description: "Minderhal's Forge appears to be a giant stone blacksmithing forge and\
  \ huge iron anvil set atop a basalt platform that rises from a pit of slag. First\
  \ and foremost, Minderhal's Forge functions as an altar of Minderhal (see page 246\
  \ of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods for rules on altars). Any creature\
  \ (not just a worshiper of Minderhal) can pray at the altar, though accepting the\
  \ altar's blessing is both an evil and lawful act. Praying at the altar grants a\
  \ +2 circumstance bonus on Craft and Sense Motive checks, or one of the following\
  \ weapon special abilities (creature's choice) to one magic weapon carried or wielded\
  \ by the creature: axiomatic or unholy. This effect is suppressed if the weapon\
  \ leaves the creature's grasp, but resumes if the weapon is returned to the creature.\n\
  Minderhal's Forge is also a fully working forge. Any creature using the forge can\
  \ create magic weapons, armor, or shields as if it possessed the Craft Magic Arms\
  \ and Armor feat. If the creature already has that feat, the forge grants a +5 circumstance\
  \ bonus on the Craft check needed to create a magic weapon, armor, or shields. Crafting\
  \ any sort of item, whether magical or otherwise, using Minderhal's Forge takes\
  \ half the normal amount of time.\nIn addition, Minderhal's Forge has 10 charges,\
  \ which renew at the beginning of each day. A creature using Minderhal's Forge can\
  \ expend the listed number of charges to activate one of the following spell-like\
  \ abilities as a full-round action, which can affect targets within 10 feet of the\
  \ forge."
destruction: "Quenching Minderhal's Forge with the blood of the last worshiper of\
  \ Minderhal causes the forge to crumble into rubble and be destroyed."
