description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis bronze bracelet has seven charms shaped\
  \ like symbols of good luck in halfling society. It works only for a wearer with\
  \ the luck or adaptable luck racial trait. At any time, a halfling wearer can choose\
  \ to reroll a roll without taking an action. She must take the new result even if\
  \ it is worse. When the wearer uses this ability, one of the bracelet's charms crumbles\
  \ to dust. When all the charms are spent, the bracelet becomes nonmagical. The wearer\
  \ can remove a charm from the bracelet and give it to another creature to grant\
  \ that creature the charm's ability to reroll die rolls, but if unused before the\
  \ next sunrise, the charm turns to dust anyway."
