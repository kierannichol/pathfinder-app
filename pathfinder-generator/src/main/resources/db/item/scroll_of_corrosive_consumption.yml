name: "Scroll of Corrosive Consumption"
description: "With a touch, this spell causes a small, rapidly growing patch of corrosive\
  \ acid to appear on the target. On the first round, the acid deals 1 point of acid\
  \ damage per caster level (maximum 15). On the second round, the acid patch grows\
  \ and deals 1d4 points of acid damage per caster level (maximum 15d4). On the third\
  \ and final round, the acid patch covers the entire creature and deals 1d6 points\
  \ of acid damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). The target can spend a full-round\
  \ action to scrape off the acid, or can wash it off with at least 1 gallon of liquid\
  \ to halve the damage for that round and negate the remaining rounds of the spell."
