description: "If this seemingly unremarkable utensil is placed in an empty container,\
  \ the vessel fills with a thick, pasty gruel. Although the gruel tastes like warm,\
  \ wet cardboard, it is highly nourishing and contains everything necessary to sustain\
  \ any herbivorous, omnivorous, or carnivorous creature. The spoon can produce sufficient\
  \ gruel each day to feed up to four humans."
