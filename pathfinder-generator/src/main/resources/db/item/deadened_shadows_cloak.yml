description: "Colored a muted gray, this cloak would be nondescript were it not for\
  \ a single clasp of silver, stylized as a trio of skulls and inlaid with three large\
  \ blue pearls. By pressing the first pearl as a move action, the wearer causes the\
  \ illumination level in a 30-foot radius to decrease by one step toward dim light,\
  \ from bright light to normal light or from normal light to dim light. While active,\
  \ the cloak also deadens the sounds the wearer makes (as sculpt sound). This prevents\
  \ the wearer from communicating verbally, casting spells with verbal components,\
  \ speaking command words, and so on. Pressing this pearl again suppresses this effect.\
  \ This effect lasts for 15 minutes and can be used at will.\nThe second pearl also\
  \ requires a move action to activate, and can be activated only while the first\
  \ pearl is active. Activating the second pearl transports the wearer to the edge\
  \ of the Material Plane where it borders the Shadow Plane. This functions as shadow\
  \ walk, but only the wearer of the cloak is affected. This ability can be used once\
  \ per week. While recharging, the second pearl changes color to a gleaming white.\
  \ Once recharged, it returns to its former dark blue coloration.\nThe final pearl\
  \ must be removed from the clasp and dropped as a move action. This breaks the jewel,\
  \ causing wisps of shadowy vapor to engulf the wearer, granting him the benefits\
  \ of shadow body for the following 15 minutes. Once destroyed, the third pearl can't\
  \ be used again."
