description: "Spelunker's mail allows a creature to more easily navigate narrow underground\
  \ tunnels by granting the wearer the option of reducing his size when a passageway\
  \ grows too narrow.\nSpelunker's mail is a +1 slick chain shirt and has a dark,\
  \ lustrous sheen to its blue-black links. Ten times per day, by speaking a command\
  \ word, you can activate the armor's power to reduce your size. Your size category\
  \ decreases by one step and you gain the relevant bonuses and penalties of your\
  \ new size. Your abilities and speed remain unchanged, and all equipment you wear\
  \ or carry reduces appropriately in size. This transformation lasts for up to a\
  \ minute, and you can dismiss its effects as a free action."
