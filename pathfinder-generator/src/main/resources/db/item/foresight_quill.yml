description: "This plume always bears ink, as though freshly drawn from an inkwell.\
  \ Once per day, a character holding the quill can enter a trancelike state, automatically\
  \ writing possible upcoming events. After 1 minute of uninterrupted writing, the\
  \ writer chooses attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. The next time that day\
  \ she attempts a roll of the chosen type, she rolls twice and takes the more favorable\
  \ result. The next time that day she attempts a roll of one of the other types (for\
  \ example, a saving throw or skill check if she initially chose attack roll), she\
  \ must roll twice and take the less favorable result."
