description: "This thick iron gauntlet is more an encasing than a piece of armor.\
  \ It has only a few moving joints, and the position of its fingers and wrist must\
  \ be adjusted and locked into place before the wielder can properly slip it over\
  \ her arm. When wearing a metal glove, it is impossible to manipulate one's digits\
  \ (meaning the wearer cannot hold anything in that hand), but that hand and forearm\
  \ are completely protected from injury, making it easy to reach into a trapped hole\
  \ or a deadly animal's cage. Any trap or creature attempting to damage an arm wearing\
  \ a metal glove must break through the glove before reaching the wearer. Heavy objects\
  \ that would normally crush the wearer's hand rest harmlessly on the glove instead,\
  \ likely trapping the item but allowing her to pull her hand out as normal. A metal\
  \ glove has hardness 10 and 15 hit points, and can withstand 2,000 pounds of pressure\
  \ before crumpling. It does not protect the wearer from injury to other parts of\
  \ her body."
