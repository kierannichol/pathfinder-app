description: "A creature under the effect of this enchantment enters a state of euphoria.\
  \ The target treats all creatures as dear friends and abhors violence, but may rise\
  \ up to protect itself if violence is perpetrated against it. Until the end of the\
  \ spell's duration, the creature's speed is halved, and it cannot make attacks or\
  \ cast spells. If the creature is attacked, it gets a Will saving throw. If the\
  \ saving throw succeeds, the creature can make act normally for 1 round. If the\
  \ saving throw fails, the creature moves half its speed away from the attacker as\
  \ its next action."
