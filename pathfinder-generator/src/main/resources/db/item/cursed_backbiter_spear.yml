description: "This is a +2 shortspear, but each time it is used in melee against a\
  \ foe and the attack roll is a natural 1, it damages its wielder instead of her\
  \ intended target. When the curse takes effect, the spear curls around to strike\
  \ its wielder in the back, automatically dealing the damage to the wielder. The\
  \ curse even functions when the spear is hurled, and in such a case the damage to\
  \ the hurler is doubled."
