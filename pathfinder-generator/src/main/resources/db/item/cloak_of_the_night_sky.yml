description: "This dark hooded cloak is decorated with embroidered comets, moons,\
  \ and stars along its edge. If the wearer sleeps while wearing the cloak, it protects\
  \ him from hot and cold environments, as endure elements, and the wearer can sleep\
  \ in medium armor without becoming fatigued. The wearer can use know direction once\
  \ per day.\nIf Desna is the wearer's patron, as a standard action the wearer can\
  \ cause additional celestial bodies to appear on the cloak so that they match the\
  \ current configuration in the sky above the wearer. The wearer can use longstrider\
  \ once per day. Once per day, the wearer can throw a tiny, white-burning meteor\
  \ that acts as a flare effect. Some priests of Desna claim to have cloaks of this\
  \ type that also allow them to travel from shadow to shadow when under a starry\
  \ night sky."
