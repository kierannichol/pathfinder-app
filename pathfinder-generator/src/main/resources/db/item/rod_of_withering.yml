description: "A rod of withering acts as a +1 light mace that deals no hit point damage.\
  \ Instead, the wielder deals 1d4 points of Strength damage and 1d4 points of Constitution\
  \ damage to any creature she touches with the rod (by making a melee touch attack).\
  \ If she scores a critical hit, the damage from that hit is permanent ability drain.\
  \ In either case, the defender negates the effect with a DC 17 Fortitude save."
