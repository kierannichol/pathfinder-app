description: "In addition to granting the same bonus on Perform (dance) checks as\
  \ regular dancer's garb, silver dancer's garb is considered a silver instrument\
  \ for silver balladeer bards (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 115). Silver dancer's\
  \ garb can be made of sunsilver (see below); sunsilver dancer's garb costs an additional\
  \ 3,000 gp and grants the same benefits as armor made of sunsilver. As with the\
  \ bonus on Perform (dance) checks, this benefit functions only when no other armor\
  \ or concealing clothing is worn."
