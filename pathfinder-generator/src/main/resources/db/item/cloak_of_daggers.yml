description: "This heavy black cloak is trimmed with silver brocade and jingles ever\
  \ so slightly when disturbed. The wearer of a cloak of daggers can draw daggers\
  \ as a free action as though she possessed the Quick Draw feat; if she already has\
  \ the Quick Draw feat, drawing a single hidden dagger becomes a free action. Once\
  \ per day, the wearer can perform a cartwheel as a standard action at any point\
  \ during a move action, creating a 15-foot cone of daggers that deals an amount\
  \ of piercing damage equal to the wearer's sneak attack damage (minimum 1d6). A\
  \ successful Reflex save (DC = 10 + the number of the wearer's sneak attack dice\
  \ + the wearer's Intelligence modifier) halves the damage. The daggers disappear\
  \ immediately."
