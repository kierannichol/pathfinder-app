description: "This sky-blue glass bottle sports a sculpture of a silver eagle wrapped\
  \ around the top of the glass. A winged bottle can be filled with the contents of\
  \ an alchemical splash weapon as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.\
  \ Three times per day, on command, the bottle sprouts crystalline wings and takes\
  \ flight. The owner can move the winged bottle to any space within 130 feet as a\
  \ move action; if given no direction, the bottle floats in place. While flying,\
  \ the bottle is able to drop its contents as a splash weapon with an attack bonus\
  \ equal to 3 + the owner's Dexterity modifier. The owner must have line of sight\
  \ to the bottle in order to direct it. Three rounds after being activated, a winged\
  \ bottle loses the power of flight and drifts safely to ground."
