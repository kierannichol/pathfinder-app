description: "These massive horseshoes sport deadly spikes that jut from their front.\
  \ Once per day on command, the rider of a mount wearing these shoes may choose to\
  \ either increase the mount's size by one size increment (maximum Huge), or change\
  \ its type to magical beast, as beast shape IV. In addition, while the mount is\
  \ augmented in either of these two ways, it gains DR/5 chaos, evil, good, or law\
  \ (selected by the rider). These horseshoes are part of a set and require all four\
  \ to be worn by the same animal to properly function."
