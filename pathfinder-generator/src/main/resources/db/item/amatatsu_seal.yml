description: "This stone statuette of a dragon is one of five royal seals of Minkai,\
  \ and represents the Amatatsu family's divine right to rule the empire of Minkai.\
  \ Should no Amatatsus of pure blood be able to take up that charge, however, the\
  \ Amatatsu Seal can invest the right to rule as an Amatatsu in any number of living\
  \ humanoid hosts. These Amatatsu scions often experience a series of visions of\
  \ the past, present, and possible future.The Amatatsu Seal has a daily allotment\
  \ of 5 charges that it can use to cast the following spells on an Amatatsu scion:\
  \ cure serious wounds, remove curse, remove disease, or restoration. Each casting\
  \ uses up 1 daily charge. Alternatively, the seal can cast heal on an Amatatsu scion,\
  \ but doing so expends all 5 charges. Finally, and only at the seal's discretion,\
  \ it can cast resurrection on an Amatatsu scion, but doing so renders its spellcasting\
  \ powers useless for a month.The Amatatsu Seal itself radiates strong magic, and\
  \ those with the proper resources can sense this magic across oceans and continents,\
  \ allowing it to be tracked across any distance. Originally meant to allow its rightful\
  \ owners the ability to track it if stolen, this feature makes it dangerous to remove\
  \ the seal from its warding box, for as long as the warding box is open, the oni\
  \ of the Five Storms can track it. The repercussions of this are detailed in later\
  \ adventures in the Jade Regent Adventure Path."
destruction: "To destroy the Amatatsu Seal, rightful scions of each of the five royal\
  \ families of Minkai must, of their own free will, cast their families' seals together\
  \ into the Well of Demons in the Imperial Shrine in Kasai Harbor."
