description: "This ornately carved ironwood ring is sometimes gifted to half-elves\
  \ leaving their elven communities so as to ease transition into human culture. A\
  \ ring of culturemeld slightly alters the wearer's words to be more appropriate\
  \ to the listener's culture and expectations, granting the wearer a +5 competence\
  \ bonus on language-based Diplomacy checks.\nIf worn by a half-elf, a ring of culturemeld\
  \ grants the wearer the ability to speak and understand an additional language dependent\
  \ on the local area. If the wearer spends 1 day in a settlement the size of a village\
  \ or larger, the ring becomes attuned to any dominant language spoken there other\
  \ than Common (such as Hallit, Skald, or Vudrani). After the ring is attuned, the\
  \ wearer gains that language as a bonus language (if she didn't already know it),\
  \ though she can only speak and understand it. After 4 more days of attunement,\
  \ the wearer gains the ability to read the language as well, though not the ability\
  \ to write that language, and gains a +5 competence bonus on opposed Sense Motive\
  \ checks against speakers of the attuned language. These benefits expire once the\
  \ wearer has been out of contact with people who speak the attuned language for\
  \ longer than 1 day or when the ring becomes attuned to a new language."
