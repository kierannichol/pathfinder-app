description: "On command, these rat-fur boots summon a rat swarm underneath the wearer\
  \ that moves with her and acts as a living carpet. As a move action, the wearer\
  \ can travel on the backs of the rats as they swim, moving up to 15 feet across\
  \ the surface of calm waters. If surface conditions become worse than calm, the\
  \ rats disperse and the wearer falls. On land, the swarm allows the wearer to ignore\
  \ difficult terrain's effects on her movement for up to 15 feet of movement per\
  \ round. The swarm can be used for up to 10 minutes per day. This duration doesn't\
  \ need to be continuous, but must be used in 1-minute increments.\nIf the wearer\
  \ falls unconscious while rat-tread boots are active, on the wearer's next turn\
  \ the swarm tries to move her away from the nearest foe, moving 5 feet before dispersing.\
  \ This movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If such movement is impossible,\
  \ the swarm disperses.\nThe swarm is a normal rat swarm, except its area doesn't\
  \ exceed that of the wearer and it can't move out of the wearer's space. The swarm\
  \ disperses when the effect's duration ends or when the swarm is reduced to 0 hit\
  \ points or fewer. Rat-tread boots grant the wearer immunity from the attacks of\
  \ rat swarms, including their special attacks."
