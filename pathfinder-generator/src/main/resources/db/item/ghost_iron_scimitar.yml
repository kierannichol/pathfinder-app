description: "When Xin learned that the runelords had invested their champions with\
  \ the swords known as the Alara'hai —the Swords of Sin —he decided that he deserved\
  \ such a weapon for his champion as well. Unfortunately, his attempt to create an\
  \ eighth Alara'hai failed. Despite his skill and power, Xin simply couldn't equal\
  \ even the least of the other Swords of Sin, a truth that vexed and humiliated him.\
  \ The weapon he created, the ghost iron scimitar, was a significant weapon, but\
  \ it was hardly an artifact. It wasn't even intelligent. Ashamed of the weapon,\
  \ but secretly harboring the hope that someday he'd figure out how to improve it,\
  \ Xin secreted the sword away in a Skymetal Vault and forgot about it.\nThe ghost\
  \ iron scimitar is a +2 dancing keen ghost touch inubrix scimitar. The weapon has\
  \ been magically enhanced so that it still deals normal weapon damage for its size\
  \ and is not treated as being broken, despite being made from a soft skymetal. It\
  \ ignores armor and shield bonuses granted by metal objects. Although the weapon\
  \ cannot damage metal creatures (and is thus not very effective against the clockwork\
  \ reliquary), it can be presented to the clockwork reliquary as an example of one\
  \ of Xin's failures to aid in triggering its unstable mind."
