description: "An angel's clarion is a graceful trumpet whose bell unfolds like the\
  \ petals of a flower. These trumpets are usually platinum or silver near the mouthpiece,\
  \ transforming to a rose gold at the bell.\nThree times per day when an angel's\
  \ clarion is sounded, it releases a blast that sounds like the chiming, resonant\
  \ voices of an angelic choir. Any goodaligned creatures in a 30-foot cone emanating\
  \ from the trumpet are washed in positive energy and healed for 3d8+5 points of\
  \ damage. This energy only affects good-aligned creatures; neutral and evil creatures\
  \ receive no benefit and undead creatures are not harmed. A carpet of flowers springs\
  \ up beneath the 30-foot cone, growing and blooming in seconds. Any evil-aligned\
  \ creatures within the area of effect must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be\
  \ treated as if in the area of an entangle spell. The entangling flowers persist\
  \ for 5 minutes."
