  \ fine vellum. If you have a Charisma of 13 or higher, or at least 1 rank in Perform\
  \ (oratory), you can read aloud prayers from the book before battle to hearten others\
  \ for the trials to come. Reading prayers for this effect takes 10 minutes. You\
  \ grant those who hear your prayers a +2 morale bonus on the next saving throw against\
  \ fear they attempt, as long as that saving throw is made in the next 24 hours."
