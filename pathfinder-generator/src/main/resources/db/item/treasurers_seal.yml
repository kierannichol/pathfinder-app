description: "Six inches in diameter, one side of this porcelain seal shows a many-keyholed\
  \ padlock, while the other displays a lightning bolt superimposed on an open hand.\
  \ The padlock side is used to lock and alarm doors, chests, and other portals. The\
  \ bearer may speak a command word to activate it when holding it against a lockable\
  \ item. If the padlock side of the seal is touching the item, it bestows an alarm\
  \ (mental alarm) and arcane lock on the target item. If the lightning bolt side\
  \ of the seal is touching the item, it casts fire trap on the lock (the seal must\
  \ be held to the lock for 10 minutes to use this ability).\nA creature carrying\
  \ the seal can speak a command word to suspend its effects on an item for 1 minute.\
  \ This ability is usable at will, but only works on effects created by that specific\
  \ seal.\nThe seal can be used at will but can only maintain effects on three items\
  \ at any given time. Using it on a fourth item automatically negates the oldest\
  \ effect."
