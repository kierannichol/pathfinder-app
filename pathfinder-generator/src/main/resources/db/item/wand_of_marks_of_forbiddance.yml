name: "Wand of Marks Of Forbiddance"
description: "Marks of Forbiddancemagically brand two creatures, preventing them from\
  \ committing violence against one another. When you cast this spell choose one enemy\
  \ and one ally within range. Both targets become branded with the sigil of forbiddance.\
  \ Until the end of the spell's duration, in order for the two targets to attack\
  \ one another, even with a targeted spell, each attacker must attempt a Will save.\
  \ If the save succeeds, that target can attack the other normally. If the save fails,\
  \ the target can't follow through with the attack and the action is lost. This spell\
  \ does not prevent the targets from attacking each other with area of effect spells\
  \ or abilities."
