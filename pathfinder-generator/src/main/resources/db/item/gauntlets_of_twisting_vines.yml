description: "These wrist wraps are actually dark, thorny vines that constantly move\
  \ and twist around the wearer's hands of their own accord. The wearer gains a +2\
  \ circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks to disarm, grapple, and steal. Once\
  \ per day when the wearer successfully pins a foe with a grapple check, the vines\
  \ can move off the wearer (ending the circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks),\
  \ envelop the target, and tie it up. A tied-up victim can escape the vines by succeeding\
  \ at a combat maneuver or Escape Artist check with a DC equal to the result of the\
  \ combat maneuver check that pinned the victim. The character who was wearing the\
  \ gauntlets when they were used to envelop a target can remove them from the target\
  \ as a move action. Any other creature must succeed at a combat maneuver or Strength\
  \ check at the same DC to pry the gauntlets loose of an enveloped target."
