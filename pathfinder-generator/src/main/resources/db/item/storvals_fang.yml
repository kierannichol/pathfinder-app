description: "This metal +1 klar is shaped like the head of a storm roc, whose sharp\
  \ feathers serve as the klar's spikes, and it hums and crackles like a distant stormy\
  \ sky. When used to make a shield bash attack, a Storval's fang deals an additional\
  \ 1d6 points of sonic damage. In addition, the wielder gains electricity resistance\
  \ 5. When the wielder confirms a critical hit with a Storval's fang, it unleashes\
  \ a thunderclap, deafening the target of the critical hit for 1 minute unless that\
  \ target succeeds at a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw.\nIf the wielder of a Storval's\
  \ fang also wields a Storval's thunder and uses the Thunder and Fang feat, each\
  \ weapon deals an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage, the DCs to negate\
  \ their critical hit effects increase by 2, and a creature that fails such a saving\
  \ throw is also pushed back 10 feet and knocked prone."
