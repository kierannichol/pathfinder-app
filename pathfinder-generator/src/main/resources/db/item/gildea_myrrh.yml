description: "Known colloquially as \"healing myrrh,\" gildea myrrh is the most famous\
  \ invention of the scholars of Katheer's Venicaan College of Medicaments and Chirurgery.\n\
  When you burn a dose of gildea myrrh, it fills a 15-foot-radius spread with faint\
  \ smoke that persists for 24 hours (or until dispersed by a moderate or stronger\
  \ wind). Any creatures resting or receiving long-term care in the area while the\
  \ myrrh is active regain 1 additional hit point per level. Multiple uses of gildea\
  \ myrrh in a 24-hour period do not stack."
