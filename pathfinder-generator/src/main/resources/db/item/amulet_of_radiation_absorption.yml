description: "This amulet features a large, ragged stone that was harvested from highly\
  \ radioactive regions of the Darklands and that glows with a faint green light.\
  \ The wearer is rendered immune to the effects of all forms of radiation. Additionally,\
  \ for each minute the wearer is exposed to radiation, the amulet absorbs 1 charge\
  \ of radioactive energy. The amulet can hold up to 5 charges. Charges naturally\
  \ dissipate at a rate of 1 charge per 24 hours. As a standard action, the wearer\
  \ can expend 1 charge in order to fire a ray of concentrated radiation from the\
  \ amulet. Treat this as a ranged touch attack with a range of 60 feet. The wearer\
  \ can choose any one of the following effects, as outlined below.\nBlightburn: The\
  \ target takes 6d6 points of fire damage.\nCaphorite: The target must succeed at\
  \ a DC 14 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.\nLazurite: The target takes\
  \ 2d6 points of negative energy damage, and if it dies in the next hour, there is\
  \ a 50% chance it rises as a ghoul 1d4 rounds later.\nSurface: The target takes\
  \ 1d2 points of Strength and Constitution damage."
