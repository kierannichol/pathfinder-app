description: "The ring of the recalled soul allows the wearer to open a door into\
  \ a nearby mindscape they are aware of as if using the spell mindscape door, but\
  \ the targeted creature cannot resist this effect with a Will save. If the ring's\
  \ wearer connects to the mindscape, he can designate up to 10 other creatures to\
  \ be able to see and pass through the door as though it were a normal doorway. The\
  \ ring grants no ability to detect mindscapes, so the wearer must already be aware\
  \ of its existence via interactions, hearsay, or the detect mindscape spell.\nOnce\
  \ the ring's wearer has connected to the mindscape, he can open the door to that\
  \ particular mindscape from anywhere on the same plane, so long as the mindscape\
  \ still exists. Physical distance poses no barrier to the mindscape. Each time the\
  \ ring's wearer opens the door to a mindscape he has previously visited, he can\
  \ alter the designated creatures allowed to pass through the door as if he were\
  \ opening the door for the first time.\nThe ring's wearer cannot prevent creatures\
  \ within the mindscape from exiting to the real world so long as the door is open.\
  \ The ring's wearer can close the door to the mindscape at any time as long as he\
  \ is not within the mindscape."
