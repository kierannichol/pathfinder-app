description: "These fine, gray ashes usually come in a black leather bag covered in\
  \ various symbols of bad luck. When the contents of the bag are flung into the air,\
  \ the ashes coat creatures within a 10-foot radius of the user, causing them to\
  \ take a –4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks\
  \ for 2d4 rounds. The user is immune to this effect."
