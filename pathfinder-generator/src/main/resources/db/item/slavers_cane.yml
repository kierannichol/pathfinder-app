description: "Katapeshi slave masters and enforcers sometimes use slaver's canes to\
  \ put down insubordinates or recapture escaped property. The head of the studded\
  \ black +1 adamantine light mace sports numerous cruel spikes, and a series of chains\
  \ around the grip of the mace make it difficult to wrench from the wielder's hands\
  \ (granting the wielder a +4 bonus to CMD versus attempts to disarm the weapon).\
  \ In addition, the command word of the slaver's cane can be spoken once per day\
  \ to create a 10-foot-radius resilient sphere around a target within 90 feet (Reflex\
  \ DC 16 negates) that lasts for 10 minutes."
