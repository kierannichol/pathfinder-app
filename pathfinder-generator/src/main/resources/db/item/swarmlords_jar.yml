description: "This small, lidded jar contains a sizable deformed insect that twitches\
  \ and wriggles as if constantly undergoing a particularly painful death. A swarmlord's\
  \ jar has a lid, but the lid is fused to the rest of the jar and cannot be opened.\
  \ While a swarmlord's jar is carried openly in one hand, it grants a +2 luck bonus\
  \ on all saving throws attempted against the attacks of swarms, and reduces swarm\
  \ damage taken by the target by 5 points. These effects do not stack if more than\
  \ one jar is carried.\nA swarmlord's jar can be thrown to shatter at any point within\
  \ 30 feet. If the jar shatters in a square that isn't currently occupied by an existing\
  \ swarm, it creates a locust swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 183) that follows\
  \ the thrower's mental commands; these commands may be issued as a free action.\
  \ If the jar shatters in a square occupied by a swarm, the swarm must succeed at\
  \ a DC 15 Will save or become controlled by the thrower. Issuing mental commands\
  \ to a swarm (whether it's a freshly created locust swarm or a controlled swarm)\
  \ is a move action, but once the swarm has been issued orders, it continues to follow\
  \ those orders until it's destroyed or the magic of the swarmlord's jar ends. A\
  \ locust swarm created by this item lasts for 1 minute if not destroyed earlier.\
  \ Likewise, control granted by the jar lasts for 1 minute. Used against a worm that\
  \ walks, a swarmlord's jar merely deals 6d6 points of damage on a successful touch\
  \ attack as it shatters (Will DC 15 half)."
