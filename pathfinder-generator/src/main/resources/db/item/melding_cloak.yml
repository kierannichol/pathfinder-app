description: "This cloak is lined with thin strings of varying colors that shift in\
  \ color to match surrounding material such as dirt, grass, or stone. This grants\
  \ the wearer a +2 competence bonus on Stealth checks. As a standard action, the\
  \ wearer is able to physically meld into material such as wood, plaster, or stone\
  \ (but not metal or other heavily worked materials), appearing as a dim shadow on\
  \ the surface. The wearer can move across any exposed portion of the material at\
  \ half her normal movement speed, allowing her to travel up walls or across floors.\
  \ While melded with material in this manner, the wearer gains a +10 circumstance\
  \ bonus on Stealth checks. The wearer can meld with material for up to 10 minutes\
  \ per day. This duration need not be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute\
  \ increments.\nNearby creatures can notice the melded wearer with a successful Perception\
  \ check. The wearer can be targeted normally while melded with material. If the\
  \ wearer takes any damage while melded, or if the surface material is manipulated\
  \ with stone shape, warp wood, or similar spells, the wearer is immediately shunted\
  \ out of the material into the nearest open space."
