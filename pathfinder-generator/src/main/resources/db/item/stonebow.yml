description: "A stonebow, or bullet crossbow, resembles a light crossbow except for\
  \ the distinct U-shaped bend in the stock. Instead of bolts, the stonebow shoots\
  \ sling bullets. The bow has two strings with a leather pocket between them to hold\
  \ the bullet. Loading a stonebow is a move action (a free action if you have the\
  \ Rapid Reload feat) that provokes attacks of opportunity.\nYou can shoot ordinary\
  \ stones with a stonebow, but stones aren't as dense or as round as bullets. When\
  \ using stones, you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls and deal damage as if the\
  \ weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you.\nYou can\
  \ shoot, but not load, a stonebow with one hand, but doing so imposes a –2 penalty\
  \ on your attack rolls. You can shoot a stonebow with each hand, but you take a\
  \ penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons. This penalty is\
  \ cumulative with the penalty for firing one-handed."
