  \ grants the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution, which adds the usual\
  \ benefits to hit points, Fortitude saves, Constitution checks, and so forth. Hit\
  \ points gained by a temporary increase in Constitution score are not temporary\
  \ hit points. They go away when the subject's Constitution drops back to normal.\
  \ They are not lost first as temporary hit points are."
