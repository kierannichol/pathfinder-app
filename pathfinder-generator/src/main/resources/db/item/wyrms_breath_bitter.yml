description: "This green-tinged brew has a pungent, bitter bite. It's flavored with\
  \ a variety of foulsmelling herbs and is intensely carbonated through a unique fermentation\
  \ process. Sometimes given to visitors as a prank, wyrm's breath bitter causes the\
  \ drinker to become sickened for 1d6 minutes (Fortitude DC 12 negates); dwarves\
  \ gain a +5 racial bonus on this saving throw. After drinking a dose of wyrm's breath\
  \ bitter, the drinker can, as a move action, unleash a thunderous and noxious belch\
  \ in either a 5-foot-radius spread or a 10-foot cone. Creatures in the area are\
  \ deafened and sickened for 1 round (Fortitude DC 12 negates). The drinker must\
  \ wait 1d4 rounds before belching again, but can belch as often as desired for up\
  \ to 10 minutes after drinking a wyrm's breath bitter."
