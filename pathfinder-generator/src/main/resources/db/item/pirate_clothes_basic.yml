description: "Pirates can appear in a variety of clothing styles, but most wear a\
  \ basic outfit consisting of a linen shirt, canvas knee-breeches, cotton stockings,\
  \ and leather shoes (though some pirates prefer to go barefoot at sea). In addition,\
  \ well-to-do pirates, particularly pirate captains, often add fancy touches to their\
  \ outfits, such as colorful jackets of velvet or silk done up with brass buttons,\
  \ tall leather boots, ruffled collars, and plumed hats. Sailors in warmer climates\
  \ may instead go shirtless and wear nothing but loose pantaloons."
