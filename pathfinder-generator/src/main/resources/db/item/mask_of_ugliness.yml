description: "This strange, featureless mask seems to have the powers of a headband\
  \ of alluring charisma +4, but instead of granting a bonus to Charisma, the mask\
  \ melds to the wearer's face, making him seem uglier and his words come off as crude\
  \ and insulting. The wearer takes a â€“4 penalty to Bluff and Diplomacy checks but\
  \ gains a +2 bonus to Intimidate checks."
