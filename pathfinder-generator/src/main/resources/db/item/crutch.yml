description: "A crutch is a simple device composed of wood or metal and held under\
  \ the arm to assist the injured or impaired with walking. Using a crutch requires\
  \ a free hand, but does not impede movement speed for an experienced user. A Medium\
  \ crutch can be wielded as a simple one-handed melee weapon that deals 1d4 points\
  \ of bludgeoning damage."
