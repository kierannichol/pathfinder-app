description: "These black, rubbery gloves have sharpened digits. Fine channels lead\
  \ to the tip of each finger, which are often stained with foul chemicals. The gloves\
  \ are used primarily by assassins to deliver poisons while in combat. Each glove\
  \ may be filled with a single dose of poison, a potion, alchemist infusion, holy\
  \ water, or similar liquid as long as the liquid would not harm the gloves (for\
  \ example, alchemist's fire and acid cannot be used). The wearer can deliver the\
  \ dose to a target as a melee touch attack or as part of an unarmed strike or natural\
  \ attack with the hands (such as a claw or slam attack). In the case of a personal\
  \ infused extract, the opponent receives both a Fortitude save and spell resistance.\
  \ The wearer can use both gloves in the same round using two-weapon fighting or\
  \ multiple natural attacks (such as 2 slams or 2 claws). Each glove can be used\
  \ once per day. Filling a glove is a full-round action that provokes attacks of\
  \ opportunity."
