description: "A volatile mix of incendiary reagents, unstable accelerant can be thrown\
  \ just like alchemist's fire. In the hands of an alchemist, a flask of unstable\
  \ accelerant can be used as part of creating a bomb, increasing its fire damage\
  \ by +1d6 points. It has no effect on bombs that do not deal fire damage. If the\
  \ bomb lasts for more than an instant, the extra damage only applies to the first\
  \ round's damage."
