description: "Weapon cords are 2-foot-long leather straps that attach your weapon\
  \ to your wrist. If you drop your weapon or are disarmed, you can recover it as\
  \ a move action, and it never moves any farther away from you than an adjacent square.\
  \ However, you cannot switch to a different weapon without first untying the cord\
  \ (a full-round action) or cutting it (a move action or an attack, hardness 0, 1\
  \ hit point). Unlike with a locked gauntlet, you can still use a hand with a weapon\
  \ cord, though a dangling weapon may interfere with finer actions."
