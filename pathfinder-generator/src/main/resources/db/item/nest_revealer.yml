description: "This small vial is sealed with a fine metal cap engraved with the visage\
  \ of a noble hound. When a few drops of a creature's blood are placed in the vial,\
  \ it begins to fill on its own, replicating the creature's blood over the span of\
  \ 1 minute. After 1 minute, the vial shatters and a small fist-sized orb of crystallized\
  \ blood falls to the ground. This animate orb rolls in the direction of the last\
  \ location in which the source creature slept for at least 1 hour. The blood travels\
  \ at a rate of 20 feet per round and can travel up to 10 miles over the span of\
  \ 5 hours. If the orb does not reach the creature's nest within 5 hours, it collapses\
  \ into a puddle containing enough blood to activate another nest revealer."
