description: "The M1917 is a modified M1914 grenade specially modified and enlarged\
  \ to release a cloud of toxic gas upon detonation. Resembling an overlarge metal\
  \ can with a small lever and handle protruding from the bottom, the grenade is armed\
  \ by pulling back on a metal firing pin held in place by the handle's depressed\
  \ lever, which is released when thrown. At the beginning of your next turn, the\
  \ grenade spews forth a cloud of mustard gas (see the sidebar on this page) in a\
  \ 20-foot radius. The cloud disperses naturally after 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+\
  \ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round."
