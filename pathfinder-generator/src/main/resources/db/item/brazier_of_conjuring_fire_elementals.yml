description: "This device appears to be a normal container for holding burning coals.\
  \ The brazier must be filled with coals or wood and a fire lit within it to function.\
  \ On command as a full-round action, the bearer may summon a fire elemental. If\
  \ 1 pound of brimstone (sulfur) is burning in the brazier, it conjures a Huge fire\
  \ elemental as if using summon monster VI. Otherwise, the brazier conjures a Large\
  \ fire elemental as if using summon monster V. Conjuring an elemental extinguishes\
  \ the fire in the brazier. The brazier cannot summon another elemental until the\
  \ previous one is dismissed, killed, or the duration of its summoning expires."
