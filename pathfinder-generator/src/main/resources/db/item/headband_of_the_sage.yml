description: "A headband of vast intellect +6 also holds a consciousness that shares\
  \ its knowledge and education with a suitable wearer. This intellect can be of any\
  \ alignment and its only purpose is to share its vast knowledge with its wearer.\
  \ The headband also functions as a helm of comprehend languages and read magic.\
  \ Furthermore, instead of granting the normal skill ranks of a headband of vast\
  \ intellect +6, this headband grants 4 ranks in six skills, but all of those skills\
  \ must be Knowledge skills. It grants such intelligence by a stream of constant\
  \ whispers and arguments that the headband communicates telepathically in Common\
  \ or in one of 10 other languages it knows. Once per week on command, the wearer\
  \ can also convince the headband to use legend lore as the spell, though the casting\
  \ time is only a standard action."
