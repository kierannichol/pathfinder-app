description: "This black leather tricorne hat is weather-beaten and salt-stained.\
  \ It grants its wearer a +2 competence bonus on Profession (sailor) and Swim checks.\n\
  If Besmara is the wearer's patron, once per day the wearer can speak a command word\
  \ to transform the hat into a small ship's boat such as a cutter, jolly boat, or\
  \ longboat (Skull & Shackles Player's Guide 25). The boat is 20 feet long, has two\
  \ pairs of oars and a single mast with a square sail, and can carry up to 12 passengers\
  \ and crew. Upon command, or after 8 hours, the boat returns to its hat form, dumping\
  \ out any occupants."
