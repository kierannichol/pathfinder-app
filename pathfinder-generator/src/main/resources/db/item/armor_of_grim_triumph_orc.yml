description: "The following suit of armor is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nSpikes of impractical length adorn this +1 spiked\
  \ breastplate. The armor's enhancement bonus applies on attack rolls and damage\
  \ rolls for attacks made with the armor spikes, as well as to its armor bonus to\
  \ AC.\nAs a full-round action, the wearer can claim a trophy from a slain foe and\
  \ mount it on the armor's spikes, gaining a +1 competence bonus on Intimidate checks\
  \ and a +1 morale bonus on Will saves against fear. Each additional trophy mounted\
  \ on the armor's spikes increases these bonuses by 1. As an immediate action before\
  \ rolling to confirm a critical hit, the wearer can call upon the armor to gain\
  \ a morale bonus on the attack roll to confirm the critical hit equal to the total\
  \ number of trophies on the armor. Doing so consumes one of the trophies.\nThe armor\
  \ can hold up to four trophies. To provide any benefit, trophies must be from creatures\
  \ that were slain by the wearer and whose Hit Dice were equal to at least half of\
  \ the wearer's total Hit Dice. The armor's magic keeps the trophies from rotting\
  \ away completely, but does nothing to keep them fresh or hide the stench of rotting\
  \ flesh.\nSuits of armor of grim triumph find use mainly among the orcs of Belkzen\
  \ and the Darklands. In the Mwangi Expanse, orcs use the similar hide of grim triumph,\
  \ which is +1 spiked hide armor crafted from tanned animal hides and foot-long thorns.\
  \ Reduce the cost and price of a hide of grim triumph by 185 gp and the weight by\
  \ 10 pounds."
