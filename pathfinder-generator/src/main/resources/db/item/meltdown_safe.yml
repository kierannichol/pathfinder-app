description: "This iron safe is only 6 inches wide by 6 inches tall, but it opens\
  \ into an extrtadimensional spaceâ€”its inside is larger than its outside dimensions,\
  \ as a type 1 bag of holding. The intricate lock on the door is of superior quality\
  \ (Disable Device DC 40) and has a powerful security feature: if any attempt to\
  \ pick the lock is unsuccessful, the inner space floods with magic fire and the\
  \ contents begin taking 5d6 points of fire damage per round. After 10 rounds of\
  \ extreme heat, the safe fully consumes itself and is reduced to a pile of ash.\
  \ If the door is opened through any means during these 10 rounds, blasts of searing\
  \ hot fire spew forth in a 15-foot cone that deals 5d6 points of fire damage (Reflex\
  \ DC 23 half) for the remaining rounds."
