description: "Often worn on the little finger, this ring grants its wearer a +4 competence\
  \ bonus on Sense Motive and Knowledge (local) checks. Also, once per day on command,\
  \ the wearer can use the ring to cast either locate creature or locate object (the\
  \ wearer's choice). Furthermore, on command and at will, the wearer can instantly\
  \ know the direction from herself to the nearest tavern, pub, or similar watering\
  \ hole as long as that establishment is in a settlement whose population is equivalent\
  \ to that of a village or greater (GameMastery Guide 203) and that is within 20\
  \ miles of the wearer."
