description: "This shepherd's crook is formed of alternating bands of ivory and obsidian\
  \ around a sycamore shaft. Golden runes run the length of the staff, twisting into\
  \ new configurations as its various powers are used. The staff of the scholar has\
  \ all the powers of a regular staff of the magi plus the following abilities: contact\
  \ other plane (2 charges), legend lore (2 charges), and scrying (2 charges). If\
  \ the wielder of the staff of the scholar uses its retributive strike ability and\
  \ successfully travels to another plane of existence, he always arrives in the abode\
  \ of a god of knowledge (though not necessarily a friendly one)."
destruction: "This item can be destroyed in the same manner as a normal staff of the\
  \ magi."
