description: "This tiny pearl swells to form a 1-foot-diameter soap-like bubble when\
  \ placed in water. Up to 5 cubic feet of goods can be placed inside the bubble vault.\
  \ On command, the bubble sinks to the bottom of the water, automatically burying\
  \ itself 1 foot deep in the bottom ground if there is mud or other loose material\
  \ present. If the command word is spoken three times within 30 feet of the bubble,\
  \ it rises to the surface of the water, at which time it can be opened and the items\
  \ within it retrieved. Once opened, the bubble reverts to its pearl form for 24\
  \ hours. The bubble is watertight but does not otherwise magically protect or preserve\
  \ its contents. If forced open, it has hardness 1 and 5 hit points."
