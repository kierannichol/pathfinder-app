description: "These gloves are made of a fine metal mesh. If a creature wearing rubble\
  \ gloves touches a 5-foot square of stone or earth floor, rubble roils to the surface,\
  \ making the square difficult terrain. Using the gloves is a standard action that\
  \ does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The wearer can use the gloves to create\
  \ up to 20 squares of difficult terrain per day."
