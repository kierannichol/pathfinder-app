description: "An offset bear trap is a specialized variety of a bear trap constructed\
  \ with offset jaws coated in resin. It inflicts less damage on captured creatures\
  \ but holds them more securely, and is therefore primarily used by trappers or bounty\
  \ hunters who do not want to risk killing their prey. Offset bear traps are almost\
  \ always secured to the ground by a heavy spike and chain so the captured creature\
  \ can't wander far.\nA sawtooth bear trap has vicious jaws and tighter springs.\
  \ Used primarily against humanoids or monsters rather than animals, sawtooth bear\
  \ traps are often painted in camouflaged colors to blend in with the trap site.\
  \ Most include locking plates over the spring mechanisms to prevent tampering by\
  \ intelligent victims."
