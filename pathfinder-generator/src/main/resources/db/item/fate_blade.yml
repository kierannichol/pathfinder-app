description: "This +1 dagger is etched with spiderweb designs and its hilt is shaped\
  \ like a skeleton that has been laid to rest. Pharasmin priests sometimes use these\
  \ daggers during ceremonies sacred to the Lady of Graves, such as to cut umbilical\
  \ cords of newborns or to lay beside the corpses of honored Pharasmins as their\
  \ spirits travel to their resting place in the Great Beyond. A fate blade counts\
  \ as a silver weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At will, the\
  \ wielder can use disrupt undead."
