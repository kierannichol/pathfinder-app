description: "The pages of this formula book are carefully varnished. Sprinkled among\
  \ the formulae are details and diagrams of alchemical devices, many of which seem\
  \ to defy the normal conventions of alchemy and physics. The last page contains\
  \ incomplete notes on the preparation of experimental mutagens."
