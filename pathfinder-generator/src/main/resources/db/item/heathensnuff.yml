description: "Others lacking the will to harden themselves appropriately turn to alchemical\
  \ methods to endure. This purplish paste is made from sea urchin toxins and numbs\
  \ the user's ability to sense pain. Illegal in Nidal, the drug is used mostly by\
  \ those attempting to emulate true belief in Zon-Kuthon or who anticipate great\
  \ pain. A dose gives the user the Endure Pain feat for 1 hour, though it also has\
  \ debilitating side effects and leaves telltale reddish-purple stains around the\
  \ nostrils for up to one day, easily identified by those familiar with the symptoms.\
  \ Followers of the Midnight Lord believe using heathensnuff is a sure sign that\
  \ an individual lacks faith.\nAnyone who takes the drug must make a DC 10 saving\
  \ throw or become addicted. A snuff addict can stave off withdrawal for 5 days by\
  \ taking a dose; failure means he must save or take 1d4 Dex and 1d4 Wis damage.\
  \ This save DC increases by +5 for every 5 days since the last time the addict had\
  \ a dose. If the addict makes two of these saves in a row, he is no longer addicted.\
  \ Remove disease can cure an addict if the caster's caster level check succeeds\
  \ against a DC equal to the addict's current withdrawal DC. Greater restoration\
  \ or heal cures the addiction without requiring a roll.\nType poison, ingested;\
  \ Save Fortitude DC 13\nFrequency 1/hour for 4 hours\nInitial Effect Endure Pain\
  \ feat for 1 hour (see above);\nSecondary Effect 1 Con damage; Cure 1 save\nCost\
  \ 10 gp"
