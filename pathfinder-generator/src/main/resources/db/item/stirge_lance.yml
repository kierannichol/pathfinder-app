description: "This +1 returning featherweight dart transforms into an insect-sized\
  \ stirge when fired. As with a normal featherweight dart, a stirge lancet deals\
  \ no damage; it instead administers 1 dose of an applied poison so long as the target\
  \ doesn't have damage reduction, hardness, or similar abilities. If no poison is\
  \ applied to the stirge lancet, it instead attaches to the target for 1 round and\
  \ draws 1 ounce of blood or an equivalent fluid (if any) from the target. After\
  \ applying poison or drawing blood, the dart flies through the air back to the creature\
  \ that fired it. Unlike other featherweight darts, a is not damaged or destroyed\
  \ when used, and can be reused indefinitely (though it can store only 1 dose of\
  \ poison or one blood sample at a time).\nAlthough a stirge lancet leaves no evidence,\
  \ the sound of its buzzing wings may attract attention. A creature hit by a stirge\
  \ lancet can attempt a Perception check to hear its humming; the DC for this check\
  \ is equal to 20 + the <>stirge lancet's"
