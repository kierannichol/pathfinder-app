description: "The fleshhook is an ancient ceremonial artifact used by high priests\
  \ to serve the sacred feast-meat from their cooking pots. This 4-foot-long wooden\
  \ pole is wrapped with three metal bands etched with elaborate cygnets and ravens—\
  one band at the base, one in the center, and one shaped into a headpiece that forks\
  \ into four sharpened tines. When recreating the ancient feasting ritual, which\
  \ takes 10 minutes, a mythic creature can use the fleshhook to imbue the meat served\
  \ upon its tines with his own mythic power. With each piece of meat served, the\
  \ bearer can transfer one use of mythic power to the creature that eats the meat.\n\
  If eaten by a mythic creature, the meat replenishes one use of mythic power. If\
  \ eaten by a non-mythic creature, it grants a single use of mythic power for 24\
  \ hours. For as long as that non-mythic creature holds this use of mythic power,\
  \ it's considered a mythic creature for the purposes of spells and effects, and\
  \ gains both the hard to kill and surge base mythic abilities. Once that use of\
  \ mythic power is spent, the creature loses these abilities and is no longer considered\
  \ mythic."
destruction: "A fleshhook of mythic sustenance snaps and become useless if used to\
  \ serve the rotten flesh of a mythic creature to a powerful outsider."
