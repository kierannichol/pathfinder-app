description: "A shoddy item is any mundane piece of equipment that has been cleverly\
  \ but poorly crafted such that its materials and workmanship are worse than expected,\
  \ but the flaws are concealed. Layers of material are thinner than normal, hasps\
  \ and hinges are only loosely attached, metals are mixed improperly, resulting in\
  \ softer alloys, and so forth. Shoddy items are sold for the same price as their\
  \ well-made counterparts. Manufacturing a shoddy item requires the Craft Shoddy\
  \ Item feat (see above) in order to successfully conceal the poor workmanship. Shoddy\
  \ items are never masterwork or made of special materials (though they might appear\
  \ to be made of a special material), and single-use items can never be made as shoddy\
  \ items.\nAny shoddy item has its hardness reduced by 2 and its hit points reduced\
  \ by half. Any weapon or piece of armor constructed in a shoddy manner takes damage\
  \ each time it is used; a weapon takes the same amount of damage it deals in an\
  \ attack (minus its lower hardness rating), and a piece of armor takes damage identical\
  \ to its wearer's loss in hit points from an enemy's successful attack (again, after\
  \ taking the adjusted hardness into account). Items other than weapons and armor\
  \ have a 10% chance to gain the broken condition with each day of use, and if they\
  \ have a limited number of uses, they have half as many uses as normal. In either\
  \ case, shoddy items that gain the broken condition can never have that condition\
  \ removed (even by using magic or if they later recover hit points) without further\
  \ successful Craft checks and gp expenditure to fix the initial flaws. Shoddy items\
  \ that are destroyed cannot be recovered by any means, and are useless for anything\
  \ more than salvaging some of the raw materials. A shoddy item typically costs the\
  \ same as a normal item of its kind.\nA character who succeeds at a DC 15 Appraise\
  \ (or appropriate Craft) check notices the shoddy condition of an item, but the\
  \ character must specifically inspect the item to do so."
