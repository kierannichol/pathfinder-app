description: "This elaborate wooden mask is carved in the image of Pharasma. The owner\
  \ of a death mask can place the mask upon a corpse to ask the corpse up to three\
  \ questions as if by speak with dead, except the corpse does not get a Will saving\
  \ throw if the mask's owner is of a different alignment than the corpse had in life.\
  \ This effect works as long as the head of the corpse is intact enough to fit the\
  \ mask onto, no matter how damaged the corpse is otherwise. A death mask functions\
  \ on a given corpse only once in this way; additional attempts to ask the corpse\
  \ questions fail.\nIf a living person dons the death mask, her appearance changes\
  \ to that of the last person whose corpse was spoken with using the mask, as alter\
  \ self. The wearer resembles the deceased person as she looked in life."
