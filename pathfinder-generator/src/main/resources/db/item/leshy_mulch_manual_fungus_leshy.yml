description: "A leshy mulch manual is a fragile, bark-bound book containing a dozen\
  \ pages of coarse, grainy paper. The book includes information and incantations\
  \ that help in crafting a leshy. The instructions grant a +3 competence bonus on\
  \ skill checks made to create a leshy, reduce the number of ranks in Knowledge (nature)\
  \ needed to create a leshy by 2, and allow the user to treat her caster level as\
  \ 2 higher for the purposes of creating a leshy. The book can also be chopped up\
  \ and mixed into the soil used to grow a leshy, replacing the normal crafting cost\
  \ for the leshy. When a leshy is cultivated from this soil, a spirit is automatically\
  \ lured into the body, with no percentile roll required."
