name: "Scroll of Transmute Rock to Mud"
description: "This spell turns natural, uncut, or unworked rock of any sort into an\
  \ equal volume of mud. Magical stone is not affected by the spell. The depth of\
  \ the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. A creature unable to levitate, fly, or\
  \ otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its\
  \ speed to 5 feet and causing a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls and AC. Brush or similar\
  \ material thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it.\
  \ Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed\
  \ of 5 feet."
