description: "The handle of this simple straw broom, or besom, is capped with a small\
  \ skull with long white hair. On command, the broom sweeps away any tracks or traces\
  \ of passage, as pass without trace, and wards its user with nondetection. The broom\
  \ can be used in this capacity for a total of 8 hours each day. By sweeping the\
  \ broom in a circular motion, the user can also learn the location of both secret\
  \ doors and simple natural traps at will, as detect secret doors and detect snares\
  \ and pits.\nBaba Yaga's besom can also be used up to three times per day to open\
  \ locks, doors, lids, shackles, chains, and the like by knocking it against the\
  \ item to be opened. The wielder must succeed at a caster level check using the\
  \ broom's caster level of 20th, with a DC equal to the Disable Device DC of the\
  \ lock or binding. Each knock opens only one form of locking, so if a chest is chained,\
  \ locked, and under an arcane lock, it takes all three uses of the broom to open\
  \ it. The broom automatically dispels a hold portal spell or arcane lock with a\
  \ caster level lower than 20th.\nLastly, Baba Yaga's besom can be used as a weapon,\
  \ functioning as a +4 dancing club. On a successful attack, a creature struck by\
  \ the broom is blinded for 1 round.\nThe broom may have other powers known only\
  \ to Baba Yaga."
destruction: "Baba Yaga's besom falls into pieces and is destroyed if it is used to\
  \ sweep all of the rooms in all configurations of Baba Yaga's Dancing Hut within\
  \ a 24-hour period."
