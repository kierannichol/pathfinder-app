description: "Spun from combed cotton, this simple, unassuming gown bears a strong\
  \ aura of witchcraft. These magical garments are highly sought after by witches,\
  \ for though anyone may wear a witching gown, only a witch may realize its full\
  \ potential. A witching gown grants its wearer a +2 resistance bonus on all saving\
  \ throws and a +2 competence bonus on all Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate skill\
  \ checks. When worn by a witch, these bonuses double.\nIn addition, a witch may\
  \ change the appearance and style of the gown to match her whims (as the glamered\
  \ armor special ability) and adopt virtually any disguise, gaining a +10 bonus on\
  \ Disguise checks that incorporate the gown's appearance. Only a true seeing spell\
  \ or similar magic can pierce this effect.\nLastly, a witch may cast a single touch\
  \ range spell of 4th level or lower into the gown. Thereafter, the gown holds the\
  \ magic for up to 24 hours, functioning as a spite spell against the next foe to\
  \ strike the witch with a successful melee attack or combat maneuver. The gown's\
  \ spite spell counts as an active spite effect for the witch wearing the gown."
