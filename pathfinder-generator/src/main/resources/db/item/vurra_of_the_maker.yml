description: "A vurra is a carving of a giant's head, usually a god but sometimes\
  \ a hero, loved one, or historical figure. This hand-sized gray stone is carved\
  \ to resemble a bearded, wise-looking man with a squarish skull. It has a leather\
  \ strap threaded through a hole in the top, and is strangely heavy for its size.\
  \ The wearer gains a +2 bonus on Craft (sculpting) checks. Once per day, the wearer\
  \ can use magic stone, and this ability can affect even the small boulders favored\
  \ by giants. The carved face grows stern and angry when worn by a creature with\
  \ a chaotic alignment, only returning to its normal expression when removed or in\
  \ the hands of a nonchaotic creature.\nIf the giant god Minderhal is the wearer's\
  \ patron, once per day the wearer may use owl's wisdom."
