description: "Resembling the more common nonmagical doctor's mask, a plaguebringer's\
  \ mask grants a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against nauseating scents and\
  \ immunity to one specific disease (the disease must be chosen at the time of the\
  \ mask's creationâ€”the ones in this adventure grant immunity to blood veil). The\
  \ mask also veils the wearer's alignment, making her aura register as neutral to\
  \ alignment-detecting effects."
