description: "Well-tanned leather binds this sturdy spellbook, with a copper plate\
  \ of a stylized animal head bolted to the front cover. A foreword filling the first\
  \ several pages of this book is addressed to \"young students of the Magaambya,\"\
  \ and offers warnings about the unexpected consequences of using spells without\
  \ careful consideration. The rest of the book contains spells, each proceeded and\
  \ followed by one or more stories discussing situations with thematic links to the\
  \ spell."
