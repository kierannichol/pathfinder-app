description: "You whisk yourself and willing allies out of a tight jam, or instantly\
  \ transfer yourselves to another location to achieve greater strategic positioning.\
  \ You can move any allies within range to any other space of your choosing within\
  \ range. Those spaces need not be in line of sight or line of effect from your original\
  \ position, but must be open locations on surfaces able to support the creatures\
  \ teleported. Except as noted above, this spell otherwise functions as dimension\
  \ door."
