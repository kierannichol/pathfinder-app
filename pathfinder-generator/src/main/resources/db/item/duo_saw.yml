description: "Sometimes referred to as a \"misery whip,\" this long blade (between\
  \ 4 and 12 feet) is lined with numerous metal teeth. Thick handholds at each end\
  \ of the blade allow a Medium or larger creature to grip one end with both hands.\
  \ When a creature pulls on a handle (a move action) with another creature on the\
  \ opposite side ready to pull after, those wielders can use the duo saw to cut through\
  \ an object at exceptional speeds. This maneuver deals 10 points of damage per round\
  \ of sawing to an object, ignoring up to 5 points of hardness on any nonmetallic\
  \ substance. These saws are typically employed in the felling of large trees."
