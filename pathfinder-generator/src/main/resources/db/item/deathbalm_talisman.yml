description: "A deathbalm talisman grants its wearer a +5 resistance bonus on Fortitude\
  \ saves against disease or poison, and if placed around the neck of an individual\
  \ already suffering the effects of poison or disease, it allows a new save (with\
  \ no additional bonus from the deathbalm talisman) to immediately remove the affliction.\
  \ Whenever a wearer successfully saves against the effects of disease or poison\
  \ while wearing a deathbalm talisman, it becomes dormant for 24 hours. After this\
  \ time has passed, it refreshes and functions again. A character who wears a functioning\
  \ deathbalm talisman for a period of 24 hours heals 1d4 points of ability damage\
  \ to any one ability score currently suffering ability damage."
