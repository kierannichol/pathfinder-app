description: "Made from a specially designed sling attached to a short club, a halfling\
  \ sling staff can be used by a proficient wielder to devastating effect. Your Strength\
  \ modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a halfling sling staff, just as\
  \ it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a halfling sling staff\
  \ with one hand. Loading a halfling sling staff is a move action that requires two\
  \ hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.\nA halfling sling staff fires bullets.\
  \ You can hurl ordinary stones with a halfling sling staff, but stones are not as\
  \ dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon\
  \ were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you and you take a\
  \ â€“1 penalty on attack rolls.\nA halfling sling staff can be used as a simple weapon\
  \ that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size. Halflings treat\
  \ halfling sling staves as martial weapons."
