description: "These magic items are usually crafted as lutes, though they can be fashioned\
  \ as other instruments. On command three times per day, the lute can transform into\
  \ a +1 spear, +1 longsword, or +1 battleaxe. The type of the weapon the instrument\
  \ transforms into must be chosen at creation, and the weapon must be appropriately\
  \ sized for the user of the instrument. The instrument takes weapon form for 1 minute,\
  \ or until its wielder uses another command word to transform it back to its normal\
  \ form."
