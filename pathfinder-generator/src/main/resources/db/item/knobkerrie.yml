description: "A knobkerrie, or iwisa, is carved from a single piece of hardwood with\
  \ a shaft 2 to 4 feet long surmounted by a bulbous knob. The knobkerrie is a traditional\
  \ hunting weapon among the Zenj people of the Mwangi, but it's also used as a symbol\
  \ of authority. Many tribal elders use decorated knobkerries as scepters or canes.\
  \ A knobkerrie is thrown end-over-end. If you are proficient, you gain a +1 bonus\
  \ on ranged attack rolls with a knobkerrie against opponents using bucklers, light\
  \ shields, or heavy shields. If you aren't proficient with a knobkerrie, treat it\
  \ as a club."
