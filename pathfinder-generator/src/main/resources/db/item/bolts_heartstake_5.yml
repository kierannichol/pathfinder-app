description: "Specially crafted from solid darkwood, heartstake bolts are specifically\
  \ designed to slay vampires. A heartstake bolt can be fired from any crossbow, but\
  \ it imposes a â€“2 penalty on the attack roll and halves the range increment of the\
  \ weapon. A vampire struck with a heartstake bolt takes the normal damage but must\
  \ also succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or fall to the ground helpless\
  \ for 1 round. While the vampire is helpless in this manner, a creature can attempt\
  \ to use the heartstake bolt to finish off the vampire by driving it through the\
  \ vampire's heart as a full-round action. Once the debilitating effect of the heartstake\
  \ bolt has ended, the vampire can pull out the bolt as a move action. A vampire\
  \ slain with a heartstake bolt is subject to the rules and limitations of slaying\
  \ a vampire with a wooden stake as described under vampire weaknesses .\nA heartstake\
  \ bolt deals normal damage for the crossbow of its type."
