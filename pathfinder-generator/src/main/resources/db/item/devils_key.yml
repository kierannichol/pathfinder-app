description: "Forged with a wicked barbed end that resembles a key, this +2 redeemed\
  \ longsword was once the unholy sword of a diabolistâ€”before a party of adventurers\
  \ retrieved it from his corpse and repurposed the weapon for good. The devil's key\
  \ is designed to permanently slay evil outsiders by bringing the fight to their\
  \ plane of origin so they can be killed outright. Once per day as a swift action\
  \ after a successful attack against an evil outsider, the wielder can activate the\
  \ sword to plane shift the wielder and the target of the attack to the creature's\
  \ home plane. The targeted outsider can resist this effect with a successful DC\
  \ 20 Will save. Once the target of this ability is slain by the wielder, the sword\
  \ activates another plane shift as an immediate action that brings the wielder back\
  \ to the exact spot it previously left."
