id: "item:wand_of_arcane_lock"
name: "Wand of Arcane Lock"
description: "An arcane lock spell cast upon a door, chest, or portal magically locks\
  \ it. You can freely pass your own arcane lock without affecting it. If the locked\
  \ object has a lock, the DC to open that lock increases by 10 while it remains attached\
  \ to the object. If the object does not have a lock, this spell creates one that\
  \ can only be opened with a DC 20 Disable Device skill check. A door or object secured\
  \ with this spell can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful dispel\
  \ magic or knock spell. Add 10 to the normal DC to break open a door or portal affected\
  \ by this spell. A knock spell does not remove an arcane lock; it only suppresses\
  \ the effect for 10 minutes."
