description: "This wooden mortar for grinding is 4 feet tall and 14 inches in diameter,\
  \ and can hold up to 4 cubic feet of dry goods. Its pestle is about 8 feet long\
  \ and carved of the same dense wood. It can be used as a weapon, functioning as\
  \ a +1 quarterstaff. On command, the mortar and pestle shrink down small enough\
  \ to fit in a belt pouch and weigh only 3 pounds. The mortar must be empty to shrink.\n\
  The mortar and pestle can be commanded to grind any object placed inside; each round,\
  \ the object takes 3d6 points of damage that bypasses hardness. Any object reduced\
  \ to 0 hit points in this manner is ground into powder. Magic items can attempt\
  \ a DC 19 Fortitude save each round to avoid taking damage. Artifacts can't be destroyed\
  \ in the mortar and pestle.\nThe mortar is large enough to hold a single Medium\
  \ creature, but it can enlarge to hold up to four Medium creatures or one Large\
  \ creature. The mortar can be commanded to fly at a speed of 30 feet as overland\
  \ flight, for up to 8 hours per day. Using the pestle to steer the mortar grants\
  \ a +10 bonus on Fly checks. Twice per day, the mortar can create a single-use phase\
  \ door that closes behind the mortar. Baba Yaga can summon her mortar and pestle\
  \ to fly to her from anywhere on the same planet, regardless of the commands of\
  \ any creatures inside it.\nWith the exception of using the pestle as a weapon,\
  \ the mortar and pestle must be together to use the their abilities."
destruction: "Baba Yaga's mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are used under the\
  \ light of a moon that shines on three worlds to grind to powder the hipbone of\
  \ a maiden, the ribcage of a mother, and the spine of a crone—all taken from the\
  \ same person."
