name: "Potion of Haunting Choir"
description: "You create a spectral choir and conduct its tortured, ghostly moans,\
  \ deluding listeners into believing they are suffering the torments of the dead.\
  \ The transparent singers occupy a 10-foot cube, but they are intangible and do\
  \ not interfere with creatures in any physical way, nor can they be attacked. Creatures\
  \ within 30 feet of the choir experience wracking pain that causes them to take\
  \ a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. Individuals who\
  \ exit the area of effect take these penalties for an additional 2 rounds before\
  \ the delusion wears off."
