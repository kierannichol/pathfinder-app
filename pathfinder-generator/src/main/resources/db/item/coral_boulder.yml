description: "This sponge-sized brick is actually a desiccated chunk of living coral.\
  \ When exposed to at least 1 gallon of water, it expands into a full-sized boulder\
  \ within 1 minute. A fully expanded coral boulder is an irregular sphere 3 feet\
  \ in diameter. An expanded boulder has a hardness of 7, has 55 hit points, and weighs\
  \ 8 pounds. The water in a coral boulder slowly evaporates if it's left in a dry\
  \ environment, and the boulder shrinks back to its original size in about a week.\
  \ If dropped in water, a coral boulder sinks straight down, and is not moved by\
  \ tides or flowing water."
