description: "Fashioned from a single piece of black jade, this 3-foot-long scepter\
  \ has a T-shaped handle carved to resemble the head of a horned crocodile. The scepter's\
  \ other end curls and forms an eyehook, to which is tied a leather strap. Strung\
  \ along this strap are four small, copper bells. Each bell signifies a single concept\
  \ related to rulership: authority, banishment, dominion, and imprisonment.\nAn individual\
  \ seeking to wield the scepter must first bond with the artifact by permanently\
  \ offering it one use of her mythic power. Thereafter, the owner must always keep\
  \ one use of power unspent to maintain the bond. If the owner expends all her mythic\
  \ power, the bond breaks and the individual can no longer access any of the scepter's\
  \ power until she reestablishes her bond of ownership.\nOnce bonded, the scepter\
  \ can be wielded as a +6 brilliant energy light mace that grants a +4 enhancement\
  \ bonus to its bonded owner's Charisma score. In addition, the owner can expend\
  \ one use of mythic power and ring the scepter's bells to produce the following\
  \ effects:"
destruction: "The Scepter of the Shining Lord explodes if its owner uses it to appoint\
  \ a non-mythic queen, lord, or other ruler as an agent. This slays the scepter's\
  \ owner and makes the ruler mythic."
