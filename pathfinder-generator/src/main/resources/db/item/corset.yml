description: "Sewn-in boning and laces allow this bodice to adjust your waist size\
  \ in a way considered alluring by some cultures. The restrictive nature of this\
  \ garment makes it a poor choice for combat or other athletic exertions, but you\
  \ can easily conceal a thin knife in the corset's boning. The price varies greatly\
  \ depending on the corset's quality; the cheapest corsets are made of simple cloth\
  \ and cost mere silver pieces, while the most expensive feature silk brocade and\
  \ are decorated with pearls or other costly adornments."
