description: "These arrows are tightly wrapped in strands of alchemical glue. Durable\
  \ arrows don't break with normal use, whether or not they hit their target; unless\
  \ a durable arrow goes missing, an archer can retrieve and reuse it again and again.\
  \ Durable arrows can be broken in other ways (such as deliberate snapping, hitting\
  \ a fire elemental, and so on). A magical durable arrow with an enhancement bonus\
  \ or magic weapon special ability applies these magical effects only the first time\
  \ it is used—afterward, the durable arrow becomes nonmagical, and it can be reused\
  \ or imbued with magic again."
