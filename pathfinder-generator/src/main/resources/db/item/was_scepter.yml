description: "The Was Scepter can be wielded in combat as a +4 light mace. Upon command,\
  \ it expands to a length of 6 feet and can be wielded as a double weapon that has\
  \ a +4 enhancement bonus. The head deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage and can\
  \ be used to make trip attacks, while the forked end deals 1d6 points of piercing\
  \ damage. The wielder can use either end as the primary weapon, with the other becoming\
  \ the off-hand weapon.\nThough it is formidable in melee, the scepter's true value\
  \ lies in its ability to allow its wielder to claim dominion over specific areas,\
  \ people, reality, and even time. As a move action, the wielder can plant the scepter's\
  \ forked end into the ground to activate a 120-foot aura of dominion. The aura remains\
  \ active so long as the scepter remains there. The wielder can then concentrate\
  \ to manipulate the aura to produce various magical effects. The wielder can produce\
  \ only a single effect at a time, and each new effect requires a new action. The\
  \ effects are as follows."
destruction: "The Was Scepter can be destroyed only by a ruler of Osirion with true\
  \ royal blood."
