description: "This is the most common form of scrying device, a crystal sphere about\
  \ 6 inches in diameter. So well-known are these items that many so-called oracles\
  \ or fortune-tellers use similar appearing (but completely nonmagical) replicas\
  \ of these items to ply their trades. A character can use a magical crystal ball\
  \ to see over virtually any distance or into other planes of existence, as with\
  \ the spell scrying (Will DC 16 negates). A crystal ball can be used multiple times\
  \ per day, but the DC to resist its power decreases by 1 for each additional use.\
  \ Certain crystal balls have additional powers that can be used through the crystal\
  \ ball on the target viewed.\n"
