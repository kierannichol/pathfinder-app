name: "Scroll of Repel Wood"
description: "Waves of energy roll forth from you, moving in the direction that you\
  \ determine, causing all wooden objects in the path of the spell to be pushed away\
  \ from you to the limit of the range. Wooden objects larger than 3 inches in diameter\
  \ that are fixed firmly are not affected, but loose objects are. Objects 3 inches\
  \ in diameter or smaller that are fixed in place splinter and break, and the pieces\
  \ move with the wave of energy. Objects affected by the spell are repelled at the\
  \ rate of 40 feet per round."
