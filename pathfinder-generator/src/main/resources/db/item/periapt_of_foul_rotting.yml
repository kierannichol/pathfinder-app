description: "This engraved gem appears to be of little value. If any character keeps\
  \ the periapt in her possession for more than 24 hours, she contracts a terrible\
  \ rotting affliction that permanently drains 1 point of Dexterity, Constitution,\
  \ and Charisma every week. The periapt (and the affliction) can be removed only\
  \ by application of a remove curse spell followed by a cure disease and then a heal,\
  \ miracle, limited wish, or wish spell. The rotting can also be countered by crushing\
  \ a periapt of health and sprinkling its dust upon the afflicted character (a full-round\
  \ action), whereupon the periapt of foul rotting likewise crumbles to dust."
