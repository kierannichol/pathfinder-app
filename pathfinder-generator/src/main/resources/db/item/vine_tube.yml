description: "This sealed copper tube contains a packet of alchemical fertilizer and\
  \ several sprouted seedlings from the First World. Once shaken and opened as a standard\
  \ action, the tube exudes a multitude of vines that spill into an adjacent square\
  \ for 3 rounds. Left alone, these vines create an area of difficult terrain in the\
  \ square, but a creature holding the tube can shape the vines as they emerge into\
  \ a crude tool, piece of furniture, or other object of wood or rope weighing 20\
  \ pounds or less with a successful DC 10 Craft (baskets or carpentry) check. The\
  \ vine construct lasts for 10 minutes before crumbling to pieces. Crafting this\
  \ item requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
