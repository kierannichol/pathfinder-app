description: "When applied to the nose as a standard action, this alchemical paste\
  \ traps airborne particles and sharpens your olfactory receptors, heightening your\
  \ sense of smell. You gain the scent ability, except you can detect creatures and\
  \ odors at only half the distance. If you already have the scent ability, rhinarium\
  \ paste increases the range at which you can detect creatures by 50%. Rhinarium\
  \ paste's effects lasts for 1 hour. Crafting this item requires a successful DC\
  \ 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
