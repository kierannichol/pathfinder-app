description: "A massive skull adorns the chest piece of this suit of +1 banded mail,\
  \ and smaller gilted images of defaced holy symbols cover the other parts of the\
  \ armor. The wearer of the armor cannot cast divine spells or use any spell-like\
  \ supernatural ability gained from a connection to a deity. The wearer gains SR\
  \ 19 against any divine-origin spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability\
  \ (such as a domain granted power or ability from an outsider serving a deity),\
  \ and treats the armor's enhancement bonus as +2 higher against creatures with these\
  \ abilities."
