description: "These C-shaped bows are most often used in the Hongal tundra by the\
  \ outriders of Tianjing, and in rare cases by the nobility of Xa Hoi. The unique\
  \ shape and craft of these bows allows them to shoot with the same velocity and\
  \ power as a longbow. The shorter size also allows them to be wielded easily while\
  \ mounted on horseback (or atop any other steed). While mounted, you gain a +1 circumstance\
  \ bonus on attack rolls with a reflex bow. All reflex bows are composite bows and\
  \ can be modified to benefit from high Strength scores in the same way as composite\
  \ bows. Effects that apply to both longbows and shortbows also apply to reflex bows."
