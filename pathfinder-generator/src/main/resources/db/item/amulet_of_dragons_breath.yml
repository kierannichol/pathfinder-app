description: "This amulet is crafted from a dragon scale hung on a thin wire of twisted\
  \ mithral. There are 10 different types of amulet of dragon's breath, each corresponding\
  \ to one of the 10 dragon types. As a standard action, the wearer of an amulet of\
  \ dragon's breath can breathe out a blast of energy similar to a dragon's breath\
  \ weapon. This breath weapon deals 8d6 points of energy damage (Reflex DC 16 for\
  \ half). The breath weapon's shape and energy type depend on the type of dragon\
  \ scale used to craft the amulet (see page 75 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook\
  \ for a list of dragon types, energy types, and breath shapes). A new amulet of\
  \ dragon's breath can be used three times before the dragon scale cracks and the\
  \ amulet becomes useless."
