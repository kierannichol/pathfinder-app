description: "This black leather cord has a red wooden ball attached at its center.\
  \ When the cord is tied around a creature's head and the wooden ball is placed in\
  \ the creature's mouth, the creature cannot speak or make any vocal sounds, including\
  \ verbal components of spells. When removed from the creature, the ball breaks off\
  \ from the leather cord, ending the effect. A creature that is not otherwise restrained\
  \ can easily untie the gag and remove it."
