description: "This peculiar idol, carved from some unknown green stone, depicts a\
  \ seven-legged octopoid figure with a horribly grinning face. Also known as the\
  \ Seasage Effigy, the Face of Dagon is a sacred relic of the ulat-kini. The bearer\
  \ of the idol can breathe water (as the water breathing spell) as long as it is\
  \ in her possession. In addition, the bearer can cast commune once per week to contact\
  \ Dagon or one of the Great Old Ones or Outer Gods. Each time the Face of Dagon\
  \ is used in this way, however, the bearer must make a DC 20 Will save or suffer\
  \ insanity (as the spell) as her mind is opened to the horrors of beyond."
