description: "This massive, wickedly curved red-bladed sword is a +3 keen vicious\
  \ falchion that murmurs a low, rumbling battle chant when drawn. Whenever the wielder\
  \ confirms a critical hit with a warbringer, the wielder gains the benefits of rage\
  \ for 1 round (if a barbarian, the wielder gains 1 additional round of rage for\
  \ that day), while the creature struck is compelled to move toward and attack its\
  \ nearest ally with a melee weapon, natural weapon, or unarmed strike on its next\
  \ turn (DC 14 Will negates), as the murderous command spell."
