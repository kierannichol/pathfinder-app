description: "Small round mirrors adorn the edges of this yellow, Qadiran silk veil,\
  \ which covers the wearer's mouth and nose. The veil protects the wearer against\
  \ extreme temperatures, as per endure elements. In addition, once per day while\
  \ in a warm or temperate desert, the wearer can speak a command word to create a\
  \ 20-foot-radius oasis that functions like a casting of grove of respite. The oasis\
  \ appears in a spot the wearer designates within 40 feet and disappears after 8\
  \ hours. Any creature outside the oasis that sees it must succeed at a DC 16 Will\
  \ saving throw or dismiss it as a mirage to be ignored. A creature that steps inside\
  \ the oasis, however, recognizes its substance."
