description: "This fine white powder is a powerful stimulant that affects the nervous\
  \ systems of any creatures that inhale or ingest it, preventing them from sleeping\
  \ for 24 hours. A packet of insomnia powder can be thrown as a splash weapon with\
  \ a range increment of 10 feet. A creature struck by a direct hit must succeed at\
  \ a DC 12 Fortitude save to avoid the effect, while those in the splash radius must\
  \ succeed at DC 8 Fortitude saves. This is a poison effect.\nAlthough it causes\
  \ no severe damage, insomnia can cause a creature to be more prone to fatigue or\
  \ exhaustion. Though it prevents sleep (and thus prevents wizards and some other\
  \ spellcasters from regaining their spells), insomnia powder does not prevent a\
  \ creature from meditating or praying. The effects of insomnia powder can be countered\
  \ by sleep, neutralize poison, or similar effects."
