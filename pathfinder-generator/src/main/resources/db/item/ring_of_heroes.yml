description: "Sculpted in the shape of two noble looking bronze lions charging toward\
  \ a centrally placed garnet, this ring grants the wearer the Luck of Heroes feat.\
  \ The ring must be worn for 24 hours before it takes effect. The wearer can also\
  \ call upon the ring's power to gain a hero point that must be used immediately,\
  \ although this causes the ring to lose its powers permanently."
