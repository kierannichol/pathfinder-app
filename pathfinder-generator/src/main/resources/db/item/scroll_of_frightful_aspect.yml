name: "Scroll of Frightful Aspect"
description: "You become a larger, awful version of yourself. You grow to size Large,\
  \ and take on features that horrify your enemies. You gain the following abilities:\
  \ a +6 size bonus to Strength, a +4 size bonus to Constitution, a +6 natural armor\
  \ bonus, DR 10/magic, and spell resistance equal to 10 + half your caster level.\
  \ You also emit an aura that emanates 30 feet from you. Enemy creatures within the\
  \ aura are shaken. Each time a creature shaken by this aura hits you with a melee\
  \ attack, that creature becomes frightened for 1d4 rounds, though at the end of\
  \ that duration it is no longer affected by this aura. The aura's effect is a fear\
  \ and mind-affecting effect."
