name: "Potion of Mirror Mantis"
description: "Whenever the target of this spell looks into a mirror or other reflective\
  \ surface where it can see its own visage clearly, it sees a Red Mantis assassin\
  \ (in full armor, face hidden by a mantis mask) looking back at it. The reflection\
  \ is harmless and mimics the target's motions perfectly; no one else can see this\
  \ illusion. The first time the target sees the Red Mantis reflection, it must succeed\
  \ at a Will save be or shaken and take a â€“2 penalty on saves against fear effects\
  \ for as long as it can see the altered image and for 3 rounds thereafter. A new\
  \ save must be attempted each time the creature views its reflection during the\
  \ spell's duration. Once a creature successfully saves, it becomes immune to being\
  \ shaken by the caster's mirror mantis spell for 24 hours, though it will still\
  \ see the Red Mantis reflection until the spell ends."
