description: "This +1 dancing dagger can attack foes up to 60 feet from the activating\
  \ character, and takes the form of a rat-sized metal wasp when the dancing special\
  \ ability is in use. It can store up to 4 doses of poison in its hilt. While dancing,\
  \ if it does not currently have poison applied to it, it automatically applies 1\
  \ dose of stored poison (if any is currently stored) to itself before the first\
  \ attack it makes each round. The hateful sting can envenom itself only when dancing.\
  \ Removing the poison from the hilt to apply to the blade manually takes a full-round\
  \ action."
