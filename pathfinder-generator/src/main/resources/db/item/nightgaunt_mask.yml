description: "A black, horned nightgaunt mask has two eyeholes but no other facial\
  \ features. When the mask is worn, even the eyeholes vanish, leaving the wearer\
  \ with no visible face at all. The wearer gains the advantages shared by the faceless\
  \ nightgaunts on which the mask is based. The entire face of the mask functions\
  \ as a sort of \"eye,\" allowing the wearer to see normally. The wearer also gains\
  \ a +4 bonus on all saving throws against gaze attacks, and does not breathe (and\
  \ is thus immune to inhaled toxins and scent-based effects). However, the wearer\
  \ can't speak, and therefore can't cast spells or use items that require verbal\
  \ components or command words.\nOnce per day, but only after wearing the mask for\
  \ at least 1 hour, the wearer can summon 1d4+1 nightgaunts to do her bidding, as\
  \ if by casting summon monster VI. These nightgaunts remain for 11 rounds. Alternatively,\
  \ the wearer can summon a single nightgaunt that remains for 24 hours. She can communicate\
  \ with and thus give orders to these nightgaunts via telepathy to a range of 100\
  \ feet. If the wearer removes the nightgaunt mask, any summoned nightgaunts immediately\
  \ turn on her and attempt to carry her off and drop her from a great height before\
  \ vanishing."
