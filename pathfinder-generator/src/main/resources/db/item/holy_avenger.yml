description: "This +2 cold iron longsword becomes a +5 holy cold iron longsword in\
  \ the hands of a paladin.\nWhen wielded by a paladin, this sacred weapon provides\
  \ spell resistance of 5 + the paladin's class level to the wielder and anyone adjacent\
  \ to her. It also enables the paladin to use greater dispel magic (once per round\
  \ as a standard action) at the class level of the paladin. Only the area dispel\
  \ is possible, not the targeted dispel or counterspell versions of greater dispel\
  \ magic."
