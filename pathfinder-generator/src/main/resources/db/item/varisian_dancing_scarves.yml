description: "This set of colorful scarves, is made of heavy silk and reinforced with\
  \ leather straps. As you move, they flutter and flow, obscuring your shape and protecting\
  \ against enemy attacks. Varisian dancing scarves provide no benefit while you are\
  \ standing still. Whenever you move at least 10 feet during your turn, you gain\
  \ a +2 armor bonus to AC until the beginning of your next turn. Varisian dancing\
  \ scarves add their enhancement bonus to this armor bonus instead of providing a\
  \ constant benefit; other magical enhancements (such as light fortification) apply\
  \ whether or not you are moving. In addition, Varisian dancing scarves provide a\
  \ +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks made to feint in combat."
