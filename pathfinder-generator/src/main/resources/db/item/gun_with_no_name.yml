description: "Though the green, glowing runes on this firearm denote it as magical,\
  \ otherwise this +2 mythic bane greater lucky pepperbox appears beat up and nearly\
  \ useless. This weapon can be reloaded normally, but if its wielder expends either\
  \ one use of mythic power or 1 grit point as a swift action, each of the firearm's\
  \ empty barrels magically reloads with either black powder and a bullet or with\
  \ a flare alchemical cartridge (the wielder chooses, and she can mix and match the\
  \ ammunition type with each barrel). While carrying this firearm, the wielder is\
  \ immune to scrying and any form of divination that attempts to ascertain her location,\
  \ thoughts, or alignment. The firearm itself is immune to locate object and similar\
  \ effects."
