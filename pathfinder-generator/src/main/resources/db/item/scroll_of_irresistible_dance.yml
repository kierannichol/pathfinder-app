name: "Scroll of Irresistible Dance"
description: "The subject feels an undeniable urge to dance and begins doing so, complete\
  \ with foot shuffling and tapping. The spell effect makes it impossible for the\
  \ subject to do anything other than caper and prance in place. The effect imposes\
  \ a –4 penalty to Armor Class and a –10 penalty on Reflex saves, and it negates\
  \ any AC bonus granted by a shield the target holds. The dancing subject provokes\
  \ attacks of opportunity each round on its turn. A successful Will save reduces\
  \ the duration of this effect to 1 round."
