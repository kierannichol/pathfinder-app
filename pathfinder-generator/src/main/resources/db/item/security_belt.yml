description: "A security belt increases the DC of Sleight of Hand checks made against\
  \ the wearer and checks to locate items or weapons hidden on the wearer's person\
  \ by 5. The wearer also gets a +5 bonus to CMD against the steal maneuver. Once\
  \ per day on command, the wearer can touch a single item of up to 10 cubic feet\
  \ and shrink it into a tiny cloth duplicate as the shrink item spell. With a move\
  \ action, the wearer can draw one of these items from one of the belt's pockets\
  \ and return it to normal size. It is difficult to detect a security belt and any\
  \ items in the pockets as magic. They are affected as though a constant magic aura\
  \ spell were making them appear nonmagical."
