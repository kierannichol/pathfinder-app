description: "This ugly +1 chainmail resists polishing and easily acquires bent links\
  \ and other cosmetic damage from everyday use, though such blemishes never impair\
  \ its function as armor. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can afflict\
  \ one target within 30 feet with bad luck, giving it a â€“2 penalty to Armor Class,\
  \ on attack rolls, or on saving throws (wearer's choice) for 1 minute. In addition,\
  \ once per day, the wearer can use protection from good."
