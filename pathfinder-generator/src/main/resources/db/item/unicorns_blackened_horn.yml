description: "This long ivory horn is twisted, elegant, and shining, but marring its\
  \ beautiful length are black, diseased lines of corruption. This item is an intact\
  \ unicorn's horn that has been horribly tainted by evil forces.\nThe wielder of\
  \ the unicorn's blackened horn can be healed by positive energy as well as negative\
  \ energy, regardless of her creature type, as long as she holds the horn. When holding\
  \ the horn, a spellcaster can also use its corrupted innocence to shape both positive\
  \ and negative energy. If the wielder prepares spells, a prepared cure spell (any\
  \ spell with \"cure\" in its name) can be spontaneously converted as it is cast\
  \ into any inflict spell (any spell with \"inflict\" in its name) of the same level\
  \ or lower, and vice versa, even if the cure or inflict spell is not normally on\
  \ her spell list. When others attempt to use Spellcraft or Knowledge (arcana) to\
  \ identify a spell cast in this way, the spell appears to be the cure or inflict\
  \ spell that is being converted (not the spell actually being cast) unless the identifier\
  \ exceeds the Spellcraft or Knowledge (arcana) DC by 10. In this case, the identifier\
  \ correctly identifies the spell. Analyze dweomer, greater arcane sight, and similar\
  \ spells of the same or higher spell level that automatically identify spells reveal\
  \ the converted spell for what it is.\nFurthermore, if the spellcaster is able to\
  \ spontaneously cast either cure or inflict spells (for an example, see the cleric's\
  \ spontaneous casting ability), then she can spontaneously cast both cure and inflict\
  \ spells while wielding the unicorn's blackened horn. If the wielder can channel\
  \ energy using a class feature, twice per day she can channel the opposite type\
  \ of energy that she normally channels.\nThe unicorn's horn imposes 1 permanent\
  \ negative level on any good creature that is attempting to wield it. The negative\
  \ level remains as long as the horn is held in hand and disappears when the horn\
  \ is no longer held. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including\
  \ by restoration spells) while the horn is held."
