description: "Undines incorporate a unique design when crafting shafted weapons such\
  \ as quarterstaves, spears, and tridents. Instead of a solid shaft, the weapon is\
  \ built around a pipe of wood or metal, with the butt end sealed and the front end\
  \ left open. As a full-round action, an undine can make a single melee attack with\
  \ the weapon and use her hydraulic push spell-like ability against the target of\
  \ that melee attack. The weapon otherwise functions like a standard weapon of its\
  \ type, and can be made of special materials (such as mithral or adamantine) and\
  \ masterwork quality."
