description: "This metal urn is identical in appearance to an efreeti bottle, except\
  \ that it does nothing but smoke. The amount of smoke is great if the stopper is\
  \ pulled out, pouring from the bottle and totally obscuring vision across a 50-foot\
  \ spread in 1 round. If the bottle is left unstoppered, the smoke billows out another\
  \ 10 feet per round until it has covered a 100-foot radius. This area remains smoke-filled\
  \ until the eversmoking bottle is stoppered.\nThe bottle must be resealed by a command\
  \ word, after which the smoke dissipates normally. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses\
  \ the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the smoke in 1 round."
