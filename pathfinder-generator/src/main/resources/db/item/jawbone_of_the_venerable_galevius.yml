description: "This brittle human jawbone is all that remains of the legendary Chelish\
  \ diplomat Galevius. A simple cord allows the relic to be worn as a necklace. The\
  \ jawbone represents all of Galevius's substantial powers of negotiation. The power\
  \ of the artifact is not in the jaw, but in the 16 teeth socketed into the bone.\
  \ Upon donning the jawbone, the wearer understands all of its powers and limitations.\
  \ As a standard action, the wearer may remove a tooth from the jawbone and crush\
  \ it in an open hand to activate its powers. The jawbone does not function for an\
  \ evil character; an evil wearer finds the teeth rooted too firmly in the bone to\
  \ remove.\nWhen the Jawbone of the Venerable Galevius is first found, it contains\
  \ a full set of 16 teeth. When a tooth is removed and crushed by the wearer, it\
  \ provides the following effect for 1 hour, although an effect immediately ends\
  \ if the wearer removes the jawbone or crushes another tooth.\nIncisors (4 teeth):\
  \ These teeth are used for cutting; in a negotiation, an incisor represents an attack\
  \ on an opponent's position. Crushing an incisor grants a +4 sacred bonus on Intimidate\
  \ checks and attack rolls.\nCanines (2 teeth): Canines are used for tearing; in\
  \ a negotiation, a canine represents a final, decisive strike in an argument. Crushing\
  \ a canine grants a +4 sacred bonus on Diplomacy checks. In addition, whenever the\
  \ user improves a creature's attitude with the Diplomacy skill, the creature's attitude\
  \ automatically improves by an additional step (but does not exceed helpful).\n\
  Premolars (4 teeth): Premolars can perform multiple functions; in a negotiation,\
  \ a premolar represents a careful shift of position. When crushed, a premolar grants\
  \ a +4 sacred bonus on Bluff checks. In addition, the user does not provoke attacks\
  \ of opportunity when moving.\nMolars (6 teeth): These teeth are used for determined\
  \ grinding; in a negotiation, a molar represents reasoned tenacity and persistence.\
  \ Crushing a molar provides a +4 sacred bonus on Sense Motive checks and immunity\
  \ to fatigue and exhaustion.\nDespite the brittleness of the teeth socketed into\
  \ the jawbone, the jawbone itself cannot be broken. Once all 16 teeth have been\
  \ used, the empty jawbone immediately disappears, reappearing elsewhere in the world\
  \ where a new owner is likely to encounter it. A prospective owner must be good-aligned\
  \ and ideally has several ranks in Diplomacy."
destruction: "If an evil user (that is capable of speech) wears the jawbone for a\
  \ full year and does not speak a single word or utter a sound during that time,\
  \ the jawbone crumbles to dust and is permanently destroyed."
