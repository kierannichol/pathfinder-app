description: "This Gray Maidenâ€“style helm has an ornate crown-like pattern sculpted\
  \ into its brow. The first such helms were created in the final days of Queen Ileosa's\
  \ reign for use by commanders in the organization, but her loyalists have had additional\
  \ copies made in her honor since her fall from power, and many of the Erinyes Company\
  \ proudly wear such helms today.\nA helm of the Fanged Crown allows its wearer to\
  \ use heroism on herself once per day as a standard action. However, the spell's\
  \ bonuses act as penalties instead on attack rolls and skill checks against devils,\
  \ devilbound creatures, and creatures with the infernal sorcerer bloodline, and\
  \ on saving throws against effects generated by such creatures. Once activated,\
  \ the effects last for 3 hours or until the helm is removed."
