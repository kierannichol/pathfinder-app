description: "This item allows its wearer to smell curses as an unearthly odor with\
  \ traces of brimstone and iron. As a standard action, the wearer can bring its nose\
  \ near an object or creature and sniff the target to glean information as if using\
  \ detect magic, except this effect only detects curses and cursed items. The wearer\
  \ must concentrate as normal to learn all possible information about the object\
  \ or creature in question.\nOnce per day as a standard action, the wearer can sniff\
  \ the air for signs of danger while considering a specific course of action to gain\
  \ an effect similar to augury. The perceived smell of a favorite food indicates\
  \ \"weal\" and the smell of death indicates \"woe.\""
