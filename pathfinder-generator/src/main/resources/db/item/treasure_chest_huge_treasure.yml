description: "A treasure chest begins as a common wooden chest, and is then treated\
  \ with resin to make the wood water-resistant. Metal bands, usually bronze to prevent\
  \ rusting, are strapped around the treasure chest for extra reinforcement, and the\
  \ lock is also made of bronze. A treasure chest uses the statistics of an ordinary\
  \ wooden chest, but its hit points increase by 25% and its Break DC increases by\
  \ 2. Treasure chests stand up better to water travel and to being buried than ordinary\
  \ chests."
