description: "Subtle, indefinable shapes ripple and flow when this deep blue cloak\
  \ moves, seemingly devouring any light falling upon it. Once per day at the wearer's\
  \ command, two large gray tentacles emerge from the cloak near the shoulders. Each\
  \ tentacle can make a natural attack that deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage,\
  \ assuming the wear is Medium (the damage of the tentacles scales by size of the\
  \ wearer as a tentacle natural attack; Bestiary 302). The tentacles have 10-foot\
  \ reach and the grab monster special ability (Bestiary 301). In addition, the wearer\
  \ gains a +4 competence bonus on grapple maneuver checks with the tentacles. The\
  \ tentacles last for 1 minute."
