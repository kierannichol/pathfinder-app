description: "A nightmare rod is a wooden rod with a smooth, purple, crystalline octopus\
  \ clutching one end, its tentacles wrapped around the length of the rod and its\
  \ bulbous body serving as a sort of mace head. Indeed, a nightmare rod can be wielded\
  \ as a +2 heavy mace. On a critical hit, a nightmare rod floods the target's mind\
  \ with horrific visions of nightmarish dooms that stagger the victim for 1 round\
  \ if it fails a DC 15 Will save. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. In addition,\
  \ a nightmare rod has the following powers."
