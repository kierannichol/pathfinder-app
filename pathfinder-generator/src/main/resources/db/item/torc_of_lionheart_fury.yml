description: "Each end of this heavy copper neckwear bears the image of a snarling\
  \ lion. The wearer gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear. If the\
  \ wearer is a barbarian of at least 12th level, she gains fearless rage as a bonus\
  \ rage power. If she already has this power, she also becomes immune to the panicked\
  \ condition while raging, and any panic-causing attack against her while she rages\
  \ instead causes her to regain 1 round of rage up to once per round."
