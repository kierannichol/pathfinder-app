description: "This hefty +1 flaming pistol is elaborately carved with its barrel in\
  \ the semblance of a roaring dragon and its grip wrapped in polished red dragonhide.\
  \ When firing ordinary ammunition, the wielder may choose to have the firedrake\
  \ pistol deal all of its damage as fire damage instead of normal damage. In addition,\
  \ as a standard action the wielder may expend 1 unit of ammunition and create a\
  \ cone of fire equivalent to burning hands rather than resolving that shot as a\
  \ normal attack."
