description: "A hex nail is a thick, 6-inch-long nail forged from cold iron. Usually\
  \ carried like charms or concealed within the heels of shoes, these roughly worked\
  \ nails are the only protection many common citizens of Irrisen have against the\
  \ White Witches and the cold fey of the North. Carrying a hex nail grants its possessor\
  \ a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws against the hexes, spells, spell-like\
  \ abilities, and supernatural abilities of fey, hags, and witches. A hex nail automatically\
  \ grants its bonus when its possessor is targeted by such an effect. Once a hex\
  \ nail has granted its bonus on a single saving throw, it becomes a nonmagical nail.\
  \ Most Jadwiga consider possession of a hex nail an act of treason."
