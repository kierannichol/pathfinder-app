description: "Electricity crackles along a metal filament inside this small glass\
  \ bottle. You can open the bottle as a standard action, unleashing a small bolt\
  \ of lightning toward an enemy within 20 feet of you. This is a ranged touch attack\
  \ that deals 1d8 points of electricity damage. Any creature in a line between you\
  \ and the target (including the target) takes 1 point of sonic damage from the terrific\
  \ clap of thunder the bolt generates (Reflex DC 15 negates). Crafting bottled lightning\
  \ is a DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
