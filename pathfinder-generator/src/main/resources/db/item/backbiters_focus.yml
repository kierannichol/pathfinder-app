description: "This small darkwood rod is adorned with a carving of a figure whose\
  \ own weapon is curled backward as if to strike the figure. Three times per day,\
  \ the user can speak the rod's command word to curse a single manufactured weapon\
  \ within 30 feet. If the weapon is magical, it can attempt a DC 16 Will save to\
  \ avoid the curse. Whenever the cursed weapon damages a creature, it deals half\
  \ as much damage to its wielder as well; only the weapon's base damage and the wielder's\
  \ Strength bonus are factored into this damageâ€”bonus damage from a magic weapon's\
  \ special abilities, from its wielder's class features and feats, or from other\
  \ effects are not factored into the damage dealt to the wielder. This is a curse\
  \ effect that lasts for 7 rounds."
