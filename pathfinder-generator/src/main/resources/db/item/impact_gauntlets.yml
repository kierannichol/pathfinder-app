description: "These gauntlets are made of worn leather; the palms are smooth, but\
  \ the wrists and backs of the gauntlets are covered in rough pebbles of various\
  \ shapes and colors. The wearer can catch Small, Medium, or Large rocks and similar\
  \ projectiles as if she possessed the rock catching monster ability, as long as\
  \ she has at least one hand free. A rock caught by the wearer shrinks and is permanently\
  \ absorbed into the gauntlets. A wearer who also possesses the rock catching ability\
  \ can catch rocks twice per round instead of once."
