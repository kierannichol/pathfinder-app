description: "Often used by ogres, bugbears, and other creatures that delight in causing\
  \ excruciating pain to others, these caltrops have serrated edges that leave rough\
  \ wounds that are difficult to heal. Serrated caltrops work just like normal caltrops,\
  \ except they are considered masterwork weapons (+1 bonus on attack rolls), deal\
  \ 1 point of bleed damage on a successful hit in addition to the caltrop's usual\
  \ damage, and possess a critical threat range of 19â€“20. On a confirmed critical\
  \ hit, the bleed damage increases to 1d2 points. A successful DC 15 Heal check or\
  \ any amount of magical healing ends the bleeding as well as the normal movement\
  \ penalty a caltrop causes. Serrated caltrops can be further enchanted as per melee\
  \ weapons, treating one 2-pound bag as a single melee weapon. If any of the magic\
  \ caltrops are lost, all the caltrops lose any magic abilities until the missing\
  \ caltrops are returned or replaced. Serrated caltrops can't have the hollow special\
  \ feature or the shrapnel special feature."
