description: "This winged, golden cartouche hangs on a leather thong beaded with semiprecious\
  \ stones. Normally, a cartouche of distinctive warding functions as a ring of protection\
  \ +1 and allows the wearer to use shield two times per day. Once per day, the wearer\
  \ can write the name of a specific individual in Ancient Osiriani hieroglyphs on\
  \ the cartouche (the name must be the person's true name, not an alias, nickname,\
  \ or title). This causes the cartouche's regular powers to go dormant, but for the\
  \ next hour the wearer is protected against the inscribed individual in three ways:"
