description: "This sash of white silk embroidered with golden suns never tears, fades,\
  \ or soils. Once per day, a paladin wearing this baldric can select three extra\
  \ mercies of her level or lower she does not already know and add them to the list\
  \ of mercies she can use for the day. She has access to these mercies for 24 hours.\
  \ When the wearer uses a mercy to remove a condition caused by a curse, disease,\
  \ or poison, the mercy actually cures the source curse, disease, or poison rather\
  \ than merely suppressing it for 1 hour."
