name: "Scroll of True Form"
description: "True formremoves any polymorph effect from a target creature, returning\
  \ it to its true form, even against its will. Against creatures affected by polymorph\
  \ spell effects (such as baleful polymorphor giant form), you must make a caster\
  \ level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level\
  \ of the effect. Success means that the polymorph effect immediately ends."
