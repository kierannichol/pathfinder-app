description: "This bronze rod is capped with a hollow head formed by sweeping aquiline\
  \ wings shielding a continual flame. A rod of liberty can be used as a +1 merciful\
  \ light mace, but while its merciful property is suppressed by the wielder so is\
  \ the continual flame. On command, the wielder of a rod of liberty may touch a creature\
  \ that has failed a save against a charm, compulsion, or possession effect. Doing\
  \ so grants that creature a new saving throw to end the effect. If this new save\
  \ fails, the effect remains and the rod's touch cannot further affect it.\nOnce\
  \ per day on command, the wielder can use break enchantment, as the spell."
