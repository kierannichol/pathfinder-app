description: "This oddly shaped, transparent bottle has one chamber nested inside\
  \ the other and two separate spouts, one leading into the smaller inner bottle,\
  \ and the other into the outer bottle. To use the bottle, the inner chamber is filled\
  \ with a potion and the outer chamber filled with water. When left alone for 24\
  \ hours, the water in the outer chamber slowly takes on the properties of the potion\
  \ in the inner chamber, creating a second dose of the potion (though the bottle\
  \ is unable to replicate potions with expensive material components). The second\
  \ dose of created potion must be quaffed from the bountiful bottle to be effective,\
  \ and loses its potency if transferred to another container. By expending one use\
  \ of mythic power, the time it takes to transform a potion is shortened to a full-round\
  \ action."
