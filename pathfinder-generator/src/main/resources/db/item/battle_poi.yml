description: "This pair of arm-length chains has handles at one end and heavy fuel-soaked\
  \ torch heads at the other. The weight of the poi is insufficient to deal physical\
  \ damage, but the burning fuel deals fire damage. If you are proficient in battle\
  \ poi, you are treated as if you have the Two-Weapon Fighting feat for the purposes\
  \ of making poi attacks. Poi can be extinguished by spending a full round action\
  \ smothering them in sand or submerging them in water."
