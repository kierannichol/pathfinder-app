description: "A sea-knife is a long-handled weapon with a short blade. It is designed\
  \ to be strapped to the ankle or foot of the wielder, pointing downward and jutting\
  \ out beyond the wearer's leg. Donning or removing a sea-knife is a full-round action.\
  \ The wearer cannot use a leg with a sea-knife strapped to it for walking or running.\
  \ A sea-knife can be used as a light melee weapon when the wielder is swimming,\
  \ flying, or prone. This allows the wielder to use a two-handed weapon, or wield\
  \ a weapon with one hand and carry a shield, and still make off-hand attacks with\
  \ the sea-knife. Attacks made with a sea-knife take a â€“2 circumstance penalty on\
  \ attack rolls in addition to all other attack penalties."
