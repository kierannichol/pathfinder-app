name: "Wand of Entropic Shield"
description: "A magical field appears around you, glowing with a chaotic blast of\
  \ multicolored hues. This field deflects incoming arrows, rays, and other ranged\
  \ attacks. Each ranged attack directed at you for which the attacker must make an\
  \ attack roll has a 20% miss chance (similar to the effects of concealment). Other\
  \ attacks that simply work at a distance are not affected."
