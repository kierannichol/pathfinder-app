description: "These steel and brass pauldrons feature two brass lion heads, one on\
  \ each shoulder. Twice a day as an immediate action when a creature successfully\
  \ makes an Acrobatics check to move through the wearer's threatened area or its\
  \ space without provoking an attack of opportunity, a shadowy lion can animate from\
  \ one of the pauldrons and attack that creature. The attack uses the wearer's base\
  \ attack bonus + Dexterity modifier and attacks the target's touch AC. On a hit,\
  \ the lion deals 2d6 points of piercing damage (Ã—2 critical)."
