name: "Scroll of Wall of Thorns"
description: "A wall of thorns spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled\
  \ brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human's finger. Any creature forced\
  \ into or attempting to move through a wall of thorns takes piercing damage per\
  \ round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature's AC. Dexterity and dodge bonuses\
  \ to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an AC of 25 or higher,\
  \ without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with\
  \ the wall.)"
