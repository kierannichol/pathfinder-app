description: "This fan, a favorite tool of courtiers and courtesans, is usually decorated\
  \ with a delicate design of flowers or geometric patterns. Once per day, the wielder\
  \ can use the fan to attempt to completely infatuate a humanoid target, causing\
  \ it to stare deeply into the wielder's eyes and ignore everything else around it.\
  \ The wielder utters a command word and holds the fan in front of his face, flourishing\
  \ it and peering over its top to make eye contact with the target. The target must\
  \ succeed at a DC 11 Will save or fall under the combined effects of the hypnotism\
  \ and lock gaze spells. The effects last for 5 rounds or until the wielder dismisses\
  \ it by closing the fan. Afterward, the target is charmed by the fan's user for\
  \ 1 hour (as charm person)."
