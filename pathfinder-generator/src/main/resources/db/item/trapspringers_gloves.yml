description: "These studded leather gloves look similar to workman's gloves, though\
  \ they are reinforced with numerous metal strips that the user can extend or retract\
  \ as she wills, turning the tip of each finger into a customizable tool useful in\
  \ examining and disarming traps. While worn, these gloves grant a +5 competence\
  \ bonus on all Disable Device checks made to disarm traps. In addition, the gloves\
  \ grant the user a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws made against traps."
