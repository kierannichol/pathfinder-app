description: "A sling is little more than a leather cup attached to a pair of strings.\
  \ Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a sling, just as it\
  \ does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading\
  \ a sling is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.\n\
  A sling fires sling bullets. You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones\
  \ are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as\
  \ if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you\
  \ and you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls."
