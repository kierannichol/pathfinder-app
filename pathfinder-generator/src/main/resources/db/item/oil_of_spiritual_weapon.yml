name: "Oil of Spiritual Weapon"
description: "A weapon made of force appears and attacks foes at a distance, as you\
  \ direct it, dealing 1d8 force damage per hit, + 1 point per three caster levels\
  \ (maximum +5 at 15th level). The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by\
  \ your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see\
  \ below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon\
  \ of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in\
  \ the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn.\
  \ It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round\
  \ in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes\
  \ as a spell, not as a weapon, so for example, it can damage creatures that have\
  \ damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without\
  \ the reduction in damage associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes\
  \ from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get\
  \ one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes\
  \ beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing\
  \ it, the weapon returns to you and hovers."
