description: "This device looks like a giant glass tube set within a protective iron\
  \ cage. The glass tube is scrawled with hundreds of mystic sigils and filled with\
  \ strange tubes and fluids. Bolts around the iron lip of the tube allow it to be\
  \ fastened into the wearers flesh, while dozens of tubes and probes connect to the\
  \ wearer's upper body. The device is designed for a creature lacking a lower body\
  \ or at least missing its legs; it can only effectively be used by undead, as a\
  \ living creature would almost certainly die from the item grafting itself to his\
  \ body and removing extraneous flesh to do so (though the character could be raised\
  \ from the dead or animated as an undead after this death).\nWhen properly attached,\
  \ you may fly at speed 30 (perfect maneuverability). You gain a +4 armor bonus to\
  \ AC."
