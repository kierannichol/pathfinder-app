description: "These white leather bracers have delicate elven runes etched upon them,\
  \ one reading \"swift defeat\" and the other \"vengeance.\" Once per day, as an\
  \ immediate action when the wearer takes hit point damage from a target, he may\
  \ cry out, \"Death to those who wrong me!\", swearing vengeance against the attacker.\
  \ The wearer gains a +1 competence bonus on weapon attack rolls made against the\
  \ target of his sworn vengeance, and deals an additional 2d6 points of damage on\
  \ successful weapon attack rolls.\nFor the duration of the effect, the wearer takes\
  \ a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls against any target other than his sworn enemy. These\
  \ bonuses and penalties last for 24 hours or until the sworn enemy is slain or destroyed\
  \ by the wearer, whichever comes first. If the wearer fails to slay the target of\
  \ his oath, these bracers cannot be used again until 7 days have passed."
