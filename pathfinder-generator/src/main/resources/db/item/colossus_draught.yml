description: "Originating from Thuvia, this potent elixir is rumored to have first\
  \ emerged from the infamous Citadel of the Alchemist. Each vial of colossus draught\
  \ is capped with an incredibly tight lid; a successful DC 22 Strength check is needed\
  \ to open and allow access to the bubbling jade liquid within. Once the vial is\
  \ opened, the contents must be imbibed within the next minute, or they spoil and\
  \ have no effect.\nDrinking the colossus draught imparts a temporary +4 enhancement\
  \ bonus to Constitution and Strength, and increases the imbiber's size to the next\
  \ larger category (as enlarge person, with all the resulting bonuses and penalties)\
  \ for the next 24 hours. While under the effects of the elixir, the imbiber takes\
  \ a â€“4 penalty on all Will saves as the fluid addles her mind."
