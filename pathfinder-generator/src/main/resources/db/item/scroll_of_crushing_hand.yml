name: "Scroll of Crushing Hand"
description: "This spell functions as interposing hand, except that it can also grapple\
  \ one opponent as grasping hand. Its CMB and CMD for grapple checks use your caster\
  \ level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +12 bonus for its Strength score\
  \ (35) and a +1 bonus for being Large (its Dexterity is 10, granting no bonus to\
  \ the CMD). A crushing hand deals 2d6+12 points of damage on each successful grapple\
  \ check against an opponent. The crushing hand can instead be directed to bull rush\
  \ a target (as forceful hand), using the same bonuses outlined above, or it can\
  \ be directed to interpose itself, as interposing hand does."
