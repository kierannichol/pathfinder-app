description: "A gift from an enigmatic master of the First World, each token of the\
  \ Eldest exemplifies the unique and specific relationship between its creator and\
  \ its first recipient. The Green Mother might bestow a crown of interwoven willow\
  \ branches, or the Lantern King a tiara spun from moonlight. These tokens have an\
  \ ethereal and fragile beauty, but prove surprisingly resistant to harm.\nOnce per\
  \ day, the wearer of a token of the Eldest can use commune with nature. In addition\
  \ to that spell's usual effects, if the area has a powerful natural protector likely\
  \ to be helpful to the wearer, this protector automatically learns of the wearer\
  \ and her location as well as a vague impression of her needs.\nOnce per day, the\
  \ wearer can expend one use of mythic power to cast charm monster on a creature\
  \ (DC 16 negates); fey creatures targeted by this effect take a –4 penalty on the\
  \ saving throw.\nFinally, as an immediate action the wearer can expend one use of\
  \ mythic power to reroll any saving throw against a spell, spelllike ability, or\
  \ supernatural ability of a fey, receiving a +2 bonus on the new saving throw. This\
  \ ability must be used after the save but before the results are revealed. The wearer\
  \ must take the result of the second roll, even if it's worse."
