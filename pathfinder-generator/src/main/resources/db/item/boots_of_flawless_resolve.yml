description: "These knee-high white leather boots are covered in delicate lines of\
  \ gemstones and precious metals that are almost imperceptible to the average human\
  \ eye. Three times per day as a move action, the wearer can declare a single creature\
  \ within 30 feet as his target. The wearer gains a +2 insight bonus to AC against\
  \ the target's attacks and a +4 bonus to CMD against combat maneuvers the target\
  \ attempts against him. This effect lasts for up to 7 rounds, but it ends immediately\
  \ if the wearer takes any move action that would move him out of his square (not\
  \ including a 5-foot step, but including movement such as flying) or if he is moved\
  \ out of his square involuntarily, such as by a successful bull rush combat maneuver\
  \ that pushes him backward. If the target dies, the effect immediately ends, and\
  \ declaring a new target requires expending another use. If the wearer declares\
  \ a new target before the effect on the previous target ends, the effect on the\
  \ previous target ends immediately, and declaring the new target expends another\
  \ use."
