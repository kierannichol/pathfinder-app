description: "This metal-studded bridle can be attached to any creature with a burrowing\
  \ speed that is made friendly or helpless. The bridle grants anyone who mounts the\
  \ bridled creature a +4 competence bonus on Ride, Handle Animal, and wild empathy\
  \ checks to control the bridled creature. An equipped burrower's bridle allows the\
  \ user to calm and train (with Handle Animal or wild empathy) any creatures with\
  \ a burrow speed and an Intelligence score of less than 3-not just animals or magical\
  \ beasts. The bridle also allows a creature riding a burrowing creature to accompany\
  \ it underground while it burrows, but does not grant the ability to breathe underground."
