description: "A cave dweller's greataxe appears to be a thin slab of stone crudely\
  \ lashed to a bone haft. It's as serviceable as a metal weapon of the same type\
  \ would be, and functions as a +1 greataxe. Once per day when the wielder of a cave\
  \ dweller's greataxe hits a creature, the wielder can speak a command word to force\
  \ the hit creature to attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save. If the creature fails, it\
  \ becomes slowed for 1 round. At the end of that round, the creature is no longer\
  \ slowed, but it must succeed at a second saving throw or it becomes petrified for\
  \ 1d4 rounds."
