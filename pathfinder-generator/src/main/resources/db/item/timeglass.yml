description: "A timeglass appears as a 1-foot-long elongated glass bulb set within\
  \ a stand made of horacalcum. Within the bulb churns a mote of pale blue mist—vapors\
  \ extracted from strange flowers that grow only in the Dimension of Time. A timeglass\
  \ can be used as if it were a crystal ball with true seeing, but also has the ability\
  \ to scry upon events in the past or future. When using a timeglass to look forward\
  \ or backward in time, a user can't specify what creatures are viewed, but does\
  \ look upon someone with whom the user has interacted before or will interact in\
  \ the future. It can be used in this manner only once per day.\nIf used to look\
  \ into the past, the timeglass does one of two things—it can reveal to the viewer\
  \ a memory that's been forgotten or put an old piece of knowledge into a new context\
  \ (granting a +20 bonus on any one Knowledge check), or it can grant a link to a\
  \ specific person that character has met in the past, allowing for a brief one-way\
  \ communication to that person. The recipient of this message generally interprets\
  \ the message in the form of a vision, or a strange prophecy, or divine insight—\
  the recipient does not know the message is in fact from the future (as the timeglass\
  \ distorts messages to the past in order to preserve the flow of time and combat\
  \ paradoxes). The first time the PCs use this device, they contact the troll augur\
  \ Augustille, and the result of this contact is the strange prophecy that he gave\
  \ the PCs back in \"The Asylum Stone.\" The timeglass itself determines whether\
  \ it grants a bonus on a knowledge check or allows a link to a past mind—allowing\
  \ the GM the chance to control how the artifact interacts with her campaign.\nWhen\
  \ a timeglass is used to look into the future, the effects are simpler—the PC gains\
  \ a brief vision of a possible important event that will occur in the PC's immediate\
  \ future. Memories of these events vanish as soon as they form, but the user retains\
  \ vague fragments of the memory, effectively gaining the effects of a foresight\
  \ spell for 24 hours.\nAt your discretion, a timeglass can have other uses involving\
  \ the past and the future."
destruction: "The timeglass must be carried back in time to the point it was created,\
  \ and must then be used to smash apart the glass containing the mist before its\
  \ creation is completed."
