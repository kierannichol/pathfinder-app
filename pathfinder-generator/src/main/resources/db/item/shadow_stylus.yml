description: "A shadow stylus can create a doorway between the Material Plane and\
  \ the Shadow Plane. To do so, the user must prick a bit of skin with the stylus's\
  \ pointed end, anointing it with a drop of blood from a living creature. The user\
  \ must then use the shadowy chalk held in the stylus's other end to inscribe a doorway\
  \ on a solid surface in an area of dim light. Doing so requires 1d4 rounds of work\
  \ and, once completed, fashions a portal like that created by a gate spell, linking\
  \ the Material Plane and the Shadow Plane. The destinations on both planes must\
  \ overlap—to create a portal to Shadow Absalom, for example, the user would have\
  \ to create the doorway from the Material Plane in Absalom. The portal created closes\
  \ 1 minute after it is created.\nAs long as a creature carries a shadow stylus on\
  \ her person, she gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells of the shadow\
  \ subschool and against all special attacks created by kytons, shadows, and other\
  \ creatures native to the Shadow Plane. In addition, the character can see on the\
  \ Shadow Plane as if that realm were brightly lit. A shadow stylus has 6 uses when\
  \ it is created. Once it is used to create a sixth portal, the stylus loses its\
  \ ability to craft new portals but retains its protective qualities."
