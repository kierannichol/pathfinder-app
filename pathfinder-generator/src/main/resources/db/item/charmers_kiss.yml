description: "This small stick of colored wax is encased in a wooden cylinder to allow\
  \ for easier application to the lips. As a standard action, a dose of charmer's\
  \ kiss can be applied to the user's lips; this dose lasts for 4 hours or until discharged.\
  \ During that time, the user can deliver the lipstick to one target creature as\
  \ a standard action (for willing targets) or a melee touch attack. The target of\
  \ this attack must succeed at a DC 16 Will saving throw or be affected by charm\
  \ monster for 7 minutes. A target of a creature type different from the wearer receives\
  \ a +2 bonus on this saving throw. One stick of charmer's kiss has enough wax for\
  \ 3 doses. This is a mind-affecting charm and poison effect."
