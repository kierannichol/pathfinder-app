description: "A permanent globe of shimmering force encloses one corpse, provided\
  \ the corpse is small enough to fit within the 10-foot diameter of the sphere, which\
  \ functions as a resilient sphere spell. The sphere is not subject to damage of\
  \ any sort except from a rod of cancellation, a rod of negation, a disintegrate\
  \ spell, or a targeted dispel magic spell. These effects destroy the sphere without\
  \ causing harm to the corpse within. Nothing can pass through the sphere, either\
  \ from the outside or from within. The corpse within a force casket is also preserved\
  \ so that it does not decay."
