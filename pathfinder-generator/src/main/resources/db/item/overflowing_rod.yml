description: "An overflowing rod amplifies and focuses the side effects of a kineticist's\
  \ burn. While holding the rod, the kineticist counts as 3 levels higher for the\
  \ purpose of determining the effects of her elemental overflow ability. If used\
  \ by a character without elemental overflow, the rod grants its wielder the benefit\
  \ of elemental overflow as a 3rd-level kineticist (which is generally helpful only\
  \ to low-level kineticists or kineticists with archetypes that replace elemental\
  \ overflow with another class feature)."
