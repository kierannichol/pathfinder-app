description: "This two-handed battle axe is heavy enough that you can't wield it with\
  \ one hand. The head may have one blade or two, and may be \"bearded\" (meaning\
  \ hooked or trailing at the bottom) to increase cleaving power and help pull down\
  \ enemy shields. The haft is usually 3 to 4 feet long."
