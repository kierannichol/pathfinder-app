description: "This ornately designed +1 lance, decorated with ribbons and small favors,\
  \ allows its wielder to more effectively knock an opponent from his mount. A successful\
  \ hit with a lance of jousting on a mounted opponent forces the target to make a\
  \ Ride check (DC 10 + damage dealt) to avoid being knocked from the saddle. Although\
  \ this lance is used in combat to remove a mounted foe's advantage, use of one in\
  \ a tournament or similar contest is generally considered a dishonorable form of\
  \ cheating."
