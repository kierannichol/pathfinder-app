description: "Many unarmed fighters wrap their hands in cloth to minimize injuries\
  \ to their fists. Some martial artists also weave small coins or metal bars into\
  \ their handwraps, adding special material effects as well. Handwraps don't alter\
  \ the damage a character's unarmed attacks deal. However, masterwork handwraps can\
  \ be enchanted as weapons, providing their benefits on unarmed attacks the character\
  \ makes with her hands. A character can't benefit from both handwraps and other\
  \ items that provide enhancement bonuses or weapon special abilities (such as an\
  \ amulet of mighty fists) on the same attack."
