description: "The iridescent, hazy contents of this glass container eddy briefly into\
  \ different shapes. A bottled cloud can be thrown as a splash weapon. When it strikes,\
  \ it unleashes a bank of whitish-gray, semi-solid clouds in one of two configurations—\
  a 20-foot-radius cloud or a 40-foot-radius sheet of mist that hovers a few inches\
  \ above the ground. The user selects which version of the clouds she wishes to create\
  \ as she throws the bottled cloud.\nIf the bottled cloud forms a 20-foot-radius\
  \ cloud, it functions as a solid fog spell.\nIf the bottled cloud is instead used\
  \ to form a sheet, the layer of mist can be walked upon as if it were solid ground.\
  \ While the bottled cloud must be thrown against solid ground in order to shatter\
  \ the container and release the cloud, it can be deliberately poured out on a liquid\
  \ surface to form a sheet as well. The cloud sheet extends over liquid surfaces,\
  \ but pours into concavities and holes—one can use a bottled cloud to traverse water,\
  \ but not a pit or chasm. The sheet of mist also allows safe movement over caltrops,\
  \ difficult terrain that lies low to the ground (GM's discretion), and other low-lying\
  \ hazards (such as a sheet of green slime) and traps that are triggered via pressure\
  \ plates.\nEither use of a bottled cloud can be dispersed by a severe wind (31+\
  \ mph) in a single round, but otherwise the effect created lasts for 3 minutes."
