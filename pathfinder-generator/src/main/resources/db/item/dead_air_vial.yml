description: "Within this corked vial is a tiny sample of what is known as \"dead\
  \ air.\" Heavy, still, and of unknown origin, pockets of dead air becalm airships\
  \ and smother crews in remote parts of the Plane of Air. When you open a dead air\
  \ vial, invisible dead air fills a 20-foot-radius area centered on you. The affected\
  \ area becomes devoid of breathable air. Creatures that breathe air must hold their\
  \ breath or suffocate in an area of dead air, though sound, fire, and other effects\
  \ that rely on a stable atmosphere are unaffected. Undisturbed, the dead air dissipates\
  \ in 1 minute. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the dead air in 4 rounds; a strong\
  \ wind (21+ mph) disperses the dead air in 1 round. This item can be crafted with\
  \ a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
