description: "Scheming nobles like to use raucous canards to spread gossip about their\
  \ enemies. An inactive raucous canard appears to be a small, nondescript piece of\
  \ rolled-up parchment. Unrolling the parchment allows you to record a messages up\
  \ to 25 words long. Once you record a message, you can throw the parchment into\
  \ the air, causing it to animate, sprout small feathery wings, and circle overhead\
  \ for 10 minutes while loudly repeating the message over and over in a booming voice.\
  \ Alternatively, you can close the scroll, causing the animation to be triggered\
  \ the next time someone opens the scroll. After 10 minutes, the raucous canard disappears\
  \ in a small shower of sparks and is destroyed."
