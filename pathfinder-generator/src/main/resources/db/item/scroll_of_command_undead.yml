name: "Scroll of Command Undead"
description: "This spell allows you a degree of control over an undead creature. If\
  \ the subject is intelligent, it perceives your words and actions favorably (treat\
  \ its attitude as friendly). It will not attack you while the spell lasts. You can\
  \ give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince\
  \ it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. Retries are not allowed. An intelligent\
  \ commanded undead never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might\
  \ be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing."
