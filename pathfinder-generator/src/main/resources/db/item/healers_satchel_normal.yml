description: "This well-worn physician's bag can be slung over one shoulder or carried\
  \ easily in one hand. It contains a collection of continually renewing bandages,\
  \ medicines, and herbs. This acts as a healer's kit, except spent uses are renewed\
  \ every day, so the wielder can expend up to 10 uses in any 24-hour period. When\
  \ the wielder expends 2 uses from a healer's satchel to treat deadly wounds with\
  \ the Heal skill, she adds her Wisdom bonus to the amount of hit points restored,\
  \ and if she exceeds the DC by 5 or more, she adds 2 Ã— her Wisdom bonus to the amount\
  \ restored. The wielder also gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Heal checks when she\
  \ expends uses of the healer's satchel to treat poisons and provide first aid (this\
  \ does not stack with the normal +2 circumstance bonus granted for using a healer's\
  \ kit).\nIn addition to the benefits described above, a specialized healer's satchel\
  \ comes with enchantments and equipment to further aid in certain medical situations.\n\
  Diagnosis: The specialized healer's satchel contains a wide variety of magical tools\
  \ for diagnosing illness and injury. When attempting a Heal check while expending\
  \ one or more uses of the satchel, the user is automatically aware if the check\
  \ failed. Additionally, the user can spend 1 minute scrutinizing a patient to increase\
  \ the circumstance bonus granted by the specialized healer's satchel by 2. This\
  \ scrutiny can be performed only once per Heal check attempted.\nFirst Aid: The\
  \ specialized healer's satchel contains self-binding tourniquets, enchanted smelling\
  \ salts, and other magical tools to help a dying patient recover. The wielder can\
  \ expend two uses of the specialized healer's satchel when performing first aid\
  \ to heal a character at negative hit points to 0 hit points with a successful DC\
  \ 20 Heal check.\nLong-Term Care: The specialized healer's satchel contains expanding\
  \ gurneys, enchanted sleep aids, and other magical tools to assist patients' recovery.\
  \ Each day, the wielder can expend two uses of the satchel per patient when providing\
  \ long-term care. This either doubles the benefits of long-term care or restores\
  \ 1 point of ability drain with a full day of complete rest (the wielder can choose\
  \ which effect applies to each patient).\nTreatment: The specialized healer's satchel\
  \ contains alchemical blood cleansers, specialized antitoxins, and other magical\
  \ tools to aid patients suffering from disease or poison. The wielder can expend\
  \ two uses of the satchel when using the Heal skill to treat poison or disease to\
  \ use her Heal check result in place of the creature's next Fortitude saving throw\
  \ against the poison or disease. If the Heal check result doesn't equal or exceed\
  \ the DC of the disease or poison, she still adds a +4 competence bonus to the creature's\
  \ next saving throw against the disease or poison."
