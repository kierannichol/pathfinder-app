description: "A runestone of power is a small chip of polished stone etched with a\
  \ rune. These objects are potent aids to all spellcasters who cast spontaneously\
  \ (but not to spellcasters like clerics who have the option to spontaneously cast\
  \ certain spells). Once per day, a spontaneous caster can draw upon a runestone\
  \ of power to cast a spell—doing so is part of the spellcasting action, and expends\
  \ that runestone's power for the day rather than one of the spellcaster's actual\
  \ spell slots for the day. An expended runestone of power recharges its capacity\
  \ after 24 hours. The spell must be of a particular level, depending on the runestone."
