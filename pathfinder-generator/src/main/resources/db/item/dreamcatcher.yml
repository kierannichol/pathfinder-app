description: "This protective ward is fashioned from a thin, supple piece of wood\
  \ bound in a circle, and then woven with sinew to create a weblike pattern. Dreamcatchers\
  \ are often decorated with beads and feathers. More elaborate dreamcatchers might\
  \ be made of gold or silver instead, and decorated with dangling jewels and metal\
  \ figurines.\nA dreamcatcher protects its sleeping owner from malicious influences.\
  \ The owner gains a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws while asleep. Further, any\
  \ ability damage or ability drain he takes during this time is reduced by 1 point\
  \ (to a minimum of 0 points)."
