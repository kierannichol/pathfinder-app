description: "At almost 5 feet in height, a longbow is made up of one solid piece\
  \ of carefully curved wood. You need two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size.\
  \ A longbow can't be used while mounted. If you have a penalty for low Strength,\
  \ apply it to damage rolls when you use a longbow. You can apply your Strength modifier\
  \ to damage rolls when you use a composite longbow, but not a regular longbow. A\
  \ longbow fires arrows."
