description: "This +1 greataxe is favored by undead and constructs, who do not suffer\
  \ its drawbacks. A life-drinker bestows two negative levels on its target whenever\
  \ it deals damage, just as if its target had been struck by an undead creature.\
  \ One day after being struck, subjects must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save for\
  \ each negative level or the negative levels become permanent.\nEach time a life-drinker\
  \ deals damage to a foe, it also bestows one negative level on the wielder. Any\
  \ negative levels gained by the wielder in this fashion lasts for 1 hour."
