description: "With an exterior crafted of blackened iron, the wayfinder of spellbreaking\
  \ has no ornamentation. In addition to the usual functions of a wayfinder (including\
  \ the ability to create light), a wayfinder of spellbreaking can be used once per\
  \ day to create a dispel magic effect on a creature or object. The wayfinder of\
  \ spellbreaking must be touched to the objectâ€”targeting an unwilling creature requires\
  \ a successful melee touch attack. If the user has detect magic active or can otherwise\
  \ observe magical auras, he can target a specific aura; otherwise, the wayfinder\
  \ of spellbreaking targets the effect with the highest caster level."
