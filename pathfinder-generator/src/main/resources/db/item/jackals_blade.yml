description: "A jackal's blade appears as a well-used falchion. The handle looks aged\
  \ and unpleasant, but despite these cosmetic features, the blade is quite sharp,\
  \ functioning as a +2 unholy falchion. The weapon inflicts particularly grievous\
  \ wounds on paladins and lawful good clerics, functioning as a bane weapon against\
  \ such targets. It also functions as a divine focus for worshipers of Lamashtu.\
  \ When used as such for casting a spell, the user gains a +4 bonus on any concentration\
  \ checks needed to complete that spell."
