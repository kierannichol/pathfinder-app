description: "This rod appears to be the limbless trunk and branching roots of a miniature\
  \ tree. It grants its wielder a +5 competence bonus on Survival checks to get along\
  \ in the wild and to keep from getting lost. Additionally the wielder and any allies\
  \ within a 20-foot radius of the wielder gain the benefits of the ranger's woodland\
  \ stride class feature.\nIf thrust into any natural ground or earth and allowed\
  \ to stand for 1 hour, the rod grows and blooms into a large tree bearing edible\
  \ fruit. A sapling rod produces 2d4 pieces of fruit. A creature that consumes an\
  \ entire piece of fruit gains the benefits of either a cure moderate wounds or lesser\
  \ restoration spell (recipient's choice). Consuming a piece of fruit from a sapling\
  \ rod is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and no single\
  \ creature can benefit from more than two piece of fruit from a single blooming.\
  \ A sapling rod can bloom once per week and after doing so reverts to its original\
  \ state after all the fruit is picked, or after 24 hours, whichever comes first.\
  \ Fruit harvested from the tree lasts for 24 hours before shriveling into useless\
  \ husks."
