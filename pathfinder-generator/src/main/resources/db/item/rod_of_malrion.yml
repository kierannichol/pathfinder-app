description: "This 14-inch rod of simple white oak is sheathed with a 3-inch sleeve\
  \ of rune-carved steel in the middle. The ends are seared, as if the wood had endured\
  \ a forest fire. Once per day, the wielder of a rod of Malrion can surround a target\
  \ with four walls of fire, forming a square around the target. The caster determines\
  \ whether the walls spring up within 10 or 20 feet of the target and whether the\
  \ heat affects creatures within or outside the barrier of flames. If the walls are\
  \ raised within 10 feet of the target with the heat spreading inward, the target\
  \ takes 8d4 points of fire damage by standing at the centermost space; if they are\
  \ created within 20 feet, the target takes no damage if he does not move from the\
  \ centermost space. The size of the target does not affect how far away from a creature\
  \ the walls appear. Passing through any of the walls deals 2d6+7 points of fire\
  \ damage (double damage to undead).\nThe rod creates as many of the four walls of\
  \ fire as it can, though barriers and cramped quarters might prevent the walls from\
  \ appearing at their full size. The flames created by the rod last for 1 minute."
