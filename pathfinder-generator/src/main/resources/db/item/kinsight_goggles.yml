description: "Kinsight goggles are in fact two separate crystal monocles, linked together\
  \ with a simple silver clasp that allows them to both be worn at once like pince-nez\
  \ spectacles. The left and right halves may be separated and worn individually,\
  \ allowing two people to see through one another's eyes. When separated, the wearer\
  \ of either half of the goggles may speak a command word to see through the lens\
  \ of the other half, so long as the halves of the goggles remain within 500 feet\
  \ of one another. When the two lenses are attached and worn as one item, they offer\
  \ no magical benefitâ€”just some minor magnification."
