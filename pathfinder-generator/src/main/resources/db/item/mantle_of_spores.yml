description: "This mantle grants the wearer a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws\
  \ against disease. Once per day, the wearer can flourish the cape as a swift action\
  \ to surround himself with a cloud of deadly spores. Creatures adjacent to the wearer\
  \ take 1d6 points of damage from the spores, plus 1d3 points of damage per round\
  \ for 3 rounds as the spores grow into fuzzy green mold. After these rounds the\
  \ mold becomes harmless, and can be washed away with a minute of scrubbing. The\
  \ spores can be destroyed by making a DC 15 Heal check on an affected creature,\
  \ or by effects that remove diseases. The spores are a disease effect."
