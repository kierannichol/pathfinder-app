description: "A creature carrying this knot-shaped charm for 3 full days becomes its\
  \ owner until she loses possession of it. A creature can only be the owner of a\
  \ single charm of the thriceborn. At the start of each day, the charm's owner rolls\
  \ 3d20 and keeps their results as her charmed dice. Once during that day, instead\
  \ of rolling a d20, the charm's owner can instead use the result of one of the three\
  \ charmed dice, randomly selected (roll 1d3 to choose)."
