description: "A robe of powerlessness appears to be a magic robe of another sort.\
  \ As soon as a character dons this garment, she takes a â€“10 penalty to Strength,\
  \ as well as to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, forgetting spells and magic knowledge\
  \ accordingly. If the character is a spellcaster, the robe targets the character's\
  \ primary spellcasting score, otherwise it targets Intelligence. The robe can be\
  \ removed easily, but in order to restore mind and body, the character must receive\
  \ a remove curse spell followed by heal."
