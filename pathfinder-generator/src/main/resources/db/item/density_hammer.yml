description: "This +3 earth breaker is blocky and heavy. Several chrysoberyls adorn\
  \ the head around its striking surface. The density hammer's wielder is immune to\
  \ petrification effects, but each time the wielder would be subject to a petrification\
  \ effect, the density hammer's weight doubles and its enhancement bonus decreases\
  \ by 1 for 24 hours. If the density hammer's enhancement bonus decreases to 0, the\
  \ wielder is no longer immune to petrification effects and the density hammer gains\
  \ the fragile weapon special feature (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 22)."
