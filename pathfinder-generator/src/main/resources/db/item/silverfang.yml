description: "Silverfang is a +1 undead bane mithral rapier originally forged by a\
  \ cabal of vampire hunters in Ustalav as a weapon against their hated foes. Ironically,\
  \ the rapier was claimed by a powerful Nidalese vampire named Volsazni Dezarr as\
  \ a trophy after he single-handedly slew the entire cabal during their foolish attempt\
  \ to destroy him. Since then, Volsazni has bequeathed the weapon as a token of his\
  \ favor to no fewer than a dozen vampiric thralls and five of his dhampir childrenâ€”\
  Gnaeus being the latest of these recipients.\nAs long as Silverfang is carried,\
  \ the user gains a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws against negative energy\
  \ and level drain, and whenever he makes a Fortitude save to recover from a negative\
  \ level, he may roll the save twice, taking the better of the two results as the\
  \ actual result. Once per day, Silverfang can target an undead creature it just\
  \ successfully critically hit with a halt undead effect (Will DC 14 negates) as\
  \ a swift action."
