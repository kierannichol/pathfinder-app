description: "Despite its best-known name, Vesper's Rapier is not necessarily a rapier.\
  \ This weapon is a +3 keen speed sword, with the type of sword varying from wielder\
  \ to wielder. Upon being taken up by a new owner, the weapon transforms into any\
  \ type of sword of the wielder's choosing, mundane or exotic. From that point on,\
  \ the weapon always transforms into that type of sword whenever it is held by that\
  \ individual. While bearing Vesper's Rapier, the wielder gains a +4 bonus on Bluff\
  \ and Diplomacy checks made to influence humanoids, and can use the rapier like\
  \ a compass to point in the direction of the closest collection of gems, silver,\
  \ or drinkable water as a standard action at will.\nThe sword also grants the wielder\
  \ the ability to either slip or tighten the bonds of the physical world, granting\
  \ her the ability to cast dimension door, dimensional lock, or greater teleport.\
  \ These powers have limits, though, as they can drain the sword's magical abilities\
  \ for the day— dimensional lock and greater teleport can be used once per day and\
  \ drain the sword immediately after their use; dimension door can be used at will,\
  \ but drains the sword after 3 uses, though the wielder can continue to use dimension\
  \ door even if the sword is drained (this is the only effect that functions even\
  \ when the sword is drained). If the sword becomes drained, it loses all of its\
  \ magical properties (aside from dimension door), including its +3 enhancement bonus,\
  \ skill bonuses, and the keen and speed special abilities. All of these properties\
  \ are restored every day at midnight."
destruction: "Vesper's Rapier is destroyed if it is taken into a demiplane where time\
  \ doesn't pass. Although this is the end of the sword, its true owner's existence\
  \ is such that earlier incarnations of the weapon will continue to exist for ages."
