description: "This spiraling animal horn can be sounded as a normal horn, but if the\
  \ command word is spoken and the instrument is then played, it deals 5d6 points\
  \ of sonic damage to creatures within a 40-foot cone and causes them to be deafened\
  \ for 2d6 rounds (a DC 16 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half and negates\
  \ the deafening). Crystalline objects and creatures take 7d6 points of sonic damage,\
  \ with no save unless they're held, worn, or carried by creatures (Fortitude DC\
  \ 16 negates).\nIf a horn of blasting is used magically more than once in a given\
  \ day, there is a 20% cumulative chance with each extra use that it explodes and\
  \ deals 10d6 points of sonic damage to the person sounding it."
