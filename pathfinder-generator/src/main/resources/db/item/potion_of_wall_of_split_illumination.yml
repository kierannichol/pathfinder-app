name: "Potion of Wall of Split Illumination"
description: "An immobile curtain of illumination springs into existence. When created,\
  \ one side of the wall (designated by you) radiates bright light to a range of 60\
  \ feet away from that side while the other side radiates darkness to an equal distance.\
  \ This effect alters the illumination level by up to two steps toward either bright\
  \ light (the light side) or darkness (the dark side). The wall also obstructs vision\
  \ through it, regardless of which side of the wall the viewer is on."
