description: "This light steel shield is specially crafted with a series of straps\
  \ to allow a character proficient in shields to ready or stow it on her back quickly\
  \ and easily. If you have a base attack bonus of +1 or higher, you may don or put\
  \ away a quickdraw shield as a swift action combined with a regular move. If you\
  \ have the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, you can draw a light or onehanded weapon with\
  \ one hand and a quickdraw shield with the other in the time it would normally take\
  \ you to draw one weapon. If you have the Quick Draw feat, you may don or put away\
  \ a quickdraw shield as a free action."
