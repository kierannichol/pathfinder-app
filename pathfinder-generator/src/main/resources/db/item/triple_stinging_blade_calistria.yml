description: "This highly decorative +1 dagger sports a rose carved onto its pommel\
  \ and a yellow-and-black-striped hilt. Upon examination, the blade seems to be dented\
  \ at regular intervals. These dents are actually retractable thorns. If you use\
  \ a triple-stinging blade to successfully damage a creature, you can make a free\
  \ combat maneuver against the target. If you fail, nothing happens. If you succeed,\
  \ you thrust the blade deep enough into the target to cause the thorns to spring\
  \ forth, dealing an additional 1d4 points of damage. The thorns retract immediately\
  \ after dealing this damage.\nOnce per day, as a free action, if Calistria is your\
  \ patron and you whisper her name, you can increase the enhancement bonus of the\
  \ triple-stinging blade to +2. This bonus lasts for 1 round. If Calistria is not\
  \ your patron and you speak her name while holding the triple-stinging blade, thorns\
  \ sprout from the handle instead and inject with you with poison equivalent to Medium\
  \ spider venom (see pages 559â€“560 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook)."
