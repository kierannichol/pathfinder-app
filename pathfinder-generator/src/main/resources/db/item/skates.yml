description: "These honed metal blades are worn on boots to enable swift passage over\
  \ ice. The wearer may move (but not climb) at her full speed on level icy surfaces.\
  \ Her speed is halved when moving up an icy slope, but she may run or charge downhill\
  \ on gentle or steep snowy slopes at quadruple speed. However, any skill check penalties\
  \ for traversing rough ice while wearing skates are doubled, and the wearer takes\
  \ a â€“4 penalty on combat maneuver checks to bull rush, drag, or trip, and to CMD\
  \ against these maneuvers. Donning or removing skates takes 1 minute."
