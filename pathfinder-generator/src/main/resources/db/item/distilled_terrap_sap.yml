description: "When first opened, this sealed jar releases such an overwhelmingly antiseptic\
  \ odor that it covers other smells until it disperses (1d6 rounds after opening).\
  \ Creatures within 20 feet of the jar get a +5 alchemical bonus on all saves against\
  \ scentbased attacks while the sap's odor remains, but they automatically fail any\
  \ scent-based Perception checks during that time."
