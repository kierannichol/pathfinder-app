description: "A scene of imperial decadences depicted in fantastically fine etchings—\
  which seem to change upon each consideration— covers the surface of this +5 short\
  \ sword. Every time Shin-Tari successfully damages a creature, it gains the bane\
  \ weapon special ability, with the target's creature type being its designated foe.\
  \ This additional weapon quality actives after the weapon first strikes an opponent,\
  \ granting additional damage to subsequent attacks but not the first attack. The\
  \ bane weapon special ability persists for the rest of the day, or until the sword\
  \ strikes a foe of a different creature type. Additionally, whenever Shin-Tari strikes\
  \ a Large or smaller foe, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be affected\
  \ as per the spell dimension door. This effect functions as the spell, but Shin-Tari's\
  \ wielder determines where his opponent is transported to, and the destination must\
  \ be within the wielder's line of sight. The wielder cannot teleport an opponent\
  \ into a space occupied by another creature or a solid object. Only one creature\
  \ can be affected by this ability each round, and the target can act as normal on\
  \ its next turn. If the sword scores a critical hit, the target must succeed at\
  \ a DC 25 Will save or be affected by the spell teleport. The sword's wielder determines\
  \ the destination, which must be very familiar to him.\nDormancy The Alara'hai were\
  \ crafted to serve the runelords of Thassilon. In modern times, however, these runelords\
  \ lie dead or dormant. With no lords to serve, the weapons of their champions lie\
  \ dormant as well, reducing each to a +2 weapon with the noted weapon special abilities\
  \ (those detailed on page 469 of the Core Rulebook) but no other properties. The\
  \ only way to awaken one of the blades is to restore its runelord master to active\
  \ life or have some other legitimate ruler take up its master's mantle (the weapon\
  \ determines what is considered legitimate). The swords can detect such restorations\
  \ and f lare to full power immediately, demanding their wielder seek out the restored\
  \ runelord and swear eternal fealty."
destruction: "Each of the Seven Swords of Sin can be destroyed merely if commanded\
  \ to break. That command, however, must come from the rightful runelord of the nation\
  \ and school of magic associated with the blade."
