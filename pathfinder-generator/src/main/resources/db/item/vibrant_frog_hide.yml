description: "Cut from the colorful flesh of an enormous frog, this +1 hide armor\
  \ squishes thickly and tightly around the body as it is donned. Light sheens brightly\
  \ off the slippery skin, revealing vivid patterns in myriad hues.\nFive times per\
  \ day as a swift action, the wearer of a vibrant frog hide can cause the armor to\
  \ ooze a virulent toxin. The next creature that touches the wearer must succeed\
  \ at a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage every round for\
  \ 4 rounds. A poisoned creature can attempt the save again at the beginning of each\
  \ of its turns, and is cured after one successful save. Successful unarmed strikes\
  \ and natural weapon attacks made by or against the wearer count as touching. The\
  \ wearer is immune to his own vibrant frog hide's poison.\nAfter being worn for\
  \ 24 hours, a suit of vibrant frog hide armor causes the wearer to grow a froglike\
  \ tongue. The tongue acts as a whip for the purposes of damage, reach, and special\
  \ features, except that it is a natural weapon with which the wearer is automatically\
  \ proficient. In addition to its normal trip and disarm weapon features, the tongue\
  \ may also be used to perform a drag combat maneuver with a +2 circumstance bonus,\
  \ but only to pull a creature closer to the wearer (the wearer cannot step back\
  \ as part of this attack). The wearer cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components\
  \ for 1 round after he uses his new tongue to attack (including any attacks of opportunity)."
