description: "When this ring is worn, the wielder's skin attains a barely perceptible\
  \ sheen. In practical terms, the wearer ignores the first 5 points of an object's\
  \ hardness when performing a sunder combat maneuver or when smashing an object.\
  \ She also does not take the standard –4 penalty for making a combat maneuver check\
  \ to disarm while unarmed.\nAdditionally, the ring's wearer can focus all of the\
  \ ring's power, possibly repelling a devastating blow. Once per day, when a critical\
  \ hit or sneak attack is scored on the wearer, there is a 50% chance that the critical\
  \ hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. Using this\
  \ ability is an immediate action, and the wearer must decide to use it before the\
  \ critical hit or sneak attack damage is rolled."
