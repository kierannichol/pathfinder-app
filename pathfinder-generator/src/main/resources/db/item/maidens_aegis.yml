description: "These +2 heavy steel shields were often issued to Gray Maiden unit leaders,\
  \ and many still carry them today. Once per day as a swift action, the wielder of\
  \ a maiden's aegis can reduce the enhancement bonus of the shield to +1 to grant\
  \ a +1 enhancement bonus to up to four other shields within a 30-foot radius. This\
  \ effect persists for 10 minutes, but it ends for any individual shield that moves\
  \ more than 30 feet from the maiden's aegis that granted the bonus."
