description: "This dark, hooded robe has six long, silvery, razor-sharp needles protruding\
  \ from the bottom of its loose sleeves, three on each side. The wearer can launch\
  \ one needle as a ranged touch attack. The needle counts as a thrown weapon with\
  \ a range increment of 10 feet. If the needle hits, it embeds itself in the target's\
  \ flesh, dealing 1 point of piercing damage and 1 point of bleed damage. A creature\
  \ can pull out the needle as a full-round action, which ends the bleed effect. The\
  \ needle is destroyed if an attack with it misses or when it is removed from a creature\
  \ it was embedded in. The robe regrows all spent needles each morning."
