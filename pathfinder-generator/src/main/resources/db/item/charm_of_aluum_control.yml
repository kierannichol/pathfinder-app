description: "This pendant holds a glowing crystal etched with faint runes. Created\
  \ by the pactmasters of Katapesh to manipulate and control their constructs known\
  \ as aluums, these charms are much sought after on the black market. Unauthorized\
  \ possession of a charm of aluum control is considered a grave crime in Katapesh,\
  \ punishable by decades of imprisonment, exile, or even death. Each charm of aluum\
  \ control is attuned to a single, specific aluum, but the magic of the charm allows\
  \ it to function somewhat against other aluums as well. Against its specific attuned\
  \ aluum, the charm grants you the ability to command that construct as if you were\
  \ using dominate person on a humanoid creature. This effect functions against other\
  \ aluums, but non-attuned aluums gain a DC 16 Will save to resist the effect. If\
  \ an aluum fails such a save, it becomes attuned to that charm and the previous\
  \ aluum becomes unattuned—a single charm of aluum control can only be attuned to\
  \ one aluum at a time. For purposes of this effect, ordering an aluum to attack\
  \ a Pactmaster or someone who appears to be part of Katapesh's government or army\
  \ or to damage any structure in the city of Katapesh counts as an action against\
  \ the aluum's nature and allows the aluum a new saving throw with a +2 bonus to\
  \ resist the charm's effects. If an aluum escapes this effect, it is no longer attuned\
  \ and typically attacks the target who attempted to command it."
