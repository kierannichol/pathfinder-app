description: "This ring appears as a normal ring of eloquence (Pathfinder RPG Advanced\
  \ Class Guide 216), with four different languages (usually Common, Dwarven, Elven,\
  \ and Gnome) etched around the inside of a silver band, and the wearer of a chatter\
  \ ring gains the ability to speak the four languages inscribed in the ring. However,\
  \ the difference between a chatter ring and a normal ring of eloquence quickly becomes\
  \ apparent when the wearer speaks, as he becomes overwhelmingly talkative. The wearer\
  \ takes a –2 penalty on Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Perform (oratory), and Stealth\
  \ checks. The ring can be removed only after the wearer benefits from a remove curse\
  \ spell or similar effect."
