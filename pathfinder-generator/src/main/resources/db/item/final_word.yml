description: "This +1 war razor is commonly used by members of the Bloody Barbers\
  \ thieves' guild in Absalom. A preferred means for the guild to permanently silence\
  \ snitches and traitorous informants as part of their trademark method of eliminating\
  \ enemies (a practice they call giving someone a \"crimson shave\"), this blade\
  \ also sees wide use throughout thieves' and assassins' guilds and among the ranks\
  \ of bounty hunters in almost every nation of the Inner Sea region.\nWhen delivering\
  \ a coup de grace with a final word, the wielder gains a +4 bonus to the DC of the\
  \ Fortitude saving throw to determine whether the target of the coup de grace dies\
  \ from the attack. This bonus is not added to the weapon damage of the coup de grace\
  \ attack.\nAny target slain by a coup de grace made with a final word has its spirit\
  \ wrenched out of its body. The spirit is then forced to answer four questions of\
  \ the wielder's choosing as though under the effects of a speak with dead spell.\
  \ The target can't attempt a Will save to ignore this effect, and takes a â€“4 penalty\
  \ on all Bluff checks to deceive the wielder. After a target answers the wielder's\
  \ questions, it can't be the target of any further speak with dead spells."
