description: "Embroidered with sapphires, this blue sash stands out in stark contrast\
  \ to the fiery tones of the City of Brass. Emissary's sashes mark contacts whose\
  \ business necessitates visiting the Noble and Slave Quarters, but who cannot be\
  \ trusted to roam the city unsupervised. Noble families assign slaves to follow\
  \ sash-bearers through restricted areas and report on their activities."
