name: "Scroll of Destruction"
description: "This spell instantly delivers 10 points of damage per caster level.\
  \ If the spell slays the target, it consumes the remains utterly in holy (or unholy)\
  \ fire (but not its equipment or possessions). If the target's Fortitude saving\
  \ throw succeeds, it instead takes 10d6 points of damage. The only way to restore\
  \ life to a character who has failed to save against this spell (and was slain)\
  \ is to use true resurrection, a carefully worded wish spell followed by resurrection,\
  \ or miracle."
