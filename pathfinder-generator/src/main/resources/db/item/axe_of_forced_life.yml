description: "This +3 battleaxe has a well-worn haft and a blackened blade etched\
  \ with an ouroboros. An axe of forced life briefly disrupts the damage reduction\
  \ of undead creatures. Once per round when the wielder strikes an undead creature\
  \ that has DR/bludgeoning, DR/good, DR/magic, or DR/piercing, the wielder can reduce\
  \ the target's damage reduction by 5 points (to a minimum of 0). This effect lasts\
  \ for 1 round, and reduces only the types of damage reduction listed. On a confirmed\
  \ critical hit, the wielder may reduce the target's damage reduction by up to 15\
  \ points. The effects of multiple axes of forced life don't stack, and the effects\
  \ of an axe of forced life do not stack with the effects of a negating weapon.\n\
  Once per day as a move action, the wielder of an axe of forced life may cause life\
  \ energy to course through the weapon for 1 minute. Doing so causes the axe's ouroboros\
  \ to shed light as a candle. Thereafter, the first undead creature struck by the\
  \ axe must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or lose the benefits of all forms of damage\
  \ reduction it possesses except DR/epic for 1 round."
