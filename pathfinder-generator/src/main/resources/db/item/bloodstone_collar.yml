description: "This leather collar is studded with red and black heliotropes and fastened\
  \ with an iron clasp. It functions only when worn by a spellcaster's familiar or\
  \ spirit animal. If a familiar wearing a bloodstone collar is reduced to fewer than\
  \ 0 hit points, the familiar immediately stabilizes at –1 hit points, and any remaining\
  \ damage is dealt to the familiar's master. The master can refuse this damage, but\
  \ the feedback of doing so immediately slays the familiar. Each time a bloodstone\
  \ collar activates, one of its heliotrope studs cracks; once a third stud cracks,\
  \ the collar becomes a ordinary nonmagical collar. A bloodstone collar is not triggered\
  \ by death effects or other damaging effects that do not deal hit point damage."
