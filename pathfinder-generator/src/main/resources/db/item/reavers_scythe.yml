description: "The black blade of this +2 keen unholy scythe reflects faint images\
  \ of the souls of those it has claimed. Whenever the scythe is used to drop a creature\
  \ to â€“1 hit points or less, the creature must immediately make a DC 14 Will save\
  \ or be instantly slain. If the reaver's scythe kills a creature, either through\
  \ damage or because the creature failed its Will save, the wielder immediately receives\
  \ 1 hero point. This hero point must be used within 1 hour or it is lost. The wielder\
  \ cannot gain another hero point from the scythe until the first is used or lost."
