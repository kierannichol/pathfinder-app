description: "This whip has a series of razor-sharp blades and fangs inset along its\
  \ tip. It deals lethal damage, even to creatures with armor bonuses. If you are\
  \ proficient with both the scorpion whip and whip, you can use a scorpion whip in\
  \ either the normal way (as a light performance weapon) or as a whip. When you use\
  \ a scorpion whip as a whip, it is equivalent to a whip, but deals lethal damage\
  \ and can harm creatures regardless of their armor bonus."
