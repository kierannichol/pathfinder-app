description: "Razmir's faithful utilize a number of tools to help them control the\
  \ populace, but few are more insidious than the tears of Razmir. This alchemical\
  \ concoction contains mild narcotics and hallucinogens that bolster the user's energy\
  \ and resistance to pain. It is also highly addictive. Although the clergy gives\
  \ away tears of Razmir to non-users, it eventually demands payment—as much as 10\
  \ gp per dose from wealthy addicts. See pages 236–237 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery\
  \ Guide for additional rules on drugs and addiction.\nType ingested; Addiction major,\
  \ Fortitude DC 18\nEffects 1 hour; +1 alchemical bonus to Constitution, -2 penalty\
  \ on Wisdom-based skill checks\nDamage 1d2 Con damage"
