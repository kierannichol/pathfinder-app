description: "This glass container of foul-smelling oil shatters easily upon impact.\
  \ You can throw a vial of noxious aromatic as a splash weapon with a range increment\
  \ of 10 feet. If a creature with the scent sense is standing in the square of impact,\
  \ it must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds. Any\
  \ creature with scent in an adjacent square must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save\
  \ or be sickened for 1 round. Creatures without the scent ability are not affected\
  \ by noxious aromatic."
