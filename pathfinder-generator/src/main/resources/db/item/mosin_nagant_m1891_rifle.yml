description: "This bolt-action rifle is the mainstay of Russian military forces. It\
  \ is similar to the advanced firearms rif le with the following differences. It\
  \ uses the same 7.62 54mmR ammunition as the Madsen machine gun, and is fed from\
  \ a 5-round internal, nondetachable magazine that is typically loaded with 5-round\
  \ stripper clips (loading it is a move action). Without stripper clips, you may\
  \ only reload up to 2 rounds of ammunition as a move action. Ammunition is typically\
  \ sold in groups of 5 rounds. The rifle has a lug for the attachment of a socket\
  \ bayonet, and can be equipped with a unique sidemount scope system (see below)."
