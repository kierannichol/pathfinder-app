description: "Unable to use levitate like noble drow, common drow sometimes rely on\
  \ these magical bolts to keep pace on climbs to the surface world or when delving\
  \ deep caves.\nA caver's bolt resembles a weighty, iron-banded crossbow bolt with\
  \ a steel tip, capped with prongs and hooks. It resizes itself to fit any Small\
  \ or Medium crossbow, and can be used as a nonmagical grappling arrow. The bearer\
  \ loads the bolt into a crossbow, chooses a solid surface within weapon range, and\
  \ speaks a command word to launch the bolt and embed it in the surface. The launched\
  \ bolt trails a ghostly purple chain of force connected to the crossbow. Anyone\
  \ holding the crossbow can speak a command word to retract the chain at a rate of\
  \ 30 feet per round, pulling the user toward the embedded bolt. The force chain\
  \ can support 500 pounds (hardness 10, 10 hp, break DC 28). Once the chain is fully\
  \ retracted, the bolt can be used again. If the force chain is severed or broken,\
  \ the caver's bolt ceases to function for 24 hours."
