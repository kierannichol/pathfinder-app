description: "The chakram is a simple, elegant, and highly portable thrown weapon.\
  \ It is a flat, open-centered metal discus with a sharpened edge. You can wield\
  \ the chakram as a melee weapon, but it is not designed for such use; you take a\
  \ â€“1 penalty on your attack roll with the weapon and must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex\
  \ save or cut yourself on the blade (half damage, no Strength modifier). You do\
  \ not need to make this save if wearing heavy armor."
