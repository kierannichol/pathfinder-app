description: "This silvery gray cloak seems to absorb light rather than be illuminated\
  \ by it. On command, the cloak makes its wearer ethereal (as the ethereal jaunt\
  \ spell). The effect is dismissible. The cloak works for a total of up to 10 minutes\
  \ per day. This duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1 minute\
  \ increments."
