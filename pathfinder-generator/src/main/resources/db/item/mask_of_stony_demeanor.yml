description: "When worn, this mask transforms the wearer's face into a stone statue\
  \ and its voice into an emotionless monotone. Though it allows the wearer to speak,\
  \ its facial expressions and voice betray little emotion, granting a +10 competence\
  \ bonus on Bluff checks made to lie and a +5 competence bonus on Bluff checks made\
  \ to feint, but also imposing a â€“5 penalty on Bluff checks made to pass a hidden\
  \ message."
