description: "These alchemical beads function as sentry seeds, but are also filled\
  \ with an alchemical gas that explodes on contact with the air. This explosion is\
  \ louder and flashier than the pop of normal sentry seeds (Perception DC 0). Creatures\
  \ within 5 feet of the beads when they break must succeed at a DC 11 Fortitude save\
  \ or be blinded for 1 round."
