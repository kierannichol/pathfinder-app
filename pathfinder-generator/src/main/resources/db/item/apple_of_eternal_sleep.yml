description: "This ripe red apple looks fresh and delicious. Should anyone bite into\

  \ fall into an eternal slumber as though by the witch's grand hex of the same name.\
  \ The victim can only be awakened by a casting of break enchantment, limited wish,\
  \ wish, or miracle, or by a kiss from someone of royal blood."
