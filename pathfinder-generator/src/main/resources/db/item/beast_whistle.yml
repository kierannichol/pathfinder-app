description: "This small wooden whistle emits a high-pitched sound like that of a\
  \ signal whistle, except the signal is audible only to a specific type of creature—\
  other types of creatures hear only a quiet hissing sound.\nBeast whistles come in\
  \ six different varieties: avian, canine, feline, rodent, reptile, and ungulate\
  \ (other varieties may be available at the GM's discretion). Animals and magical\
  \ beasts that match a beast whistle's type can hear the whistle as a human hears\
  \ a signal whistle. Creatures that fit into multiple categories (such as griffons)\
  \ can usually hear the call of multiple types of whistles, though magical beasts\
  \ who don't fit into any of the above categories cannot hear a beast whistle. Beast\
  \ whistles don't function underwater, except if surrounded by an air bubble (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Ultimate Combat 222) or similar effect, though creatures underwater may hear\
  \ a beast whistle sounded from above the surface if they are close enough."
