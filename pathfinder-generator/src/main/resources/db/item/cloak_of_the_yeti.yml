description: "This heavy cloak is crafted from shaggy white yeti fur. When the cloak's\
  \ hood is pulled up over the wearer's head, it takes on a semblance of its arctic\
  \ namesake's fearsome visage. Northern warriors value its ability to ward against\
  \ the chill of winter, as well as the protection it provides in combat. The cloak\
  \ of the yeti provides a constant endure elements effect in cold weather (it has\
  \ no effect in hot weather). In battle, the cloak wraps around the wearer, granting\
  \ a +1 natural armor bonus. In addition, with the hood drawn over the wearer's head,\
  \ the cloak grants a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate skill checks."
