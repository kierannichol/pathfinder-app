description: "This mixture of seed and dead insects is suitable food for small birds\
  \ such as ravens, crows, and chickens. Birds of prey such as falcons, hawks, and\
  \ owls can also sustain themselves on bird feed, though they typically require at\
  \ least two servings per day. Larger avian creatures such as axe beaks and griffons\
  \ require larger portions of meat, and cannot survive on bird feed alone."
