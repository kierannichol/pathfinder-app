description: "This small metallic device resembles a crab's claw. When the item is\
  \ pinched and released, friction on the claw's inner surface creates a loud clicking\
  \ noise that carries up to a half mile underwater. The intensity of the sound decreases\
  \ as the click passes through water, providing a listener familiar with the sound\
  \ a general sense of the distance and direction of the noise's origin (Perception\
  \ DC 0, +1 per 100 feet between the click-claw and the listener). Click-claws are\
  \ particularly useful for keeping a group together in murky water, and many undersea\
  \ animal handlers train their animals to respond to the noise."
