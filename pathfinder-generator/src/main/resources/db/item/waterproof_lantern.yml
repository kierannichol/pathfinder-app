description: "Meant to shelter its flame from both water and wind, this lantern treats\
  \ severe winds as strong winds, windstorms as severe winds, and hurricanes as windstorms\
  \ for the purpose of determining whether they extinguish its flame. It holds enough\
  \ air to burn underwater for 5 rounds before going dark."
