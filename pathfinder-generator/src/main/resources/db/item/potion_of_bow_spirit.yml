  \ a swift action to direct the bow spiritto fire an arrow or a bolt at a target\
  \ of your choice, as if thebow spiritwere firing the necessary ranged weapon. The\
  \ bow spirituses your base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier, as well as\
  \ any bonuses and effects from feats you have that affect ranged attacks, or bonuses\
  \ from the ammunition it uses. A bow spirit'sattacks do not provoke attacks of opportunity.\

  \ as if used by you."
