description: "Named after a malevolent Mwangi goddess, this sack of luminous paste\
  \ is made from crushed jungle flowers. You can throw Kitumu's ire as a ranged touch\
  \ attack with a range increment of 10 feet; on a hit, the target is coated with\
  \ the paste. A target coated with the paste draws the attention of any swarm within\
  \ 30 feet, causing it to seek out and attack the target over any other creature.\
  \ In addition, an affected creature takes a –2 penalty on saving throws against\
  \ swarms' distraction ability. Kitumu's ire lasts for 1 hour or until washed away\
  \ with at least a gallon of alcohol."
