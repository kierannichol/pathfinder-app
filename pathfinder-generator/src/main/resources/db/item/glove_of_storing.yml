description: "This device is a single leather glove. On command, one item held in\
  \ the hand wearing the glove disappears. The item can weigh no more than 20 pounds\
  \ and must be able to be held in one hand. While stored, the item has negligible\
  \ weight. With a snap of the fingers wearing the glove, the item reappears. A glove\
  \ can only store one item at a time. Storing or retrieving the item is a free action.\
  \ The item is shrunk down so small within the palm of the glove that it cannot be\
  \ seen. Spell durations are not suppressed, but continue to expire. If the glove's\
  \ effect is suppressed or dispelled, the stored item appears instantly. A glove\
  \ of storing uses up the wearer's entire hands slot. The wearer may not use another\
  \ item (even another glove of storing) that also uses the hands slot."
