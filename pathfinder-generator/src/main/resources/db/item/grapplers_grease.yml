description: "When applied to your body, this pale grease made from animal fat makes\
  \ you more difficult to grapple. While covered in the grease, you gain a +4 bonus\
  \ to CMD against grapple combat maneuvers. Applying the grease takes 1 minute, and\
  \ once applied, its effects last for 10 minutes. You can't be wearing armor to gain\
  \ the benefit of grappler's grease. Grappler's grease is usually sold in small clay\
  \ jars that hold five applications."
