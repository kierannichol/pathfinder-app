description: "These fine silk wrappings-covered in mystic symbols and diagrams of\
  \ the wearer's pressure points-wind around the wearer's hands and wrists. When the\
  \ wearer spends ki to make an additional attack, he can spend 1 additional point\
  \ of ki to use the Stunning Fist feat with the attack, even if he has already used\
  \ the feat that round.\nIf the wearer is a monk using an archetype that replaces\
  \ Stunning Fist with a different feat that's usable a number times per day equal\
  \ to his monk level, hand wraps of blinding ki allow that feat to be used a second\
  \ time instead of allowing him to use Stunning Fist."
