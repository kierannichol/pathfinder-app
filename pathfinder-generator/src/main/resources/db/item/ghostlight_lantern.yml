description: "This brass bullseye lantern is embossed with dancing orbs flitting amid\
  \ a leaf-and-holly motif. A ghostlight lantern functions as a normal bullseye lantern,\
  \ but if the remains of a dead will-o'-wisp are placed inside it, the lantern gains\
  \ additional abilities. The dead will-o'-wisp powers the lantern for a period of\
  \ 1 week, during which time the lantern sheds a bluish-white light without the need\
  \ for oil as fuel. Creatures within the 60-foot cone of the lantern's normal light\
  \ are outlined with a pale, bluish glow, as faerie fire. Orcs within the cone are\
  \ dazzled, as if in bright sunlight, for as long as they remain within the light.\
  \ Additionally, three times per day as a standard action, the wielder of a ghostlight\
  \ lantern can draw upon the power of the deceased will-o'- wisp fueling it to cast\
  \ shocking grasp. Lastly, while within the bounds of Ghostlight Marsh in the Hold\
  \ of Belkzen, a ghostlight lantern unerringly emits a beacon that illuminates a\
  \ direct path to the circle of standing stones that form the entrance to the Vault\
  \ of Thorns. After 1 week, the power of the deceased aberration is exhausted, and\
  \ the ghostlight lantern loses its additional abilities, once again functioning\
  \ only as a normal bullseye lantern until another dead will-o'-wisp is placed inside."
