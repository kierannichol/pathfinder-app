description: "This small, ornate mirror is mounted inside an enclosing case, such\
  \ as a locket, small jewelry box, or even just a leather flap. To use an attentive\
  \ mirror, the owner must spend 1 hour gazing into the mirror in a ritual to attune\
  \ herself to it. At the end of this time, the owner can willingly give the mirror\
  \ to another creature. Thereafter, the creature that has the mirror can use it as\
  \ an emergency means of communication with the mirror's owner. Up to three times\
  \ per day, the mirror's possessor can open it to alert the attuned owner. This functions\
  \ as a mental alarm with a range of 100 miles. The White Witches of Irrisen frequently\
  \ provide attentive mirrors to their loyal minions and monstrous allies so the witches\
  \ can be notified when their agents have important news. Once alerted, an attuned\
  \ witch can then send aid or cast Irriseni mirror sight to view the situation through\
  \ the mirror and receive a minion's report directly."
