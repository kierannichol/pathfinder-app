description: "This +1 full plate is decorated with a wave and fish motif and often\
  \ has tiny fins and scales worked into the design. Although the armor remains as\
  \ heavy and bulky as normal full plate, the wearer of plate armor of the deep is\
  \ treated as unarmored for purposes of Swim checks. The wearer can breathe underwater\
  \ and can converse with any waterbreathing creature with a language."
