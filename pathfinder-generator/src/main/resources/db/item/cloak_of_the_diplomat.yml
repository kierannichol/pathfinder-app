description: "The forest-green cloak grants a +5 competence bonus on Diplomacy and\
  \ Sense Motive checks. In addition, once per day, before making a Diplomacy or Sense\
  \ Motive check, the wearer can decide to call upon the powers of the cloak to roll\
  \ twice and take the better result. Finally, the wearer of this cloak can adjust\
  \ a creature's attitude up to three steps when using Diplomacy, instead of the normal\
  \ limit of two steps. However, the cloak's power does have one drawback. Should\
  \ the wearer ever fail a Diplomacy checks made to adjust a creature's attitude by\
  \ 5 or more, the creature's attitude is reduced by two steps instead of one."
