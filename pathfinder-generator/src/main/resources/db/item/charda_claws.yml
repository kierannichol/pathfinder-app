description: "This tiny set of sculpted claws, made from stone carefully chipped from\
  \ the Battle of Charda monument (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Magnimar, City of\
  \ Monuments 11), is set upon a fine chain. Once per day when attempting an Intimidate\
  \ check to demoralize a single opponent in combat, the user can forcefully present\
  \ the charda claws as part of the action to activate their residual power. Using\
  \ the claws in this way requires a free hand, but only while the Intimidate check\
  \ is made. If the Intimidate check was a success and the target is demoralized,\
  \ the claws grant the wielder a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against that creature\
  \ for the duration of the demoralized effect. If the wielder uses the claws but\
  \ the Intimidate check is not successful, the claws' daily use is expended to no\
  \ effect."
