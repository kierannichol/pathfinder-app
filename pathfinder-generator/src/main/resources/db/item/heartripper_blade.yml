description: "This +1 dagger is granted baleful powers when used in bloody sacrifice.\
  \ Whenever used to deliver a coup de grace, the Heartripper Blade pulls the victim's\
  \ still-beating heart free from his body. You may then consume the heart to gain\
  \ any of the following abilities.\nYou may eat the heart to gain a simultaneous\
  \ remove disease, restoration, and cure serious wounds effect.\nYou may utter a\
  \ command word and cause the heart to burst into flames, after which the Blade becomes\
  \ a +2 flaming burst dagger for 1 hour. This consumes the heart.\nYou may speak\
  \ a blasphemous second command word to cause the heart to boil and smoke. Breathing\
  \ in the smoke gives you glimpses of the future or far off places and objects, granting\
  \ you the ability to use divination or scrying. This consumes the heart."
