description: "This rare and expensive variant of standard Garundi pesh is produced\
  \ by introducing a vial of dragon's blood into a dose of pesh during the refining\
  \ process, and has a noticeable reddish tint. While the drug provides a more potent\
  \ high and fewer immediate penalties, it is highly addictive, and unless a user\
  \ has a steady supply of dragon's blood, the cost to her wellbeing can be severe.\
  \ For more information on drugs and addictions, see page 236 of the Pathfinder RPG\
  \ GameMastery Guide."
