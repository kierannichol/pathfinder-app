description: "A hanging tent is a small tent (able to comfortably house a single Medium\
  \ creature) with a teardrop shape, which hangs from a sturdy anchor rope. The rope\
  \ can be tied to a tree limb, grappling hook, or even a piton hammered into a cliff\
  \ side. Hanging tents are used primarily in mountainous terrain (where no flat surface\
  \ may be available for camping) and swamps (where no dry ground may be available).\
  \ Climbing in or out of a hanging tent is a full-round action that requires a DC\
  \ 10 Climb check. Failure indicates another attempt must be made, while failure\
  \ by 5 or more indicates the camper has fallen from the tent."
