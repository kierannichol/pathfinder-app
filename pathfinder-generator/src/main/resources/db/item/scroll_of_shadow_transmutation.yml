name: "Scroll of Shadow Transmutation"
description: "You suffuse one subject's body with energy from the Shadow Plane, altering\
  \ its form to match a creature from the Shadow Plane. Shadow transmutation can mimic\
  \ any of the following spells: animal growth, anthropomorphic animalUM, enlarge\
  \ person, fins to feetARG, longarmACG, polymorph, reduce person, and stone fist.\
  \ If using shadow transmutation as polymorph, the target does not gain any sensory\
  \ abilities that its new form has (such as lowlight vision or darkvision) and the\
  \ speed of any movement types gained from the spell cannot exceed the target's base\
  \ speed or natural speed with those movement types (whichever is higher). A creature\
  \ under the effects of shadow transmutation deals normal damage and has all the\
  \ normal abilities and weaknesses of whatever form it assumes using the spell."
