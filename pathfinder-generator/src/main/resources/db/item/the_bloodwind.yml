description: "This folding boat is made of rich, dark wood and a sail of blood-red\
  \ cloth. In its ship form, it is the size of a longship, with 20 sets of oars and\
  \ manacles to keep slave rowers in place. When in ship form, the Bloodwind can create\
  \ a gust of powerful wind behind its sails as from a feather token (fan). This ability\
  \ lasts for only 1 hour, and can be used once each day. The Bloodwind's special\
  \ purpose is to serve the moon-beasts of Leng as a slave ship. When called by the\
  \ moon-beasts' eerie piping, which the Bloodwind can hear from anywhere in the Dreamlands,\
  \ it can sail through the air as with overland flight to the Dreamlands' mysterious\
  \ moon.\nThe Bloodwind has a sly and spiteful intelligence and is fond of cruel\
  \ pranks. It has sufficient self-mobility to operate its own sails, lock and unlock\
  \ its own manacles, and trigger its powers, although it cannot operate all of its\
  \ oars at once and therefore requires rowers to move when the wind is slack. The\
  \ Bloodwind willingly follows the commands of moon-beasts and denizens of Leng,\
  \ but plays cruel jokes on others, both slaves and slavers alike: untying knots,\
  \ raising its anchor at inconvenient times, or even folding into a box and obstinately\
  \ refusing to return to ship form. The Bloodwind's favorite prank is to surreptitiously\
  \ unlock a new slave's manacles to offer the hope of freedom, and then snap them\
  \ shut againâ€”preferably bloodying a finger or toe in the process."
