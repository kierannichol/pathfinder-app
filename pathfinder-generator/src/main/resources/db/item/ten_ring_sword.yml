description: "This finely crafted +2 nine-ring broadsword has an extra gap at the\
  \ base of the blade's unsharpened edge, closest to the hilt, seemingly to fit an\
  \ extra ring. The wielder of a ten-ring sword can use a full-round action to place\
  \ a magic ring into the empty slot, where the ring then rests until removed (another\
  \ full-round action). Once a ring is fitted to the tenth slot, the sword's wielder\
  \ can employ that ring as if he were wearing it, even if he is currently wearing\
  \ two magic rings.\nAlternatively, the sword's wielder can fit a ring made of a\
  \ specific metal like adamantine or cold iron into the tenth slot. Doing so allows\
  \ the sword to penetrate damage reduction as if it were made of the same metal as\
  \ the ring. Using this property does not grant the weapon any additional properties\
  \ of that metal (such as bypassing hardness, etc.). Typically, such metal rings\
  \ cost one-tenth the cost of a ninering broadsword made from that material. In the\
  \ event that a magic ring made from a specific metal, like silver, is affixed to\
  \ the sword's tenth slot, the sword's wielder decides which of the weapon's two\
  \ properties will be in effect when the ring is placed. However, the sword's wielder\
  \ can use a move action to switch between properties."
