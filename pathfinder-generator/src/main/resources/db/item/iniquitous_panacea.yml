description: "Although it's often packaged and sold as a cure-all, this nefarious\
  \ snake-oil concoction temporarily weakens the immune system of whoever consumes\
  \ it, accelerating the rate at which the drinker suffers from a contracted poison\
  \ or disease.\nConsuming the iniquitous panacea while suffering the effects of a\
  \ disease or poison increases the DCs of the imbiber's next three Fortitude saving\
  \ throws against the disease or poison by 2 and halves the remaining onset time\
  \ of any contracted diseases or poisons that have not yet taken effect; these effects\
  \ wear off after 24 hours. An iniquitous panacea has no effect on creatures that\
  \ have not contracted a disease or a poison. Crafting an iniquitous panacea requires\
  \ a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check."
