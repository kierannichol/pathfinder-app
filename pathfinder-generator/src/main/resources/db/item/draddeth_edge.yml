description: "This +1 defiant transformative warhammer houses the mind of a cunning\
  \ schemer and brilliant military tactician. The weapon has a deep sense of patriotism\
  \ for the nation of Molthune, and it seeks to help its owner rise through the ranks\
  \ of that militant nation. The weapon never willingly reveals its name until it\
  \ feels its job as a military tutor is nearing completion.\nThe Draddeth Edge enjoys\
  \ listening to military strategies, and empathically communicates its feelings on\
  \ tactics to its owner. It evaluates its owner's underlings and despises incompetent\
  \ or untrustworthy comrades, generals, and commanders, urging its owner to dismiss\
  \ them from service. When dealing with a well-meaning but tactically inept owner,\
  \ The Draddeth Edge attempts to exert its ego during military matters.\nThe weapon\
  \ has a +12 bonus on Profession (soldier) checks, and a +7 bonus on Sense Motive\
  \ checks. It can cast magic aura on itself at will (Will DC 13 disbelieves) and\
  \ teleport on itself once per day. The Draddeth Edge can read and understand Common\
  \ and Varisian.\nOwners who think too highly of Molthune's rival nations (especially\
  \ Nirmathas), or who frequently argue with the weapon, find The Draddeth Edge missing\
  \ at critical moments. The warhammer uses a combination of its transformative, magic\
  \ aura, and teleport abilities to evade service to these potential owners, and to\
  \ leave its current owner when it feels its purpose is complete."
