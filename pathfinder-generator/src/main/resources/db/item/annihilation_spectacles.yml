description: "Creatures viewed through these darkly tinted glasses sometimes seem\
  \ to flicker briefly in and out of existence. A transmuter can use these spectacles\
  \ to spontaneously convert any prepared wizard transmutation spell into any other\
  \ wizard transmutation spell he knows; the desired spell must be of the same level\
  \ or lower than the prepared spell. Once per day, he may use the spectacles to spontaneously\
  \ cast disintegrate in place of one of his prepared transmutation wizard spells\
  \ of 6th level or higher, even if he doesn't know that spell."
