description: "This formfitting black +1 leather features eight ridged support ribs\
  \ along the back. On command, the arachnid harness sprouts eight enormous spidery\
  \ legs from these ribs. These legs allow the armor's wearer to attempt Climb checks\
  \ at full speed without needing to use her hands or feet. Additionally, while the\
  \ legs are deployed, the armor's wearer doesn't lose her Dexterity bonus to AC while\
  \ climbing, and need not succeed at a Climb check to avoid falling if she takes\
  \ damage while climbing."
