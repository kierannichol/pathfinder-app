description: "This foot-long tube of gold absorbs nearby sound when struck, as if\
  \ it were the target of a silence spell. This ability can be used once per day.\
  \ The chime vibrates silently for the next 5 rounds, increasing in strength as time\
  \ passes. On the bearer's turn each round there is a cumulative 20% chance that\
  \ the chime prematurely ends the magical silence and releases the pent-up sound\
  \ as a shout spell as a free action, oriented in a random direction. The bearer\
  \ may spend a standard action to strike the vibrating chime again, ending its silence\
  \ early and unleashing the shout in a direction of his choosing. If dropped while\
  \ vibrating, the chime automatically gains the broken condition and releases the\
  \ shout effect in a random direction. A broken chime of resounding silence cannot\
  \ be used until it is repaired. The chime has no effect if struck in an area of\
  \ silence it did not create."
