description: "After casting this spell, the next creature you attack using your smite\
  \ evil class ability is engulfed in holy flames that flare up when the target attacks\
  \ someone other than you. If at any time during the duration of your smite evil\
  \ effect the target makes an attack that does not include you, it takes 3d8 points\
  \ of fire damage. Once triggered in this manner, or when your smite evil ability\
  \ expires, the spell ends."
