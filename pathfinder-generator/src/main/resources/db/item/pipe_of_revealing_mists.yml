description: "A pair of angry, squinting eyes is carved into the bowl of this wooden\
  \ smoking pipe. The pipe defies any attempts to light it; even when it's unlit,\
  \ pale wafts of smoke constantly crawl out from the pipe's bowl, despite being unlit.\
  \ Three times per day as a standard action, the user can inhale the smoke and blow\
  \ it out in a 30-foot cone. While most of the smoke quickly dissipates, a thin layer\
  \ of it clings to any corporeal invisible creatures caught in the cone. The creatures\
  \ are revealed as blurred shapes, rather than being invisible, but attacks against\
  \ them still suffer a 20% miss chance. This effect lasts for 6 rounds."
