description: "This altar takes the form of a throne sized for a Large humanoid. It's\
  \ carved from mountain stone, and its surface is inscribed with prayers to Gozreh\
  \ in Thassilonian and to Ioz'om in Giant. The Throne of the Sky-Father projects\
  \ a magic circle against law that affects creatures within 50 feet of the throne.\
  \ A character within this area can speak a prayer to Gozreh to gain a temporary\
  \ blessing from the altar (treat this as speaking a command word to activate a magic\
  \ item). Praying at the altar grants a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against\
  \ weather effects and a +2 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, and Fly checks.\
  \ This blessing ends after 24 hours (or earlier, if dispelled or ended by the actions\
  \ of the worshiper). The altar can provide its blessing only once per creature per\
  \ day."
