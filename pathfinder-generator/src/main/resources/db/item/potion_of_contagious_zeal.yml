name: "Potion of Contagious Zeal"
description: "The target gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage\
  \ rolls, 1d6 temporary hit points, and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against\
  \ fear effects and to the DC of Intimidate checks attempted against her. Once per\
  \ round, the target can select one other creature to gain this bonus as well. The\
  \ chosen creature can be no farther from the target than 25 feet + 5 feet for every\
  \ 2 caster levels you possess, and a creature can't be selected more than once in\
  \ this way. Such allies gain only the bonuses and temporary hit points; they don't\
  \ continue to spread it to other creatures. The additional creatures' bonuses and\
  \ temporary hit points share the original spell's duration, so when that duration\
  \ ends, all affected creatures lose their bonuses and any remaining temporary hit\
  \ points from this spell."
