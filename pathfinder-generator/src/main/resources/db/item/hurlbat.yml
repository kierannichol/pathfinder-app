description: "A hurlbat is a throwing axe made from a single piece of flat metal.\
  \ Every extremity of the hurlbat is sharpened, including the point of the handle.\
  \ You can wield the hurlbat as a melee weapon, but it's not designed for such use;\
  \ you take a â€“1 penalty on melee attack rolls with the weapon, and you must succeed\
  \ at a DC 15 Reflex save when making melee attacks to avoid cutting yourself on\
  \ an edge and taking 1 point of slashing damage. You don't need to attempt this\
  \ save while wearing heavy armor."
