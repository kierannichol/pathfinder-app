description: "Although intended for trapping large animals, bear traps work as well\
  \ for trapping humanoids or monsters. The hinged jaws of the trap are attached to\
  \ a chain, which in turn is secured to a spike driven into the ground to ensure\
  \ that the victim cannot simply crawl away. Prying open the jaws or pulling the\
  \ spike from the ground requires a DC 20 Strength check."
