name: "Scroll of Deceptive Redundancy"
description: "You create a contingent ward that defies those who would dispel your\
  \ magic, convincing them that their spell worked. When a spell such as dispel magic\
  \ would end one of your spells that's affecting you, you can dismiss deceptive redundancy\
  \ as an immediate action to attempt an opposed caster level check against the spellcaster.\
  \ If you succeed, the dispelling effect fails to end your spell, and your spell's\
  \ aura becomes difficult to detect for 1 round per caster level. Any divination\
  \ attempted during this time fails to perceive the spell's aura unless the caster\
  \ succeeds at a caster level check (DC = 15 + your caster level). Deceptive redundancy\
  \ is most effective when hiding auras for spells that don't have easily perceived\
  \ effects, rather than visually obvious spells such as enlarge person or fire shield."
