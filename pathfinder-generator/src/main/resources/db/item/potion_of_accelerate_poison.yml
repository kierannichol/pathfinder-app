name: "Potion of Accelerate Poison"
description: "You hasten the onset of poison in the target. If the poison normally\
  \ has an onset time, its effects begin immediately. If the poison has no onset time,\
  \ its frequency is doubled, requiring two saving throws and inflicting damage twice\
  \ per round or minute, though its duration is halved. Accelerate poison does not\
  \ change the cure condition for the poison. If the target is affected by more than\
  \ one poison, you may choose which is affected if you administered the poison; otherwise,\
  \ randomly determine which poison is affected."
