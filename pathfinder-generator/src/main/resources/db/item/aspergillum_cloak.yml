description: "This drab brown, hooded cloak acts as a cloak of resistance +1 but also\
  \ quickly absorbs any liquids poured onto it, drying in moments. Three times per\
  \ day, the wearer can pour a vial of holy water onto the interior lining of an aspergillum\
  \ cloak, causing its outer surface to glisten and drip. The holy water cannot be\
  \ recovered once absorbed. For 7 minutes, the garment is soaked in holy water, dealing\
  \ 2d4 points of damage to any undead or evil outsider that strikes the wearer with\
  \ an unarmed strike or a natural weapon. An aspergillum cloak can also absorb unholy\
  \ water instead, dealing damage to good outsiders instead. An aspergillum cloak\
  \ gains no special abilities from absorbing any other liquid."
