description: "Swirling green and blue patterns bedeck the surface of this fine oak\
  \ wayfinder, whose compass and needle are made of light polished steel engraved\
  \ with themes of Gozreh's oceanic aspect. The needle does not point north as one\
  \ would expect, but instead indicates the direction the wind is traveling in the\
  \ area around the wayfinder. A wayfinder of zephyrs grants its bearer a +5 circumstance\
  \ bonus on Profession (sailor) checks. Once per day, the bearer of a wayfinder of\
  \ zephyrs can move the needle to change the direction the wind is traveling toward\
  \ any direction on the compass. Optionally, the wielder may also increase or decrease\
  \ the wind's intensity by one step (Core Rulebook 439) while changing its direction.\
  \ A wayfinder of zephyrs has no effect on magical wind effects other than indicating\
  \ the direction they are traveling."
