description: "An alchemically fired piston in the head of this two-handed hammer strikes\
  \ targets with astounding force. Successful sunder attacks made with a piston maul\
  \ deal an additional 4 points of damage. A piston maul requires a thunderstone to\
  \ function; otherwise, it functions as a greatclub. Inserting a thunderstone into\
  \ the weapon's compartment is a standard action, and powers the weapon for 24 hours,\
  \ after which the thunderstone is consumed."
