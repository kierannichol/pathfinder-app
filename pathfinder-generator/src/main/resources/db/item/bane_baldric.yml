description: "This ornate sash of embroidered velvet stretches across the chest from\
  \ shoulder to waist. If the wearer is an inquisitor, she is treated as five levels\
  \ higher when using her bane and greater bane abilities. If the wearer is not an\
  \ inquisitor, she gains the bane ability of a 5th-level inquisitor, but must first\
  \ attune a light or one-handed melee weapon to the baldric by hanging it from the\
  \ cloth for 24 hours, and can only use the bane ability with the attuned weapon.\
  \ Attuning a new weapon to the baldric ends the attunement for the previous weapon."
