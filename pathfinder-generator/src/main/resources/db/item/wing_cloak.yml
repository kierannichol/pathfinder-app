description: "This strange piece of equipment only works for sylphs and similar creatures,\
  \ whose light, airy bodies can be borne upon the winds. Looking like a fine silk\
  \ traveler's cloak, a wing cloak is secretly reinforced with a series of wooden\
  \ struts that, when locked into place, stretch the cloak's fabric into a rudimentary\
  \ wing. Arranging the struts into a wing or reversing the change is a move action.\
  \ When the cloak is shaped into a wing, the wearer can make a DC 15 Fly check to\
  \ fall safely from any height without taking falling damage, as if using feather\
  \ fall. When falling, the wearer may make an additional DC 15 Fly check to glide,\
  \ moving 5 feet laterally for every 20 feet she falls. Readying and using a wing\
  \ cloak requires two hands and provokes an attack of opportunity. A wing cloak has\
  \ hardness 0 and 5 hit points. If the wing cloak is broken, the Fly DCs to use it\
  \ increase by +10."
