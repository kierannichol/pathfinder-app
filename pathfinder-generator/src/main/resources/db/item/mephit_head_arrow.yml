description: "The steel head of this masterwork arrow is sculpted to look like a leering\
  \ mephit. If a mephit-head arrow hits, it sprays elemental energy in a 15-foot cone\
  \ that must originate from the target creature (including the creature struck) and\
  \ expand in the direction the arrow was fired. The damage dealt depends on the type\
  \ of mephit-head arrow, as detailed below. A successful DC 13 Reflex save halves\
  \ the cone's damage and negates any additional effect.\nAir Mephit: A blast of wind-borne\
  \ grit deals 1d8 points of slashing damage.\nDust or Salt Mephit: A spray of fine\
  \ grit or coarse salt crystals deals 1d4 points of slashing damage and sickens targets\
  \ in the cone for 3 rounds.\nEarth Mephit: A shower of gravel deals 1d8 points of\
  \ bludgeoning damage.\nFire or Magma Mephit: A cone of flames or spray of magma\
  \ deals 1d8 points of fire damage.\nIce Mephit: Shards of ice deal 1d4 points of\
  \ cold damage and sicken targets in the cone for 3 rounds.\nOoze Mephit: A wave\
  \ of slime deals 1d4 points of acid damage and sickens targets in the cone for 3\
  \ rounds.\nSteam Mephit: A plume of steam deals 1d4 points of fire damage and sickens\
  \ targets in the cone for 3 rounds.\nWater Mephit: A spray of acid deals 1d8 points\
  \ of acid damage."
