description: "This +1/+1 darkwood quarterstaff grants superior balance and acrobatic\
  \ skill. It glows with a faint green-yellow radiance when in use and can extend\
  \ to nearly double its length, though only when being used to perform acrobatic\
  \ feats. The wielder gains a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks and can move\
  \ at full speed without penalty when using Acrobatics to move on narrow surfaces\
  \ or uneven ground. When making a high jump while wielding the quarterstaff of vaulting,\
  \ the Acrobatics DC is equal to 3 times the height to be reached instead of 4.\n\
  In addition, with a successful DC 25 Acrobatics check, the wielder can use the staff\
  \ to vault over an opponent's head in place of taking a 5-foot step. She can only\
  \ use this ability on creatures no more than one size category larger than her,\
  \ and must end her movement in the nearest adjacent square on the opposite side\
  \ of the creature. If this square is unavailable, she cannot use this ability. This\
  \ movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity."
