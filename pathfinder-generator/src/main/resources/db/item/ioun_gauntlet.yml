description: "Much like wayfinders, an ioun gauntlet grants enhanced or altogether\
  \ new abilities depending on the type of ioun stone inserted into its matrix. In\
  \ its base form, an ioun gauntlet grants its wearer the ability to cast detect magic\
  \ as a spell-like ability once per day. When the detect magic effect is active,\
  \ the gauntlet also sheds illumination as light in the 60- foot cone of the detect\
  \ magic effect.\nAn ioun gauntlet features a single matrix in the back of the hand,\
  \ suitable for one ioun stone. When an ioun stone is inserted into the matrix as\
  \ a standard action, the wearer gains the associated bonus from the ioun stone as\
  \ well an additional effect based on the shape of the ioun stone inserted, as listed\
  \ below. While a creature can put on two ioun gauntlets, the wearer gains the additional\
  \ benefit from only one inserted ioun stone.\nCabochon: +1 enhancement bonus on\
  \ Acrobatics checks.\nDisk: +1 enhancement bonus on Linguistics checks.\nEllipsoid:\
  \ +1 enhancement bonus on Knowledge (arcana) checks.\nNodule: +1 enhancement bonus\
