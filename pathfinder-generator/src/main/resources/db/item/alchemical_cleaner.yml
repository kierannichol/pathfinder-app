description: "This caustic alchemical solution dissolves blood, hair, and small pieces\
  \ of flesh. Distributing it over a 5-foot square takes one full-round action and\
  \ increases the DC of Perception checks to find such materials by 20. (A creature\
  \ that fails the Perception check to find such materials by 5 or less realizes the\
  \ area has been unnaturally cleared of them.) This applies only to the original\
  \ Perception DC, not a substituted skill check like those from the cleaner or traceless\
  \ archetypes. One pot of alchemical cleaner contains enough liquid to cover nine\
  \ 5-foot squares. A pot of alchemical cleaner can be thrown as a splash weapon and\
  \ functions as an alkali flask (Advanced Player's Guide 184) when thrown. Crafting\
  \ alchemical cleaner requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."
