description: "This talisman is worn lashed around the neck and is made of flexible\
  \ bark woven into a mesmerizing pattern. While wearing a talisman of beast training,\
  \ a wearer finds that animals become much more patient with her and amenable to\
  \ training. As such, failed Handle Animal checks made during downtime periods— including\
  \ those made to rear animals and teach them new tricks—may be treated as if they\
  \ were successful. The talisman can turn 10 failed checks into successes this way.\
  \ Once the tenth failed check has been converted to a success, the talisman falls\
  \ apart and becomes useless."
