description: "A skulking sniper's blowgun is crafted of fine hardwood that shifts\
  \ color between brown and dark green under different lights. The wielder of this\
  \ +3 distance greater sniping (see page 27) blowgun isn't automatically detected\
  \ by tremorsense, blindsense, blindsight, or similar supernatural senses while she's\
  \ attempting to move unnoticed. Creatures with these abilities must attempt a Perception\
  \ check opposed by the wielder's Stealth check to notice the wielder. Such a creature\
  \ gains a +10 bonus on this Perception check if the wielder is within half the maximum\
  \ range of the sense ability. The wielder can still be detected by other senses\
  \ (such as vision, hearing, or smell) as normal."
