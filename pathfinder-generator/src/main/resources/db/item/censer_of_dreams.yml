description: "Typically crafted of bronze, brass, or copper with an upper section\
  \ of silver or mithral, a censer of dreams protects sleeping minds from the fell\
  \ influence of magical nightmares. A censer of dreams can burn any type of incense\
  \ as per a normal censer, but can also be commanded to emit lavender-scented fumes\
  \ that fill a 30-foot-radius spread for up to 8 continuous hours per day, as long\
  \ as the censer remains immobile. Strong winds disperse this effect, and moving\
  \ the censer causes the effect to end immediately, but otherwise, any creature that\
  \ sleeps in this area gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws made against dream-\
  \ or nightmare-related effects, such as the nightmare spell or the effects of the\
  \ nightmares caused by the abysium reactor in this adventure. A night hag cannot\
  \ use her dream haunting ability in an area under this effect, and at the GM's discretion,\
  \ the effect can block other strange effects that target sleeping or dreaming minds.\
  \ All creatures who sleep for the full 8 hours in this area awaken particularly\
  \ refreshed, having had pleasant dreams in which they explored idyllic landscapes\
  \ and spoke with charming and eccentric creatures. Upon awakening, these subjects\
  \ heal as if they'd taken complete bed rest for an entire day and night (recovering\
  \ twice their character level in hit points)."
