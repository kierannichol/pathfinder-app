description: "Szuriel's weapon is Lamentation of the Faithless, a black-bladed +5\
  \ speed unholy greatsword. When using the blade to attack, Szuriel regains 1d6 hit\
  \ points with each successful hit. If Szuriel presents her sword as a standard action,\
  \ all creatures within 60 feet that view it are blinded and affected by crushing\
  \ despair for 1d4+1 rounds unless they succeed at a DC 30 Will save. Creatures with\
  \ the good subtype and divine spellcasters take a –4 penalty on this save. As a\
  \ standard action, Szuriel can call the sword to her hand from any distance, including\
  \ across planar boundaries."
destruction: "The sword shatters and sublimates if it is ever placed in the empty,\
  \ walled garden at the summit of Heaven's mountain by a risen, repentant fiend."
