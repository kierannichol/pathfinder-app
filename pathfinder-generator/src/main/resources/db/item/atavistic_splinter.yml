description: "This sheet of charred bark is 2 feet long, 10 inches wide, and 1 inch\
  \ thick. The Atavistic Splinter imbues its owner with a primal authority over beasts,\
  \ providing a +4 insight bonus on wild empathy checks.\nOnce each day, the owner\
  \ can touch the Atavistic Splinter to a humanoid creature to force an animalistic\
  \ transformation. Using this ability against an unwilling target requires a melee\
  \ touch attack. A target touched by the Atavistic Splinter must succeed at a DC\
  \ 16 Fortitude save or acquire the bestial simple template (see below) for 24 hours.\
  \ After this period, the target must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or retain\
  \ the template for an additional 24 hours, except the Intelligence and Charisma\
  \ ability score penalties from the template each increase to â€“4. Each day it retains\
  \ the template, the target must attempt another Fortitude save; on each successive\
  \ day, the Fortitude save DC decreases by 2, and the Intelligence and Charisma penalties\
  \ increase by 2. These penalties can't reduce either ability score below 2. This\
  \ effect can't be dispelled, but can be removed with break enchantment, limited\
  \ wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish. If the target's Intelligence and Charisma\
  \ scores both reach 2 as a result of this effect, the template becomes permanent\
  \ and can't be removed except with miracle or wish. A target that succeeds at a\
  \ saving throw against this effect can't be affected by the Atavistic Splinter for\
  \ 1 year."
