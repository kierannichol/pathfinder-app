description: "This hemispherical dome of jet-black crystal has no discernible markings\
  \ on its curved surface, but faint runes (including the command word) are visible\
  \ on the flat side. Three times per week, whenever it is placed flat side down and\
  \ the command word is spoken, the parley ward hums and projects a black dome-shaped\
  \ field that slowly expands for 1 minute and then finally snaps into place, covering\
  \ up to a 30-foot-radius area, though the area can be reduced and shaped to encompass\
  \ the interior of a room or structure (such as a meeting hall or pavilion) in order\
  \ to make it less obvious to those on the outside. The affected area becomes a protected\
  \ zone that provides complete privacy, preventing sound, light, and divination and\
  \ scrying spells from penetrating, as per the mage's private sanctum spell. Additionally,\
  \ the protected zone discourages any creatures within from committing deliberate\
  \ hostile acts, as though they were affected by the serenity spell (with no save\
  \ allowed). Each use of the magic of the parley ward can function for up to 24 hours,\
  \ or until the user deactivates it. Once the parley ward is activated, neither the\
  \ item nor its zone can be moved; attempting to do so deactivates it, consuming\
  \ one of its 3 weekly charges."
