description: "This hide helm is a powerful variant of the more common helm of the\
  \ Mammoth Lord. Like its lesser incarnation, a greathelm of the Mammoth Lord is\
  \ set with plates of ivory carved with runes, with a pair of tusks curving down\
  \ either side of the wearer's face for cheek guards. The helm's tusks provide a\
  \ gore attack dealing 1d8 points of damage for a Medium wearer (or 1d6 points of\
  \ damage for a Small wearer) and count as magic and cold for the purpose of overcoming\
  \ damage reduction. The greathelm of the Mammoth Lord also protects the wearer from\
  \ cold environments as per endure elements.\nFurthermore, it provides a +5 competence\
  \ bonus on Handle Animal, Ride, and wild empathy checks with elephants, mammoths,\
  \ mastodons, and other elephant-like creatures. On command, the wearer can use detect\
  \ animals or plants or speak with animals, but only to detect or communicate with\
  \ elephant-like creatures. Once per day, the wearer can transform into a mammoth\
  \ (treat as an mastodon) as beast shape III."
