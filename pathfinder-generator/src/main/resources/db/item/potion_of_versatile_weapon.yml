description: "You transform the physical makeup of a weapon as you desire. This spell\
  \ functions like greater magic weapon, except that it subtly alters the physical\
  \ properties of a weapon, enabling it to bypass damage reduction of one the following\
  \ types: bludgeoning, cold iron, piercing, silver, or slashing. The affected weapon\
  \ still inflicts damage of its normal type and its hardness and hit points are unchanged.\
  \ This spell can be cast on a natural weapon or unarmed strike."
