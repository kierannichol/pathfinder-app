description: "You draw a light crossbow back by pulling a lever. Loading a light crossbow\
  \ is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A light crossbow fires\
  \ crossbow bolts.\nNormally, operating a light crossbow requires two hands. However,\
  \ you can shoot, but not load, a light crossbow with one hand at a â€“2 penalty on\
  \ attack rolls. You can shoot a light crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty\
  \ on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons. This penalty is cumulative\
  \ with the penalty for one-handed firing."
