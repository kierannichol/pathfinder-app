name: "Oil of Speak with Animals"
description: "You can ask questions of and receive answers from animals, but the spell\
  \ doesn't make them any more friendly than normal. Wary and cunning animals are\
  \ likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones make inane comments.\
  \ If an animal is friendly toward you, it may do some favor or service for you."
