description: "With a command word, the bearer of this +2 light steel shield can cause\
  \ a series of lockpicks and tiny tools to extend from the front of the shield and\
  \ begin picking a lock or disabling a detected trap. The shield attempts a Disable\
  \ Device check with a +10 total skill bonus. The shield is treated as using thieves'\
  \ tools, and can't gain any additional bonuses on the check from spells, the aid\
  \ another action, or other abilities. The shield performs the work on the wearer's\
  \ behalf, freeing her to take other actions. She must still remain in contact with\
  \ the target of the Disable Device attempt for the normal number of rounds, but\
  \ can move around the target, as long as she never breaks contact. The wearer is\
  \ still the subject of any effects that result from the success or failure of the\
  \ Disable Device check.\nWhile picking a lock or disabling a device with the shield,\
  \ the wearer loses her shield bonus to Armor Class, though the bonus does apply\
  \ against any result of the Disable Device check that targets Armor Class (such\
  \ as an attack from a trap triggered by the shield failing its check by 5 or more)."
