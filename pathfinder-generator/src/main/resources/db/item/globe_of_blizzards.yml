description: "Tiny white crystals hang suspended in a clear fluid inside this fist-sized\
  \ glass ball, which contains a miniature scene of leafless trees in a snow-covered\
  \ landscape. Shaking the globe (a move action) activates it, and causes the crystals\
  \ inside to fly wildly about the globe, taking on the appearance of a mad snowstorm\
  \ for 1d6 minutes until they settle back down. Shattering an activated globe (hardness\
  \ 1, hp 2) creates raging blizzard conditions in a 2-mile-radius circle centered\
  \ on the location where the globe was shattered. In this area, temperatures drop\
  \ to below freezing, winds blow at over 50 miles per hour, and heavy snow falls\
  \ (see pages 438â€“439 of the Core Rulebook). It takes 10 minutes for the blizzard\
  \ to form, and the conditions last for 1 hour before dissipating, at which point\
  \ normal weather conditions in the area return. Once shattered, a globe of blizzards\
  \ is destroyed."
