description: "Drinking a vial of this bland, bluish liquid grants you a +5 alchemical\
  \ bonus on Fortitude saves to avoid nausea or sickness for 1 hour. If you are already\
  \ nauseated, you can drink stillgut as a move action. Drinking it in this fashion\
  \ grants you a second saving throw (without the +5 bonus). Goblins often use stillgut\
  \ so they can choke down meat or other foods in advanced stages of rot or decay."
