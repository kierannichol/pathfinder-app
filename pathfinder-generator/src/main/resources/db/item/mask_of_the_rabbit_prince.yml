description: "This colorful mask evokes the image of the Rabbit Prince from the Harrowed\
  \ Realm. It covers the top half of the wearer's face and depicts the countenance\
  \ of a resolute rabbit complete with large, floppy felt ears. Despite its apparently\
  \ fragile construction, the mask is as tough as iron (hardness 10). The mask of\
  \ the rabbit prince imparts reckless bravado, granting the wearer a +2 morale bonus\
  \ on initiative checks and on saving throws against fear effects. In addition, the\
  \ wearer always counts as having a running start when attempting Acrobatics checks\
  \ to jump."
