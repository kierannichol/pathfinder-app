description: "Made specifically for those who frequently navigate the mazelike tunnels\
  \ that wind throughout Nar-Voth, these compasses are made from stone sourced from\
  \ the Darklands. However, instead of featuring the four cardinal directions, the\
  \ compass's circumference is adorned with several small pictographs. To use a cavern\
  \ compass, the bearer must be at an intersection of tunnels or caverns somewhere\
  \ underground, and must hold it in his hand and speak the name of his desired destination.\
  \ The destination must be well known enough to be likely to appear on a map of the\
  \ area, such as a settlement or a prominent ruin, or else must be a location with\
  \ which the holder is intimately familiar. For the next mile, the needle of the\
  \ cavern compass points down whichever passageway most efficiently leads to the\
  \ chosen destination.\nAdditionally, if the passage contains any of the following\
  \ hazards over the course of 1 mile, a corresponding pictograph glows with a faint\
  \ light: magma, molds or slimes, radiation, sudden vertical passages, or water hazards.\
  \ If a passage further splits into multiple pathways within 1 mile, the cavern compass\
  \ selects whichever one results in being closest to the destination after 1 mile\
  \ and provides information about hazards only down that route."
