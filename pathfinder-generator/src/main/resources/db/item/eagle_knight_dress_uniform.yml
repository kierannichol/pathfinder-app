description: "This set of fine +2 parade armor matches the dress uniform of Andoran's\
  \ Eagle Knights. If the wearer is ever grappled or restrained, she can attempt an\
  \ Escape Artist check to get free as an immediate action. The wearer gains a +2\
  \ competence bonus on this check. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer\
  \ of an Eagle Knight dress uniform can call forth shimmering plates of golden light\
  \ to reinforce the armor. This effect increases the armor's enhancement bonus to\
  \ AC from +2 to +5 for the next 10 minutes."
