description: "This simple harness, basically just a leather lash, straps a combatant's\
  \ arm to the tusk or horn of a Huge or larger animal such as a gorthek. Engaging\
  \ or disengaging a horn harness is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.\
  \ A horn harness includes a quiver that typically holds up to 12 javelins. A creature\
  \ in a horn harness gains all the bonuses and takes all the penalties for engaging\
  \ in combat or casting spells while mounted (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 202),\
  \ but also can't do anything that requires using the hand lashed to the mount. If\
  \ the mount falls in battle, the creature in the horn harness remains attached,\
  \ but can attempt a DC 25 Ride check to make a soft fall. If the creature in the\
  \ horn harness falls unconscious, it remains strapped in, but takes an amount of\
  \ damage equal to the mount's trample damage (if any) each round the monster moves."
