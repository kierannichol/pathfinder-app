description: "This vial contains what appears to be ordinary ink. However, when a\
  \ command word is uttered and then an individual uses the ink to write something,\
  \ the ink \"stores\" that person's handwriting style, and can then be used to duplicate\
  \ it, allowing the creation of a nearly perfect forgery. For example, if a noble\
  \ was provided the ink for the purpose of signing a writ of arrest, the next person\
  \ to use the ink could activate its power and scribe a pardon in the exact handwriting\
  \ of the noble. Such a falsified document perfectly matches the stored handwriting,\
  \ thus granting a +20 bonus on Linguistics checks to create a forgery (which doesn't\
  \ stack with any bonus from possessing an original copy of the handwriting in question).\
  \ At the GM's discretion, if the person attempting to detect the forgery doesn't\
  \ have the appropriate knowledge to look for other clues, such as the type of paper\
  \ used, the seal, the method of delivery, or the phrasing, the check to detect the\
  \ forgery automatically fails. The individual being mimicked must inscribe something\
  \ legible. Doodling, drawing, or random scratching doesn't convey the handwriting\
  \ style, though simple lists, signatures, or mathematical computations do. The ink\
  \ can't produce magical writing (spellbook pages or scrolls) unless the forger has\
  \ the ability to create such writing and is attempting to do so, in which case the\
  \ magical inscription appears in the mimicked person's handwriting and must be deciphered\
  \ by read magic as normal. The vial contains enough ink of mimicry to create 10\
  \ pages of forged text. Text written using the ink in the process of storing the\
  \ writer's handwriting style doesn't count toward the limit."
