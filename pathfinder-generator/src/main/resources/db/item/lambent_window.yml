description: "This small pane of glass in a frame made of black metal looks like a\
  \ small hand mirror at first glance, but when a creature spends at least 1 minute\
  \ staring into its reflection, the image shifts and changes, showing the landscape\
  \ of another plane. If the lambent window is activated on the Material Plane, it\
  \ shows the corresponding location on the Shadow Plane, along with any creatures\
  \ at that location. Likewise, when used on the Shadow Plane, it shows the corresponding\
  \ location on the Material Plane. This item only allows those staring into it to\
  \ see the corresponding location on the other plane; they cannot hear through or\
  \ gain other sensual information about the other side by way of the window. This\
  \ effect can be used for up to 10 minutes per day. Those minutes need not be consecutive,\
  \ and the 1 minute it takes to activate the lambent window does not count against\
  \ this limit.\nA person holding an active lambent window can use it as a special\
  \ focus when casting plane shift or using plane shift as a spell-like ability to\
  \ reach the specific location shown in the mirror, rather than 5â€“500 miles from\
  \ the bearer's intended destination."
