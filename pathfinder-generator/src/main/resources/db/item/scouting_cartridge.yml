description: "This +1 paper alchemical cartridge is contains a bullet and is marked\
  \ with an open eye. When fired from a firearm, a scouting cartridge allows the wielder\
  \ to temporarily transfer his sense of sight to the location where the bullet lands.\
  \ Until he dismisses the effect by rubbing his eyes as a move action, the wielder\
  \ can see as clairvoyance from the square in which the bullet landed, regardless\
  \ of whether it hit its mark."
