description: "This hollow holy symbol includes a reservoir meant to contain a dose\
  \ of holy water. When the reservoir is filled on the home plane of its corresponding\
  \ deity with a dose of holy water as a full-round action, the symbol becomes charged\
  \ with additional power. Each time a filled anointed holy symbol is used to channel\
  \ energy, the user can use the standard form of channel energy or use variant channeling\
  \ based on one aspect of her deity's portfolio, selected each time the anointed\
  \ holy symbol is used. The user cannot apply more than one variant channeling ability\
  \ to her channeled energy at one time. An anointed holy symbol remains charged for\
  \ 3 days, after which time the holy water within is consumed and the reservoir is\
  \ empty again.\nAnointed unholy symbols also exist for evil deities; they must be\
  \ filled with unholy water to function but otherwise operate just as an anointed\
  \ holy symbol."
