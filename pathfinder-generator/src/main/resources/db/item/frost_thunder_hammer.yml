description: "This oversized +2 warhammer is forged from blue steel and engraved with\
  \ Abyssal runes that read, \"There are no screams for those who die the frozen death.\"\
  \ A frost-thunder hammer is sized for giants; it is a two-handed weapon for Medium-sized\
  \ creatures, who take a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls for wielding an oversized weapon.\n\
  Once per day as a ranged touch attack, the wielder of a frost-thunder hammer can\
  \ slam the weapon against the ground to release a crackling bolt of ice that shoots\
  \ across the ground toward a single target up to 100 feet away. On a successful\
  \ hit, the ice immediately freezes around the target, trapping it within a 9-inch-thick\
  \ solid block of pale blue ice. The ice blocks line of effect to the entrapped victim,\
  \ who is helpless (but can still breathe) and takes 9 points of cold damage per\
  \ round until freed. The ice has hardness 0 and 27 hit points; if the ice is broken,\
  \ the creature is freed. A creature can break the ice as a full-round action with\
  \ a successful DC 24 Strength check."
