description: "You contact a particular creature with which you are familiar and send\
  \ a short message of 25 words or less to the subject. The subject recognizes you\
  \ if it knows you. It can answer in like manner immediately. A creature with an\
  \ Intelligence score as low as 1 can understand the sending, though the subject's\
  \ ability to react is limited as normal by its Intelligence. Even if the sending\
  \ is received, the subject is not obligated to act upon it in any manner."
