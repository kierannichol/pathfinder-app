description: "The oaken plates of this +1 wild wooden armor are rough with untreated\
  \ bark. The wearer can activate the armor with a command word, causing her flesh\
  \ to become treelike in appearance and resilience. This grants the wearer a +4 enhancement\
  \ bonus to her existing natural armor bonus and removes her need to breathe, but\
  \ reduces her speed by half and imposes a â€“2 penalty on Reflex saves. This effect\
  \ remains until dismissed as a free action. The wearer can use this ability for\
  \ up to 10 rounds per day, though the rounds need not be consecutive."
