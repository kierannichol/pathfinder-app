description: "These black leather gloves are lined with soft black velveteen and have\
  \ silver buckles that run from the wrist to the elbow. Three times per day, the\
  \ gloves allow the wearer to treat a ranged magus spell as a spell with a range\
  \ of \"touch,\" allowing him to deliver the spell with his spellstrike ability.\
  \ The glove can only affect spells that normally affect one or more creatures at\
  \ a range greater than \"touch\" (such as slow), not rays or other created effects.\
  \ The altered spell only affects the creature attacked (any other targets normally\
  \ allowed by the spell are lost)."
