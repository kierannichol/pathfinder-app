description: "The holy water in this +1 battle aspergillum never runs dry. However,\
  \ the water vanishes 1 round after leaving the aspergillum, so it cannot be collected.\
  \ As a full-round action, the wielder can swing the weapon to dispense a vial's\
  \ worth of holy water as a ranged touch attack with a maximum range of 10 feet and\
  \ no range penalty. An everflowing aspergillum counts as a good-aligned weapon for\
  \ purposes of overcoming damage reduction."
