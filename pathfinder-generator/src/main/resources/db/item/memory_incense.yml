description: "This purple incense is a powerful aid to amnesiacs and those prone to\
  \ nocturnal fits. A creature that sleeps for at least 1 hour within 10 feet of burning\
  \ memory incense retains any memories accrued within the next 24 hours, even those\
  \ that would normally be lost to effects such as lycanthropic transformation. In\
  \ addition, the creature gains a +4 alchemical bonus on saving throws against effects\
  \ that modify or erase memories for this duration. A single stick of memory incense\
  \ can burn for 4 hours. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy)\
  \ check."
