description: "This simple bronze amulet depicts a mountaintop being shattered by a\
  \ sword blow. Twice per day, the amulet's wearer can make a single melee attack\
  \ against the ground as a standard action. The wearer can choose a point of origin\
  \ within 100 feet of himself and apply his attack roll against all creatures within\
  \ a 20-foot radius of that point. The amulet's wearer rolls his attack's damage\
  \ once and applies it to all creatures in the affected area. The damage includes\
  \ the weapon's base damage dice, the wearer's Strength modifier, and damage from\
  \ feats such as Power Attack and Vital Strike; it doesn't include damage from other\
  \ magical sources, such as enhancement bonuses, spells, and magic weapon special\
  \ abilities."
