description: "Originating as a farming tool used for reaping grain, this one-handed\
  \ weapon has a blade with a strong curve that can easily catch an opponent's limb\
  \ or armor. Its blade can be either smooth or serrated, and some fighting sickles\
  \ are sharpened on both sides near the point, making it easier to hook into an opponent's\
  \ flesh."
