description: "This Stone Age weapon is a thin piece of wood or antler used as a lever\
  \ to hurl a specially fitted dart. An atlatl gives much greater range to a dart,\
  \ but must be loaded like a projectile weapon. Your Strength modifier applies to\
  \ damage rolls when you use an atlatl, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can\
  \ fire—but not load—an atlatl with one hand. Loading an atlatl is a move action\
  \ that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity. The Rapid Reload\
  \ feat can be taken for atlatls, allowing you to load a dart as a free action."
