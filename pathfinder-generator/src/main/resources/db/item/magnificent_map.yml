description: "When inactive, this item looks like a simple roll of tanned leather\
  \ sized to fit in a map case. A close inspection reveals six faint runes in one\
  \ corner, and anyone who knows the correct sequence can tap the runes in order to\
  \ activate the item's magic. Doing so causes a three-dimensional, monochromatic,\
  \ translucent illusion to spring up—a map in exacting detail of a particular location.\
  \ If the magnificent map is within the area of the map and active, its location\
  \ appears on the map as a faintly pulsing green light. The map grants a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus on Survival checks to navigate the area represented.\nAn owner who wants\
  \ to map a new area can activate the magnificent map with a different sequence of\
  \ rune taps to erase any maps stored within and begin automatically mapping the\
  \ area around it. The map records rooms, corridors, natural features, and large\
  \ furnishings, but not living creatures or small details such as a bas-relief mural\
  \ on a wall or the type of lock on a door. This mapping function operates continually,\
  \ even when the map is rolled up, recording in a 30-foot radius around itself. This\
  \ lasts until the map is deactivated or moves more than 500 feet from where it was\
  \ first activated. Consequently, the largest area a magnificent map can portray\
  \ is a sphere with a 1,000-foot diameter. Activating the magnificent map again for\
  \ the purpose of mapping erases the previous map entirely, but the map automatically\
  \ updates if a feature it has already mapped changes. For instance, if a door is\
  \ knocked down while the magnificent map is present, the magnificent map updates\
  \ its records to show what's in the room beyond. The map must be present (and within\
  \ 30 feet) to update in this way.\nWhile mapping, the map can penetrate through\
  \ creatures and thin barriers, but is blocked by 1 inch of stone, a thin sheet of\
  \ any metal, or 3 inches of dirt or wood. It is not precise enough to show secret\
  \ doors, hidden traps, or other concealed features. The map ignores temporary magical\
  \ effects, but records permanent ones, including illusory obstacles. It can't differentiate\
  \ between illusions and real objects.\nA found magnificent map usually includes\
  \ a map of a region left by its previous owner."
