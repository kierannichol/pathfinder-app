description: "This bloodstained spiked chain has a large handle-ring that glows a\
  \ pale violet color when wielded in normal light. An umbral chain grows more potent\
  \ in darkness. It acts as a +1 spiked chain when in dim light. In darkness, it acts\
  \ as a +2 spiked chain. When surrounded by supernatural darkness (such as in an\
  \ area of deeper darkness), it acts as a +2 spiked chain and grants the wielder\
  \ the Blind-Fight feat. In daylight or bright illumination, the weapon temporarily\
  \ loses all its magical enhancement bonuses and is effectively a masterwork weapon,\
  \ though it resumes its magical functions once it's no longer in bright light. The\
  \ violet glow from the weapon dims in response to ambient light, vanishing completely\
  \ in darkness or supernatural darkness."
