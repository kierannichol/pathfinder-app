description: "This ancient gold coin measures an inch in diameter and a quarter of\
  \ an inch thick. One face bears one of the seven Thassilonian runes for magic and\
  \ sin, while the opposite side bears the image of a broken column. When carried,\
  \ a whispering coin periodically haunts its carrier with soft whispers that seem\
  \ to be in Thassilonian, but which are never loud enough to understand. These whispers\
  \ are only slightly distracting, and in fact offer a boon to the carrier of the\
  \ coin— they grant a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells of the\
  \ school of magic associated with the coin's rune (the coin found in this adventure\
  \ bears the rune of lust, and thus grants a +1 resistance bonus against enchantment\
  \ spells).\nOnce per day, when the bearer flips the whispering coin and asks a question\
  \ in Thassilonian while the coin is in the air, the coin provides an answer to the\
  \ question as it lands, either \"yes\" (the Thassilonian rune) or \"no\" (the broken\
  \ column); the word \"yes\" or \"no\" is also whispered into the user's ear as the\
  \ answer is determined. A whispering coin's knowledge is limited to events that\
  \ have a significant chance to affect the coin's carrier in the immediate future\
  \ (no further out than a few minutes), and is further limited to facts, not conjecture.\
  \ You could ask a whispering coin whether a door you were about to open is trapped,\
  \ but not \"Is the king the mastermind of the conspiracy we just learned about?\"\
  \ The GM, in other words, can determine whether or not a whispering coin can answer\
  \ or not—if the coin can't answer, it spins on its edge upon landing for several\
  \ seconds before flopping over to a random side and does not whisper a \"yes\" or\
  \ \"no\" into the user's ear. The coin's one use for the day is still consumed."
