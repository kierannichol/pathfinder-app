description: "This two-ended tool can be used as +1/+1 monk's spade. Five times per\
  \ day as a standard action, the wielder can sweep an adjacent 10-foot square. This\
  \ action clears the affected area of objects and terrain that hinder movement, such\
  \ as caltrops, rubble, and undergrowth. The trailblazer's spade has no effect on\
  \ features more than 4 feet high or deep. It has no effect on terrain that has been\
  \ magically manipulated to impede movement."
