description: "This ancient silver ring provides a measure of control over elemental\
  \ creatures. The spirit of an ancient Jistkan elementalist still echoes within the\
  \ ring, issuing a sense of smug arrogance. The Ring of the Weary Sky's special purpose\
  \ is controlling or defeating elementals, and once per day the wearer can attempt\
  \ to charm a creature with the elemental subtype (as charm monster, Will DC 15 negates).\n\
  Once per day, the ring can affect its wearer with resist energy. The ring uses this\
  \ ability only when the wearer faces a hostile creature with the elemental subtype,\
  \ making an educated guess about the most applicable energy type against which to\
  \ ward its wearer. The ring is quick to provide this protection when the wearer\
  \ tries but fails to charm an elemental creature, exuding a clear impression of\
  \ patronizing disappointment."
