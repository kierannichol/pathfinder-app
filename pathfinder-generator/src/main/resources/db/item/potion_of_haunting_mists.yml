name: "Potion of Haunting Mists"
description: "An illusion of misty vapor inhabited by shadowy shapes arises around\
  \ you. It is stationary. The illusory mist obscures all sight, including darkvision,\
  \ beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss\
  \ chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the\
  \ attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). All creatures within the mist\
  \ must save or take 1d2 points of Wisdom damage and gain the shaken condition. The\
  \ shaken condition lasts as long as the creature remains in the mist."
