description: "This bifurcated mithral rod resembles an oversized tuning fork. The\
  \ forked rod acts as a focus for plane shift, but the plane to which it is attuned\
  \ to can be adjusted as a standard actionâ€”a forked rod can be attuned to any plane\
  \ that a common tuning fork (see plane shift) can be attuned to. Once per day, a\
  \ forked rod can be used to cast plane shift to the plane it is currently attuned\
  \ to. Three times per day as a standard action, the user can attack a creature or\
  \ object with a forked rod as if it were a +1 light mace. On a hit, the forked rod\
  \ deals no damage, but affects the target with dimensional anchor for 9 minutes.\
  \ As long as a target is affected in this way, the forked rod is inert and cannot\
  \ be used to cast plane shift, as a focus for plane shift, or to affect another\
  \ target with dimensional anchor."
