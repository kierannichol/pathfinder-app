description: "These +1 mithral ghost touch undead bane dwarven waraxes were crafted\
  \ hurriedly to combat the rising undead threat, but the rush to craft these weapons\
  \ and cut corners in their creation resulted in a dangerous flaw—whenever an undead\
  \ creature is slain with a deadflesh waraxe, the axe allows a portion of the destroyed\
  \ undead's necromantic energy to flow through the axe and into the wielder's body,\
  \ causing the wielder to become shaken for 1 minute if he fails a DC 15 Will save.\
  \ These effects stack with each other—the second time the victim succumbs, he becomes\
  \ frightened. The third time, he is panicked and drops the deadflesh waraxe in his\
  \ attempt to flee. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. This flaw is relatively\
  \ subtle—in order to notice it when identifying the item, the examiner must exceed\
  \ the DC 27 Spellcraft check by 10 points or more. In the hands of a soldier ready\
  \ to deal with this imperfection, a deadflesh waraxe can be a powerful tool against\
  \ the undead, but many of the dwarven defenders of the mines weren't made aware\
  \ of the flaw until it was too late."
