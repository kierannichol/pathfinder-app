description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis elixir is generally stored in a palm-sized\
  \ crystal jar. When applied under the eyes as a standard action, it reveals the\
  \ magical nature of illusions and some creatures. For 1 hour after applying the\
  \ ointment, whenever the user first perceives an illusion, she can attempt a Will\
  \ save to disbelieve it even without interacting with it. An Ulfen user recognizes\
  \ fey animals and creatures that have changed their shape into human or animal forms\
  \ as more than they appear, though she does not learn their true nature."
