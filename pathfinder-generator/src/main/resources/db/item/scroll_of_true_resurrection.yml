name: "Scroll of True Resurrection"
description: "This spell functions like raise dead, except that you can resurrect\
  \ a creature that has been dead for as long as 10 years per caster level. This spell\
  \ can even bring back creatures whose bodies have been destroyed, provided that\
  \ you unambiguously identify the deceased in some fashion (reciting the deceased's\
  \ time and place of birth or death is the most common method)."
