description: "The empty hands are an innocuous looking pair of wellcrafted gloves\
  \ made of soft, tanned brown leather. As a standard action, the wearer can cause\
  \ any weapon or item he holds to become invisible for 3 minutes, during which it\
  \ is clear the wearer is holding something, but it's not possible to see exactly\
  \ what it is. The wearer gains a +1 circumstance bonus on attack rolls with an invisible\
  \ weapon, a +5 circumstance bonus on opposed Bluff checks made to feint in combat\
  \ or claim to be unarmed, and a +10 circumstance bonus on opposed Sleight of Hand\
  \ checks made to conceal a weapon or item. This invisibility can be dismissed as\
  \ a free action. The 3 minutes a held item is invisible need not be consecutive,\
  \ but must be expended in 1-minute increments. Empty hands grant no bonuses against\
  \ foes able to see invisible objects, as per spells like see invisibility or true\
  \ seeing. Empty hands can only affect one item at a time, even if one item is held\
  \ in each hand."
