description: "Bolas bolts are bolas-like projectiles used as ammunition for slaver's\
  \ crossbows. If you hit a target with a bolas bolt fired from a slaver's crossbow,\
  \ attempt a trip combat maneuver against your target (don't add your Strength bonus\
  \ when attempting the combat maneuver check). You can't be tripped during your own\
  \ trip attempt when using a bolas bolt.\nOn a critical hit, instead of dealing extra\
  \ damage, the bolas bolt ensnares its target. Your target is entangled until it\
  \ or an ally succeeds at a DC 15 Strength check to break the bolas cords. A light\
  \ slaver's crossbow can entangle a target up to the same size as its intended wielder,\
  \ and a heavy slaver's crossbow can entangle a creature up to one size larger. A\
  \ masterwork bolas bolt or one with an enhancement bonus of at least +1 increases\
  \ the DC of the Strength check to break the bolas to 20.\nIf the attack trips and\
  \ entangles a target, the creature cannot move from its square until it breaks free\
  \ of the bolas cords."
