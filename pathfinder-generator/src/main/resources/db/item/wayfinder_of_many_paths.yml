description: "The Wayfinder of Many Paths behaves like a normal wayfinder (Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 299), allowing it to shine (as the\
  \ light spell) on command and granting its user a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival\
  \ checks to avoid getting lost. It has a small indentation designed to hold a single\
  \ ioun stone, and when an ioun stone is placed within, the owner of the wayfinder\
  \ gains the stone's normal benefits as if it were orbiting his head.\nOnce per day\
  \ on command, a Wayfinder of Many Paths with an implanted ioun stone can be used\
  \ to create a 5-to-20-foot-diameter gateway, similar to the spell gate. The exact\
  \ destination depends on the type of ioun stone slotted into the wayfinder; ioun\
  \ stones of the same type always lead to the same location. The gateway remains\
  \ open for up to 18 rounds, but the user can drain the socketed ioun stone, rendering\
  \ it dull gray and powerless, to keep the gateway open for up to 18 additional rounds.\
  \ If fitted with an ioun stone while in that stone's attuned location, a Wayfinder\
  \ of Many Paths can open a gateway back to the location in which it was last used,\
  \ allowing its user to make a return trip after 24 hours."
