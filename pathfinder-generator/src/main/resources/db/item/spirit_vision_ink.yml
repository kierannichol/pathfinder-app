description: "Originally developed by kami-revering priests to write prayer scrolls,\
  \ this pale ink is now often used by ninjas to mark locations or leave messages.\
  \ Once spirit-vision ink dries, it becomes completely invisible. To invisible creatures,\
  \ however, writing in spirit-vision ink shimmers with a rich azure hue."
