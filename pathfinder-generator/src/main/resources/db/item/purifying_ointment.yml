description: "Usually stored in a jar shaped like a scarab beetle, this unguent is\
  \ pale green and smells like thistle with a hint of the scent of embalming fluids.\
  \ A jar contains five applications, each of which can be applied as a full-round\
  \ action.\nWhen applied to an afflicted area or swallowed, the ointment removes\
  \ a single curse or restores ability damage caused by an undead's special attack\
  \ (such as a shadow's touch). This ointment otherwise acts as per lesser restoration\
  \ or remove curse with a +5 bonus on the check. Unlike normal applications of remove\
  \ curse, purifying ointment can potentially remove an affliction that is both a\
  \ curse and disease (such as mummy rot), though that requires two successful caster\
  \ level checks."
