name: "Scroll of Primal Regression"
description: "This spell sequesters the targets' ability for higher reasoning, allowing\
  \ their darker impulses to come to the fore. An affected target becomes a ravening\
  \ monster--savage, bloodthirsty, and brutish. Until the spell ends, the targets\
  \ have all of the following benefits and drawbacks. Targets' Intelligence and Charisma\
  \ scores drop to 3 (if the scores were higher), and they are unable to use Intelligenceor\
  \ Charisma-based skills, cast spells, understand language, or communicate coherently.\
  \ Targets take a â€“4 penalty on Will saves. Targets gain a +6 enhancement bonus to\
  \ Strength, a +2 natural armor bonus to AC, and 2d8 temporary hit points. These\
  \ temporary hit points disappear at the end of the spell's duration. When the spell\
  \ ends, each affected creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or take 1d4 points\
  \ of Intelligence drain and 1d4 points of Charisma damage."
