  \ reagents. It can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet.\
  \ Upon breaking open, a sack of sporecrafter's kindness releases russet mold spores\
  \ in a 5-footradius burst and unleashes 1d4+1 vegepygmies in the nearest adjacent\
  \ squares. The vegepygmies are not under the control of the user, and immediately\
  \ attack the nearest creatures for 5 rounds, after which they collapse into nonmagical\
  \ plant matter."
