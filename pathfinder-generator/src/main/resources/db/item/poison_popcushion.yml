description: "This squishy, gel-filled sack is the size of a fist, and its exterior\
  \ is covered with countless tiny metal studs. When set on the ground or somewhere\
  \ else within line of sight, a poison popcushion can be targeted with a melee or\
  \ ranged attack (hardness 0, AC 7). A successful attack causes the poison popcushion\
  \ to explode, sending a spray of needles everywhere within a 10-footradius burst\
  \ and dealing 1d4+1 points of piercing damage to creatures caught in the area each\
  \ round for 1d3 rounds. A successful DC 13 Reflex save halves this damage. Additionally,\
  \ a poison popcushion can be loaded with an injury poison before it is placed. Fully\
  \ loading a poison popcushion takes 3 doses of poison (not included in the price).\
  \ In addition to dealing damage, a loaded poison popcushion affects struck creatures\
  \ with the poison stored within, though the Fortitude save DC to save against this\
  \ poison is 4 lower than the poison's usual DC."
