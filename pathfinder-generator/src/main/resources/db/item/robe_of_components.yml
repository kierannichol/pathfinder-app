description: "The pockets of this simple blue robe always seem to carry just what\
  \ the wearer needs whenever she casts a spell. The robe functions as a spell component\
  \ pouch, providing any spell components or focuses that are necessary for the wearer's\
  \ spellcasting. The robe can even produce spell components or focuses with a specific\
  \ cost, though it provides no more than 50 gp worth of such materials in any single\
  \ day. The materials supplied by the robe are suitable only for spellcasting, and\
  \ disappear if they leave the wearer's person or when the spell requiring them is\
  \ cast."
