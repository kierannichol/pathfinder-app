description: "This magical shawl is woven from silken, diaphanous material. Once per\
  \ day, the wearer can speak a command word to transfer some of her life energy into\
  \ the shawl (up to 10 hit points). If she is wearing the shawl and is reduced to\
  \ –1 hit points or below, the shawl immediately heals her an amount equal to the\
  \ number of hit points stored in the shawl. This healing cannot prevent the wearer\
  \ from being killed. The life energy stored in the shawl lasts for 24 hours or until\
  \ it heals the wearer, whichever comes first. If the shawl is destroyed, the stored\
  \ life energy is lost.\nWhile the shawl is storing a creature's life energy, it\
  \ retains a connection to that creature. If another creature holds the shawl in\
  \ its hand, the creature whose life energy is stored in the shawl takes a –2 penalty\
  \ on Fortitude and Reflex saving throws against all effects from the current bearer\
  \ of the shawl."
