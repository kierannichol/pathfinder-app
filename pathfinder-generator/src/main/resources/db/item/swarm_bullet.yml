description: "This small brass cylinder is inscribed with a symbol of a honeycomb,\
  \ and a faint buzzing sound can be heard from within. A swarm bullet can be loaded\
  \ into a weapon with the scatter weapon quality, such as a blunderbuss, as though\
  \ it were ammunition. When fired, the weapon produces a wasp swarm that immediately\
  \ moves to attack the nearest living target in a 15-foot cone. The wasp swarm acts\
  \ on the shooter's turn each round, pursuing the closest living creature for 3 rounds\
  \ or until it's destroyed. Should the weapon misfire while loaded with a swarm bullet,\
  \ the swarm instead angrily emerges from the weapon and pursues the wielder."
