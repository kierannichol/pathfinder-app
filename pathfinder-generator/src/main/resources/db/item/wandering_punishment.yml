description: "The oni of Chu Ye grant these +3 tetsubos to loyal human servants, who\
  \ use them to enforce the oni's will throughout the nation in spite of the Steel\
  \ Dictate limiting their involvement. The wielder of a wandering punishment can,\
  \ as a standard action, assume the appearance of an oni of her size as though under\
  \ the effects of alter self. This transformation does not affect her ability scores\
  \ and lasts as long as the weapon is held in one or both hands. Once per day, the\
  \ wielder can also grow in stature as per enlarge person, taking on the form of\
  \ a larger oni in the process. This growth lasts 10 minutes or until the wielder\
  \ drops the wandering punishment.\nOnce per day while enlarged, the wielder can\
  \ deliver an awesome blow. As a standard action, the wielder can attempt a free\
  \ bull rush combat maneuver check as part of a standard attack with a wandering\
  \ punishment. She can't move with her target if this combat maneuver succeeds."
