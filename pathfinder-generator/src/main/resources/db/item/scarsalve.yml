description: "This alchemical substance, originally developed by secretive worshipers\
  \ of Zon-Kuthon to hide the marks of their devotion, has become popular among former\
  \ Gray Maidens. When applied to scarred areas of the body, scarsalve causes those\
  \ scars to fade from view for 1 day. A character who gains benefits from having\
  \ visible scars loses those benefits while under the effects of scarsalve, but she\
  \ also gains a +2 alchemical bonus on Disguise checks."
