description: "The bullets fired by this +2 Maxim M1910 machine gun (see page 65) are\
  \ enhanced to pierce protective cover, allowing the wielder to ignore the AC bonus\
  \ granted to targets by anything less than total cover. A Maxim of suppressive fire\
  \ can make attacks against targets with total cover, but the wielder must still\
  \ guess the correct square of its target's location, and the target still benefits\
  \ from total concealment (50% miss chance)."
