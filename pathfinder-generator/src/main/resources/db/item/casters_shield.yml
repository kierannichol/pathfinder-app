description: "This +1 light wooden shield has a leather strip on the back on which\
  \ a spellcaster can scribe a single spell as on a scroll. A spell so scribed requires\
  \ half the normal cost in raw materials. The strip cannot accommodate spells of\
  \ higher than 3rd level. The strip is reusable.\nA random caster's shield has a\
  \ 50% chance of having a single medium scroll spell on it. The spell is divine (01–\
  80 on d%) or arcane (81–100). A caster's shield has a 5% arcane spell failure chance.\
  \ The price of the shield is modified by the value of the scroll spell if one is\
  \ currently scribed."
