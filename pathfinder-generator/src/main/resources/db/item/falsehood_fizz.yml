description: "When imbibed, this cloudy, pink liquid grants you 1d4 uses of alchemical\
  \ inspiration that can be used only on Bluff checks to lie or to deliver secret\
  \ messages. Additionally, you can spend two uses of alchemical inspiration to gain\
  \ inspiration on a saving throw against truth-detecting or truth-forcing magic (such\
  \ as discern lies or zone of truth).\nThe benefits of falsehood fizz last for 1\
  \ hour. During this time, you must roll Sense Motive checks twice and take the worse\
  \ result."
