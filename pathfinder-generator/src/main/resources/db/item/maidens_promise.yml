description: "Each pair of these lockets is made from a piece of jewelry from Castle\
  \ Korvosa's treasury that was split into two parts, each of which was fashioned\
  \ into a necklace. When worn by two individuals, the lockets' magic enhances their\
  \ devotion to each other. Many former Gray Maidens cling to these lockets, distributed\
  \ among Queen Ileosa's forces during the final days of her reign, as a symbol of\
  \ their sisterhood.\nWhen the wearers of linked maiden's promise lockets are within\
  \ 30 feet of each other, each gains a +1 morale bonus on Will saves against any\
  \ effect that would compromise her loyalty to the other. If one wearer becomes helpless,\
  \ the other gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against any creature threatening\
  \ the helpless wearer. If one wearer dies, the other must succeed at a DC 16 Will\
  \ save or suffer the effects of crushing despair for 1 minute."
