description: "This viciously barbed +1 spiked chain consists of a jagged hook at the\
  \ end of a length of rusty chain. It twitches of its own accord, as if it had some\
  \ semblance of cruel intelligence. As the wielder swings it, the chain contracts\
  \ and expands with a seemingly endless supply of new links. As a free action, the\
  \ wielder can cause the chain to expand, giving the weapon reach for 1 round. The\
  \ weapon doesn't threaten adjacent squares when it's expanded. The wielder can't\
  \ reverse this change manually; he must wait for it to expire.\nIf the wielder of\
  \ a hooked massacre uses it for a drag or reposition combat maneuver that brings\
  \ the target adjacent to him, he can make an attack against the target at his highest\
  \ base attack bonus as an immediate action."
