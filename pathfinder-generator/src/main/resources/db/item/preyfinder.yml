description: "These sturdy brass compasses are often painted blood red and etched\
  \ with images of wolves, lions, crocodiles, or sharks stalking their prey. Though\
  \ preyfinders function as standard compasses (Ultimate Equipment 62), making them\
  \ useful tools for navigation, they also have the power to magically identify and\
  \ track down creatures.\nTo use a preyfinder, its bearer must (as a standard action)\
  \ take a drop of blood from a creature, smear it onto the compass's glass faceplate,\
  \ and then touch the compass to his head. The blood must be no more than 1 week\
  \ old, and can come from a living or dead creature, though a living or undead target\
  \ can attempt a DC 18 Will save to resist the preyfinder's tracking ability. If\
  \ the Will save is successful, the preyfinder can't identify or locate the creature,\
  \ and none of the preyfinder's magical powers function for 24 hours. If the creature\
  \ fails the Will save, the preyfinder telepathically provides its bearer with an\
  \ image of the creature to which the drop of blood belonged and marks the creature\
  \ as the preyfinder's quarry.\nAfter a creature is marked as the preyfinder's quarry,\
  \ the bearer can spend a standard action to magically divine the creature's current\
  \ location. As long as the quarry is no more than 100 miles away, the preyfinder\
  \ provides a series of telepathic images to the bearer, who is then able to determine\
  \ the direction toward and exact distance to the quarry. This detection ability\
  \ can be fooled by mislead, nondetection, and polymorph spells and effects.\nA preyfinder\
  \ can have only one creature designated as its quarry at any one time. If the bearer\
  \ adds a new drop of blood, the old quarry is replaced by the new one. The bearer\
  \ can also spend a full-round action to remove a quarry designation from the preyfinder.\n\
  When used by a slayer with the studied target class feature, a preyfinder grants\
  \ the slayer a +1 insight bonus on all attack and damage rolls made against a creature\
  \ designated as the preyfinder's quarry. Additionally, instead of designating another\
  \ creature as its quarry, a slayer can add a drop of his own blood to the preyfinder\
  \ (a standard action) to gain a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls, saves, and\
  \ skill checks he attempts for 1 minute. After a slayer adds a drop of his own blood\
  \ to the preyfinder, none of the preyfinder's magical powers functions for 24 hours."
