description: "This jet-black uniform is assigned to top agents in Druma's militaryâ€”\
  the Mercenary League. Wearers of this +3 armored coat continually benefit from the\
  \ spell undetectable alignment. When following the orders of a member of the Kalistocracy,\
  \ the wearer receives a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls, saves, and skill checks\
  \ related to completion of her mission.\nAnytime the wearer tries to disregard an\
  \ order given by a member of the Kalistocracy, she must attempt a Will save with\
  \ a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the total Hit Dice of the creature giving the order. If\
  \ she fails, she must follow the order to the best of her ability. If she succeeds,\
  \ she can remove the armor as a move action to ignore the command."
