description: "This distinctive +4 adamantine glamered o-yoroi (Ultimate Combat 128)\
  \ was designed for scions of Minkai's imperial families and their highest-ranking\
  \ and most loyal samurai, providing its wearer with DR 3/â€”. In addition, the armor\
  \ stores the kinetic energy from blows made against it. Once the armor has negated\
  \ 15 total points of damage, the wearer can release the stored energy as a swift\
  \ action against a single creature within 10 feet. This energy takes the form of\
  \ a force effect, and the wearer must make an attack roll at his base attack bonus\
  \ +10. The energy deals 15 points of force damage to the target, and the target\
  \ must make a DC 22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. If the wearer chooses\
  \ not to release this energy, the armor still provides damage reduction but absorbs\
  \ no more energy until the stored energy is released."
