description: "This cloak is woven from a fabric of solid darkness held together by\
  \ magic alone. When the wearer takes the total defense action, the mantle quickly\
  \ dissolves into a globe of darkness (as per deeper darkness) that is centered on\
  \ the wearer. The darkness coalesces into a mantle on the wearer's shoulders again\
  \ at the beginning of her next turn unless she immediately uses another total defense\
  \ action to maintain it. This effect functions up to 10 rounds per day.\nIf any\
  \ of the item's daily uses are left, the wearer can grab the mantle and toss it\
  \ into a space within 30 feet as a standard action. The mantle dissolves into a\
  \ deeper darkness effect centered where the mantle landed and lasting for a number\
  \ of rounds equal to the remaining daily uses. When the duration ends, the mantle\
  \ materializes in the square into which the wearer threw it."
