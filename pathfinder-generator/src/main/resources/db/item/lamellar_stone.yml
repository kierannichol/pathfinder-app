  \ materials are strung together in parallel rows using fine cord. Lamellar plates\
  \ can be constructed from lacquered leather, horn, or even stone, though suits of\
  \ iron and steel are the most common. Lamellar armor can be crafted into various\
  \ shapes, including partial pieces such as breastplates, greaves, or even entire\
  \ coats. The properties of specific suits and pieces of lamellar armor are determined\
  \ by their material."
