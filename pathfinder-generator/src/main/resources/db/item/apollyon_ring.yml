description: "Upon donning the Apollyon Ring, the wearer experiences an increased\
  \ state of being, her consciousness becoming an infectious disease known as the\
  \ Mark of the Prophet. The wearer is the host of this disease, but is immune to\
  \ its effects. Any creature that comes into physical contact with the wearer (or\
  \ with one afflicted by the disease) must make a successful Fortitude save or be\
  \ infected. The disease causes 1d4 points of ability damage, with the affected ability\
  \ being the wearer's highest ability score (or her choice in the case of equally\
  \ high scores). The disease's other effects are detailed below. The saving throw\
  \ to resist the disease is equal to 10 + the wearer's Hit Dice + her Charisma modifier.\
  \ This disease can be cured as normal. Creatures immune to disease are immune to\
  \ any disease created by the Apollyon Ring, but also gain none of the abilities\
  \ granted by wearing the ring.\nAny creature infected by the disease becomes a potential\
  \ host for the ring wearer's senses. The wearer always knows how many creatures\
  \ are infected and can detect any one of them as a standard action as per the status\
  \ spell. Additionally, by spending a minute concentrating, the wearer can see and\
  \ hear using any infected individual's senses, as per the clairaudience/clairvoyance\
  \ spell. The wearer remains dimly aware of her surroundings while making use of\
  \ this effect, and may end it as an immediate action. She may use this ability any\
  \ number of times per day. Once per day, she may also either cure any number of\
  \ individuals infected with the disease within 300 feet, or force them to make an\
  \ additional save against its effects at a –5 penalty.\nRemoving the Apollyon Ring\
  \ or killing the wearer instantly cures all creatures afflicted by the Mark of the\
  \ Prophet."
destruction: "The Apollyon Ring shatters if Apollyon, Horseman of Pestilence, is slain.\
  \ Alternatively, the ring is destroyed if a creature immune to disease wears it\
  \ and casts remove disease on at least one victim of every different disease known\
  \ to the world."
