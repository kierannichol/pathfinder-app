description: "An inactive apparatus of the octopus appears to be a large, sealed iron\
  \ barrel big enough to hold two Medium creatures. Closer examination (and a successful\
  \ DC 20 Perception check) reveals a secret catch that opens a hatch at one end.\
  \ Anyone who crawls inside finds 10 unlabeled levers and seating for two Medium\
  \ or Small occupants. These levers allow those inside to activate and control the\
  \ apparatus's movements and actions.\n"
