description: "A whetstone allows you to sharpen a blade by sliding it against the\
  \ stone at a precise angle. Honing a blade with a whetstone requires about 15 minutes\
  \ of work and grants the weapon a +1 bonus on your damage roll the first time you\
  \ hit with it. This only works on nonmagical blades."
