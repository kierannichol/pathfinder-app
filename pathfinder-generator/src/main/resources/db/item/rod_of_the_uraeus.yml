description: "This rod is fashioned in the form of a uraeus (Pathfinder Campaign Setting:\
  \ Osirion, Legacy of Pharaohs 63), the legendary two-headed winged cobra that is\
  \ the symbol of the Ancient Osirian deity Wadjet, patron of Osirion and the goddess\
  \ of good serpents, the River Sphinx, and wisdom. The priesthood of Wadjet is credited\
  \ with creating the first rods of the uraeus, but others have since replicated the\
  \ feat.\nA rod of the uraeus can be wielded as a +1 light mace. When holding the\
  \ rod, the wielder gains a +2 resistance bonus on Reflex saves and a +5 competence\
  \ bonus on Sense Motive checks. The wielder can fire a 30-foot line of stinging\
  \ poison from the rod up to twice per day (once for each head of the uraeus). A\
  \ creature in the area of effect can avoid the poison with a successful DC 13 Reflex\
  \ save. On a failed save, a creature is blinded and paralyzed for 8 rounds. Each\
  \ round on its turn, an affected creature may attempt a DC 13 Fortitude save to\
  \ end the blindness and paralysis effects. A rod of the uraeus functions only if\
  \ its possessor is lawful."
