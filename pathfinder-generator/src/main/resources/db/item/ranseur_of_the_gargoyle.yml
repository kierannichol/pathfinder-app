description: "A ranseur of the gargoyle appears to have a head crafted of obsidian,\
  \ but is in fact as hard and resilient as steel. This weapon functions as a +1 ranseur\
  \ that grants a +4 bonus on disarm checks rather than the typical +2 bonus a ranseur\
  \ grants. Up to 5 times per day as a swift action, the wielder of a ranseur of the\
  \ gargoyle can cause its skin to harden for 1 round, gaining a +2 enhancement bonus\
  \ to its natural armor score."
