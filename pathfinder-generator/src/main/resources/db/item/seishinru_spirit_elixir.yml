description: "This potent elixir has the consistency and color of pomegranate juice,\
  \ and a tart taste with a faint aroma of fresh fruit. Usually found in bamboo containers\
  \ decorated with images of carp, the sacred animal of the goddess Shizuru, the elixir\
  \ within contains the distilled spiritual essence of the most honorable guardians\
  \ who died in service to Minkai's emperors. Each time the character drinking the\
  \ elixir makes an attack roll, ability check, or skill check, it rolls two d20s\
  \ and takes the better result, as these spiritual guardians offer their advice and\
  \ encouragement. This effect lasts for 10 rounds, but it immediately ends if any\
  \ roll is a natural 20. If the character drinking the elixir is a scion of one of\
  \ Minkai's five imperial families (including anyone invested as such by an Imperial\
  \ Seal) and is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points during the duration of the elixir's\
  \ effects, the elixir also immediately cures the drinker of 5d8+10 points of damage,\
  \ which can bring a recently slain character back to life. This healing immediately\
  \ ends any of the elixir's other effects."
