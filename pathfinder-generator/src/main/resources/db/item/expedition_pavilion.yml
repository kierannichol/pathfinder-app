description: "This ordinary-looking, windowless tent appears to cover only a 10-foot-by-10-foot\
  \ area, but, inside, it measures a full 30 feet by 30 feet, with a large central\
  \ area and three small \"bedrooms\" (separated by curtains) along the back wall.\
  \ The interior can be lit on command, and can be adjusted from normal darkness as\
  \ per the spell light. Occupants inside the tent cannot be seen, heard, or smelled\
  \ by creatures outside.\nThe temperature inside the expedition pavilion is 70° F\
  \ if the exterior temperature is between 0° and 100° F. For every degree the exterior\
  \ temperature is below 0° or above 100°, the interior temperature decreases or increases,\
  \ respectively, by 1°. The pavilion also provides protection against the elements,\
  \ such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The pavilion withstands any wind of less than\
  \ hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind speed) or greater force destroys\
  \ it.\nThe pavilion can only be set up once per day, requiring 10 minutes to erect\
  \ or dismantle. The tent cannot be dismantled while foreign objects are still inside,\
  \ though if the pavilion is destroyed, any creatures and objects inside immediately\
  \ spill out."
