description: "Molded and crafted from a single large chunk of raw iron ore, this +1\
  \ thundering earth breaker is as cool as loose soil to the touch. Three times per\
  \ day as a standard action, the wielder may slam an earthcracker against the ground,\
  \ causing earth and stone to rise and fall in a violent wave that travels in a 30-foot\
  \ line from the wielder's location. All of the affected squares become difficult\
  \ terrain. The wielder can perform a free trip combat maneuver on a single creature\
  \ within the affected squares; this attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity\
  \ and the wielder is not knocked prone if the attempt fails. If the trip combat\
  \ maneuver check is a natural 20, the blow is so mighty that it also deals 2d8 points\
  \ of sonic damage to the target."
