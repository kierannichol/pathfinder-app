description: "The dwarves of Highhelm fill these 20-foot-diameter cloth balloons with\
  \ a secret and highly flammable gas (included in the price) and then release them\
  \ into the sky over their enemies. To transform the balloons into decoys, dwarven\
  \ siege warriors place dummies in cargo baskets beneath the balloons to look like\
  \ balloonist scouts or snipers. Whoever releases the balloon can attempt a DC 15\
  \ Profession (driver), Knowledge (nature), or Wisdom check; if the check is successful,\
  \ the balloon can be guided out to a maximum range of 300 feet, a far enough distance\
  \ for archers to safely shoot the balloon with flaming arrows, causing it to explode\
  \ in a devastating ball of fire. A detonated sky mine creates a 50-foot-radius burst\
  \ of flame that deals 10d6 points of fire damage to anything in the area."
