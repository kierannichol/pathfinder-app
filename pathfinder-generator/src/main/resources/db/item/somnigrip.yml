description: "This tacky paste is peppered with flakes of glass created using materials\
  \ from the Elemental Planes, and this glass effectively limits underground movement.\
  \ When you throw somnigrip at a creature (this requires a ranged touch attack with\
  \ a range increment of 10 feet) and strike your target, the creature must succeed\
  \ at a DC 20 Strength check each round. If the creature succeeds, it can burrow\
  \ or use earth glide (if it has that ability) at half its burrow speed that round.\
  \ If it fails, the creature cannot burrow or use earth glide at all that round,\
  \ although it can still move using its other speeds as normal. Somnigrip dissolves\
  \ and stops affecting a creature's movement after 1 minute. Crafting this item requires\
  \ a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check."
