description: "This conical iron jingasa, or war hat, grants the wearer a +1 deflection\
  \ bonus to AC. When struck by a critical hit or sneak attack, the wearer can spend\
  \ an immediate action to negate the critical hit or sneak attack (similar to the\
  \ fortification armor special ability, but without requiring a roll). The damage\
  \ is instead rolled normally. This ability functions only once, though the jingasa\
  \ continues to grant its deflection bonus even after the other ability is expended."
