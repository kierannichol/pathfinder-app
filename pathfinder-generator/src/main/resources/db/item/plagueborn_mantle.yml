description: "Made from the preserved skins of plague victims, this cloak functions\
  \ as a +1 cloak of resistance. If the wearer is infected with a disease, he can\
  \ also command the mantle to cast virulent miasma once per day. Additionally, as\
  \ a standard action, a diseased wearer can make a touch attack. If it hits, the\
  \ target must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract one disease the wearer\
  \ currently has (wearer's choice in the case of multiple diseases)."
