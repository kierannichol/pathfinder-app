description: "This ornate, oversized silver goblet is wrought with runes and letters\
  \ in a profusion of languages. When written words are placed in the goblet—whether\
  \ written on a piece of parchment, carved into stone, or other such means of delivering\
  \ physical text—the text detaches itself from the source, liquefying into a sweet\
  \ wine over the next 10 minutes. The liquid can then be drunk, granting the imbiber\
  \ benefits based on the nature of the text."
