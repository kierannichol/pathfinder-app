description: "This silver, oval-shaped platter can hold up to 1 cubic foot worth of\
  \ food. Once per day, the platter's user can activate the item to transform its\
  \ contents into another type or quality of food of the user's choosing. The transformed\
  \ food looks and smells just like actual food of its new type, but retains its original\
  \ texture, taste, nourishment, and level of fulfillment. Spoiled or poisoned food\
  \ remains so and is detectable as such under magical or supernatural scrutiny."
