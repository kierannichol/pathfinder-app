description: "Pain wheels are used by orc marauders to blight the lands of their foes\
  \ and despoil the earth for generations to come. When you whirl this cruel weapon\
  \ above your head as a standard action, it scatters salt in a 5-foot radius centered\
  \ on your space. Creatures in the affected area (including you) that have fewer\
  \ than their maximum number of hit points must succeed at a DC 11 Fortitude save\
  \ or be sickened by pain for 1d6 rounds. Creatures affected by bleed effects take\
  \ a â€“5 penalty on their saves. A successful DC 11 Heal check ends the sickened condition,\
  \ as does the application of any effect that heals hit point damage. A pain wheel\
  \ must be loaded with a pound of salt (a move action) before it can be used. You\
  \ can also load a dose of itching powder (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 108)\
  \ or another alchemical powder normally used as a splash weapons into a pain wheel;\
  \ when a pain wheel is used this way, the affected area (including your square)\
  \ is treated as the splash radius for the purpose of determining the powder's effects,\
  \ and there is no way to deal a direct hit with the powder."
