description: "A vigil cap is built like a tinker's cap, but with shades and wideview\
  \ mirrors instead of magnifying lenses. The helmet's arms can be adjusted (as a\
  \ full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity) into one of the following\
  \ modes at a given time:\nAll-Around Perspective: When properly angled, the mirrors\
  \ grant the wearer a better view of his surroundings and attacking foes. In this\
  \ mode, the helmet grants a +2 circumstance bonus on reactive sight-based Perception\
  \ checks.\nIndirect Observation: Intended to protect against gaze attacks, this\
  \ mode combines shades positioned to block forward vision with mirrors angled to\
  \ let the wearer see around him. Any time he would normally have to attempt a saving\
  \ throw against a gaze attack, there is a 75% chance he doesn't need to attempt\
  \ the save. Because of the wearer's obscured vision, however, all foes gain partial\
  \ concealment (10% miss chance) against him.\nShades: With the mirrors tucked aside,\
  \ the shades provide a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against effects that\
  \ blind or dazzle."
