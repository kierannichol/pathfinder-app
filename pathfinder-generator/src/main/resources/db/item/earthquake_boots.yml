description: "These thick hide boots allow the wearer to detect unseen enemies, and\
  \ they provide a final line of defense against overwhelming foes. The wearer gains\
  \ tremorsense with a range of up to 60 feet as long as she is standing on solid\
  \ ground. Additionally, once per day, by stomping repeatedly on an earthen or stone\
  \ surface as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the wearer\
  \ can cast earthquake as a spell-like ability."
