description: "Fashioned from granite, this stone tablet is approximately 2 feet long,\
  \ 1 foot wide, and just over an inch thick. Dating to the period of the Keleshite\
  \ Interregnum in Osirion over 2,000 years ago, the tablet was once part of a larger\
  \ stone stele that was publicly displayed for all to see. Now known as the tablet\
  \ of languages lost, the broken slab is inscribed with a vow of fealty to the Padishah\
  \ Emperor of Kelesh in three different languages: Ancient Osiriani, Kelish, and\
  \ contemporary Osiriani. The characters and hieroglyphs of the three languages correspond\
  \ to one another and serve as a translation key between the languages.\nOnce per\
  \ day, upon speaking the command word, the owner of the tablet can read and understand\
  \ any written texts as if using comprehend languages for a period of 30 minutes.\
  \ This does not allow the owner to speak or write unknown languages, or read magical\
  \ writings (though the tablet reveals that such texts are magical). In addition,\
  \ if the tablet is readily available and at hand, the owner gains a +3 competence\
  \ bonus on all Linguistics checks. Finally, if the owner knows at least one of the\
  \ three languages inscribed on the tablet, he can attempt Linguistics checks to\
  \ translate the other two languages even if untrained in the Linguistics skill.\n\
  Possession of the tablet of languages lost serves as an acceptable rationale for\
  \ the owner to learn one of the three languages inscribed upon it (by putting a\
  \ rank in Linguistics during character advancement) without the need of a teacher\
  \ or library.\nAlthough the tablet of languages lost was created to ease the transition\
  \ of native Osirians from pharaonic rule to that of a foreign monarch, other tablets\
  \ could exist bearing different messages in other languages."
