description: "Death cults such as the Whispering Way use this elixir to prevent their\
  \ enemies from stealing their members' secrets, even after death. Elite cultists\
  \ typically imbibe deathgag elixir as part of an elaborate initiation ritual when\
  \ they are promoted to high-ranking positions in the cult. Thereafter, should the\
  \ imbiber fall below –1 hit point, the elixir triggers the release of a fatal poison\
  \ that throws him into wild convulsions. The victim begins foaming at the mouth,\
  \ and his eyes turn blood red. Soon after, the victim's entire jaw dissolves, rendering\
  \ him immune to speak with dead spells. Prior to the victim's death, only a limited\
  \ wish, miracle, or wish spell can undo the effects of the elixir. Individuals that\
  \ have imbibed deathgag elixir are noted as being \"deathgagged\" in the Defensive\
  \ Abilities section of their stat blocks."
