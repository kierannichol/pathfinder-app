description: "This slender tube contains an acrid black sludge that feels warm to\
  \ the touch. When she consumes this elixir, the imbiber is transformed into a gray\
  \ cat for 1 hour (as beast shape II), leaving behind any worn belongings on the\
  \ ground. While under the effects of the elixir, the imbiber gains darkvision with\
  \ a range of 30 feet, and her paw prints leave a trail of scorch marks that smell\
  \ faintly of sulfur. If the imbiber's original form already has darkvision, the\
  \ range increases by 30 feet. When the effect ends, the imbiber transforms back\
  \ into her original form."
