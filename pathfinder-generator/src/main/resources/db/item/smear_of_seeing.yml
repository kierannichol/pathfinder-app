description: "This oily black paste is kept in a glass jar about the size of a human's\
  \ fist. When rubbed onto an opaque surface as a standard action, an application\
  \ of smear of seeing allows others to see through it for 10 minutes or until it\
  \ is thoroughly diluted with universal solvent, after which the smear loses its\
  \ potency. Anyone on the side of the surface on which the smear was applied can\
  \ see through that surface as though it were a clear glass window. This does not\
  \ enable creatures to hear through the surface. Creatures on the other side of a\
  \ surface affected with smear of seeing cannot see the effect, but may detect it\
  \ via detect magic or other effects as normal.\nSmear of seeing can be used on plaster,\
  \ stone, wooden, or similar surfaces up to 10 feet thick. Smear of seeing has no\
  \ effect on metal or harder materials, regardless of thickness.\nOne application\
  \ of smear of seeing is enough to cover a 1-foot-radius area; multiple applications\
  \ can be used to increase the affected surface area. One jar of smear of seeing\
  \ contains enough paste for five applications."
