description: "Rather than being made of one continuous line of material, this belt\
  \ consists of many bits of tanned leather joined together by thick metal studs.\
  \ On command, the belt's wearer can transform the belt into a single masterwork\
  \ slashing and/or piercing melee weapon of her choice. As long as she is holding\
  \ the weapon, she can also revert it back to belt form with a command. Furthermore,\
  \ the belt can be enchanted like a piercing and slashing melee weapon, using the\
  \ cost of the belt as the cost of the masterwork item."
