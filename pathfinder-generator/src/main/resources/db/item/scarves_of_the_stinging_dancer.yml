description: "Made to enhance the most seductive Varisian dances, this collection\
  \ of silken scarves is patterned in yellow and black. Varisian worshipers of Calistria\
  \ weave these scarves in the shadow of the Irespan, drawing upon the ancient evocation\
  \ magic they call ragario to imbue the silk with vengeful energies. Scarves of the\
  \ stinging dancer grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform (dance) checks, similar\
  \ to that granted by masterwork musical instruments; this effect is nonmagical and\
  \ cannot be dispelled.\nTo activate the scarves' magic, the wearer must succeed\
  \ at a DC 20 Perform (dance) check. This check can be attempted as part of a move\
  \ action in which the wearer moves no more than half his speed (including when he\
  \ uses the Acrobatics skill to avoid enemies) or as part of an attack action or\
  \ full attack in which the wearer uses only a bladed scarf to attack. Once activated,\
  \ the scarves' magic lasts until the beginning of the wearer's next turn.\nWhile\
  \ the scarves' magic is active, whenever the wearer is successfully targeted by\
  \ a harmful spell, hit by a melee or ranged attack, or touched against his will,\
  \ the scarves lash out at the source of the attack (a creature if it's a spellcaster\
  \ or an individual holding a magic item, or an object if the source is a trap or\
  \ otherwise unattended) with a magic missile (CL 3rd). This missile takes the form\
  \ of an angrily buzzing wasp. The scarves can be deactivated as a free action.\n\
  The scarves of the stinging dancer can create 50 missiles before losing their magic.\
  \ At this point, the scarves can no longer cast magic missile, but they still provide\
  \ the +2 bonus on Perform (dance) checks."
