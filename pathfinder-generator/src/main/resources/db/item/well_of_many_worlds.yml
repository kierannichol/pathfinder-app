description: "This strange, interdimensional device looks just like a portable hole.\
  \ Anything placed within it is immediately cast to another world—a parallel world,\
  \ another planet, or a different plane (chosen randomly). If the well is moved,\
  \ it opens to a new plane (also randomly determined). It can be picked up, folded,\
  \ or rolled, just as a portable hole can be. Objects from the world the well touches\
  \ can come through the opening just as easily— it is a two-way portal."
