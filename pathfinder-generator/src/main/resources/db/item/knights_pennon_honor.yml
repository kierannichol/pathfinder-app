  \ though it can be flown from a spear, polearm, or even a staff. It has no effect\
  \ if not mounted appropriately. A knight's pennon grants different benefits depending\
  \ on its color and design.\nBattle: The red knight's pennon of battle allows its\
  \ bearer to benefit from heroism once per day.\nHonor: The gold knight's pennon\
  \ of honor bestows protection from evil upon the bearer once per day.\nParley: The\
  \ white knight's pennon of parley, when displayed approaching a negotiation, grants\
  \ the bearer a +4 enhancement bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive\
  \ checks for 1 hour, so long as the bearer does not initiate any hostile action."
