description: "When blown, this crudely carved reed whistle emits a painful sound that\
  \ only dogs (or other canine creatures, like wolves, werewolves, or yeth hounds)\
  \ can hear. All such creatures within a 30-foot-radius spread when a devastating\
  \ dog whistle is activated must make a DC 11 Fortitude save to avoid taking 1d6\
  \ points of sonic damage. A creature that fails to resist the effects of this spell\
  \ is also affected by magical silence, preventing it from speaking or making sounds\
  \ with its voice (it can still make noise by movementâ€”it just can't talk or bark\
  \ or howl) for 1 minute. A devastating dog whistle can be used once per day without\
  \ peril, but each additional use per day brings a 25% cumulative chance that the\
  \ devastating dog whistle is destroyed upon activation."
