description: "Crafted of stout, wax-treated leather and wrapped with warm fur reminiscent\
  \ of a frost giant's beard, these boots are sometimes given as gifts by the frost\
  \ giant tribes of the north to their smaller allies. In addition to functioning\
  \ as boots of the winterlands, the boots of the winter jarl enable their wearer\
  \ to take the form of a frost giant once per day, as with the giant form I spell.\
  \ While in giant form, the wearer gains a +6 size bonus to Strength, a –2 penalty\
  \ to Dexterity, a +4 size bonus to Constitution, a +4 natural armor bonus, low-light\
  \ vision, rock catching, rock throwing, and resist cold 20, but also gains vulnerability\
  \ to fire. The wearer can remain in giant form for up to 10 minutes."
