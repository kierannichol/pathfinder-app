description: "These specially charged pieces of parchment come in small packages containing\
  \ seven sheets. Psychically attuned to the specific magnetic fluids a living creature\
  \ needs to part the ethereal veil, these sheets add a 5% bonus to the chance of\
  \ creating meaningful writing for the automatic writing occult skill unlock. This\
  \ use consumes one sheet of the paper, and only one sheet can be used per attempt."
