description: "This white, slender rod is engraved with decorative emblems of elephants,\
  \ jackals, alligators, and other wild beasts, and is worth 2,000 gp because of its\
  \ masterful craftsmanship. The wielder can command the obedience of golems within\
  \ 120 feet when she activates the device (a standard action), bypassing their immunity\
  \ to magic and any other resistances to magic they may possess. Up to 300 Hit Dice\
  \ worth of golems can be ruled at once with an ivory baton. Ruled golems obey the\
  \ wielder as if she were their creator. Still, if the wielder attacks a ruled golem\
  \ or gives it a command that is obviously harmful to it, the magic is broken. An\
  \ ivory baton can be used for 500 total minutes before crumbling to dust. This duration\
  \ need not be continuous. For each golem ruled beyond the first, multiply the number\
  \ of minutes expended by the number of golems ruled (so, for example, a creature\
  \ wielding an ivory baton to control three golems effectively expends 3 minutes\
  \ of the rod's total duration every minute)."
