description: "This whip is made from braids of metallic wire. When it is activated,\
  \ the wielder can expend the power within it to gain a sacred (if activated with\
  \ positive energy) or profane (if activated with negative energy) bonus on her next\
  \ disarm or trip combat maneuver with the whip. This bonus is equal to the number\
  \ of dice of the activating cleric's channel energy ability. The whip remains charged\
  \ until its magic is used or 1 hour has passed."
