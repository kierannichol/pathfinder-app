description: "This leather collar resizes to fit almost any size of creature. Once\
  \ per day on command, the creature that fastened the dire collar to the animal can\
  \ cause that animal to grow larger and more bestial. The collar's fastener must\
  \ be within 30 feet of the animal to do so. The animal gains the benefits of an\
  \ enlarge person spell (despite the normal targeting restrictions of that spell)\
  \ for 1 minute."
