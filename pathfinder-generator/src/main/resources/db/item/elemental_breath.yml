description: "This vial at first seems to be empty, but when it's opened, a rush of\
  \ wind issues forth from within. When elemental breath is inhaled (as drinking a\
  \ potion) by an air-breathing creature, that creature does not need to breath air\
  \ for 10 rounds. A vial of elemental breath must be inhaled on the round it was\
  \ opened to gain this effect. If it is not, the item is wasted."
