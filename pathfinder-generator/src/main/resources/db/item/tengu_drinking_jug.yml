description: "This looks like a one-gallon stoneware jug with white glaze, black birds\
  \ painted around the middle, and a cork stopper tied about the neck with a hemp\
  \ cord. Any liquid placed within the jug becomes safe to drink, as though affected\
  \ by purify food and drink (though the jug only affects liquids). Three times per\
  \ day, the bearer can command the jug to alter the temperature of its contents so\
  \ that it ranges anywhere from ice cold to boiling hot. Once per day, the bearer\
  \ can command water placed into the jug to transform into plum liquor, sake, or\
  \ tea. A tengu jug holds up to 1 gallon of any liquid."
