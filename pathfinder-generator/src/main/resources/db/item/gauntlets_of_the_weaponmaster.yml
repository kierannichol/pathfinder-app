description: "These gauntlets come in a variety of forms. Some are mostly leather\
  \ with small steel plates, and are suited for fine swordplay. Others are fully articulated\
  \ plate favored by knights in full plate. On command, the wearer of the gauntlet\
  \ can store a single weapon he is holding in the gauntlets. When he does so, a graven\
  \ image of the weapon appears on the gauntlet's plates. The wearer can store up\
  \ to 10 weapons in the gauntlets in this manner. Retrieving a weapon requires the\
  \ wearer to touch the image of the weapon he wants. Doing so is a swift action.\
  \ When a weapon is retrieved, it appears in the hands of the wearer and any weapons\
  \ the wearer had in his hands is stored in the gauntlets. If there is no room in\
  \ the gauntlet for the weapons the wearer is holding, those weapons are dropped.\
  \ The gauntlets can only store weapons; other items cannot be placed in the gauntlet.\n\
  Furthermore, three times per day on command, the gloves affect the wearer as the\
  \ greater heroism spell."
