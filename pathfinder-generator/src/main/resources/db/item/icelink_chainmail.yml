description: "Carved from a single block of ice birthed from the breath of the great\
  \ white wyrm Sjohvor, the ice-carved rings of this exquisite suit of +2 chainmail\
  \ never thaw. If grappled, the wearer can command the armor to release an icy blast\
  \ against the grappler. The armor then glows with a pale blue radiance, deals 4d6\
  \ points of cold damage to the target, and causes the target to be staggered for\
  \ 1 round. Once the armor discharges, this ability can't be used until the armor\
  \ recharges 1 hour later.\nIcelink chainmail is considered light armor and has an\
  \ arcane spell failure chance of 20%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +4, and an armor\
  \ check penalty of â€“3. The armor weighs half as much as standard chainmail and floats\
  \ in water."
