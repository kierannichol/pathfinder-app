description: "This miniature chariot is made of wood and bronze and has a leather\
  \ thong so it can hang around the neck or a belt. Once per day when the command\
  \ word is spoken, the chariot increases in size to a fully functioning medium chariot\
  \ (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 181) capable of holding one Large creature or\
  \ four Medium creatures. Up to four Medium creatures or one Large creature can be\
  \ harnessed to the chariot to pull it, allowing these creatures as well as the chariot\
  \ to gain the effects of overland flight. The chariot cannot move of its own volition\
  \ and must have a source of propulsion in order to fly.\nWith a second command word,\
  \ the chariot shrinks back to its miniature size. Any creatures harnessed to it\
  \ (but not those riding the vehicle) are absorbed into the miniature chariot. Such\
  \ creatures are affected as if by a temporal stasis spell; they reappear at their\
  \ normal size when the chariot is next activated."
