description: "The wearer notices nothing unusual when the robe is donned, and it functions\
  \ normally. However, as soon as he is in a situation requiring concentration and\
  \ action against hostile opponents, the true nature of the garment is revealed:\
  \ the wearer immediately suffers a multitude of bites from the insects that magically\
  \ infest the garment. He must cease all other activities in order to scratch, shift\
  \ the robe, and generally show signs of the extreme discomfort caused by the bites\
  \ and movement of these pests.\nThe wearer takes a –5 penalty on initiative checks\
  \ and a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and skill checks. If he tries to\
  \ cast a spell, he must make a concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose\
  \ the spell."
