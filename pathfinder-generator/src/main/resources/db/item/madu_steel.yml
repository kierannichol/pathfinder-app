description: "The madu is a round, light leather shield with two animal horns—usually\
  \ from an antelope—extending from opposite edges of the shield. If you are proficient\
  \ with the madu, you may use it to fight defensively with a –2 penalty instead of\
  \ the normal –4, and your attack penalty for using Combat Expertise improves by\
  \ +1 (minimum –1 penalty). You cannot hold anything else in the hand that bears\
  \ a madu. If you are not proficient with the madu, treat it as a light spiked shield.\
  \ A madu can't be disarmed. While traditional madus are crafted from leather and\
  \ animal horn, they can be made entirely out of metal. Whether leather or steel,\
  \ a madu offers the same basic protection and attack benefits, though the two varieties\
  \ respond differently to some spells and effects (such as rusting grasp). A druid\
  \ can use a leather madu, but not a steel madu."
