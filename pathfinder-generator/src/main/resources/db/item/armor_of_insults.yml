description: "Each metal bit of this suit of +1 studded leather looks more like a\
  \ tiny sneering face than a simple stud. Once per day the wearer of the armor may\
  \ command the mouths to unleash a torrent of verbal abuse directed against every\
  \ hostile creature within 60 feet who can see and hear the wearer. Each such creature\
  \ must make a DC 16 Will saving throw to avoid suffering an overwhelming compulsion\
  \ to attack the wearer for the next 7 rounds. If the creature is unable to attack\
  \ the wearer on its next turn, or attacking the wearer would put the creature at\
  \ risk (moving through a threatened square, charging into a pit, and so on) it can\
  \ act normally that turn. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect, and has no effect\
  \ on creatures that do not use a spoken language."
