name: "Scroll of Righteous Vigor"
description: "Infusing the target with a surge of furious divine energy, you enhance\
  \ a creature's ability to hit an opponent based on the number of times it has already\
  \ hit that opponent with a successful attack. Each time the subject successfully\
  \ strikes an opponent with a successful melee attack, the subject gains a cumulative\
  \ +1 morale bonus on attack rolls (maximum +4 bonus) and gains 1d8 temporary hit\
  \ points (to a maximum of 20 temporary hit points). If an attack misses, the attack\
  \ bonus resets to +0 but any accumulated temporary hit points remain. The temporary\
  \ hit points disappear at the end of the spell's duration."
