description: "These tight-fitting mithral bracers are used throughout the Inner Sea\
  \ region in nations where dueling is prominent. The wearer of dueling cuffs gains\
  \ a +1 deflection bonus to AC. This bonus increases to +2 if the wearer is wielding\
  \ one or more weapons that benefit from the Weapon Finesse feat.\nIn a duel (Ultimate\
  \ Combat 150), the wielder doesn't take the normal –5 penalty when using the dueling\
  \ parry action. In addition, the wielder can attempt to deflect ranged attacks from\
  \ firearms with a dueling parry, but takes a –5 penalty on such attempts."
