name: "Oil of Recoil Fire"
description: "The target firearm suddenly fires of its own volition, even if it is\
  \ unloaded, generating a recoil so great that the wielder or carrier of the firearm\
  \ must scramble to hold onto it and becomes flat-footed until the start of his next\
  \ turn. If the wielder is already flat-footed, he is instead knocked prone. If the\
  \ firearm was loaded, that ammunition is wasted."
