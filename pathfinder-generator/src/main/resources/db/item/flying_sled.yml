description: "A flying sled is a small vehicle akin to a rowboat, and is covered in\
  \ metallic veins. The sled can hold one occupant. A psychic pilot can the control\
  \ the craft. Without a psychic pilot, a flying sled acts in all regards as a rowboat\
  \ (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 185).\nA control helmet that fits a Small or Medium\
  \ creature is linked by cables to the metal veins of the sled. When a psychic creature\
  \ (one with levels in an occult class, the Psychic Sensitivity feat, or the ability\
  \ to use psychic spell-like abilities) wears the control helmet, the flying sled\
  \ gains the following abilities."
