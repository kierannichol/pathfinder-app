description: "This looks to be just two plain steel rings. But when a mythic creature\
  \ grasping them expends one use of mythic power as a swift action, they explode\
  \ into a 10-foot-long spiked fighting chain formed from of the wielder's choice\
  \ of acid, cold, fire, or electricity. The wielder can dismiss this effect as a\
  \ free action. The chain is a +6 spiked chain that deals 4d6 points of damage of\
  \ the chosen type instead of the normal damage typically done by a spiked chain.\
  \ Once activated, the chain retains it shape for 1 hour or until the wielder dismisses\
  \ the weapon, whichever comes first."
destruction: "Feeding its twin steel rings to an elemental lord destroys an elemental\
  \ chain."
