description: "This thick coat of +2 scale mail is crafted from waxy scales of varying\
  \ sizes with a sickly, jaundiced color—the grime-stained fingernails of dead hill\
  \ giants. Any creature of the giant subtype who comes within 30 feet of giant's\
  \ nail scale mail must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or take a –4 penalty on attack\
  \ rolls and saving throws for 1d4 rounds. This ability functions as a gaze effect.\
  \ It is a mind-affecting fear effect, but it does not stack with other fear effects\
  \ to create stronger fear conditions. A giant who succeeds at the saving throw is\
  \ immune to this effect for 24 hours. If a giant rolls a natural 20 on its saving\
  \ throw, it becomes enraged by the sight of the armor. The giant gains the effects\
  \ of the rage spell for 1d4 rounds and is compelled to attack the armor's wearer\
  \ for the duration of this effect."
