description: "The basic single-shot pistol is one of the most common firearms, although\
  \ in most campaigns it is still rare enough to be an object of envy or curiosity\
  \ to most. As such, it can take a variety of different forms, from wildly ornate\
  \ masterpieces in the shape of fire-breathing dragons to the more common woodhandled\
  \ pistols, or nothing more than a simple metal tube with a triggering device.\n\
  A pistol uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical\
  \ cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm."
