description: "This +2 shock musket is inscribed with imagery of storms and plagues,\
  \ glorifying the daemonic harbinger Cixyron. When a bullet fired from a withershot\
  \ strikes a good- or neutral-aligned target, it burrows into the target's flesh\
  \ and infects the target with cackle fever (Core Rulebook 557). Infected creatures\
  \ can resist the disease normally, but can't be cured or recover lost ability damage\
  \ until the cursed bullet is removed (this requires a successful DC 15 Heal check\
  \ or a restoration spell). Additional bullet impacts do not increase the effects,\
  \ but each bullet must be removed before the target can be cured of its disease."
