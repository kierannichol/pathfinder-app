description: "Once per day when a user wearing both these bracers speaks a command\
  \ word, the metal turns entirely liquid and swims over the wearer's hands to cover\
  \ her weapons. The user can cover a two-handed melee weapon or up to two one-handed\
  \ or light melee weapons. For the next 10 rounds, the affected weapons can overcome\
  \ damage reduction as though the weapons were made of adamantine, cold iron, or\
  \ silver (as determined by the quickmetal bracers' type).\nThe heavy, shifting metal\
  \ coating affects the balance of manufactured weapons, imposing a –2 penalty on\
  \ attack rolls. Improvised weapons, however, are already unwieldy, and the metal\
  \ coating doesn't significantly affect their balance. If the wielder lets go of\
  \ a weapon affected by the bracers, the liquid metal immediately turns back into\
  \ a solid metal bracer— or bracers, in the case of a two-handed weapon—reappearing\
  \ on the user's wrists. The bracers cannot therefore affect thrown weapons or ranged\
  \ weapon ammunition."
