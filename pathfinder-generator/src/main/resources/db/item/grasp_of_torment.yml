description: "This wicked-looking +2 adamantine spiked chain is favored by those who\
  \ associate with kytons. When used to perform a disarm or trip combat maneuver,\
  \ the chain partly animates to grasp the target, granting a +4 bonus on the combat\
  \ maneuver check. On a successful disarm or trip combat maneuver check, the chain\
  \ deals damage to the target creature or weapon as if it had also hit with an attack\
  \ (in addition to the maneuver's effects)."
