description: "This immaculate set of +1 full plate adorned with gilt flourishes and\
  \ imagery of lions, and embossed red accents. When worn, the armor grants its wearer\
  \ a +2 sacred bonus on all saves against spells with the evil descriptor or cast\
  \ by evil creatures.\nOnce per day as a swift action, the wearer of honor's panoply\
  \ can call upon Iomedae for protection. For the next 5 minutes, the armor glows\
  \ with an aura of golden light, and any hostile creature within 20 feet of the wearer\
  \ must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or take a â€“2 penalty to its Armor Class and\
  \ on attack rolls and saving throws for the duration, or until it hits the wearer\
  \ with an attack. The wearer can dismiss this effect before the duration expires\
  \ as a swift action on his turn to heal itself of 3d8+5 points of damage in a burst\
  \ of healing energy.\nA creature with the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat and at\
  \ least 5 ranks in the Craft (armor) skill can perform a ritual to corrupt honor's\
  \ panoply, shifting its dedication to an evil deity. This ritual takes 6 days to\
  \ complete, costs 2,000 gp in incense and materials, and requires a successful DC\
  \ 19 Craft (armor) check. If the magic warhammer Sinderbos (see page 42) is used\
  \ during the ritual, the cost of the ritual is reduced by 1,000 gp and requires\
  \ only a successful DC 10 Craft (armor) check to complete. Once performed, the ritual\
  \ transforms the armor into infamy's panoply; the armor turns black, the lions become\
  \ animals sacred to the evil deity to which the armor is dedicated, and the red\
  \ accents turn the crimson of fresh blood. The ritual also inverts the armor's effects:\
  \ the save bonus is now profane and applies to spells with the good descriptor or\
  \ cast by good creatures, and the armor now emanates a palpable aura of horror,\
  \ causing non-allies to be shaken on a failed save. Dismissing this effect now grants\
  \ the wearer fast healing 2 for 1 minute."
