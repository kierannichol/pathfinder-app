  \ that magic is the preferred method for turning salt water into fresh drinking\
  \ water. The power provided by this device's heatstones accelerates the desalination\
  \ process considerably. The user of a heatstone desalinator can place 1 gallon of\
  \ salt water into the device and receive a gallon of fresh water in 1 minute, with\
  \ no additional effort required on her own part."
