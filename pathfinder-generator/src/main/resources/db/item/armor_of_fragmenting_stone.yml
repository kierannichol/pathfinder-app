description: "This imposing suit of armor, first forged by Jistkan elemental binders,\
  \ is covered in large, jagged stones and functions as +2 full plate. Once per day\
  \ as an immediate action, when a bludgeoning or slashing attack strikes the wearer,\
  \ the wearer can will a chunk of the stone to break off, summoning a Medium earth\
  \ elemental as summon monster IV. The elemental fights as the wearer directs (and\
  \ understands the wearer, even if the two do not share a language) for 7 rounds,\
  \ or until it is destroyed."
