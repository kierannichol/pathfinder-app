description: "This shield behaves in all ways as an absorbing shield until its owner\
  \ attempts to use its disintegration power in combat. Once he does, it instead causes\
  \ one or more monsters to pour forth from the shield and attack the nearest creature\
  \ each round (including the shield-bearer) for 1d6 rounds before retreating by the\
  \ safest possible route. If there is no such path for them to escape, the monsters\
  \ fight to the death. To determine the nature and number of the monsters, roll 2d4\
  \ to determine the level of the summon monster spell and roll 1d3 to determine the\
  \ number of creatures that appear. Monsters conjured by this shield remain until\
  \ killed, act as normal for their kind, and are treated as summoned creatures with\
  \ a permanent duration.\nOnce its curse activates, the shield calls forth monsters\
  \ three times per day, approximately every 8 hours. If the monsters cannot emerge\
  \ directly from the shield and survive (for example, because it's buried or underwater),\
  \ they instead appear at the nearest safe location within 50 feet. Successful curse-breaking\
  \ magic cast on the shield restores it to its previous guise as an absorbing shield\
  \ and allows its wearer to abandon it."
