description: "At first glance, this book appears to be a nondescript volume filled\
  \ with blank pages of ordinary paper (though it might instead contain recorded conversations;\
  \ see below). By speaking the proper command word, the owner can cause the exterior\
  \ of the tome to appear exactly like another book, changing its size, shape, and\
  \ color so as to be an exact duplicate of the specified title. Once activated in\
  \ this manner, the codex of conversations begins recording any verbal communication\
  \ that occurs within 20 feet of it, inscribing the words upon its pages in whatever\
  \ language they are uttered. If the language being spoken has no written form, the\
  \ inscription occurs phonetically in whichever language the book's activator specifies.\
  \ Additionally, the activator can utter an additional command word to cause the\
  \ text to be recorded in an encoded form that she specifies. Repeating this second\
  \ command word decodes the script.\nThe codex can detect and differentiate voices,\
  \ inscribing each conversationalist's words in a different color of ink, up to a\
  \ total of eight colors. The book doesn't attribute names to these voices, though\
  \ the reader might be able to determine who they are through context. If the book\
  \ hears more than eight different voices, it reuses the eight colors as evenly as\
  \ possible; two inscriptions with the same color ink could thus be the words of\
  \ different people. The book continues to record conversations until another command\
  \ word is spoken or until all 200 pages are full (each page holds about 300 words,\
  \ or about 2 minutes of conversation). A user might bring the book openly to a meeting\
  \ in order to accurately record all that is said, or attempt to surreptitiously\
  \ slip a codex of conversations into a target's library, replacing a seldom-used\
  \ volume with the magical one in the hope of gathering vital information unnoticed.\n\
  When a codex of conversations is deactivated, it returns to its true nondescript\
  \ form, but the words it has inscribed remain intact for as long as the user wishes\
  \ to keep them. Another command word causes the recorded conversations to disappear\
  \ from the pages of the book, resetting it to be used again. The codex can't record\
  \ anything other than the spoken word, so it can't inscribe musical notes if a song\
  \ is sung. It can record verbal components to spells, but the resultant verbiage\
  \ is not magical and can't be used to cast the spell or be read as a scroll. It\
  \ can inscribe command words to other magical items when the words are uttered aloud."
