name: "Scroll of Slowing Mud"
description: "You coat the targets in thick, sticky mud. The mud acts as a slow spell\
  \ and also blinds the targets. A creature can use a standard action to remove the\
  \ mud from its eyes or the eyes of an adjacent creature, ending the blinded condition\
  \ for that individual. Removing enough mud to end the slow effect is a full-round\
  \ action. Jumping into a lake or being subject to an effect that creates a lot of\
  \ water (such as create water or hydraulic push) removes all the mud in 1 round."
