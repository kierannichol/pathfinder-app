description: "This banner, emblazoned with a good or lawful deity's holy symbol, is\
  \ meant to be carried and displayed and has no effect when not mounted properly\
  \ or when lying on the ground. A bastion banner emits a hallow effect in a 40-foot\
  \ radius around it, so long as it is borne by one true to the religion whose holy\
  \ symbol graces the banner.\nWithin the 40-foot radius of its hallow effect, a planted\
  \ bastion banner secures terrain that would otherwise be unstable, whether due to\
  \ natural causes (such as a mudslide) or supernatural causes (such as a specific\
  \ plane's morphic trait). Natural terrain is simply fixed in its current configuration\
  \ and cannot be altered naturally or magically; a spellcaster attempting to change\
  \ the terrain affected by a bastion banner (such as with move earth or transmute\
  \ mud to rock) must make a successful DC 21 caster level check to do so. Unnaturally\
  \ or magically morphic terrain (such as that on the Abyss) is shaped into a 40-foot\
  \ sphere with the topmost hemispherical half composed of breathable air and the\
  \ lower hemispherical half composed of packed earth. This effect only secures basic\
  \ footing against collapse; it cannot impede moving objects from outside the area\
  \ (such as rain or an avalanche) or forces that act physically on the soil (such\
  \ as shovels or tunneling creatures).\nWhen planted, a bastion banner also has a\
  \ specific spell tied to the hallow effect, as well as an additional effect, both\
  \ tied to the holy symbol it bears. When a bastion banner affects allies, the allies\
  \ must worship the same deity as the one portrayed on the banner to benefit from\
  \ the deity-specific spell and effect, and only as long as they are within 40 feet\
  \ of the banner. Enemies must also be within 40 feet of the banner to be affected.\
  \ The spells and effects associated with each deity are:\nAbadar: Protection from\
  \ energy (type is set when banner is planted; renews daily); allies gain a +4 sacred\
  \ bonus on checks to aid another.\nAsmodeus: Cause fear (affects enemies only),\
  \ and the hallow effect is unhallow instead; allies gain a +2 morale bonus on combat\
  \ maneuver checks.\nCayden Cailean: Remove fear; whenever allies successfully resist\
  \ a fear effect, they gain 10 temporary hit points for 1 hour.\nDesna: Freedom of\
  \ movement; once per day, whenever the banner's owner or an ally rolls a d20, the\
  \ owner of the banner may choose to treat the roll as a natural 20.\nErastil: Invisibility\
  \ purge; allies gain a +1 morale bonus on damage and attack rolls with ranged weapons.\n\
  Iomedae: Death ward; allies gain a +1 morale bonus on damage and attack rolls with\
  \ melee weapons.\nIrori: Resist energy (type is set when banner is planted); allies\
  \ gain a +2 sacred bonus on saves.\nSarenrae: Daylight; all spells with the fire\
  \ or light descriptor cast from within the affected area are cast at +1 caster level.\n\
  Shelyn: Tongues; allies gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma.\nTorag: Dimensional\
  \ anchor; allies gain a +2 sacred bonus to AC.\nZon-Kuthon: Darkness, and hallow\
  \ effect is unhallow instead; enemies are sickened."
