description: "This simple woolen cloak is trimmed across the shoulders with the feathers\
  \ of eagles and other raptors, and permits the user to fly (as the spell) for a\
  \ total of 30 minutes each day. These 30 minutes need not be consecutive, but each\
  \ use of this ability that lasts for fewer than 5 minutes reduces the daily limit\
  \ by 5 minutes. While flying under the power of the plumed mantle, the wearer has\
  \ a +2 bonus on Fly checks, in addition to any bonuses from speed or maneuverability.\n\
  In addition to its powers of flight, the plumed mantle protects its wearer with\
  \ a continuous feather fall effect, and makes him appear as a golden eagle to viewers\
  \ on the ground. The wearer can suppress either effect by force of will as a free\
  \ action.\nWhile at a height greater than 40 feet, the wearer of the plumed mantle\
  \ receives a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks involving vision or sight."
