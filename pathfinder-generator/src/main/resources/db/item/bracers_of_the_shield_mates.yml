description: "These heavy, bronze bracers depict scenes of epic battle and heroic\
  \ sacrifice. When worn together, they provide no benefit. When two individuals each\
  \ wear a single bracer, each wearer gains a +2 shield bonus to AC as long as the\
  \ two remain within 100 feet of each other.\nBy expending one use of mythic power\
  \ as a swift action, the wearer of one of the bracers can teleport up to 100 feet\
  \ per mythic tier to any unoccupied space adjacent to the other wearer. The wearer\
  \ acts normally for the remainder of her turn, then immediately teleports back to\
  \ her original space when her turn ends. Effects that prevent dimensional travel\
  \ either from the wearer's space or to her destination block this ability."
