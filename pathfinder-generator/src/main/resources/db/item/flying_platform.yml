description: "This sturdy, 10-foot-by-10-foot mithral platform bears five shifting,\
  \ white runes of Auran incantations related to clouds and swift travel. It functions\
  \ identically to a carpet of flying, except it requires periodic recharging to maintain\
  \ power. The device can hold up to 5 charges, depleting them at a rate of 1 charge\
  \ for every hour or partial hour of continuous use. The charges can be restored\
  \ by casting overland flight onto the runes, which restores 1 charge per casting.\n\
  When in operation, a flying platform also reduces the effect of rushing wind upon\
  \ those standing on it, producing an alter winds effect to decrease the wind's intensity\
  \ by one step. A flying platform can normally carry 800 pounds at a speed of 40\
  \ feet, but it can carry up to twice this amount with a reduced speed of 30 feet.\
  \ A flying platform can hover without need for a Fly check, and grants a +5 bonus\
  \ on any other Fly checks made to operate it. It has hardness 10 and 60 hit points."
