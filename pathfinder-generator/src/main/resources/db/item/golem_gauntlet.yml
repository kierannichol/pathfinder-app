description: "This adamantine light mace has been molded to resemble the fist of a\
  \ golem. When the mace is touched or picked up by a creature, elemental energies\
  \ within the mace surge and swirl around the user's hands, but the energies soon\
  \ subside as the gauntlets become adjusted to the user. When the user deals damage\
  \ to a golem with the golem gauntlet, the golem must succeed at a DC 23 Will save\
  \ or lose its spell immunity until the beginning of the wearer's next turn. In addition,\
  \ the user can use the golem gauntlet to ready an action to counter a ranged attack\
  \ generated by a spell effect that targets the wielder. If the readied action is\
  \ triggered, the wielder of the gauntlet can make a melee attack roll against the\
  \ ranged attack. If the result of the wielder's attack roll is greater than the\
  \ attack roll of the magical ranged attack, the magical ranged attack is negated."
