description: "When the wearer of this delicate platinum ring dies, his soul remains\
  \ adrift in the River of Souls and does not proceed to its final judgment in the\
  \ Boneyard. Until the soultether ring is removed from the corpse, the time limit\
  \ for restoring the creature to life via spells such as raise dead or resurrection\
  \ is suspended. This ring has no effect if it is placed upon a corpse; it must be\
  \ worn at the time the creature dies to tether its soul. Psychopomps and other followers\
  \ of Pharasma consider soultether rings to be sacrilegious, and the creatures destroy\
  \ the rings whenever possible."
