description: "This humble-looking, round-bottomed flask was used to purify one of\
  \ the legendary philosopher's stones, and acquired some special properties as a\
  \ side effect of this use. The hermetic flask and its creations function for only\
  \ users with the alchemy class feature (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 26)\
  \ and the ability to make extracts. Using the flask normally requires an alchemist's\
  \ lab or crafting kit. Makeshift tools can be used, but result in a –5 penalty on\
  \ all checks.\nIf a user spends 10 minutes and 100 gp, and succeeds at a DC 30 Craft\
  \ (alchemy) check, the flask can distill one dose of alchemical essence. If the\
  \ user expends one use of mythic power during the distilling process, 10 doses are\
  \ made instead. Alchemical essence remains stable only as long as it's contained\
  \ within the hermetic flask. As a standard action, an alchemist can pour forth a\
  \ dose and immediately convert it into an alchemical item worth 100 gp or less,\
  \ or into a poison worth 1,000 gp or less. He may throw it or apply it as part of\
  \ the same standard action.\nA weapon-like liquid, such as alchemist's fire, congeals\
  \ into a fragile globule and remains stable until thrown or otherwise broken. Any\
  \ such substance poured from the flask remains stable for 1 minute, and then dissolves\
  \ harmlessly. The purity of the alchemical essence increases the effectiveness of\
  \ alchemical items derived from it. Any save DCs associated with the item increase\
  \ by 2, and any damage caused or healed by it increases by 50% (including ability\
  \ damage). The hermetic flask can hold a maximum of 10 doses of alchemical essence\
  \ at a time.\nThe user can identify the properties of an unknown alchemical substance\
  \ or poison by pouring it into an empty hermetic flask and succeeding at a DC 25\
  \ Craft (alchemy) check for a normal substance, or a DC 30 or 35 check for a rarer\
  \ substance. This analysis takes 1 minute and doesn't destroy the substance. Poisons\
  \ analyzed in the flask can be converted into an antidote as part of this check,\
  \ consuming the poison in the process. Such an antidote automatically cures the\
  \ poison in any creature currently suffering from it, and provides immunity to further\
  \ exposure to that specific poison for 24 hours. The antidote remains stable for\
  \ as long as it's within the flask, and for 1 minute after it's removed.\nBy expending\
  \ one use of mythic power and using the flask as part of a Craft check, the user\
  \ can halve the cost of materials needed to create an alchemical item or poison.\
  \ This doesn't apply to the creation of alchemical essence."
destruction: "A hermetic flask can be destroyed by using it to analyze any of the\
  \ products of a philosopher's stone. Such an act of hubris shatters the flask in\
  \ a powerful explosion, dealing 25d6 points of fire damage in a 30-foot-radius spread.\
  \ The person performing the experiment receives no saving throw. Other victims can\
  \ halve the damage with a successful DC 30 Reflex save."
