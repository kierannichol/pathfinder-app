  \ its head resemble thorns. Once per day, the wielder can use bless. Additionally,\
  \ once per day when the wielder is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, the weapon\
  \ automatically casts cure light wounds on the wielder at the start of her next\
  \ turn, so long as it remains in the same square as the wielder."
