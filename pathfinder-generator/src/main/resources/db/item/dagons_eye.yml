description: "This chunk of yellow crystal glows like a torch, shedding normal light\
  \ in a 20-foot radius and increasing the light level for an additional 20 feet by\
  \ one step, up to normal light. The crystal floats in the air 1 foot above any solid\
  \ surface and can be moved with little effort.\nAny form of Abyssal writing (books,\
  \ scrolls, etc.) read by the light of Dagon's eye can be understood by any creature\
  \ that perceives it, as if under the effects of a comprehend languages spell.\n\
  If any form of Celestial writing is placed in the light of Dagon's Eye, the words\
  \ erupt into a searing fireball that deals 6d6 points of fire damage to all creatures\
  \ within 20 feet of the writing. Creatures in the area take only half damage with\
  \ a successful DC 14 Reflex save. This ability functions once every 10 minutes."
