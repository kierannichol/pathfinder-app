description: "This silver coin bears the symbol of the Prophecies of Kalistrade on\
  \ one side, and its other side is inscribed with one of the many rules that lead\
  \ to enlightenment. When the coin is placed in a non-magical bag or purse and the\
  \ command word is spoken, the coin reduces the weight of any coins, gems, or jewelry\
  \ carried in the bag by half. In addition, the container becomes the focus of an\
  \ alarm spell that's triggered if the container is opened without the command word\
  \ being spoken. Most Kalistocrat's coins have a mental alarm. The coin doesn't function\
  \ for containers of other materials, and a container can benefit from only one Kalistocrat's\
  \ coin at a time."
