description: "Apollyon's weapon is the Usher of the Black Rain. He can cause this\
  \ weapon to shift from a scythe to a composite longbow (Str +16) as a move action,\
  \ but in both forms the Usher is a +5 unholy wounding weapon. As a longbow, it creates\
  \ ammunition automatically as it is fired. Against foes who are currently suffering\
  \ from a disease, the Usher of the Black Rain deals an additional 6 points of profane\
  \ damage with each hit."
destruction: "The Usher of the Black Rain burns to ash if Apollyon's cloak (which\
  \ was stitched from the flesh of the angels whose souls empower his bow) is brought\
  \ to Nirvana, washed clean there, and then buried while intoning each dead angel's\
  \ long-forgotten name."
