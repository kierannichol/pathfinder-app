description: "Consecrated weapons may be of any type—swords, axes, masterwork, mithral,\
  \ and even magical—and function appropriately. When activated, the cleric charges\
  \ the weapon with positive or negative energy (as appropriate) so it deals extra\
  \ damage when it hits a target. This functions like the Channel Smite feat, except\
  \ the additional damage is equal to half the cleric's channel energy damage (the\
  \ target makes a Will save as normal, based on the cleric's channel energy DC).\
  \ The weapon remains charged with this energy until it successfully strikes a creature\
  \ or 24 hours pass, whichever comes first. Creatures other than the cleric are able\
  \ to use the charged weapon and this ability."
