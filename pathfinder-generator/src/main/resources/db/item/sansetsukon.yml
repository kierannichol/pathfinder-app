description: "Also called a three-section staff, this weapon is divided into three\
  \ 2-footlong segments chained together, allowing the wielder greater flexibility\
  \ than a normal staff and allowing the weapon to be swung rapidly to create a defensive\
  \ block, wrap and catch weapons, or harness momentum via a whipping motion for powerful\
  \ strikes."
