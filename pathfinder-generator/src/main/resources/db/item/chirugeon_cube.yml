description: "This 1-inch steel cube bears a variety of unique, intricate carvings\
  \ upon each face. On command, the cube sprouts wings and arms and becomes a Diminutive-sized,\
  \ cube-shaped mechanical construct (treat as a thrush with hardness 10). The creature\
  \ obeys and serves whoever activated the cube. It understands Common but cannot\
  \ speak. The chirurgeon cube is skilled at healing constructs. As a standard action,\
  \ the cube can use the magnets and small hooks embedded on its underside to attach\
  \ itself to a construct and quickly stitch together any torn and broken pieces.\
  \ This provides the construct with fast healing 2 for as long as the chirurgeon\
  \ cube remains in contact with it. A chirurgeon cube can be activated for up to\
  \ 10 minutes each day, spent in 1-minute increments. If the chirurgeon cube is broken\
  \ or destroyed in either form, it is forever ruined."
