description: "By sitting on the throne of blasphemy and intoning profane blasphemies\
  \ (a full-round action) with hands soaked in the blood of a good-aligned sentient\
  \ being, a creature gains the ability to poison the minds of those nearby for 24\
  \ hours. Every round the seated creature speaks (a standard action), all creatures\
  \ with Intelligence scores of 3 or higher within 100 feet must succeed at a Will\
  \ save or be compelled to listen, becoming vulnerable to its blasphemies. The save\
  \ DC is equal to 10 + the seated creature's Charisma modifier + 1/2 its Hit Dice.\
  \ Deafened creatures, or those immune to sonic mind-affecting effects, are not considered\
  \ to be listening.\nThe seated creature can then use its speech to affect listeners\
  \ as if by the following spells: confusion (as a 4th-level spell), crushing despair\
  \ (as a 4th-level spell), enthrall, modify memory, or suggestion (as a 3rd-level\
  \ spell). The seated creature can affect multiple victims with different spell effects\
  \ in the same round. The DC to resist these spells is equal to the original DC from\
  \ above + the mimicked spell's level. Victims still receive saving throws against\
  \ these effects, but if they fail their saves, they are not aware that the throne\
  \ is working its power on them.\nAny victim that succeeds at its saving throw against\
  \ a particular spell effect is immune to that effect for the next 24 hours. However,\
  \ it can still be affected by the throne's other spell effects. These are sonic\
  \ mind-affecting effects.\nA creature that gains the power to poison other creatures'\
  \ minds from the throne maintains this ability for 24 hours even if it moves off\
  \ the throne. If another creature sits on the throne and gains this power, any other\
  \ creature that gained the ability this way immediately loses it.\nThe throne imposes\
  \ 2 permanent negative levels on nonevil creatures that sit upon it and use its\
  \ blasphemous power."
destruction: "The throne of blasphemy is destroyed if a lawful evil creature is killed\
  \ upon it and then magic circle against evil is cast upon the throne."
