description: "One of the oldest known dwarven ales, longbeard lambic is fermented\
  \ with wild airborne yeasts and cultures, especially those that proliferate in the\
  \ dank caves where it has been brewed since long before the Quest for Sky began.\
  \ Longbeard lambic has a bracing effect that shocks the system. If the drinker is\
  \ fatigued, shaken, or staggered, she can ignore these conditions for 1d4 rounds\
  \ after imbibing longbeard lambic. In addition, a dose of longbeard lambic can reduce\
  \ the exhausted condition to fatigued or the frightened condition to shaken (drinker's\
  \ choice) for the same duration. If you consume a second longbeard lambic within\
  \ 1 minute of the previous dose, you must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be\
  \ nauseated for 1d4 rounds. The DC increases by 5 for each dose imbibed within the\
  \ same time span. Dwarves gain a +5 racial bonus on this saving throw."
