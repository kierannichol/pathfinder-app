description: "Alternating diamonds and rubies stud this band of white gold. A minor\
  \ ring of fortitude reduces ability damage or temporary ability penalties the wearer\
  \ takes by 2 points and ability drain by 1 point. If an effect targets multiple\
  \ ability scores (for example, exhaustion, fatigue, or touch of idiocy), the ring\
  \ reduces the damage, drain, or penalty for all ability scores.\nA major ring of\
  \ inner fortitude reduces ability damage or temporary penalties by 4 points and\
  \ reduces ability drain by 2 points.\nA greater ring of inner fortitude reduces\
  \ ability damage or temporary penalties by 6 points and reduces ability drain by\
  \ 3 points.\nWearing a ring of inner fortitude ring does not make the wearer immune\
  \ to conditions such as fatigued or exhausted even if the wearer ignores all ability\
  \ damage, drain, or penalties from the condition. If the ring prevents any damage,\
  \ drain, or penalty that are associated with a beneficial effect, it also negates\
  \ the beneficial effect."
