description: "This odd weapon is a 2-foot rod topped with four blunt claws. Squeezing\
  \ the handle causes the claws to close. You can use the gnome pincher to attempt\
  \ a disarm or steal combat maneuver with a +2 bonus. You can transfer an object\
  \ from the pincher to your free hand as a free action. Gnomes treat pinchers as\
  \ martial weapons."
