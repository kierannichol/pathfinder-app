description: "Consecrated to one of Golarion's many deities, this intricately etched\
  \ case contains numerous candles, stands, scented herbs, dishes, silks, small cups,\
  \ containers, and similar ceremonial tools all bearing colors and iconography sacred\
  \ to the associated deity. The sturdy container features a padded interior with\
  \ numerous straps and compartments so that the items within aren't damaged in transport.\
  \ The altar's surface prominently features a deity's holy symbol, and it's sturdy\
  \ enough that it can support up to 300 pounds of weight, enough to serve as a makeshift\
  \ pulpit.\nAmong the items found within the altar are the tools and materials necessary\
  \ to perform not just ceremonies, but also jobs and professions the related deity\
  \ deems sacred, as well as holy texts written to inspire greatness in the deity's\
  \ followers. The user can expend some of the materials within the altar to gain\
  \ a +2 circumstance bonus on the next Craft check of the specified type (see below).\n\
  In addition, after spending 1 hour praying and reading the holy scriptures within\
  \ the altar, the user gains a +2 circumstance bonus on a single skill check. Which\
  \ deity this altar is dedicated to determines the skill to which this bonus applies\
  \ (see below). The user must attempt this skill check within an hour of praying\
  \ and reading the altar's scriptures or lose the bonus—the mantras and inspiration\
  \ provided by the texts having drifted from her mind. This hour of prayer and scripture\
  \ reading can be integrated with the time a cleric uses to prepare her spells. Regardless,\
  \ using the masterwork portable altar in this manner expends the altar's materials\
  \ in the same way that using the normal altar to bolster a Craft check does.\nA\
  \ masterwork portable altar can be used multiple times, but after 20 uses, it must\
  \ be restocked with 50 gp worth of sanctified materials—preferably purchased from\
  \ a temple of the associated deity. The altar grants no bonuses on skill checks\
  \ if used while its materials are depleted, though it can still be employed as a\
  \ normal portable altar."
