description: "This hefty +1 warhammer is crafted to resemble a dwarven face and is\
  \ decorated with lavish gems. By speaking a command word, the wielder can transform\
  \ the Forgefather's sledge into a blacksmithing hammer of any size suitable for\
  \ the wielder's size and strength or back into its weapon form. The weapon grants\
  \ the wielder fire resistance 1. If the wielder places the Forgefather's sledge\
  \ in a Small or larger fire (such as a campfire, forge, or woodburning stove) for\
  \ at least 1 minute, the hammer's head glows bright red from the heat for 1d4 minutes,\
  \ though the handle remains cool to the touch. If used in combat during this time,\
  \ the hammer deals 1 point of fire damage to creatures struck in addition to the\
  \ regular damage dealt."
