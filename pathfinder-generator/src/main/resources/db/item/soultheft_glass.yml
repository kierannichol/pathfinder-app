description: "The wielder of this hand-sized, fine glass mirror can view another's\
  \ reflection in the mirror to capture a portion of that creature's soul. Doing so\
  \ requires the wielder to avert his eyes as if defending against a gaze attack (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Bestiary 300) so that he views the creature only by its reflection, and then\
  \ take a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. This imposes 1\
  \ temporary negative level on the creature reflected (Fortitude DC 16 negates).\
  \ A soultheft glass can hold no more than three portions of a creature's soul, and\
  \ can't contain portions from more than one creature's soul at a time. When the\
  \ glass is at full capacity, attempts to steal additional soul portions fail. While\
  \ the mirror retains at least one soul portion, its possessor receives a +1 luck\
  \ bonus on ability checks, saving throws, and skill checks.\nThe wielder can query\
  \ the soul portions trapped within, in effect questioning echoed memories of the\
  \ target creature. This works as call spirit, except the creature doesn't need to\
  \ be dead. The wielder can ask a number of questions per day equal to the number\
  \ of soul portions in the glass.\nTemporary negative levels bestowed by a soultheft\
  \ glass never become permanent. The victim can attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save to\
  \ remove each negative level every 24 hours. Success removes that negative level\
  \ and frees one soul portion held within the glass. Any other method of removing\
  \ a negative level (such as restoration) also frees a soul portion from the glass.\n\
  Once it imposes a temporary negative level on a creature, a soultheft glass shows\
  \ a ghostly reflection of that creature (though not any information about its surroundings)\
  \ until all soul portions have been returned. If the victim dies, its soul portions\
  \ fade after 24 hours. As a standard action, the mirror's wielder can release all\
  \ soul portions, which also removes the victim's negative levels."
