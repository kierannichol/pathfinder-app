description: "Devised by Her Infernal Majestrix, Abrogail I, this +3 studded leather\
  \ armor is lavishly adorned with a bound swarm of hellwasps. Once ranking among\
  \ the most spectacular pieces of clothing in Cheliax, the discomfort caused by during\
  \ the creation of this corset is as legendary as the protection it offers.\nThe\
  \ wasps bound to the corset prevent the first 20 points of damage you take each\
  \ day (resetting at midnight). Once the wasps have prevented 20 points of damage\
  \ for the day, they angrily animate and swarm around you, and you must make a DC\
  \ 18 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. After 1 round of activity, the\
  \ swarm then returns to the corset and goes dormant, and this ability to prevent\
  \ damage does not function until it recovers at midnight.\nThe swarm cannot be targeted\
  \ separately from the armor and cannot be killed unless the armor is destroyed (not\
  \ just broken)."
