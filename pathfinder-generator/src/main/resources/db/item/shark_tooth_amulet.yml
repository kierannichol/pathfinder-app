description: "This amulet is crafted of a single massive petrified shark tooth suspended\
  \ on kelp twine and grants its wearer combat potency while underwater. While wearing\
  \ this amulet, its wearer can use melee weapons normally, taking no penalty to attack\
  \ and dealing full damage with such attacks. This amulet also allows the wearer\
  \ to make thrown range weapon attacks underwater, though such attacks take a –2\
  \ penalty on attack rolls and their range increment is halved."
