description: "Traders crossing Casmaron's Grass Sea often carry a small, eagle-shaped\
  \ caravan guardian with them on their journeys. These wooden statuettes serve as\
  \ watchful guardians, alerting travelers when there is danger and summoning an eagle\
  \ ally to fight the threat. Each day, the guardian's wielder must designate up to\
  \ five allies, including himself, to be alerted of an intruder's presence. When\
  \ a creature approaches within 20 feet of an unattended caravan guardian (or its\
  \ wielder, if a creature has the guardian on their person), that creature must speak\
  \ the command word within 1 round or an eagle appears in a space next to the statue\
  \ and attacks whatever creature triggered it. Additionally, the caravan guardian\
  \ sends all designated creatures a mental warning, as per the mental alarm use of\
  \ the alarm spell (if the guardian's wielder did not designate allies to be alerted\
  \ that day, the item alerts the most recently designated allies). If there is no\
  \ appropriate space for the eagle to be summoned into, it does not appear, but the\
  \ caravan guardian still sends a mental alarm. A caravan guardian can summon only\
  \ one eagle per day."
