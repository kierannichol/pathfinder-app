description: "The crown of an infamous undead tyrant, the Horns of Naraga are a symbol\
  \ of dominance over death. When worn by an undead creature, the Horns of Naraga\
  \ reduce all damage taken from positive energy by half. In addition, whenever the\
  \ wearer touches a living creature while wearing this helm (even if the touch is\
  \ part of casting a spell or another touch attack), the touch deals an additional\
  \ 5d6 points of negative energy damage and the wearer gains these hit points, just\
  \ as if he had cast vampiric touch. The wearer of the helm is immune to acid and\
  \ can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, even that created by magic. Once per\
  \ day on command, the helm can be ordered to transform into an ancient black dragon\
  \ that unquestioningly obeys the creature that summoned it for 1 hour before reverting\
  \ to a helm. Slaying the dragon does not destroy the helm, but it does prevent this\
  \ ability from being used for 1 week. While the helm is in dragon form, the helm's\
  \ owner does not receive any of the helm's other benefits."
destruction: "The helm can be destroyed by crushing it between the jaws of an ancient\
  \ black dragon's skull in the middle of a desert with the sun at its zenith."
