description: "When this plain leather badge is sewn onto a summoner's armor or clothing,\
  \ a faded image of his summoner rune appears on its surface. The summoner can add\
  \ charges to the badge by expending summoner spells slots; the badge gains charges\
  \ equal to the spell level of the slot expended (maximum 5 charges). Adding charges\
  \ to the badge is a standard action (regardless of the spell level expended). When\
  \ the summoner uses his life link ability, instead of sacrificing his own hit points,\
  \ he may expend charges from the badge to heal the eidolon 1d6 hit points per charge.\
  \ The summoner does not have to decide how many charges are spent beforehand (he\
  \ may expend one charge, roll, and decide whether or not to spend more charges for\
  \ more healing). All charges in the badge are lost when the summoner readies spells\
  \ after resting."
