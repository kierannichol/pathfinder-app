description: "The so-called Invidious Halberd was intended to epitomize a sort of\
  \ balance to the other six Alara'quin —Emperor Xin sought to infuse this weapon\
  \ with potent abilities to negate powerful works of magic and saw its bearer as\
  \ a potential champion of the regulation of power. Yet when the first to carry the\
  \ weapon, Runelord Naaft, fell to the same corruption and sin that consumed the\
  \ other six runelords, Xin soon realized the naive folly of his hopes. Over the\
  \ years, as the weapon passed from one runelord's hands to the next's, the Invidious\
  \ Halberd's self-loathing and hatred of arcane spellcasters only grew. It only grudgingly\
  \ abided its runelord wielders, accepting them as its proper bearers but never fully\
  \ appreciating their skills. The halberd itself is truly happy only when it is used\
  \ to cut down those who can cast arcane spells—particularly if such targets are\
  \ wizards. Its knack for consuming magic and leaving magic-wielding foes baffled\
  \ and befuddled quickly earned its users an additional level of scorn and perhaps\
  \ a sliver of fear of the halberd itself. Of course, for the Runelords of Envy,\
  \ this only heightened their feelings of jealousy.\nThis weapon is an intelligent\
  \ +2 dispelling burst keen spell-storing mithral halberd. When Belimarius's Invidious\
  \ Halberd strikes a creature capable of casting arcane spells, the creature struck\
  \ must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or the halberd drains one spell of 3rd level\
  \ or less, storing that spell in its spell-storing ability (or if the drained spell\
  \ is dispel magic, in its dispelling burst ability). The halberd picks which spell\
  \ is stored, but otherwise this ability functions as if the creature struck had\
  \ used the weapon's spell-storing ability to store a spell of the halberd's choice,\
  \ losing that preparation of the spell (or a spell slot associated with it) in the\
  \ process. It cannot use this ability if it already has a spell stored. On a critical\
  \ hit against an arcane spellcaster, Belimarius's Invidious Halberd also casts feeblemind\
  \ (DC 17) on the creature struck after it drains a spell."
destruction: "Belimarius's Invidious Halberd is destroyed if it is hurled under the\
  \ crushing feet of the Oliphaunt of Jandelay, but only if there is no current Runelord\
  \ of Envy living in the world."
