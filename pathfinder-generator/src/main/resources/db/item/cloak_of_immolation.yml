description: "This cloak appears to be a finely made garment that radiates protective\
  \ magic. The cloak can be handled or examined without harm, but when it is put on,\
  \ it immediately bursts into flames that burn continuously but do not harm the cloak,\
  \ only its wearer. The cloak deals 1d6 points of fire damage each round and cannot\
  \ be removed unless the curse is broken. Sufficient amounts of water or other smothering\
  \ materials can douse the flames temporarily, but the cloak reignites when exposed\
  \ to air again. Spells like resist energy, protection from energy, and similar effects\
  \ can protect the wearer against the cloak's flames while they last."
