description: "When this unguent—prepared with vile alchemical reagents and the gore\
  \ of fiends—is applied to a wounded tiefling or evil outsider (not currently at\
  \ maximum hit points), it momentarily transforms the essence of the target into\
  \ something even more fearsome and demonic. While under the effects of a fiendgore\
  \ unguent, a tiefling or an evil outsider gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate\
  \ checks and a +1 circumstance bonus to the DC of all spells with the fear descriptor\
  \ that they cast. Applying the unguent is a delicate process, requiring a full-round\
  \ action, and can only be properly applied to a willing or helpless creature. If\
  \ applied to a creature other than a tiefling or an evil outsider, it sickens the\
  \ creature instead. The unguent's effects (either beneficial or harmful) last for\
  \ 1 minute."
