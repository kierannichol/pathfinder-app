description: "This ashen powder can be thrown as a splash weapon, muffling all sound\
  \ within a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on the point of impact. Perception checks\
  \ to notice sound emanating from or passing through the cloud take a â€“10 penalty.\
  \ Alternatively, applying a dose of silence dust to your feet as a standard action\
  \ grants you a +5 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks to avoid being heard while\
  \ walking. The dust is effective for 1 minute before it disperses."
