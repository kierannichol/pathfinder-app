description: "This gourd has been hollowed out and carved with the symbol of a good-aligned\
  \ deity. It sheds light as a candle. If the gourd is smashed onto the ground, the\
  \ 40-foot-radius area around the crushed gourd is affected as if by hallow with\
  \ a remove fear spell fixed to it. This magic item is often crafted from a pumpkin,\
  \ though other types of gourds, or even large turnips, can be used."
