description: "This shield is made of bone and ivory, but has been imbued with magic\
  \ to function as a +2 mithral heavy steel shield (though it is not considered to\
  \ be made of metal). The shield has stylized animal claws encircling its outer rim.\
  \ If the wearer is grappled, pinned, or swallowed whole, as a standard action he\
  \ can cause the claws to animate and make a single melee attack dealing 1d8 points\
  \ of damage + the wielder's Strength modifier (1d6 + his Strength modifier for a\
  \ Small wielder) without requiring a successful combat maneuver check to do so.\
  \ This is considered a weapon attack with a one-handed weapon the wielder is proficient\
  \ with, not a shield bash.\nAdditionally, the claws can animate to perform the somatic\
  \ components of a spell as long as the arm holding the shield would be able to provide\
  \ these components if it weren't carrying a shield. As a result, the shield has\
  \ no arcane spell failure chance."
