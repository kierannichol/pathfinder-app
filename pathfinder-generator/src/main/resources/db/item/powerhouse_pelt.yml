  \ such as bending bars, and forcing doors. This bonus doesn't apply on any other\
  \ Strength-related rolls (including Strength-based skill checks and melee attack\
  \ and damage rolls). The wearer also treats her Strength score as if it were 8 higher\
  \ than normal for the purpose of determining her carrying capacity."
