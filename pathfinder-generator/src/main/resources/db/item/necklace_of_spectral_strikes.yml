description: "When worn, this silver-and-turquoise necklace melds with the skin, turning\
  \ into an intricately patterned tattoo on the wearer's chest. It ignores any wearer\
  \ with an Intelligence score lower than 3, failing to meld or function. The necklace\
  \ can be removed as a full-round action by concentrating on the tattoo to call the\
  \ necklace back into existence. While in tattoo form, the amulet grants a +1 bonus\
  \ on attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes (but not natural weapons) and\
  \ provides the benefits of the ghost touch weapon special ability on unarmed strikes.\
  \ As a swift action, the wearer can spend a ki point to make one unarmed strike-whether\
  \ as a single attack or part of a full attack-an incorporeal touch attack.\nAs an\
  \ immediate action, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to become incorporeal\
  \ for 1 round. This lasts until either just before his next turn (if used during\
  \ his turn) or at the end of his next turn (if used outside his turn). While incorporeal,\
  \ the wearer has no Strength score, so his Dexterity modifier applies to his melee\
  \ attacks, ranged attacks, and combat maneuver checks. Since the necklace provides\
  \ the ghost touch ability, the wearer can make unarmed strikes against corporeal\
  \ creatures while incorporeal. The wearer can remain inside solid objects as long\
  \ as he continues expending mythic power to remain incorporeal. If he fails to do\
  \ so, he materializes inside the object and instantly dies."
