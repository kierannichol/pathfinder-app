description: "This eldritch chart describes part of the unfathomably vast shape of\
  \ the physical universe and the subtler motions of the stars. A cosmogram grants\
  \ a +1 circumstance bonus on Knowledge (geography) checks relating to stars and\
  \ on Survival checks to navigate the void of space between star systems. A cosmogram\
  \ can be consulted while using an orrery (see below) as a focus for augury. Doing\
  \ so increases the chance of a successful reading by 2%."
