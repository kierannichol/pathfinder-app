description: "When lit, this foot-long wooden tube begins to hiss and emit puffs of\
  \ smoke. One round later it takes flight, moving in a straight line at a speed of\
  \ 90 feet for 1d6 rounds before exploding in a burst of thick, colorful smoke. Each\
  \ square the firework passes through during its flight fills with smoke (treat the\
  \ effect as a fog cloud spell, except a moderate or stronger wind dissipates the\
  \ smoke in 1 round), as does an area in a 15- foot radius surrounding the point\
  \ at which the rocket exploded. This smoke stings the eyes and inflames the lungs,\
  \ and a creature that begins its turn in a square filled with smoke must succeed\
  \ at a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or be sickened for 1d4 rounds."
