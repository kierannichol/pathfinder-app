description: "This plain mask is made of a reflective, dark gray ceramic. When worn,\
  \ the mask transforms to look like the wearer's skull, and it gradually becomes\
  \ eerier and more fearsome the closer a viewer gets to the wearer. Whenever a creature\
  \ enters a square adjacent to the wearer of Bax's mask, that creature must succeed\
  \ at a DC 13 Will save or become shaken for as long as it remains adjacent to the\
  \ wearer. An affected creature can attempt a new save by moving away from the wearer\
  \ and reentering a square adjacent to the wearer. A creature that succeeds at the\
  \ save is immune to the mask's effect for 24 hours. A creature shaken by Bax's mask\
  \ does not become frightened if affected by the mask again, but other fear effects\
  \ stack with the creature's shaken condition as normal."
