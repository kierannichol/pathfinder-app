description: "Shorter and thicker than most lances, this +3 lance has a full-sized\
  \ shield worked into the vamplate, though it is too heavy to count as a shield for\
  \ shield bash and similar maneuvers, and does not automatically grant the wielder\
  \ a shield bonus to AC. However, a war lance grants the wielder and her steed a\
  \ +2 shield bonus to AC when the wielder is mounted."
