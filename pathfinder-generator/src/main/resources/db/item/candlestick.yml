description: "This saucerlike object has a flat bottom, a handle, and a spike on top.\
  \ You can affix a candle onto the spike (up to 3 inches in diameter) and hold the\
  \ candlestick by the handle. The flat bottom means you're able to set it down and\
  \ not worry about the candle falling over and extinguishing itself. A typical candlestick\
  \ is crafted from baked clay or a cheap metal such as copper, but elaborate and\
  \ expensive ones exist."
