description: "This bottle is crafted from the darkest ebony. When opened and held\
  \ upright, faint whispers can be heard emanating from the bottle's mouth. The bottle\
  \ initially has 4 charges. When turned upside down, the bottle summons a shadow\
  \ to do the bidding of the user, draining 1 charge each round of service. As a standard\
  \ action, the bearer may dismiss the summoned shadow. If the shadow kills a humanoid\
  \ creature of at least 4 HD, the bottle gains 1 charge. The bottle is automatically\
  \ restored to 4 charges at sundown."
