description: "This rapier like weapon has a thicker blade than normal, which is shaped\
  \ into a corkscrewing spiral of sharpened edges. These edges can catch enemy weapons,\
  \ making it ideal for disarming or parrying. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat\
  \ to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls\
  \ with a spiral rapier sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon. You can't\
  \ wield a spiral rapier in two hands in order to apply 1-1/2 times your Strength\
  \ modifier to its damage. Any effects that apply to rapiers also apply to a spiral\
  \ rapier."
