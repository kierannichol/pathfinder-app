name: "Potion of Litany of Righteousness"
description: "Calling down a litany of anathema, you make an evil more susceptible\
  \ to the attacks of good creatures. If the target is evil, it takes double damage\
  \ from attacks made by creatures with a good aura (from a class feature or as a\
  \ creature with the good subtype). If the target also has the evil subtype; when\
  \ it is hit with attacks made by creatures with a good aura, it is also dazzled\
  \ for 1d4 rounds. If this spell targets a nonevil creature (or one that lacks the\
  \ evil subtype), it has no effect, and the spell is wasted."
