description: "This curio is a four-leaf clover that was harvested from the wild and\
  \ preserved. Typically encased in glass or crystal, four-leaf clovers are sometimes\
  \ pressed, bronzed, or protected through other means. A creature with a four-leaf\
  \ clover in her possession can call upon an extra boost of luck before attempting\
  \ a single ability check, saving throw, or skill check. She gains a +2 luck bonus\
  \ on that check. This ability functions three times per day, and requires a free\
  \ action that the owner can perform even when it's not her turn."
