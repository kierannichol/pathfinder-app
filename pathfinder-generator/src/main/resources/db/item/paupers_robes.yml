description: "Dirt and grime from city streets cling to these dirty brown robes, covering\
  \ them in an ever-present film of filth. A set of pauper's robes surrounds its wearer\
  \ in mystery, making it difficult for creatures to remember details about him. Creatures\
  \ that attempt to remember details of their interactions with the wearer of a set\
  \ of pauper's robes must make a successful Will save to do so: recalling general\
  \ details about the wearer (such as gender or race) requires a successful DC 13\
  \ Will save, and recalling more specific information (such as name, distinguishing\
  \ features, or mannerisms) requires a successful DC 16 Will save. If the wearer\
  \ of the robes takes any action that counts as an attack (as defined by the invisibility\
  \ spell), creatures witnessing that action are immune to the memory-fogging influence\
  \ of the pauper's robes for all interactions with the wearer over the next 24 hours.\n\
  As a standard action, the wearer of a set of pauper's robes can cause the garment\
  \ to tarnish and dirty any valuables he carries, making jewelry appear to be little\
  \ more than beads and twine or a magical sword look rusted and dull. Anyone who\
  \ examines or interacts with such an object can see through the guise with a successful\
  \ DC 13 Will save. This effect ends immediately once the object leaves the wearer's\
  \ possession."
