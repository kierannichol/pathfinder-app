description: "This +1 slick leather armor is made of shining, slippery eelskin that\
  \ allows the wearer to move with deadly grace and sudden swiftness, especially underwater.\
  \ When immersed in water, enchanted eelskin gains the shadow property and grants\
  \ the wearer a swim speed of 30 feet and the ability to breathe water. In addition,\
  \ during a surprise round the wearer can act as if she had a full round of actions,\
  \ rather than a single standard action, as long as those actions do not require\
  \ leaving the water. If she does leave the water, her surprise round turn immediately\
  \ ends."
