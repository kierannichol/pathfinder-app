description: "When you cast this eerie spell upon a recently slain creature, you cause\
  \ a ghastly, spectral image of it to rise up from its corpse, shrieking for vengeance\
  \ before it vanishes in a burst of unnatural light. This phantom then unerringly\
  \ seeks out the creature that killed it, as long as that creature is on the same\
  \ plane, and tries to slay its killer in turn."
