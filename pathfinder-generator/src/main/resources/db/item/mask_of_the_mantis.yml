description: "A mask of the mantis is the traditional headgear of the Red Mantis assassinâ€”\
  a magical helm that evokes the eerie visage of a praying mantis. Designed both to\
  \ mask the wearer's identity while on a job and to enhance the wearer's ferocious\
  \ appearance, a mask of the mantis has 3 daily charges that can be used to gain\
  \ additional bonuses. The wearer can spend a charge to gain darkvision to a range\
  \ of 60 feet, the effects of see invisibility, the effects of deathwatch, or a +5\
  \ competence bonus on Perception checks. Once a charge is spent, the effect granted\
  \ persists for 30 minutes before fading. Multiple effects can be active simultaneously.\
  \ Charges expended from the mask replenish automatically in 24 hours."
