description: "This elbow-length scaled metal gauntlet flares at the wrist like a cobra's\
  \ hood. Up to three times per day, the wearer way transform the gauntlet into an\
  \ iron cobra (Bestiary 182), which crawls from the wearer's wrist and obeys his\
  \ commands, leaving behind a simple bracelet of linked scales. Whoever wears the\
  \ bracelet is the iron cobra's master. The iron cobra can remain animated for a\
  \ total of 1 hour per day.\nIf the snake is within hearing range of the master and\
  \ commanded to revert to gauntlet form (a standard action), it travels to its master\
  \ as fast as possible, crawls onto its master's arm, and as a free action reverts\
  \ to its inactive shape. If the snake's duration expires before it can reach its\
  \ master, it reverts to gauntlet form, but automatically melds with the bracelet\
  \ if the two touch.\nIf slain in cobra form, the snake reverts to gauntlet form\
  \ and cannot be used again for 24 hours. If destroyed in gauntlet form, the item\
  \ is destroyed. The wearer can refill the iron cobra's poison reservoir in snake\
  \ form or gauntlet form."
