description: "Inside this crystalline bottle swirls a smoky orange liquid that hisses\
  \ when uncorked. As a standard action, a creature that drinks this elixir can breathe\
  \ out a 15-foot cone of fiery teeth. This blast deals 2d4 points of fire damage,\
  \ 2d4 points of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and 1d4 points of bleed\
  \ damage. Creatures in the area can each attempt a DC 13 Reflex save for half damage.\
  \ The magic of the elixir ends after 1 hour or one use, whichever comes first."
