description: "This 3-foot-long strip of extremely thin hide can be cut into different\
  \ lengths. When moistened and applied across surfaces or between objects, it creates\
  \ a bond requiring a DC 15 Strength check to pull apart. Once applied, an adhesive\
  \ strip takes 1 minute to set. If applied to an item with the broken condition,\
  \ it suppresses the effects of that broken condition for as long as the item remains\
  \ repaired by the stripâ€”though the item does not regain hit points and is still\
  \ broken. The uses for an adhesive strip are many; it can be used to bind prisoners,\
  \ mend clothing, patch holes, and so on."
