description: "This grotesque, amulet-like shrunken head is said to contain the enslaved\
  \ soul of its former owner. Forced to obey whomever carries it, once per day a soulspeaker\
  \ can repeat a message as if the spell magic mouth were cast upon it. The owner\
  \ must merely hold the 6-inch-in-diameter head and speak his message and the conditions\
  \ under which the soulspeaker should repeat it. While it carries a message, the\
  \ eyes of the stitched head stretch open, closing as soon as its message has been\
  \ delivered."
