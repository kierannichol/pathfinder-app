description: "This rich yellow ink reacts with a creature's body heat to create a\
  \ flickering, flamelike glow. It takes 10 minutes to apply fire ink, and 1 dose\
  \ covers an approximately hand-sized area. Once applied, the ink glows as a candle\
  \ for 24 hours. Four or more doses applied to the same part of the body glow as\
  \ a torch for 24 hours. The alchemical reaction of the ink to the target's skin\
  \ and body heat is painful and irritating, giving the target the sickened condition\
  \ while the glow lasts. A DC 15 Heal check can temporarily soothe these sensations,\
  \ negating the sickened condition for 1 hour. Creatures immune or resistant to fire\
  \ are immune to this sickening effect. Ifrits are especially known for their fondness\
  \ for fire ink, and ifrit fire-dancers often decorate their skin with flaming designs\
  \ before performing. A concentrated version of the ink costs 10 times as much and\
  \ can be used to make permanently glowing tattoos."
