description: "A wooden stopper depicting an animal or human head seals this limestone\
  \ jar. Any creature that opens the jar takes 3d6 points of Constitution damage as\
  \ several of its internal organs vanish from its body and appear inside the jar.\
  \ If the creature survives, the resulting trauma deals 2d6 points of bleed damage\
  \ every round. This bleed damage lasts until the victim receives at least 5 points\
  \ of magical healing or benefits from a DC 20 Heal check. A carnivorous jar functions\
  \ only once, and can be found alone or in sets of four."
