name: "Scroll of Glide"
description: "You take no damage from falls (as if from feather fall). In addition,\
  \ you can move up to 5 feet in any horizontal direction for every 1 foot you fall,\
  \ at a speed of 60 feet per round. You cannot use this spell to actually gain height,\
  \ merely coast in other directions as you fall. If subjected to a strong wind or\
  \ any other effect that causes you to rise you can take advantage of it in order\
  \ to increase the distance you can glide. The spell ends as soon as your feet touch\
  \ the ground regardless of its remaining duration. If the spell expires while you\
  \ are still in the air you fall the remaining distance as normal."
