description: "The Praenomen is a two-part amulet, comprising an oval plate that covers\
  \ the wearer's chest and a counterweight that hangs down the wearer's back, joined\
  \ by chains. The front plate is inscribed with the cartouche of the pharaoh who\
  \ is the Praenomen's master; the counterweight is shaped like a cobra to honor Wadjet,\
  \ protector of Osirion and Osirion's pharaohs. The Praenomen was traditionally worn\
  \ by a pharaoh's royal envoy to signify that the envoy acted in the pharaoh's name\
  \ and was under her protection. It grants its benefits only to loyal subjects of\
  \ its masterâ€”the pharaoh whose cartouche is inscribed upon it.\nThe Praenomen grants\
  \ its wearer a +4 bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks. Once per day, the wearer\
  \ can impose a geas on another creature, compelling the target to undertake a mission\
  \ for the Praenomen's master. The Praenomen also shields its wearer and other faithful\
  \ subjects of the pharaoh from the pharaoh's enemies. Its wearer gains a +2 deflection\
  \ bonus to Armor Class, and three times per day, the wearer can activate the Praenomen\
  \ to grant the benefits of heroism to all loyal subjects of its master within 30\
  \ feet.\nThe Praenomen can be rededicated to a new master by replacing the front\
  \ plate and engraving the name of its new master on the cartouche, requiring a successful\
  \ DC 21 Craft (jewelry) check."
