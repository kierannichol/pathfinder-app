description: "This black velvet eye patch is attached to an onyx chain that is worn\
  \ around the head. The eye patch grants its wearer darkvision with a range of 60\
  \ feet. Additionally, as a standard action, the wearer can speak the eye patch's\
  \ command word to see through powerful magical darkness, such as an area of deeper\
  \ darkness, for up to 11 minutes per day. This duration need not be used all at\
  \ once, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. Ending this effect is a free\
  \ action."
