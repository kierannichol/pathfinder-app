description: "This cube is activated or deactivated by pressing one side. When activated,\
  \ it creates a cube-shaped area 10 feet on a side centered on the possessor (or\
  \ on the cube itself, if the item is later placed on a surface). The temperature\
  \ within this area is always at least 65Â° F. The field absorbs all cold-based attacks.\
  \ However, if the field is subjected to more than 50 points of cold damage in 1\
  \ round (from one or multiple attacks), it collapses and cannot be reactivated for\
  \ 1 hour. If the field absorbs more than 100 points of cold damage in a 10-round\
  \ period, the cube is destroyed."
