description: "A detailed bronze figurine of a crowned honeybee adorns this iron choker.\
  \ The first chokers of this type were created by a cabal of gnome priests of the\
  \ Eldest from the Abendego Coast, who believed pain could forestall the bleaching.\n\
  When this choker is placed on a living creature's neck, the bee springs to life\
  \ and latches itself to the wearer, embeds its stinger deep into her neck, and fills\
  \ the wearer's throat with swarming bees. Although it produces a disconcerting feeling,\
  \ this sting and the bees do no harm to the wearer other than to give her voice\
  \ an aggressive buzzing quality that grants her a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate\
  \ checks.\nOnce per day as a standard action, the wearer can swallow some of the\
  \ bees in her throat as a swift action, which coats her throat in soothing, golden\
  \ honey. For the next hour, her voice sounds silken and smooth, and she gains a\
  \ +2 competence bonus on Diplomacy checks rather than on Intimidate checks.\nFinally,\
  \ the wearer can release the entire swarm as a standard action once per day. When\
  \ she does so, she exhales a 15-foot cone of angry bees from her mouth. Those caught\
  \ in the cone take 4d6 points of piercing damage and are staggered by the painful\
  \ stings for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 16 Reflex saving throw halves the damage\
  \ inflicted and negates the staggered condition."
