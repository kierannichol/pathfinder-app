name: "Scroll of Shadowbard"
description: "You conjure up a quasi-real phantom singer that is visible as a shifting,\
  \ shadowy duplicate of yourself. The singer follows you automatically, moving as\
  \ you move even if you teleport. The singer cannot be damaged, but can be dispelled.\
  \ When a shadowbardcomes into being, it immediately begins a bardic performance\
  \ of your choice--it has access to all of the bardic performances that you do. It\
  \ continues that bardic performance until you direct it as a move action to switch\
  \ to a different performance. Rounds spent by a shadowbardcreating a bardic performance\
  \ do not decrease the number of rounds you can use your own bardic performance,\
  \ nor can a shadowbard'sbardic performance be used to trigger spells that require\
  \ you to begin or cease a bardic performance."
