description: "In outer construction and manner of play, pipes of shifting tempo resemble\
  \ a typical set of unremarkable pan pipes, but the complex chambers within the pipes\
  \ are modeled after difficult-to-duplicate Azlanti instruments. Music created by\
  \ these pipes sounds unusually mournful, with a strange, almost warbling subtext\
  \ to the notes. Up to three times per day, a user can attempt to harness these pipes'\
  \ power by making a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check as a standard action.\
  \ With a successful check, the possessor can play a grave melody to cast slow or\
  \ an allegro melody to cast haste. The resulting spell functions as normal for the\
  \ item's caster level, affecting five creatures per casting."
