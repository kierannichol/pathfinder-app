description: "These rough leather gloves grant an enhancement bonus of +1 to +5 on\
  \ attack and damage rolls with improvised weapons. Alternatively, the gloves can\
  \ grant melee weapon special abilities, so long as they can be applied to melee\
  \ or thrown weapons (see pages 136– 137 of Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment for\
  \ a list of abilities). Special abilities count as additional bonuses for determining\
  \ the market value of the item, but do not modify attack or damage bonuses. Gloves\
  \ of improvised might cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special\
  \ ability bonus equivalents) higher than +5. Unlike an amulet of mighty fists, gloves\
  \ of improvised might must have a +1 enhancement bonus to grant a melee weapon special\
  \ ability.\nNormal weapons are unaffected by gloves of improvised might except when\
  \ used as an improvised weapon in a way specifically permitted by the weapon description,\
  \ such as using an arrow or bolt as a melee weapon (or if the user has an ability\
  \ that allows the use of normal weapons as improvised weapons). The wearer still\
  \ takes a –4 nonproficiency penalty on attack rolls with improvised weapons, as\
  \ normal, unless he has the Catch Off-Guard feat or a similar ability."
