description: "The Impossible Eye grants a number of potent powers of divination. In\
  \ order to activate any of these powers, the user must look into the mirror and\
  \ make a DC 20 Will save; failure indicates that the user becomes fascinated by\
  \ his reflection until an outside force breaks his gaze. Left alone, a fascinated\
  \ viewer doesn't eat, drink, move, or sleep, and eventually dies of thirst. If the\
  \ Will save is successful, the viewer can activate any of the mirror's powers as\
  \ a standard action.\n5/day: vision\n3/day: greater prying eyes, greater scrying\n\
  1/day: contact other plane, discern location, foresight\nThe Impossible Eye can\
  \ also be used to read any nonmagical language—any written message reflected in\
  \ the mirror appears in unmirrored text written in the holder's native tongue. The\
  \ mirror can be used to safely peruse the text of the Codex of Infinite Planes in\
  \ this manner."
destruction: "The Impossible Eye was crafted in a secret foundry somewhere in the\
  \ Plane of Fire—it may only be destroyed by returning it to this foundry and smashing\
  \ it against the oven in which its glass was created."
