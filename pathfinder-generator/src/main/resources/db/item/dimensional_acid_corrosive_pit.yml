  \ creating a temporary extradimensional pit wherever it touches. A flask of dimensional\
  \ acid can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Alternatively,\
  \ it can be used as a special component when casting the snare spell. Instead of\
  \ the spell's usual effect, the creature that triggers the modified snare is treated\
  \ as if it had taken a direct hit from the dimensional acid.\nDimensional acid comes\
  \ in a number of varieties.\nBasic Pit: This acid creates a pit, as the create pit\
  \ spell, where it lands. Faint conjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, create\
  \ pit.\nCorrosive Pit: This acid affects matter as well, creating an acid pit where\
  \ it lands. Faint conjuration; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, acid pit.\nJagged Pit:\

  \ 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, spiked pit.\nLiving Pit: This acid burns into a living\
