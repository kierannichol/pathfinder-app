description: "This sinister item functions much like a robe of useful items, but specifically\
  \ for the serious necromancer. It appears to be an unremarkable robe, but a character\
  \ who dons it notes that it is adorned with small embroidered figures representing\
  \ undead creatures. Only the wearer of the robe can see the embroidery, recognize\
  \ them as the creatures they become, and detach them. One figure can be detached\
  \ each round. Detaching a figure causes it to become an actual undead creature (see\
  \ the list below). The skeleton or zombie is not under the control of the wearer\
  \ of the robe, but may be subsequently commanded, rebuked, turned, or destroyed.\
  \ A newly created robe of bones always has two embroidered figures of each of the\
  \ following undead:"
