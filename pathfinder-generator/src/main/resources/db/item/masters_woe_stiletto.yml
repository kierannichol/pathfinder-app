description: "The black-lacquered handle of this slender blade is inlaid with the\
  \ image of a broken skull. A master's woe stiletto is a +1 living steel dagger that\
  \ allows its wielder to weaken a would-be necromancer's control over the undead.\
  \ Three times per day when the wielder successfully strikes a target with the stiletto,\
  \ the wielder can activate the stiletto as a free action to force the target to\
  \ attempt a DC 13 Will save. On a failure, the number of undead creatures the target\
  \ can control through spells like animate dead or feats like Command Undead is reduced\
  \ by 6 Hit Dice (to a minimum of 1 HD). Any excess undead become uncontrolled, but\
  \ their former controller may choose which creatures are released.\nThis effect\
  \ lasts for 3 hours and cannot be dispelled, though it can be removed by remove\
  \ curse, break enchantment, or similar effects. Any uncontrolled undead remain uncontrolled\
  \ when the effect ends."
