description: "The Aasen mortar is an indirect-fire advanced siege firearm, consisting\
  \ of a heavy steel barrel, a loading mechanism, and a folding bipod stand, and is\
  \ used to launch explosives to penetrate enemy defensive lines. Aiming the mortar\
  \ is part of the standard action required to fire it. Reloading the mortar is a\
  \ full-round action, and the user loads a grenade-like projectile into the breech\
  \ of the weapon's steel barrel, along with a blank rifle round that propels the\
  \ bomb when triggered. The weapon uses indirect fire to lob bombs in slow-moving,\
  \ high arcs, and the user targets a specific square. Rules for indirect-fire siege\
  \ weapons are found on page 160 of Ultimate Combat. Mortars can also be fired as\
  \ direct-fire siege engines. When used for direct fire, they take a â€“4 penalty on\
  \ attack rolls and their range increment is halved, but they do not have a minimum\
  \ range. After the point of impact is determined, the shell explodes and deals 6d6\
  \ points of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage to all creatures in a 30-foot\
  \ radius (Ref lex DC 20 for half). An Aasen mortar has hardness 10 and 35 hit points;\
  \ it fires special, finned fragmentation bombs that cost 10 gp each and weigh 4\
  \ pounds each. These bombs usually arrive on the battlefront in wooden cases containing\
  \ 6 mortars each."
