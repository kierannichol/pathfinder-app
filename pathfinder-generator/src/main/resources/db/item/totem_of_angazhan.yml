description: "Dangerous artifacts created by the demon lord Angazhan, several totems\
  \ of Angazhan lie hidden in the depths of the Mwangi Expanse. Each is an intelligent\
  \ artifact largely in control of itself. A totem radiates an aura that forces all\
  \ non-worshipers of Angazhan within 30 feet to make a successful DC 15 Will save\
  \ or become panicked for 1 round. This is a mindaffecting fear effect. A totem can\
  \ also make use of its own spell-like abilities as it pleases, frequently lashing\
  \ out with weird to attack. Its size and direct connection to Angazhan's power prevents\
  \ it from easily being used by other creatures. Any who would employ its powers\
  \ must touch the totem. Those who aren't chaotic evil worshipers of Angazhan must\
  \ also enter into a contest of wills with the totem to make use of its powers for\
  \ that day (see page 535 of the Core Rulebook). If a creature wins the contest,\
  \ that creature can direct the totem to use its abilities. Additionally, the creature\
  \ is immune to the totem's panic aura for 24 hours and the totem cannot use its\
  \ spell-like abilities against the creature for that day."
destruction: "A totem of Angazhan can be destroyed only by a Gorilla King (either\
  \ acting on his own volition or while under the effects of magical control), who\
  \ can damage the totem as if it were a normal item with hardness 8 and 100 hit points\
  \ (or by succeeding at a DC 30 Strength check to break the totem in half). Of course,\
  \ once a Gorilla King makes his first attack upon one of these totems, the blasphemy\
  \ against Angazhan causes that Gorilla King to no longer count as a worshiper of\
  \ Angazhan, and he can now be affected by the totem's panic aura. Worse, the affront\
  \ allows the totem of Angazhan to attempt once per round to revoke that Gorilla\
  \ King's reincarnated body. Each round the blasphemous Gorilla King remains within\
  \ reach of the totem's senses, the Gorilla King must make a successful DC 25 Fortitude\
  \ save to avoid being transformed back into whatever race the creature was before\
  \ he was reincarnated. Once this occurs, the target is no longer a Gorilla King\
  \ and can no longer damage the totem, but the totem can continue to use weird to\
  \ attempt to slay the creature as long as it is able."
