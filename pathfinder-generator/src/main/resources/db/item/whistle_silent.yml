description: "With a DC 5 Perform (wind instruments) check you can use a whistle to\
  \ signal the same sorts of situations as signal horns. A whistle's piercing report\
  \ can be clearly heard (Perception DC 0) up to a quarter-mile away. For each quarter-mile\
  \ beyond, Perception checks to hear a whistle suffer a –2 penalty.\nSilent whistles\
  \ that only animals and other creatures with keen hearing can hear also exist."
