description: "These short matching swords come in pairs, cleverly nested together\
  \ to appear as a single blade. Both weapons can be drawn at the same time, and they\
  \ can be separated as a free action and wielded in both hands to make wickedly effective\
  \ chops and slashes. Their thin, broad blades extend just 1 foot in length. A butterfly\
  \ sword has a hardwood grip covered with braided cord, and a metal D-shaped guard\
  \ to protect the wielder's hand. The listed price is for a pair of butterfly swords.\
  \ Masterwork butterfly swords cost 320 gp for the pair. If you add magical enhancement\
  \ bonuses or properties to a butterfly sword, treat each sword in the pair as a\
  \ separate weapon (for example, adding a +1 magical enhancement bonus to a pair\
  \ of masterwork butterfly swords costs 4,000 gp)."
