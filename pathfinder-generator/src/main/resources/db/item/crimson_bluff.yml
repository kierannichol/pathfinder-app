description: "With a blade crafted entirely out of black metal, this +2 speed sawtooth\
  \ sabre has only one hint of color: a red hilt. Once per day as a standard action,\
  \ the wielder of the blade can utter a prayer to the god Achaekek to create 1d4+3\
  \ illusory Red Mantis assassins that last for 1 hour. These illusions confound the\
  \ wielder's enemies, allowing the wielder to flank an enemy with an appropriately\
  \ positioned figment. The wielder can direct the movement of all figments as a single\
  \ swift action, moving each of them up to 30 feet. Any creature interacting with\
  \ (or being flanked by) an illusion can attempt a DC 16 Will save to disbelieve\
  \ the effect. If an illusory assassin is hit by an attack, it disappears. (Use the\
  \ wielder's touch AC as an illusion's AC.)\nThree times per day as an immediate\
  \ action, when the wielder of a crimson bluff is the target of an enemy's melee\
  \ attack, she can swap places with an illusory assassin that is adjacent to her."
