name: "Scroll of Forceful Hand"
description: "This spell functions as interposing hand, except that it can also pursue\
  \ and bull rush one opponent you select. The forceful hand gets one bull rush attack\
  \ per round. This attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Its CMB for\
  \ bull rush checks uses your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with\
  \ a +8 bonus for its Strength score (27), and a +1 bonus for being Large. The hand\
  \ always moves with the opponent to push them back as far as possible. It has no\
  \ movement limit for this purpose. Directing the spell to a new target is a move\
  \ action. Forceful hand prevents the opponent from moving closer to you without\
  \ first succeeding on a bull rush attack, moving both the forceful hand and the\
  \ target closer to you. The forceful hand can instead be directed to interpose itself,\
  \ as interposing hand does."
