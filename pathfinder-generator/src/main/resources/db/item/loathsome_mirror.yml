description: "This buckler-sized mirror magnifies flaws and faults, presenting the\
  \ least appealing image of any creature reflected in it. The mirror must be held\
  \ in one hand to function. As a standard action three times per day, the bearer\
  \ of the mirror can project a reflection onto the creature that produced it, making\
  \ them appear utterly loathsome to all onlookers. The subject must be within 30\
  \ feet of the mirror, and must be able to see the mirror to be affected. For the\
  \ next 5 rounds any creature attempting to target the subject with a beneficial\
  \ spell or effect must make a DC 14 Will save. On a failure, the creature must choose\
  \ a new subject for the spell or effect is wasted. Once a creature succeeds on this\
  \ saving throw, it can target the subject normally for the remainder of the mirror's\
  \ effect's duration."
