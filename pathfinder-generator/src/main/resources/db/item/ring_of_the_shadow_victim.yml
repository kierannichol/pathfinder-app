description: "This smooth, lusterless gray ring is crafted of dark glass and has the\
  \ image of a body carved into its band. Once per day, the wearer of this ring can\
  \ perform a complex mental and verbal ritual, repeatedly whispering the ring's command\
  \ word, while touching any humanoid corpse that has been dead for less than 1 week.\
  \ The creature must have had 7 Hit Dice or fewer in life. This ritual can be as\
  \ short as 1 round or could last up to 24 hours. It requires both total focus and\
  \ constant contact between the ring, the wearer, and the target corpse. Interruption\
  \ of any kind spoils the ritual, requiring the wearer to begin anew. The wearer\
  \ of the ring chooses how long this ritual will last, but that decision must be\
  \ made before she begins the ritual.\nOn the ritual's completion, an illusory duplicate\
  \ of the creature touched—partially real and formed of animate ice cloaked in magical\
  \ shadow—springs into existence. This functions as lesser simulacrum in all ways\
  \ unless stated otherwise. The wearer of this ring gains a +10 bonus on the Disguise\
  \ check when performing this ritual. The shadow creature appears in all ways to\
  \ be hearty and full of life, equipped with all of the gear and clothing that was\
  \ carried or worn by the corpse throughout the ritual. At the same moment the shadow\
  \ creature is completed, the targeted corpse and all of its attendant equipment\
  \ vanishes, melting away like snow.\nThe false creature brought into existence by\
  \ the ring of the shadow victim has the same base ability scores, type, and subtype\
  \ as the targeted corpse. It appears in all ways to be the same individual as the\
  \ corpse touched, and it retains the general personality, attitude, abilities, and\
  \ intellect of that creature. However, this duplicate doesn't possess any memories\
  \ that the wearer of the ring doesn't also possess, has no spell-like or supernatural\
  \ abilities, can't use activated extraordinary abilities, can't gain the benefits\
  \ of healing, can't gain levels or increase its abilities, and can't have more than\
  \ 3 Hit Dice.\nThis false creature behaves much like the target did in life, except\
  \ it has a starting attitude of helpful toward the ring's wearer and is generally\
  \ willing to assist the wearer in any endeavor. The shadow creature will take nearly\
  \ any action to aid the wearer of the ring, including dangerous, foolish or suicidal\
  \ actions. This semi-illusory creature remains in existence for a duration equal\
  \ to 7 × the length of the initial ritual that created it, until the wearer removes\
  \ the ring of the shadow victim, until the wearer activates the ring again, or until\
  \ the creature is destroyed by violence, whichever comes first. At that time, the\
  \ duplicate vanishes and the original corpse, unchanged from when the initial ritual\
  \ was completed, appears in its place."
