description: "This shining helm glints with the multicolored hues of the aurora, and\
  \ features wings carved of fine whalebone that sweep back from the temples. While\
  \ it is in good shape, it shows signs of having seen battle. Once per day the wearer\
  \ can summon a giant spectral wolf. Treat this as phantom steed cast by a 14th-level\
  \ caster, but with an AC of 24 (â€“1 size, +8 natural armor, +7 Dexterity) and 100\
  \ hit points. The wolf can persist for up to 24 hours, as long as the creature that\
  \ summoned it is still wearing the helm of the valkyrie. Even though it takes the\
  \ form of a fierce predator and is more powerful than other phantom steeds, the\
  \ mount is nothing more than mist and can't attack."
