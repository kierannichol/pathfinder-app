description: "This curved wicker basket is worn like a glove over one hand. The basket\
  \ extends approximately 2 feet in a steady curve, allowing you to launch a thrown\
  \ splash weapon at incredible speeds and over long distances. Using a bombchucker\
  \ increases the range increment of any thrown splash weapon by 10 feet. Loading\
  \ a bombchucker requires a free hand, as the hand wielding the bombchucker can't\
  \ be used for any other purpose. A bombchucker doesn't get in the way of preparing\
  \ and throwing a bomb created with the bomb class feature."
