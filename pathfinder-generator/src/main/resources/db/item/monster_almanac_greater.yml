description: "The countless pages of this heavy tome bear detailed illustrations and\
  \ descriptions of creatures from the Material Plane and other planes, including\
  \ numerous Material Plane planets and the vast black spaces between the stars. The\
  \ book looks slim when closed, but when a user turns its pages, more and more pages\
  \ appear.\nThe user must spend at least 10 minutes researching a particular type\
  \ of monster to get any benefit from the almanac. If the user is trained in the\
  \ appropriate Knowledge skill to identify the monster, she gets a +5 circumstance\
  \ bonus on her skill check. She can attempt a Knowledge check to identify a creature\
  \ despite being untrained in the appropriate skill (without the +5 bonus) regardless\
  \ of the DC.\nIf the user spends 24 hours instead of 10 minutes, she can treat the\
  \ check as though she got a result of 25. This functions much like using an extensive\
  \ library and doesn't require the user to be trained in the relevant Knowledge skill."
