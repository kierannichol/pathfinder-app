description: "This pike has a hollow spot near its tip into which a flask can be strapped.\
  \ If the flask is filled with an alchemical splash weapon and you hit a creature\
  \ with the pike, the target is also hit with the splash weapon. This uses up the\
  \ contents of the flask. Because of the added weight of a flask, attacks with the\
  \ flask pike take a â€“2 penalty when it's loaded with one. Reloading the flask pike\
  \ is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity."
