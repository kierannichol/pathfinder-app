description: "This 3-foot-long iron rod has a flanged, conical head and strikes as\
  \ a +1 light mace. On command when held in hand, the rod points in the direction\
  \ of the closest grave, tomb, or cairn within 500 feet. If the wielder concentrates\
  \ on a specific type or subtype of creature, the rod identifies only gravesites\
  \ that hold the remains of that type of creature. The rod can search for the remains\
  \ of a specific individual if the wielder carries an item that the individual owned\
  \ in life."
