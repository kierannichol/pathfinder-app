description: "Swallowing this dark black-red tea pill causes your blood to heat up,\
  \ granting you a +2 alchemical bonus on initiative checks and on saving throws against\
  \ cold effects for 8 hours. However, any damage you take from bleed effects during\
  \ this time is multiplied by 1-1/2 (rounded up). Swallowing a blood-chilling pill\
  \ while under the effects of a blood-boiling pill negates the effects of both pills."
