description: "Stuffed between the pages of these two well-worn volumes are all manner\
  \ of riddles, tidbits of lore, and fragments of maps. One of the covers is missing\
  \ a corner, as if hacked off with a blade, and the text inside is tiny and cramped,\
  \ as if the author were afraid of running out of room."
