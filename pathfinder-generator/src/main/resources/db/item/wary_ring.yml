description: "This relatively plain brass ring of mind shielding can read script in\
  \ any language. The personality within the ring is distrustful of everyone, and\
  \ it pesters its wearer with increasingly elaborate conspiracy theories. Because\
  \ of its unrelenting paranoia, the ring provides its wearer with occasional welltimed\
  \ guidance and can use timely inspiration up to three times per day on the wearer."
