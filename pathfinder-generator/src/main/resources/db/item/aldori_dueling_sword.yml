description: "These slightly curved swords measure just over 3 feet in length. An\
  \ Aldori dueling sword can be used as a martial weapon (in which case it functions\
  \ as a longsword), but if you have the feat Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Aldori dueling\
  \ sword), you can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead\
  \ of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an Aldori dueling sword sized for\
  \ you, even though it isn't a light weapon. You can also wield an Aldori dueling\
  \ sword in two hands to apply 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus to damage rolls."
