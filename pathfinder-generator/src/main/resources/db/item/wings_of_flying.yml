description: "A pair of these wings might appear to be nothing more than a plain cloak\
  \ of old, black cloth, or they could be as elegant as a long cape of blue feathers.\
  \ When the wearer speaks the command word, the cloak turns into a pair of bat or\
  \ bird wings that empower her to fly with a speed of 60 feet (average maneuverability),\
  \ also granting a +5 competence bonus on Fly skill checks."
