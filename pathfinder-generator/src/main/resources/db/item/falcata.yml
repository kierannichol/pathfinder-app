description: "This heavy blade has a single sharp edge, concave at the bottom and\
  \ convex at the top, with a hook-shaped hilt. Its shape distributes the weight to\
  \ give it the momentum of an axe with the cutting edge of a sword, much like a larger\
  \ version of a kukri. The hooked hilt is sometimes carved to resemble the head of\
  \ a horse or bird of prey, and may have a thin chain stretched across its opening,\
  \ acting as a partial guard for the hand and fingers."
