description: "Metamagic gems can be used to enhance spells with various metamagic\
  \ effects, similar to the way metamagic rods are used, save that metamagic gems\
  \ are consumed when they are used. To apply the effects of a metamagic gem to a\
  \ spell, you need only use the metamagic gem as an additional material component\
  \ for the spell in question.\nWhen you apply a metamagic effect to a spell using\
  \ a metamagic gem, the spell slot of the altered spell does not change. You may\
  \ only use one metamagic gem on any given spell, and while that spell cannot be\
  \ further enhanced by a metamagic rod, it can be used with spells already enhanced\
  \ in the normal way via any metamagic feats you possess. In this case, only the\
  \ feats possessed by you adjust the spell slot of the spell being cast.\nUse of\
  \ a metamagic gem does not confer the associated feat on the owner, only the one-time\
  \ ability to use the given feat. A sorcerer or other spontaneous spellcaster must\
  \ still take a full-round action when using a metamagic gem, just as if using a\
  \ metamagic feat he possesses (except for quickening diamonds, which can be used\
  \ as a swift action).\nThe metamagic gems presented here are not the only such gems\
  \ that exist. Other metamagic gems based on metamagic feats from other sources could\
  \ easily be created—their costs should follow the pattern presented here (1,000\
  \ gp for gems that alter a spell slot by 1 level, 2,000 gp for those that alter\
  \ spell slots by 2 levels, and so on), and each new gem should have a corresponding\
  \ unique gemstone type associated with it."
