description: "In addition to serving as a vessel for Auberon's soul, the jaundiced\
  \ skull ioun stone is a potent artifact with two protections against detection.\
  \ First, when active, the ioun stone is invisible as it orbits the bearer's head.\
  \ Secondly, the jaundiced skull ioun stone is immune to divination effects.\nIf\
  \ a lich activates this ioun stone, it can use its paralyzing touch as a ranged\
  \ touch attack to a distance of 60 feet. In addition, if the lich whose soul is\
  \ stored within the jaundiced skull ioun stone is slain and someone else takes possession\
  \ of the artifact, the rate at which the lich rejuvenates is accelerated, as the\
  \ ioun stone begins sapping the life force from its current bearer. The stone's\
  \ bearer quickly rots, taking 1 point of Constitution drain initially and every\
  \ hour thereafter while it is activated unless the bearer succeeds at a DC 25 Fortitude\
  \ save. The creature bearing the ioun stone receives a new saving throw each time\
  \ it would be subjected to Constitution drain. As long as the ioun stone has dealt\
  \ at least 1 point of Constitution drain, the deterioration assists in the reformation\
  \ of the lich's body, reducing the time required for rejuvenation to 1d10 hours\
  \ instead of the normal 1d10 days."
destruction: "The jaundiced skull ioun stone can be destroyed only after the destruction\
  \ of the lich whose soul it holds and before the lich has rejuvenated. During this\
  \ time, the ioun stone must be subjected to a consecrate spell and then be smashed\
  \ to pieces. The jaundiced skull ioun stone has AC 26, 50 hit points, and hardness\
  \ 10."
