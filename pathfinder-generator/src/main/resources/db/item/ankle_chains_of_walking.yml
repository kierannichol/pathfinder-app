description: "These steel cuffs are connected with a 2-foot-long chain. The cuffs\
  \ are decorated with lead inlays of broken feet. When locked around a helpless or\
  \ willing creature's ankles as a full-round action, the creature can move only half\
  \ its normal speed for all its forms of movement. The creature that placed the ankle\
  \ chains can remove them with a command word, any creature can remove them with\
  \ a successful DC 30 Disable Device check, and the restrained creature can remove\
  \ them with a successful DC 30 Escape Artist check. Dispelling the ankle chains\
  \ doesn't assist in removing them, though it does prevent the creature that placed\
  \ the ankle chains from using the command word to remove them for as long as their\
  \ effects are suppressed or dispelled."
