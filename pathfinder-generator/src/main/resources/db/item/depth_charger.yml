description: "Carved to look like the bones of fish, the barrel and mechanical components\
  \ of this blunderbuss are made of mithral. A depth charger is a +2 reliable blunderbuss\
  \ that gains an additional +2 enhancement bonus on attack rolls against creatures\
  \ with the aquatic subtype, and deals an additional 2d6 points of damage to such\
  \ creatures with a successful attack. All ammunition used by a depth charger is\
  \ considered to have the dry load weapon special ability in addition to any other\
  \ magical enhancements it previously contained.\nWhen a depth charger is wielded\
  \ underwater, it enables its wielder to breathe normally. The wielder can continue\
  \ to breathe underwater for a total of 12 hours as long as she continues to hold\
  \ the blunderbuss. These hours do not have to be consecutive but must be used in\
  \ 1-hour increments. The available breathing time is reset only if a depth charger\
  \ is kept dry for 12 continuous hours."
