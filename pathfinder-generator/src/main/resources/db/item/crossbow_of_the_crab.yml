description: "This Large masterwork repeating heavy crossbow is powered by a system\
  \ of clockwork gears and torsion springs. It functions like its normal counterpart\
  \ above water, but it can also be used underwater, where it has a range increment\
  \ of 50 feet. Pulling a lever on the crossbow as a move action extends and retracts\
  \ the weapon's stock and opens and collapses its limbs for easy stowage, making\
  \ it small enough for a Medium character to carry in a backpack. The crossbow can\
  \ be enchanted with weapon abilities like any normal masterwork crossbow.\nWhen\
  \ mounted on the pincers of an apparatus of the crab or another similar device (which\
  \ takes a full-round action), a character operating the vehicle can aim and shoot\
  \ the crossbow up to twice per round (attack bonus +12) by pulling the lever that\
  \ normally snaps the pincers. While using the crossbow in this way, a character\
  \ without Exotic Weapon Proficiency (repeating heavy crossbow) doesn't take a penalty\
  \ for nonproficiency. While the crossbow is thus mounted, the apparatus can't make\
  \ attacks with the pincers. If a character operates the lever that extends and retracts\
  \ the pincers and feelers while the crossbow is mounted, the apparatus ejects the\
  \ crossbow instead, enabling the vehicle to make pincer attacks again."
