description: "This single, jade-encrusted ironwood pauldron glistens slightly, as\
  \ if it were the reflective surface of a still pool, even in complete darkness.\
  \ This pauldron increases the virulence of all poisons used by the wearer. Once\
  \ per day, when attempting to poison a target, the wearer can speak a command word\
  \ to magically enhance a single dose of poison, making it immune to the effects\
  \ of delay poison. The poison's DC is unaffected and the poison can still be affected\
  \ by a neutralize poison spell and similar magical effects."
