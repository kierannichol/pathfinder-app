description: "Like a miniature blunderbuss, the dragon pistol fires pellets or a bullet\
  \ from its flared barrel. The dragon pistol fires in a 15-foot cone when firing\
  \ pellets, and has a 10-foot range increment when firing a bullet. A dragon pistol\
  \ uses either a bullet or group of pellets and 1 dose of black powder, or a single\
  \ alchemical cartridge (with either bullets or pellets) as ammunition. This is an\
  \ early firearm."
