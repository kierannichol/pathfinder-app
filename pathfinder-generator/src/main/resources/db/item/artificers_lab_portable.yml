description: "The portable artificer's lab contains everything needed to create magic\
  \ items, though many of the tools and implements are of only the most basic type.\
  \ This lab allows the artificer to spend 4 hours crafting each night while out adventuring,\
  \ and net 3 hours' worth of work (instead of 2). However, because the tools are\
  \ all designed to fulfill multiple functions and the portable lab lacks the space\
  \ and quiet that provide ideal circumstances for creating magic items, the skill\
  \ check to complete a magic item that had any of its work done using a portable\
  \ lab takes a â€“5 penalty."
