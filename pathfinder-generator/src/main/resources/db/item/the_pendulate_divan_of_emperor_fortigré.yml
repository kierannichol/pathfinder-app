description: "This luxurious, red felt divan is edged in gold latticework and made\
  \ from highly polished, glossy black wood. If you lie upon it, you automatically\
  \ understand how to activate it. Created for the mad Emperor Fortigré of Taldor\
  \ thousands of years ago, the pendulate divan includes many special abilities. When\
  \ you sit, stand, or lie upon it, it can walk like a fourlegged animal with a movement\
  \ speed of 30 feet, create up to 2 gallons of water per day, protect you with endure\
  \ elements, and fly or teleport as per the spells (once each per day). The original\
  \ pendulate divan is stored in the Imperial Palace in Taldor, though a few copies\
  \ of it were created over the centuries, and many wealthy nobles own lesser versions\
  \ which can only walk and have no other powers."
