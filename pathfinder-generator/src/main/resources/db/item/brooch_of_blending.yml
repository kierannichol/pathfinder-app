description: "Occasionally, half-elves find it socially advantageous to blend in fully\
  \ with either elves or humans. As a standard action, the wearer of this brooch can\
  \ transform his features to appear either entirely elven or entirely human. The\
  \ magic of this brooch actually changes the wearer's features physically, granting\
  \ him a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear as a member of the selected\
  \ race. The transformation does not otherwise alter the wearer's features, and those\
  \ who know him recognize him without a Perception check. This change remains until\
  \ the brooch is used again or removed. This change does not radiate magic and cannot\
  \ be seen with detect magic, although true seeing does reveal the alteration. This\
  \ item only functions for half-elves, but there are versions that exist for half-orcs\
  \ as well."
