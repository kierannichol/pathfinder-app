description: "This violet shawl twists and melds with the darkness, becoming as black\
  \ as coal in even the faintest shadow. While worn, the wearer can hide her appearance\
  \ as if with a penumbral disguise spell (see page 29). Onlookers never discern that\
  \ the wearer was wearing a shawl of shadowy disguise."
