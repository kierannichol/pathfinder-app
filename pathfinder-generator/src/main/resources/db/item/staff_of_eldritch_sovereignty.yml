description: "Similar to the staff of the magi, this long ivory staff is inlaid with\
  \ platinum sigils and burns with eldritch fire when its powers are called upon.\
  \ Unlike a normal staff, a staff of eldritch sovereignty holds 50 charges and can't\
  \ be recharged normally. Some of its powers use charges, and others don't. A staff\
  \ of eldritch sovereignty doesn't lose its powers if it runs out of charges. The\
  \ following powers don't use charges:"
destruction: "A staff of eldritch sovereignty can be broken for a retributive strike.\
  \ Such an act must be purposeful and declared by the wielder. All charges in the\
  \ staff are released in a 30-foot-radius spread. Quadruple the wielder's tier and\
  \ add this amount to the number of charges remaining in the staff. All creatures\
  \ within 10 feet of the staff take an amount of damage equal to 10 times this number.\
  \ A successful Reflex save with a DC equal to 23 plus the wielder's tier halves\
  \ the damage.\nUnlike with the staff of the magi, breaking a staff of arcane sovereignty\
  \ invariably destroys the wielder (no saving throw)."
