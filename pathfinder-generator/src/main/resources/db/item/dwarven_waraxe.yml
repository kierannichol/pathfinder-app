description: "A dwarven waraxe has a large, ornate head mounted on a thick handle,\
  \ making it too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an\
  \ exotic weapon. A Medium character can use a dwarven waraxe two-handed as a martial\
  \ weapon, or a Large creature can use it one-handed in the same way. A dwarf treats\
  \ a dwarven waraxe as a martial weapon even when using it in one hand."
