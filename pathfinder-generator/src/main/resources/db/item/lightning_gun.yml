description: "This device appears to be a box and frame made of a strange metallic\
  \ alloy. A bellows or tapered accordion structure protrudes from the box, with handles\
  \ and controls at the wide end and a bright metal disk or lens at the other. The\
  \ controls are seemingly designed to be operated by large creatures with only two\
  \ fingers, though humanoid hands can manipulate them after some practice.\nAs a\
  \ standard action, the operator can hold the device in front of herself with two\
  \ hands and use the controls to unleash a blast that deals 10d12 points of electricity\
  \ damage on a successful ranged touch attack against a single target within 120\
  \ feet. The lightning blast sets fire to combustibles and damages objects that it\
  \ strikes. It can melt metals that have a low melting point, such as lead, gold,\
  \ copper, silver, or bronze."
