description: "This heavy iron arrowhead is sealed with an alchemical resin. Pulling\
  \ a small string (a move action) breaks the seal and triggers a reaction in the\
  \ arrowhead, greatly increasing its magnetic properties. You gain a +4 circumstance\
  \ bonus on attack rolls when firing a lodestone arrow at a target wearing metal\
  \ armor or a target made of metal, but the magnetized arrow deals only half damage\
  \ on a successful hit. The increased magnetism fades 1 round after you activate\
  \ a lodestone arrow, after which it becomes a normal arrow."
