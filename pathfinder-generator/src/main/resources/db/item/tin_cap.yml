description: "This simple tin headpiece is a lesser replica of the powerful stannum\
  \ crown. A tin cap feeds on its wearer's paranoia, granting her a +4 insight bonus\
  \ on saving throws against mindaffecting effects and divinations that gather information\
  \ about her. Donning a tin cap saps the mind of the wearer, imposing a â€“2 penalty\
  \ to her Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. The increased paranoia causes the wearer\
  \ to always attempt saving throws, even against harmless effects. Removing the tin\
  \ cap removes both the benefits and drawbacks until it is donned again."
