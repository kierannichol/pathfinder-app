description: "These spectacles fit firmly over eyes and are held in place by two crystalline\
  \ stems. The lenses are initially clear and don't hinder the wearer's vision. When\
  \ the wearer is targeted with an illusion spell or spell-like ability of the pattern\
  \ subschool (such as color spray), the spectacles absorb the magic and darken, protecting\
  \ the wearer from the pattern effect. Once the spectacles absorb a spell and become\
  \ opaque, the wearer becomes blinded until the spectacles are removed (a swift action).\
  \ Patternward spectacles protect against spells or spell-like abilities of only\
  \ 3rd level or lower; higher-level effects affect the wearer as normal. Once the\
  \ spectacles absorb an effect, they lose their magic."
