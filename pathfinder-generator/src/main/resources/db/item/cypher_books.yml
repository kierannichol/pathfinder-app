description: "These books, always sold in identical pairs, contain numbered grids\
  \ on each page which simply and easily catalog random lists of words. This allows\
  \ a user to write messages which substitute letters and numbers that reference the\
  \ page, row, and column of a particular word found within the cypher book. A creature\
  \ without access to the appropriate cypher book takes a â€“10 penalty on Linguistic\
  \ checks made to decipher each page of a coded message. Writing a message using\
  \ the cipher takes 10 times as long as writing an uncoded message, and decoding\
  \ it with the cipher book takes as much time as writing the original coded message."
