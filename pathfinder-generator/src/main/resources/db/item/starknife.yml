description: "From a central metal ring, four tapering metal blades extend from this\
  \ weapon like points on a compass rose. By gripping the crossbar that runs through\
  \ the weapon's open middle, a wielder can strike with it as a deadly melee weapon.\
  \ Alternatively, by gripping it by the outer rim, a starknife's light, aerodynamic\
  \ design allows it to be thrown short distances in a manner similar to a chakram."
