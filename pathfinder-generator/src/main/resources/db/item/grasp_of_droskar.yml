description: "This left-handed black iron gauntlet appears little more than a dull\
  \ soot-stained plated glove at first glance, but in truth it is a powerful boon\
  \ granted by Droskar to his most faithful subjects. Placing the glove on your left\
  \ hand causes excruciating pain as your appendage curls into a tight fist and then\
  \ slowly transforms to supernaturally hard black stone. You cannot use your left\
  \ hand for anything beyond smashing it into objects or creatures (you cannot carry\
  \ a shield or secondary weapon and you take a -4 on skill checks that usually require\
  \ two hands). The gauntlet cannot be removed without a successful casting of remove\
  \ curse, break enchantment, or similar spell.\nThe gauntlet grants you a +2 enhancement\
  \ bonus to Strength and acts as a +1 adamantine gauntlet. The item also grants you\
  \ the ability to use the gauntlet as a secondary natural weapon. In addition, the\
  \ Grasp of Droskar allows its wearer to use stone shape once per day."
