description: "An estoc is a sword about as long as a bastard sword, but designed exclusively\
  \ for thrusting attacks. Its \"blade\" is a steel spike with a triangular, square,\
  \ or hexagonal crosssection. Like the bastard sword, an estoc requires special training\
  \ to use it one handed, but it can also be wielded as a two-handed martial weapon.\
  \ When you wield an estoc with one hand, treat it as a one-handed weapon; when you\
  \ wield an estoc with two hands, treat it as a two-handed weapon. If you can use\
  \ the estoc proficiently with one hand, you can also use the Weapon Finesse feat\
  \ to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls\
  \ when wielding an estoc sized for you with one or two hands, even though it isn't\
  \ a light weapon."
