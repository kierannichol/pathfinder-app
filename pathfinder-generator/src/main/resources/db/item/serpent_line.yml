description: "This 30-foot length of rope is braided with musk-cured strips of snakeskin\
  \ from a variety of desert serpents, and is typically laid out in a 5-foot-radius\
  \ circle around the edge of a tent or around a sleeping creature. When it's laid\
  \ out in this way, common snakes crawling across the desert floor often mistake\
  \ the serpent line for another snake and shy away from crossing it. Ordinary venomous\
  \ snakes approaching a serpent line must succeed at a DC 10 Will save or turn away\
  \ from it, though if they notice potential prey within the serpent line, they may\
  \ continue to lurk nearby. At the GM's discretion, an exceptionally aggressive or\
  \ hungry snake may gain a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throw. Snakes that\
  \ are magically controlled ignore a serpent line."
