description: "Made from a single male lion's coat with the mane surrounding its hood,\
  \ the lion cloak is an impressive sight. A creature wearing the cloak gains a +2\
  \ resistance bonus on saving throws made against mind-affecting and fear effects\
  \ and a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks. Once per day, the wearer can\
  \ pull the hood over her head, assuming the form of a lion (as the beast shape II\
  \ spell, except that it allows only lion form) for up to 10 minutes. If the wearer\
  \ has the smite class feature, she can use this power more than once per day by\
  \ expending uses of her smite; at most she can take the lion form as many times\
  \ as she has smites plus one additional time. While in this lion form the wearer\
  \ cannot use its normal smite ability."
