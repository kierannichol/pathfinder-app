description: "Numerians who oppose the Technic League have developed many forms of\
  \ protection from the tyrannical organization's technology-infused weaponry. This\
  \ +2 breastplate is made of scrap metal from one of the alien ruins that pepper\
  \ the landscape, remnants of the crashed spaceship now known as Silver Mount. Specifically\
  \ designed to provide additional defense against beam weapons, Numerian resistance\
  \ plate grants its wearer a +4 bonus to touch AC against ray attacks.\nThree times\
  \ per day, when a ray attack targeting the plate's wearer misses by 4 or less, the\
  \ wearer can deflect the ray back at its source as an immediate action. The ray\
  \ uses the original attack roll to determine whether it hits its new target."
