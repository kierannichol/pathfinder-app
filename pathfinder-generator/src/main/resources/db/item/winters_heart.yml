description: "Carved long ago from the ice at the heart of an ancient glacier and\
  \ infused with a cold and unstoppable drive, this +5 icy burst quenching bastard\
  \ sword (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 146) changes size to match its wielder.\
  \ Spell-like abilities used by Winter's Heart receive the benefits of Greater Spell\
  \ Focus (evocation).\nAs a standard action, the wielder of Winter's Heart can dispel\
  \ fire effects as a frost brand. Alternatively, as a standard action, the wielder\
  \ can quench a Huge or smaller nonmagical fire by touching it with the sword.\n\
  The sword commands the following spell-like abilities:\n3/day— heroism (on its wielder\
  \ only)\n1/day—empowered cone of cold (DC 21), maximized widened detonate (cold\
  \ only, DC 20), word of recall\nThe DC for detonate is determined as if it were\
  \ an 8th-level spell. If detonate is cast on a creature with the cold subtype, it\
  \ also acts as heal; if cast on a creature with the fire subtype, it also acts as\
  \ harm.\nWinter's Heart has the special purpose of uniting the lands of the north\
  \ under one iron rule. When pursuing this purpose, it surrounds its wielder in icy\
  \ armor that combines the protection of stoneskin and fire shield (cold flames).\
  \ If the protection of the stoneskin is exhausted, both protections are lost and\
  \ the sword can't reestablish them for 10 minutes."
destruction: "Winter's Heart can be destroyed only if it's hurled into the center\
  \ of a cataclysmic volcanic eruption. Even a normal volcano's heat is insufficient\
  \ to melt the blade, and Immersing it in magma merely solidifies the magma into\
  \ rock."
