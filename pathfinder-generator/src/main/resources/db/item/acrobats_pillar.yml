description: "This training contraption consists of a stout, 7-foot-tall wooden pillar\
  \ with spring-powered woodand- brass arms jutting sideways at different heights.\
  \ When the springs are wound, the arms wave erratically through the area within\
  \ 10 feet of the pillar. The arms don't swing with sufficient force to cause damage,\
  \ but you can practice your acrobatic technique by moving up to and around the pillar\
  \ while the arms are in motion, attempting to avoid being tagged. The mechanism\
  \ operates for 10 minutes before winding down. The entire contraption can be dismantled\
  \ and stowed in a chest the size of a large foot locker for transport.\nUsing the\
  \ pillar to hone your acrobatic techniques requires 1 hour of practice and a DC\
  \ 20 Acrobatics check. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus\
  \ on Acrobatics checks to avoid attacks of opportunity provoked by moving out of\
  \ or through an opponent's threatened area. This bonus lasts for 24 hours or until\
  \ you fail an Acrobatics check."
