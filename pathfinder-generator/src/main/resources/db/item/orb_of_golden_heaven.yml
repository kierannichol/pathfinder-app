description: "This alabaster sphere, overlaid with golden bands set with diamonds\
  \ in runelike patterns, sheds light like a continual flame spell. Making a melee\
  \ touch attack with the orb has the same effect as dousing the target with a flask\
  \ of holy water. A good creature may hold the orb in hand and command it to invoke\
  \ consecrate and searing light each once per day.\nThe orb bestows one permanent\
  \ negative level on any evil creature holding or carrying it. The negative level\
  \ remains as long as the creature has the orb and disappears immediately when the\
  \ orb is no longer held or carried. This negative level cannot be overcome in any\
  \ way (including by restoration spells) while the bearer has the orb. If the bearer\
  \ of an orb of golden heaven wears a crown of golden heaven, its light counts as\
  \ daylight instead of continual flame, and its consecrate acts as if the orb were\
  \ a shrine to the bearer's deity."
