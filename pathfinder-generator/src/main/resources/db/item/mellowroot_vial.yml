description: "Sneaky goblin chieftains give this orange paste to the tribe's warriors\
  \ before proposing a particularly bold raid. Consuming mellowroot causes a euphoric\
  \ feeling that makes you feel invulnerable. For 1 hour after consuming mellowroot,\
  \ you gain a +5 alchemical bonus versus fear effects. However, while under the effects\
  \ of mellowroot, you must make a DC 15 Will saving throw when you try to leave the\
  \ threatened area of an opponent. If you fail the saving throw, you cannot leave\
  \ the threatened area with that action but do not lose the action."
