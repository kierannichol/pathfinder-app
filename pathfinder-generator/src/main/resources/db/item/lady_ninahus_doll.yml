description: "This well-worn doll is 18 inches tall, and its floppy limbs and fine\
  \ clothing are patched in several places. Pressing the doll's left button-eye causes\
  \ it to become preternaturally rigid and affix itself in space, as an immovable\
  \ rod. While in this state, the doll has hardness 20. The doll can maintain this\
  \ state for 1 minute before returning to its usual plush composition; pressing the\
  \ doll's right eye causes it to return to its original state immediately. Pressing\
  \ either eye is a move action. Lady Ninahu's Doll has the protection of children\
  \ as its special purpose and particularly prioritizes the protection of its owner\
  \ if its owner is a child. Lady Ninahu's Doll does not impose a negative level on\
  \ an owner who is a child, regardless of the child's alignment.\nLady Ninahu's Doll\
  \ is satisfied to lie inert most of the time, watching its owner's environment carefully\
  \ for threats (Perception +13). The doll rarely attempts to communicate other than\
  \ to encourage feelings of calm and safety. If danger presents itself, the doll\
  \ is able to move up to 10 feet under its own power, become immobile as above, or\
  \ take the aid another action to grant its owner an AC bonus. Once per day, the\
  \ doll can act as if it had the In Harms Way feat. Aware that its immobility is\
  \ temporary, the doll empathically urges its owner to escape while it holds the\
  \ menace at bay. Lady Ninahu's Doll can move under its own power, but only to block\
  \ a perceived threat."
