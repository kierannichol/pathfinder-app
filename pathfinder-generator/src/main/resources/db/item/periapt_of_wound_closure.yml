description: "This stone is bright blue and dangles on a silver chain meant to be\
  \ worn on the neck. The wearer of this periapt automatically becomes stable if his\
  \ hit points drop below 0 (but not if the damage is enough to kill the wearer).\
  \ The periapt doubles the wearer's normal rate of healing or allows normal healing\
  \ of wounds that would not do so normally. Hit point damage caused by bleeding is\
  \ negated for the wearer of the periapt, but he is still susceptible to damage from\
  \ bleeding that causes ability damage or drain."
