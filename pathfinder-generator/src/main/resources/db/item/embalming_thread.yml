description: "This coarse, acrid-smelling thread is more akin to wire than fabric.\
  \ When carefully sewn into the body of a flesh golem or zombie (requiring 1 hour\
  \ per Hit Die of the creature and a successful DC 20 Heal or Spellcraft check),\
  \ the stitches change the creature's damage reduction to DR 5/ adamantine and slashing.\
  \ Variant zombies lacking damage reduction (such as fast zombies) instead gain DR\
  \ 5/slashing. One length of stitching is required for every Hit Die of the creature\
  \ being enhanced. Using an insufficient number of lengths has no effect. A full\
  \ thimble of embalming thread contains 20 lengths.\nIf the skill check to use the\
  \ stitches fails, they are not wasted, but must first be cleaned and unknotted,\
  \ requiring 1 hour per stitch. Once used successfully, the stitches cannot be reused."
