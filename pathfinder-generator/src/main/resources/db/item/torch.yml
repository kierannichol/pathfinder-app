description: "A torch burns for 1 hour, shedding normal light in a 20-foot radius\
  \ and increasing the light level by one step for an additional 20 feet beyond that\
  \ area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A torch\
  \ does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. If a torch\
  \ is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning\
  \ damage equal to that of a gauntlet of its size, plus 1 point of fire damage."
