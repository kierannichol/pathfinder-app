description: "You and your mount lay down a trail of glowing, heavenly mist behind\
  \ you as you move that makes passage easier for good creatures but more difficult\
  \ for evil creatures. This glowing trail of mist appears behind your mount in a\
  \ straight line starting where you cast the spell and ending where your mount ends\
  \ its movement. The mist takes the form of a path 10 feet wide and up to 120 feet\
  \ long and always floats just above the ground, up to a height of 1 foot. Thereafter,\
  \ the mist persists for 1 round per level."
