description: "Roughly carved from porous stone that litters the base of the Tusk Mountains,\
  \ these pots allow Kellid nomads to carry burning coals from one day's campsite\
  \ to the next, so they can quickly start cook fires wherever they find themselves.\
  \ Coals placed within an ember pot stay hot for 24 hours, and allow anyone to light\
  \ a fire in normal conditions without needing to make a Survival check."
