description: "This black poker has a cherry-red tip, as though fresh from a searing\
  \ fire. The more artful interrogators of Cheliax well understand that their subjects\
  \ soon learn to welcome unconsciousness and even death as a means to escape torture.\
  \ To frustrate their victim's respite, a torturer's wracking rod delivers a painful\
  \ jolt that keeps the target alert for an extended session of interrogation. On\
  \ a successful touch attack, the victim receives the benefit of a cure light wounds\
  \ spell (ld8+1) but must also make a DC 16 Fortitude save or be sickened for 2d4\
  \ rounds. Over the decades, desperate members of Cheliax's underclass have found\
  \ that these rods double as black market sources of emergency healing. A wracking\
  \ rod can be used up to 5 times per day."
