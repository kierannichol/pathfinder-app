description: "This item resembles a normal mirror about 4 feet long and 3 feet wide.\
  \ It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by speaking a command\
  \ word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. If a creature sees its reflection\
  \ in the mirror's surface, an exact duplicate of that creature comes into being.\
  \ This opposite immediately attacks the original. The duplicate has all the possessions\
  \ and powers of its original (including magic). Upon the defeat or destruction of\
  \ either the duplicate or the original, the duplicate and its items disappear completely.\
  \ The mirror functions up to four times per day. Destroying the mirror (hardness\
  \ 1, 5 hit points) causes all of the duplicates to immediately vanish."
