name: "Scroll of Demand"
description: "This spell functions like sending, but the message can also contain\
  \ a suggestion (see the suggestion spell), which the subject does its best to carry\
  \ out. A successful Will save negates the suggestion effect but not the contact\
  \ itself. The demand, if received, is understood even if the subject's Intelligence\
  \ score is as low as 1. If the message is impossible or meaningless according to\
  \ the circumstances that exist for the subject at the time the demand is issued,\
  \ the message is understood but the suggestion is ineffective."
