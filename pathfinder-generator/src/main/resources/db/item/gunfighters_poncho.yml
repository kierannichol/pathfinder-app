description: "The abjurations woven into this woolen poncho not only defend against\
  \ gunfire, but also insulate the wearer from dangerous magic. The wearer gains a\
  \ +2 luck bonus to touch AC. Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer can\
  \ negate a single ranged touched attack targeted at him, but cannot use this ability\
  \ if the attack is a confirmed critical hit. When the wearer uses this ability,\
  \ he must fall prone."
