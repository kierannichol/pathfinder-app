description: "A glove of familiar's touch features a large, brightly colored gem fastened\
  \ to its palm, and comes with an additional gem attuned to the glove. As long as\
  \ his familiar is touching the attuned gem, the wearer of this glove can designate\
  \ his familiar as the source for any touch spell he casts, even if he and his familiar\
  \ are not in contact when the spell is cast. A glove of familiar's touch takes up\
  \ the wearer's entire hands slot; the wearer can't gain the benefits of another\
  \ magic item (even another glove of familiar's touch) that also uses the hands slot."
