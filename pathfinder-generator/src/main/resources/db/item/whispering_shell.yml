description: "This striped conch shell appears to be nothing more than a piece of\
  \ flotsam idly picked up by a beachcomber. Once per day when held to the lips, the\
  \ conch shell absorbs a whispered message of 25 words or fewer and stores the spoken\
  \ words indefinitely. When pressed to the ear and prompted by the command word,\
  \ the shell repeats its message as a whisper that cannot be heard by anyone except\
  \ the creature holding the conch shell. A whispering shell can only hold one such\
  \ message at a time, but can replay its message as often as a creature issues the\
  \ command to do so."
