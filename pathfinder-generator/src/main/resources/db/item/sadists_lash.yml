description: "A sadist's lash is a long whip of thin strips of leather. Created originally\
  \ by a special sect of wizards who served under Runelord Sorshen, sadist's lashes\
  \ swiftly became quite popular throughout Thassilon. The lash acts as a +1 wounding\
  \ whip, and also aids enchantment spells in two ways. First, it can deliver enchantment\
  \ spells with a range of touch as if the wielder had touched the creature struck.\
  \ Additionally, any creature that takes damage from a sadist's lash takes a â€“5 penalty\
  \ on Will saves against all enchantment effects created by the wielder of the lash\
  \ for 1 minute unless it succeeds at a DC 15 Will save."
