description: "This shallow box contains an assortment of beeswax, oils, pigments,\
  \ brushes, and quills, and allows a user to blend seemlessly into new cultures and\
  \ fashion scenes. By spending 5 minutes applying these contents, a user may adopt\
  \ the hairstyle, fashion, and social cues of any culture with which he is familiar,\
  \ granting a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff or Diplomacy checks with members of\
  \ that culture, but leaving him otherwise recognizable. Alternatively, the palette\
  \ may be used to conceal the user's identity entirely; it cannot make the user appear\
  \ shorter or taller or otherwise alter their body, but otherwise allows him to adopt\
  \ the appearance of another creature of the same type with the same body type and\
  \ build. Either application lasts for 5 hours or until removed with soap and water.\
  \ A resplendent diplomat's palette has 50 charges when created, and each use consumes\
  \ 1 charge.\nThe palette qualifies as a disguise kit, granting a +2 circumstance\
  \ bonus on Disguise checks. Using it as such does not consume a charge."
