description: "Long ago, engineers in Anuli wore pairs of these sturdy brown leather\
  \ boots to navigate the city after the Paroxsys tore apart the land. The wearer\
  \ of these boots gains a +5 competence bonus on Craft checks to repair items. Additionally,\
  \ as a move action, the wearer of a pair of rebuilder's boots can activate them\
  \ to move up to her land speed and ignore any adverse movement effects of difficult\
  \ terrain, as per the effects of the feather step spell. This effect lasts for 40\
  \ minutes per day or until the wearer ends it as a free action. The wearer need\
  \ not spend this duration all at once, but she must spend it in 1-minute increments."
