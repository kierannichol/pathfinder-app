description: "This 4-inch wooden wheel is small enough to fit into a pocket or a pouch.\
  \ By rolling the wheel on the ground (this requires a standard action to activate\
  \ the item), the wheel begins rolling toward the nearest body of clean, potable\
  \ water with enough liquid for the wielder to quench her thirst. Alternatively,\
  \ the wheel rolls toward the nearest normal magic area if the wielder is in an area\
  \ of primal magic, a magic dead zone, or another variant type of magic. (If necessary,\
  \ the wielder must specify whether the wheel should seek water or normal magic when\
  \ she activates the item.) The wheel can roll for up to 10 minutes per day until\
  \ it leaves the region of variant magic, it reaches the body of water, or the wielder\
  \ instructs it to stop (a free action). This item's duration need not be used all\
  \ at once, but it must be used in 1-minute intervals. As part of its movement, the\
  \ wheel can ascend or jump up to 30 feet. A wheel of survival is unaffected by variant\
  \ magic regions."
