description: "Crafted from a preserved rust monster antenna, this item works similarly\
  \ to a gauntlet of rust, with the exceptions that you can make a rusting grasp touch\
  \ attack with the whip at will, you can use it on all nonmagical metallic objects\
  \ (not just ferrous ones), and it does not protect you from other rusting attacks.\
  \ This item counts as a whip for the purposes of proficiency and weapon feats."
