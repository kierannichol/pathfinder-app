description: "The litheria blossom is a rare but naturally occurring flower with large,\
  \ pink petals. The pollen of the litheria blossom bridges the gap between life and\
  \ death, functioning like an elixir, though inhaled rather than imbibed. A creature\
  \ inhaling the pollen gains the benefit of the death ward and deathwatch spells.\
  \ Both effects last for 10 minutes. If plucked, the flower remains vibrant and alive\
  \ until the pollen within the flower is inhaled, at which point the flower wilts\
  \ and dies. The pollen remains potent only so long as it held within the flower\
  \ or immediately thereafter. If removed from the flower for longer than 1 round,\
  \ both the pollen and the flower become nonmagical."
