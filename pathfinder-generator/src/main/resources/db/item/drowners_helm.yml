description: "This metal helmet sports an open top and a tightly sealed collar that\
  \ closes securely around the neck. Water is poured into the open top, filling the\
  \ helmet and forcing you to hold your breath. A safety lever allows you to release\
  \ the water at any time. Training with the drowner's helm requires 1 hour of practice\
  \ and a DC 15 Constitution check. If you succeed at the check, you treat your Constitution\
  \ score as 5 higher when determining how long you can hold your breath. This bonus\
  \ lasts for 24 hours."
