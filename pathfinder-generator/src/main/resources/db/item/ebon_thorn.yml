description: "This suit of +4 bolstering grinding adamantine full plate bristles with\
  \ long thorns and barbs along the edges of its heavy plates. These are gained from\
  \ the grinding special ability, and also act as +1 cruel armor spikes. As a swift\
  \ action whenever Ebon Thorn's spikes damage an opponent, its wearer can attempt\
  \ a Intimidate check to demoralize that opponent. The wearer doesn't take the normal\
  \ â€“4 penalty on Intimidate checks made against larger opponents."
