description: "This cursed item looks like any normal ioun stone, and has powers according\
  \ to its color and shape. However, whenever you are in combat, the orbiting stone\
  \ batters at your face and head, dealing 1 hit point of damage each round. If you\
  \ sleep or fall unconscious while the stone is in orbit, it drills into your head,\
  \ dealing 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma damage each round until\
  \ the penalty to one of these ability scores exceeds your actual score, at which\
  \ point it removes itself from your head and hides itself on your person, near other\
  \ gems. The stone can remove itself from a wayfinder to attack you in this fashion.\
  \ The attack automatically wakes a sleeping character. The only way to end the attack\
  \ is to interfere with the magic of the stone (by using dispel magic, entering an\
  \ antimagic field, and so on) or grab it and place it in a container."
