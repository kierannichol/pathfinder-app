description: "Whispering Shrike is a +1 wakizashi (Ultimate Combat 134) of incredibly\
  \ beautiful design. The sword is etched with images of seven shrikes perched on\
  \ a coiling branch that runs the length of the blade. Once per day, Whispering Shrike\
  \ can be used to cast shield other on any creature touched by the blade while you\
  \ wield it. The blade's tsuka (hilt) has not weathered the passage of time as well\
  \ as the blade itself, and until the pommel is repaired (a process requiring 600\
  \ gp, a day's work, and a DC 20 Craft [weapons] check), attacks with the weapon\
  \ take a -2 penalty due to the loose grip. A DC 20 Perception check (an automatic\
  \ success once repair is underway) reveals a secret compartment in the hilt just\
  \ large enough to hold a small item such as a flask or rolled piece of paper. This\
  \ compartment currently holds an important letter-see page 22 for details on this\
  \ find."
