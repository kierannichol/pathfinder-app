description: "The skydragon firework is the apex of the firework artisan's craft.\
  \ Unlit, a skydragon firework looks like an unassuming tube of thin wood and colored\
  \ parchment. One round after you light a skydragon firework, the tube takes flight\
  \ at a speed of 60 feet for 1d4 rounds, traveling in the direction it is pointed\
  \ for the first round and changing direction randomly each round thereafter. The\
  \ firework deals 2d6 points of fire damage to any creature within 10 feet of its\
  \ flight path. If a skydragon's flight path causes it to hit a solid object, the\
  \ firework continues in a random direction but subtracts 30 feet from its movement\
  \ for that round."
