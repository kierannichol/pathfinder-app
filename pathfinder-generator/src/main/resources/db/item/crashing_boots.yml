description: "These thick, stout boots, crafted from the hide of a gorthek, grant\
  \ their wearer a +2 enhancement bonus on attack rolls when charging. In addition,\
  \ once per day when the wearer hits a Large or smaller creature with an attack,\
  \ he can send his foe flying 10 feet. The foe must be thrown in a straight line\
  \ away from the wearer, and lands prone at the end of the movement. If an obstacle\
  \ prevents the completion of the opponent's move, the opponent and the obstacle\
  \ each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space\
  \ adjacent to the obstacle."
