description: "This leather satchel contains a forger's kit—quills, ink, parchment,\
  \ and sealing wax—as well as personal oddments ranging from braids of hair to heirloom\
  \ brooches. When attempting to create a forgery, the user can place within the forger's\
  \ friend a personal possession or other item connected to the person whose handwriting\
  \ the user wants to forge. After 24 hours, any forgery made with paper or parchment\
  \ also kept within the satchel for that duration is supernaturally convincing beyond\
  \ the +2 circumstance bonus granted by the forger's kit itself. A creature attempting\
  \ to detect the forgery takes a penalty on its Linguistics check equal to the penalty\
  \ a target of a scrying spell would take based on the contents of the forger's friend.\
  \ The forger's friend can acclimate the forging gear within to only one creature\
  \ at a time."
