description: "These strange, heavy, leather-and-steel boots feature a pair of ever-fluttering\
  \ wings on each side. These boots function like winged boots, but also grant a +5\
  \ bonus to CMD against bull rush, overrun, and reposition combat maneuvers as long\
  \ as the wearer is standing on solid ground. A mythic creature can expend one use\
  \ of mythic power when commanding the boots to fly to gain the bonus to CMD for\
  \ as long as she uses the boots to fly."
