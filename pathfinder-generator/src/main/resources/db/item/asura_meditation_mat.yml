description: "This simple mat is woven from a type of reed that grows in the swamps\
  \ of Geryon's realm. Meditating on the mat opens the user's mind to the destructive\
  \ power of emptiness. If a lawful evil character with a ki pool meditates upon an\
  \ asura meditation mat for 1 hour, for the next 4 hours, the user's mind becomes\
  \ an empty vessel guided by wrath. During this time, the user gains a +4 profane\
  \ bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects but must attempt saving\
  \ throws against all mind-affecting effects (including beneficial or harmless ones).\
  \ In addition, before the user makes a melee attack with an unarmed strike or a\
  \ monk weapon, she can spend up to 4 ki points to declare an empty strike. The user\
  \ gains a profane bonus on the attack roll and weapon damage roll equal to twice\
  \ the number of ki points spent, and the attack ignores 2 points of hardness or\
  \ damage reduction for each ki point spent. When used with Stunning Fist or similar\
  \ feats, an empty strike also increases the DC of that effect by the number of ki\
  \ points spent. A user without a ki pool, or one who is not lawful evil, gains no\
  \ benefit from an asura meditation mat."
