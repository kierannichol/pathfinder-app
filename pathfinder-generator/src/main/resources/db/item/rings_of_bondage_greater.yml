description: "These specialized rings function as rings of bondage, but a command\
  \ imposed by the wearer of the master ring (including a mutual agreement affecting\
  \ both wearers) takes 10 minutes to activate, is permanent, and functions as geas/quest,\
  \ except a DC 16 Will save still negates it.\nIn addition, the wearer of the master\
  \ ring gains a continuous sanctuary (DC 16) effect against the wearer of the servant\
  \ ring, with a save required for every attack the servant makes against the master\
  \ (including area attacks, but no save is required when directing allies or controlled\
  \ creatures to attack the wearer); a failed save prevents only that single attack.\
  \ Each time the servant successfully attacks the master, he must succeed at a second\
  \ DC 16 Will save or be affected as bestow curse."
