description: "Grudge blades play a role in many of the conflicts driven by the diabolical\
  \ elite, both petty and epic. The dull, dark-gray steel of the blades almost appears\
  \ blunt on the edges, but these +1 rapiers are wickedly sharp. Each elegantly carved\
  \ hilt displays an engraved, glaring eye that appears to wink and flash as you fight.\n\
  The true power of a grudge blade reveals itself against an opponent you have already\
  \ injured with the sword. If you hit a creature with the sword on your previous\
  \ turn, you gain an extra +1 bonus on damage rolls with the sword against that creature.\
  \ As long as you continue to hit that creature at least once per round and attack\
  \ no other creatures with the grudge blade, this damage bonus continues to build,\
  \ to a maximum of +5; failing to hit that target or attacking anyone else resets\
  \ the damage bonus to +0."
