description: "The soles of these tough boots include lodestones that have been augmented\
  \ through alchemical processes to be very strong. While climbing a rope, you can\
  \ pinch the rope between the boots to prevent yourself from falling; you can release\
  \ the boots' grip by carefully twisting them apart. The boots also stick to steel,\
  \ iron, and other magnetizable surfaces.\nYou gain a +4 circumstance bonus on your\
  \ Climb checks while using the boots' magnetism to help you climb a rope or magnetic\
  \ surface. While standing on a magnetic surface, the boots grant you a +4 circumstance\
  \ bonus on Strength checks and Fortitude saving throws to avoid being blown away\
  \ by winds. Leaving a square when you the boots are attached to a magnetic surface\
  \ requires an additional 5 feet of movement, as your overland speed is effectively\
  \ reduced in exchange for the boots' assistance in climbing."
