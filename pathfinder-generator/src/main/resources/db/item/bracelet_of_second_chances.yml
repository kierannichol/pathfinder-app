description: "This bracelet is adorned with seven coral beads carved in intricate\
  \ designs. When a critical hit or sneak attack is confirmed on the wearer, as an\
  \ immediate action before damage is rolled, he can choose to convert the critical\
  \ hit into a normal hit. Each time the wearer negates a critical hit or sneak attack\
  \ in this manner, one bead shatters. When all seven are used up, the bracelet itself\
  \ crumbles into powder."
