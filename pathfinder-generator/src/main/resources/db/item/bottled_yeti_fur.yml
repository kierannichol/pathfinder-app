description: "This small opaque flask releases a thick stream of coarse white fur\
  \ when opened. This fur creeps up the user's arm and across her entire body until\
  \ she is completely covered in a tangled pelt. While coated with this fur she gains\
  \ cold resistance 5, a +2 natural armor bonus to AC, and a +4 competence bonus on\
  \ Stealth checks in areas of ice and snow. This fur sheds from her body after 24\
  \ hours, or can be removed early by soaking it in alcohol. The flask is expended\
  \ after one use."
