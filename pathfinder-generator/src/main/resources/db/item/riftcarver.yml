description: "Riftcarver is an immense weapon carved from exoskeleton plates pried\
  \ from the body of the now-long-forgotten monstrosity that birthed Deskari into\
  \ the Abyss. The demon lord emerged fully formed, and the crafting of this weapon\
  \ was among the first of his acts— Riftcarver aided the demon lord tremendously\
  \ in those first few thousand centuries of his life, and was the primary tool he\
  \ used to dig the Rasping Rifts.\nRiftcarver is a Gargantuan +5 defending unholy\
  \ wounding scythe. As part of its first successful hit against a target in any one\
  \ round, Riftcarver can infest the creature hit with rot grubs (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery\
  \ Guide 245). Once per minute as a standard action by striking at the ground, Riftcarver\
  \ can create an earthquake centered on the target's location. Riftcarver's wielder\
  \ never suffers any ill effects from earthquakes created by the scythe. Once per\
  \ day, the scythe can be swept through the air as a standard action to rip a hole\
  \ between worlds that serves as a 20-foot-diameter gate —this gate can be used only\
  \ for planar travel, not for calling creatures. Riftcarver is made of the chitin\
  \ of an Abyssal monster, yet it is treated as adamantine for the purposes of damaging\
  \ objects and penetrating hardness.\nSmaller versions of this artifact, built to\
  \ be used by Medium cultists, also exist. Called rotcarvers, the majority of these\
  \ weapons have been captured and destroyed by the crusaders by the Fifth Crusade.\
  \ A rotcarver is a +3 scythe that can infest those it strikes with rot grubs, or\
  \ can transform its user into a rot grub swarm. Rotcarvers are detailed on page\
  \ 51 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lost Kingdoms."
destruction: "If the remains of its ancient, forgotten source can be located and restored\
  \ to life, Riftcarver can be destroyed by using it to deliver a coup de grace against\
  \ that creature. If the attack slays the resurrected horror, Riftcarver crumbles\
  \ to dust."
