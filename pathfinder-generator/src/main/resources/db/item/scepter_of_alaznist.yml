description: "This scepter consists of two spiraling pieces of metal, one of iron\
  \ and the other of adamantine, twisted around one another like two snakes. Each\
  \ spiral terminates in a clenched fist.\nNine times per day, the bearer of the Scepter\
  \ of Alaznist can empower, expand, or maximize a spell she casts as though she were\
  \ using a greater empower metamagic rod, greater expand metamagic rod, or greater\
  \ maximize metamagic rod, except that she can simultaneously apply two or all three\
  \ of these metamagic effects to the same spell, expending two or three of the scepter's\
  \ daily uses, respectively. Each daily use spent when casting a spell lowers the\
  \ DC of the spell by 2 (to a maximum reduction of 6); however, this reduction doesn't\
  \ apply to evocation spells.\nThe scepter also functions as a +5 adamantine light\
  \ mace. When the wielder hits a creature, the wielder can cast a single targeted\
  \ spell of up to 3rd level on the creature, as spell-storing weapon, by expending\
  \ one of the scepter's daily uses as a swift action. The spell cast can't be empowered,\
  \ extended, or maximized by the Scepter of Alaznist, but its DC isn't lowered for\
  \ a daily use expended this way."
destruction: "The scepter unwinds into two separate nonmagical metal rods if a spellcaster\
  \ uses its metamagic properties on three consecutive rounds to cast three 9th-level\
  \ healing spells, then uses a carefully worded casting of miracle or wish to destroy\
  \ the artifact."
