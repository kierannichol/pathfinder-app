description: "This white, waxy ointment allows you to appear older or younger, and\
  \ is useful for both people who need disguises and the vain. When mixed with an\
  \ equal amount of sealing wax, it forms a gray paste that discolors and relaxes\
  \ your skin, reducing the penalty on Disguise checks to appear older than you are\
  \ by 2. When mixed with an equal amount of soap, it forms a rosy paste that clarifies\
  \ and tightens your skin, reducing the penalty on Disguise checks to appear younger\
  \ than you are by 2. An application of age ointment lasts for 1d4+1 days. Age ointment\
  \ can be used once, and the price includes the required amounts of sealing wax and\
  \ soap."
