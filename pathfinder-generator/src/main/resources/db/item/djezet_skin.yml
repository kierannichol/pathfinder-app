description: "When unattended, djezet skin appears as a curiously smooth sphere of\
  \ rust-red metal. When it's held and a command word is spoken, the armor oozes across\
  \ the wearer's body like a second skin. The armor can be removed as a free action\
  \ by stepping out of it, causing it to pool on the floor. Djezet skin acts as a\
  \ suit of +1 leather, except it is made of metal (and thus druids cannot wear it)\
  \ and has no armor check penalty and a 0% chance of arcane spell failure. Additionally,\
  \ the wearer of djezet skin gains a +5 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks to\
  \ make requests of creatures with an attitude of friendly or helpful."
