description: "This rigid, fingerless gauntlet has three blades projecting from the\
  \ gauntlet's hand. The central blade is straight and double edged, while the side\
  \ blades are curved like the prongs of a sai. You can't use the hand on which a\
  \ manople is worn for anything else. A manople takes a full-round action to don,\
  \ and gives you a +10 bonus to your CMD against disarm attempts."
