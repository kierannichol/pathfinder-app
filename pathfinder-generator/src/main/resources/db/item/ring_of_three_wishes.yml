description: "This ring is set with three rubies. Each ruby stores a wish spell, activated\
  \ by the ring. When a wish is used, that ruby disappears. For a randomly generated\
  \ ring, roll 1d3 to determine the remaining number of rubies. When all the wishes\
  \ are used, the ring becomes a nonmagical item."
