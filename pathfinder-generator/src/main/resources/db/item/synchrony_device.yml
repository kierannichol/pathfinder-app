description: "The Synchrony Device is a large, spherical mass of intertwining, spinning\
  \ rings, each covered in complex runes and sigils. Designed by the Spindle Solution\
  \ prior to Earthfall as a weapon of mass destruction, the device currently rests\
  \ in a secure research facility known as the Compass.\nActivating the Synchrony\
  \ Device involves manipulating the confusing, and often unlabeled, controls on the\
  \ control dais beneath the device while attempting a variety of Knowledge and Disable\
  \ Device checks, all of which have a minimum DC of 35. When doing so, the user sets\
  \ the device's target, selecting any location eligible as the target of a greater\
  \ teleport spell, and the plane to which the device is to be attuned from the following\
  \ options: Negative Energy Plane, Plane of Air, Plane of Earth, Plane of Fire, Plane\
  \ of Water, and Positive Energy Plane.\nWhen it detonates, the device creates a\
  \ 500-mile-radius burst, the effects of which depend on which plane it was attuned\
  \ to when activated (as detailed below). The effects of the device are instantaneous\
  \ unless otherwise noted."
destruction: "The Synchrony Device must be carefully disassembled and each ring destroyed\
  \ individually before the following ring is removed until reaching the device's\
  \ abysium core, which must be contained and disposed of separately. Activating the\
  \ device also destroys it."
