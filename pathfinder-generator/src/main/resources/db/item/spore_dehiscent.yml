description: "This pungent concoction can be thrown as a splash weapon to trigger\
  \ unsustainable spore or pollen release in fungi and plants. Any plant creature\
  \ in the square where the spore dehiscent lands must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude\
  \ save or immediately activate any of its effects based on spores or pollen, treating\
  \ itself as the target or center of the effect. Fungal hazards like russet mold\
  \ or yellow mold are activated automatically with no saving throw. Plant creatures\
  \ or hazards in squares adjacent to the square of impact must each succeed at a\
  \ DC 10 Fortitude save or suffer the same effect. Once the effect is triggered,\
  \ the creature or hazard cannot activate the effect again for 1d4 rounds or until\
  \ the effect could normally be used again, whichever is longer."
