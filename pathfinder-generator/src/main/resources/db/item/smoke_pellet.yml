description: "This small clay sphere contains two alchemical substances separated\
  \ by a thin barrier. When you break the sphere, the substances mingle and fill a\
  \ 5-foot square with a cloud of foul but harmless yellow smoke. The smoke pellet\
  \ acts as a smokestick, except the smoke only lasts for 1 round before dispersing.\
  \ You may throw a smoke pellet as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of\
  \ 10 feet."
