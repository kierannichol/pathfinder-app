description: "A common lamp illuminates a small area, providing normal light in a\
  \ 15-foot radius and increasing the light level by one step for an additional 15\
  \ feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal\
  \ light). A lamp does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light.\
  \ A lamp burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil. You can carry a lamp in one hand."
