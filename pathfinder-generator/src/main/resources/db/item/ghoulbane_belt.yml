description: "Due to the toxic nature of many environments found within the Darklands,\
  \ this belt is designed to protect its wearer from exotic diseases, paralyzing attacks,\
  \ and poisonous molds. The wearer gains a +2 bonus on saving throws to resist disease,\
  \ paralysis, and poison. This bonus increases to +4 on saving throws to resist such\
  \ effects caused by molds or slimes. Additionally, the wearer can cast a single\
  \ spell from the following list as a spell-like ability once per day: neutralize\
  \ poison, remove disease, or remove paralysis. Activating this ability is a purely\
  \ mental action that can be taken even while paralyzed or otherwise helpless. The\
  \ chosen spell affects only the belt's wearer."
