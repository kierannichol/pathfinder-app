description: "This huge, sooty cauldron has two sets of rings aligned on opposite\
  \ sides. Through these rings, large shafts can be inserted in order for two bearers\
  \ to lift and carry the cauldron. The inside of the oversized pot is caked with\
  \ baked-on residue that smells foul and is greasy to the touch. Once per day, a\
  \ horde of up to 100 orcs can consume a thick soup or gruel prepared within the\
  \ cauldron. This substance makes the orcs uncannily stealthy and difficult to track.\
  \ For the next 2 hours, any overland movement by the horde leaves few traces. When\
  \ a creature attempts a Survival check to discover the horde's tracks, the effect\
  \ negates the penalty to the DC for the number of orcs in the group.\nAny non-orc\
  \ who consumes even a single spoonful of the soup or gruel immediately become nauseated\
  \ for 10 minutes and does not gain any benefits."
