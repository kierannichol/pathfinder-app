description: "A slender copper band, a tyrant's friend is thin enough to be hidden\
  \ beneath another ring (although it still counts against the limit of magic rings\
  \ a character can wear). The ring grows noticeably warmer whenever the hand wearing\
  \ it touches a poisoned or poisonous object or creature (including containers holding\
  \ poison), warning the wearer of potential danger."
