description: "The Bound Blade is a +3 unholy adamantine bastard sword, forged from\
  \ the claws of Kazavon. For worshipers of Abadar, the Bound Blade is heresy made\
  \ manifest. The sword grants the user a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength. As a free\
  \ action, upon using the sword to reduce a sentient living creature to 0 or fewer\
  \ hit points, the wielder can cast soul bind, forcing that creature to make a successful\
  \ DC 25 Will save or have its soul trapped within the sword. While there is a soul\
  \ trapped within the sword, the Bound Blade emanates the effects of the spell desecrate\
  \ in a 50-foot-radius aura. This aura lasts for a number of days equal to the number\
  \ of Hit Dice the slain creature possessed. After that period passes, the soul within\
  \ the sword is destroyed and cannot be restored by any method short of divine intervention.\
  \ The sword wielder can release a trapped soul by using the blade's soul bind ability\
  \ on another creature."
destruction: "The Bound Blade shatters if used by a paladin of Abadar to slay a fallen\
  \ paladin dedicated to Zon-Kuthon."
