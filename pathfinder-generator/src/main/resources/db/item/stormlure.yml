description: "A stormlure is usually fashioned from pieces of creatures known for\
  \ their affinity to air—the feathers of birds, the shells of flying insects, and\
  \ the scales of a dragon. When activated, stormlures call to the wind, causing a\
  \ tempestuous gale. Once per day on command, the wearer of a stormlure is surrounding\
  \ by swirling winds for 1 minute, granting a 50% miss chance against all ranged\
  \ attacks, including rays and other ranged spells that require a roll to hit. This\
  \ wind does not hinder the wearer of the stormlure in any way. At any one time during\
  \ this duration, as a swift action, the wearer can cause the air around her to fill\
  \ with crackling lightning, dealing 4d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures\
  \ adjacent to her. A DC 14 Reflex save halves this damage."
