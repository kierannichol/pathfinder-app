description: "Used in Avistan since before Earthfall, seaxes are straight, single-edged\
  \ blades. The broken-back seax is the size of a short sword, and has a broad blade\
  \ with a distinctive trapezoidal shape. If your Strength score is less than 15,\
  \ you take a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls with a broken-back seax, as you're unable\
  \ to put enough force into the blows to land them effectively."
