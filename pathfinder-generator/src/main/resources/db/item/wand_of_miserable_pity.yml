name: "Wand of Miserable Pity"
description: "This spell functions as sanctuary, except creatures attempting to attack\
  \ the target who fail their saves also feel a strong sense of pity toward the target,\
  \ as if it were weak, pathetic, and not a threat. If the target breaks the spell\
  \ by attacking, any creature that failed its save against the spell gains a +2 morale\
  \ bonus on attack rolls against the target for 1 minute."
