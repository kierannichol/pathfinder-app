description: "This elaborate circlet of gold-and-platinum filigree bears tiny gems\
  \ in settings that look disturbingly like human eyes. When worn, the circlet lets\
  \ the wearer sense the presence of other thinking creatures in her immediate area.\
  \ The wearer gains the benefits of blindsense 30 feet, but only against creatures\
  \ with an Intelligence score that are susceptible to mind-affecting effects.\nUndead,\
  \ constructs, and mindless creatures like most oozes and vermin cannot be perceived\
  \ when using the circlet, nor can creatures under the effects of mind blank or a\
  \ ring of mind shielding.\nThe circlet does not interfere with the wearer's ability\
  \ to see normally. If the wearer has blindsense or blindsight, he is able to differentiate\
  \ creatures detected with those senses from creatures detected with the circlet\
  \ of mindsight."
