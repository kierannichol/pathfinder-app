description: "Typically engraved with numerous skulls, this small metal coffer allows\
  \ the safe transport of infectious substances of up to Tiny size. Closing the lid\
  \ seals in the contents and holds them in stasis, rendering them immune to aging\
  \ or any damage. In addition, any infectious material—such as the body of a creature\
  \ that died of disease—is preserved for as long as the coffer is closed. A death's\
  \ head coffer‘s dimensions are approximately 4 inches by 4 inches by 6 inches, so\
  \ it can potentially hold several Tiny items.\nA death's head coffer can spread\
  \ infections between items. Any item placed into a coffer with a disease-ridden\
  \ item (something capable of spreading a disease by contact) becomes infected with\
  \ the same disease. For 1 week after being removed from the coffer, the newly infected\
  \ item can spread the same affliction as the disease-ridden item to any creature\
  \ that touches it. For example, if a coin is placed into a death's head coffer with\
  \ a rat infected with the shakes, any creature that touches the coin must succeed\
  \ at a DC 13 Fortitude save or become infected with the shakes as well.\nAfter a\
  \ death's head coffer is closed and then reopened, its magic dissipates, rendering\
  \ the box completely mundane. Some death's head coffers feature complex locking\
  \ mechanisms, which require successful Disable Device checks with a DC of 30 or\
  \ higher to open."
