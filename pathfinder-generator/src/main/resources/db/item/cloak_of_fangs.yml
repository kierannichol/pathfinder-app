description: "Wearing this animal-hair cloak grants a +1 resistance bonus on saving\
  \ throws. Furthermore, the wearer can force its teeth to grow rapidly up to five\
  \ times per day as a swift action. The oversized teeth last for 1 round, during\
  \ which time the wearer can make a bite attack. Treat this attack as a primary natural\
  \ attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (or 1d4 if the wearer is Small). If the\
  \ wearer already has a bite attack, the damage of that bite attack increases by\
  \ one step (Bestiary 302)."
