description: "This thin disk of woven material is 2-1/2 inches in diameter. From its\
  \ edges protrude fine, hair-like fibers about half an inch long. A touch of avolition\
  \ is in fact an example of migo technology—as much fungus as anything else. Creatures\
  \ like mi-go can handle a touch of avolition with ease, but humanoids and other\
  \ fleshy users must wear gloves to avoid becoming the target of the item's effect.\
  \ Applying a touch of avolition requires a successful touch attack. When placed\
  \ against flesh (any living, corporeal, non-plant or non-ooze creature), a touch\
  \ of avolition's fibers swiftly merge with the target unless the creature succeeds\
  \ at a DC 15 Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim becomes paralyzed for\
  \ 7 rounds. It can attempt a new Fortitude as a standard action after the first\
  \ round to end the effect early.\nOnce a victim recovers from the paralysis effect,\
  \ the touch of avolition saps the user's willpower and dulls the senses, making\
  \ creatures under these effects easier to mentally manipulate. The victim's Wisdom\
  \ is reduced by 6 (minimum 1) as long as the touch of avolition remains attached.\
  \ The fungal filaments of a touch of avolition dig deep, and merely ripping the\
  \ patch free from the skin doesn't remove this Wisdom penalty, though the removal\
  \ itself deals 1d4 points of damage to the victim. The effect is a curse effect,\
  \ and it (and the paralysis) can be removed as such via remove curse or similar\
  \ spells.\nA touch of avolition works best when damp. The save DC to resist a dry\
  \ touch of avolition is 10, its paralysis effect lasts for only 2 rounds, and its\
  \ Wisdom penalty is reduced to 2. The effects of multiple touches of avolition do\
  \ not stack."
