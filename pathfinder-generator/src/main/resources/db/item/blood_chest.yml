description: "A blood chest is a medium-sized chest of red iron with a volume of 4\
  \ cubic feet. The metal sculpture of a monstrous fanged face surrounds the inset\
  \ superior quality lock, making it impossible to reach the lock without putting\
  \ a hand in the mouth. The chest is additionally sealed by a permanent arcane lock,\
  \ and is protected by powerful magic that makes the chest as resilient as a wall\
  \ of force.\nThe chest is attuned to a particular owner, which can be changed by\
  \ speaking a command word while the chest is open. Any key can be used in the lock,\
  \ but whenever a key is inserted, the fanged mouth closes on the hand holding it\
  \ (or on the device holding it, if some contraption is used to insert the key) and\
  \ deals 1 point of damage. If the bitten hand is that of the owner attuned to the\
  \ chest, the chest opens. If the hand belongs to anyone else, or no hand is present\
  \ to bite, or the hand is not damaged by the bite, the chest doesn't open. If the\
  \ lock is picked with a successful DC 50 Disable Device check, the teeth don't close."
