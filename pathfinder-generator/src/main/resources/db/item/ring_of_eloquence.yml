description: "Fine etchings spell out the alphabets of four languages around the inside\
  \ of this finely crafted silver band. The wearer gains the ability to speak and\
  \ understand the four languages whose alphabets are inscribed on the ring. Normally\
  \ the languages are Common, Dwarven, Elven, and Gnome. Less often, such rings are\
  \ attuned to Giant, Goblin, Orc, and Undercommon, and rings with different sets\
  \ of languages might also exist. The wearer retains the ability to speak in these\
  \ languages even if she assumes a form normally unable to do so (such as a druid\
  \ wild shaped into a wolf).\nThe ring also makes it easier for the wearer to find\
  \ the correct words to express herself, granting a +2 competence bonus on Bluff,\
  \ Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Perform (oratory) checks. Also, if the wearer is deafened\
  \ and attempts to cast a spell with a verbal component, the chance of spell failure\
  \ is reduced to 10%."
