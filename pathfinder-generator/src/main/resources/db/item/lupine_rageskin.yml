description: "This +1 leather armor consists of wolf skins sewn together with sinew.\
  \ When the wearer rages, he automatically turns into a Medium wolf, as if using\
  \ change shape (beast shape I). The armor melds with his new form as normal, but\
  \ the armor's enhancement bonus changes into a +1 enhancement bonus to her natural\
  \ armor. When the rage ends, the wearer reverts to his own form."
