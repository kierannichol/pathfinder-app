description: "These glasses look like golden teeth holding a pair of greentinted lenses.\
  \ The wearer may use eyebite 11 times per day on command, affecting one target for\
  \ each use of the spell. The wearer does not need to use these rounds consecutively,\
  \ but each activation is a standard action (unlike the spell, in which targeting\
  \ a new foe is a swift action). If the wearer removes the glasses, the eyebite effects\
  \ immediately end."
