description: "This shortbow is beautifully made and inlaid with iridescent designs,\
  \ appearing to be a +2 shortbow. When it fires its arrows, though, it does it with\
  \ so much force that the arrows are always broken on either a hit or a miss. This\
  \ bow must be used as its owner's primary ranged weapon and can only be discarded\
  \ after the owner is subject to a remove curse spell or similar effect."
