description: "This asymmetric Minkai longbow, or daikyu, is over 6 feet long, and\
  \ made of laminated bamboo, wood, and leather with a grip crafted from the hide\
  \ of an imperial dragon. The daikyu of commanding presence is a +2 seeking composite\
  \ longbow that adjusts its strength rating to match the Strength bonus of its wielder.\
  \ Once per day, the wielder of the daikyu of commanding presence can fire a single\
  \ arrow into the air, which illuminates the surrounding area with the effects of\
  \ a daylight spell for 1d6 rounds. All allies within the daylight spell's area of\
  \ increased illumination (120 feet) receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against\
  \ fear and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made as part of a charge, for the duration\
  \ of the daylight effect. If the wielder of the daikyu of commanding presence is\
  \ a cavalier or samurai, this daylight effect counts as a banner for the purpose\
  \ of the character's banner ability, and the morale bonuses are treated as for a\
  \ cavalier or samurai of five levels higher. In addition, a cavalier or samurai\
  \ wielding the daikyu of commanding presence can use his challenge ability against\
  \ a foe within the first range increment of the bow, and deals extra damage to the\
  \ target of his challenge with arrows fired from the bow.\nThe daikyu of commanding\
  \ presence is an ancestral weapon of the Higashiyama family, one of the five imperial\
  \ families of Minkai. The daikyu is imbued with royal honor, and bestows one permanent\
  \ negative level on any creature without honor who attempts to wield it (such as\
  \ oni, traitors, kinslayers, and the like). The negative level remains as long as\
  \ the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This\
  \ negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells)\
  \ while the weapon is wielded."
