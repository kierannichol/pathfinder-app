description: "A thrum of the hidden soul appears as a single, unbreakable crimson\
  \ thread. To use the thrum, you tie the thread around any Fine or smaller nonmagical\
  \ object and will your soul into the marked object. The thread disintegrates and\
  \ your soul transfers into the marked object as if it were a magic jar, leaving\
  \ your body alive but catatonic. You cannot move your body or use its senses. You\
  \ can remain within the magic jar for an unlimited amount of time, but cannot sense\
  \ your surroundings or possess any other living creature. You may return to your\
  \ original body at will. If your body is slain, you may only escape the magic jar\
  \ if your body is resurrected or else a wish, miracle, or similar effect is used\
  \ to restore you.\nWhile within the magic jar, your soul is shielded from divination\
  \ attempts. Spells such as scrying show the location of your corpse, and spells\
  \ such as divination return information consistent with your body's death. While\
  \ your soul inhabits it, the magic jar appears non-magical to divination magic,\
  \ including detect magic, identify, and legend lore."
