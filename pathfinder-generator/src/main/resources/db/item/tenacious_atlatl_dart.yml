description: "This +1 returning atlatl dart is not destroyed when used as ammunition\
  \ for an atlatl. Its returning special ability functions even if it is fired as\
  \ ammunition. Like all atlatl darts, a tenacious atlatl dart can be thrown; if it\
  \ is thrown, it is treated in all ways as a javelin. Two times per day, when the\
  \ dart successfully strikes a foe who is benefiting from an abjuration spell or\
  \ ability, the atlatl automatically attempts a dispel check against that effect,\
  \ as dispel magic, before returning to the wielder as normal."
