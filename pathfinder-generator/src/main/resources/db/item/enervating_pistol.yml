description: "Kerdak Bonefist had this +1 reliable distance pistol (Ultimate Combat\
  \ 138, 142) specially crafted for him to take advantage of his unique skeletal hand.\
  \ The pistol shows signs of wear and exposure to the elements, but its walnut stock,\
  \ nickelplated barrel, and gold accents are of fine craftsmanship, and its mechanisms\
  \ still move with precision. Ammunition fired from an enervating pistol deals an\
  \ extra 1d6 points of negative energy damage on a successful hit. On a successful\
  \ critical hit, an enervating pistol bestows a negative level on its target. One\
  \ day after being struck, subjects must make a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative\
  \ level or they become permanent. An enervating pistol bestows one permanent negative\
  \ level on any creature wielding it that is not undead or does not possess an undead\
  \ hand. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears\
  \ when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in\
  \ any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded."
