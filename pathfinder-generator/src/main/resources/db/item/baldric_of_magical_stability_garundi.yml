description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis rugged leather baldric can hold one weapon\
  \ in its sheath and has pockets sufficient to hold one of the following (or gear\
  \ of an equivalent volume): two cases of bolts, one quiver of arrows, or 40 bullets\
  \ or firearm cartridges. The wearer, as well as each item held in the baldric, gains\
  \ a +2 insight bonus on saving throws against the effects of primal magic (Pathfinder\

  \ check to prevent a primal magic event from triggering, she gains a +2 competence\
  \ bonus on the check; she can attempt the check even if she is not a spellcaster,\
  \ treating her effective caster level as 5 and applying the highest of her Intelligence,\
  \ Wisdom, and Charisma modifiers."
