description: "This otherwise plain ring is adorned with a tiny Sihedron rune. These\
  \ rings were given to agents and allies of the runelords as badges of office and\
  \ tokens of appreciation for their work—sometimes, they were given as bribes to\
  \ those a runelord was attempting to win to his cause. Like the more common Sihedron\
  \ medallion, runelords have special links to Sihedron rings that aid in scrying\
  \ and observation of the world around the wearer of the ring.\nA Sihedron ring grants\
  \ a +3 deflection bonus to AC, a +3 resistance bonus on all saving throws, and protects\
  \ the wearer with a constant endure elements effect. At will, as a standard action,\
  \ the wearer can use the Sihedron ring to change the appearance of his clothing\
  \ or armor into any other kind of clothing or armor. The actual clothing and armor\
  \ worn retain all their properties (including weight) when glamered. Only true seeing\
  \ or similar magic reveals the true nature of the adornments."
