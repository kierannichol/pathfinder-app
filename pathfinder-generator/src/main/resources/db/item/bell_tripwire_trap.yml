description: "This fine, 10-foot-long tripwire is attached to a loud bell and comes\
  \ with pitons to fix the trap in place. The trap can be set across doorways, hallways,\
  \ or narrow passes or between trees or rocks. Arming the trap properly takes 5 minutes;\
  \ it can be set up in as little as 1 minute, but doing so reduces the DC to notice\
  \ and disarm the trap by 5. The trap has the following statistics."
