description: "These sleek gloves bear a faint scaled pattern and shimmer slightly,\
  \ as if they were covered in ice crystals. While in cold or colder weather (Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Core Rulebook 444), rimeshaper gloves allow the wearer to solidify nearby\
  \ snow or ice into a light or one-handed weapon of normal quality with a hardness\
  \ of 2. Creating such a weapon takes the same amount of time that it would take\
  \ to draw it from a sheathâ€”a move action for most, but faster for a wearer with\
  \ the Quick Draw feat or a similar ability, for example. These weapons evaporate\
  \ if left unattended for 1 round; otherwise, they last for 1 minute, after which\
  \ they melt into pure liquid. Alternatively, as a move action, the wearer can cause\
  \ actual ice crystals to form over the gloves, causing them to act as masterwork\
  \ spiked gauntlets that also grant a +2 competence bonus on Climb checks. This effect\
  \ lasts until it is dismissed as a standard action. Finally, the gloves grant the\
  \ wearer cold resistance 5."
