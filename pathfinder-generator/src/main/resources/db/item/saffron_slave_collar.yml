description: "This magical slave collar (which uses the same statistics as masterwork\
  \ manacles) is reserved for particularly strongwilled slaves. When shackled around\
  \ a creature's neck, the collar targets the wearer with a calm emotions effect (Will\
  \ DC 13 negates). The wearer must attempt an additional save each minute it wears\
  \ the collar until it fails a save or removes the collar. Once active, the calming\
  \ effect of the collar remains until the collar is removed or the wearer takes a\
  \ number of points of damage equal to or greater than its Hit Dice. Once per day,\
  \ the wielder of the key to the Saffron slave collar's lock (a superior lock) can\
  \ cast suggestion on the wearer. A successful DC 14 Will saving throw negates this\
  \ effect, unless the target is subject to the calm emotions effect of the collar,\
  \ in which case it receives no saving throw."
