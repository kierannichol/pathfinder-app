description: "This bizarre +1 quilted cloth armor holds eight small vials that can\
  \ be filled with potions, poisons, or other alchemical substances, plus numerous\
  \ decoys. If the wearer is struck by a bludgeoning attack or critical hit, is grappled,\
  \ takes constrict damage, or is swallowed whole, the wearer can choose one vial\
  \ to break as an immediate action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.\
  \ The wearer must choose himself or his attacker as the target of the vial's contents,\
  \ which immediately produce their effect. If the wearer is the target, the effect\
  \ functions at half strength and for half the normal duration (minimum 1 round).\
  \ For example, a potion of cure moderate wounds broken in this manner cures half\
  \ as many hit points as normal. If the wearer's opponent is the target, the wearer\
  \ must attempt a touch attack against the opponent to apply the effect. If the attack\
  \ is successful, the opponent is affected as if struck by the vial's contents. If\
  \ the vial contains a substance that would harm the opponent only upon ingestion,\
  \ the opponent can avoid being affected if she succeeds at a DC 15 Reflex save."
