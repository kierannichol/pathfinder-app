description: "Carvings of winter scenes decorate this set of pan pipes. Activating\
  \ the pipes requires a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check. Creatures within\
  \ 30 feet gain a +2 competence bonus on caster level checks to dispel magical effects\
  \ and overcome spell resistance. Maintaining the performance is challenging, requiring\
  \ a move action and a new Perform check each round, with the DC increasing by +1\
  \ for each round the instrument is played. The magic ends when the player voluntarily\
  \ stops or fails the Perform check, after which the pipes cannot be used again for\
  \ 1 hour."
