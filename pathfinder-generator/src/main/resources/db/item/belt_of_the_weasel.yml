description: "This surprisingly soft belt has an absurdly large buckle, made even\
  \ more absurd by the fact that it's crafted in the shape of a smiling weasel's face.\
  \ It grants its wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, and the ability to move\
  \ at half normal speed while prone. Treat the enhancement bonus to Dexterity as\
  \ a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn. The wearer\
  \ does not take a penalty on melee attack rolls or to AC against melee attacks while\
  \ prone. Additionally, the wearer gains the compression ability (Bestiary 2 295)."
