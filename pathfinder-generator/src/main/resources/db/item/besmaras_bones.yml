description: "Named for the goddess of piracy, strife, and sea monsters, this figurehead\
  \ must be mounted on the prow of a ship function. Once per day, a ship carrying\
  \ Besmara's Bones can inflict a curse on an enemy ship struck with a successful\
  \ ramming attack. The target ship must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or its pilot\
  \ takes a â€“4 penalty on Profession (sailor) checks to control the ship. In addition,\
  \ the cursed ship can never gain the upper hand in ship-to-ship combat (Skull &\
  \ Shackles Player's Guide 9). The curse inflicted by the figurehead cannot be dispelled,\
  \ but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove\
  \ curse, or wish spell. In addition, once per day, Besmara's Bones can be used to\
  \ cast false life (CL 5th) on the captain of the ship carrying the figurehead. A\
  \ ship may not have more than one figurehead, magical or otherwise, mounted on it\
  \ at one time."
