description: "A set of unbalanced scales permits an unscrupulous merchant to conduct\
  \ transactions with inaccurate weight results, but still pass inspections by commerce\
  \ officials when necessary. The unbalanced scales normally provide an accurate measurement\
  \ of weight, but by means of a command word, the user can cause the set of scales\
  \ to provide a reading that is off (either lighter or heavier, as desired) by as\
  \ much as 25%."
