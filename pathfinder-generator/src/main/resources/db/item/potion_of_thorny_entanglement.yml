name: "Potion of Thorny Entanglement"
description: "This spell functions as entangle, except the plants also grow thorns\
  \ and can fling them up to 15 feet. Any creature that moves within 15 feet of the\
  \ spell's area is attacked once on its turn by the animated plants. The plants use\
  \ your caster level as their base attack bonus and add your spellcasting ability\
  \ score modifier (Intelligence for witches; Wisdom for druids, rangers, and shamans)\
  \ to the attack roll. A volley of thorns counts as a thrown weapon and deals 2d6\
  \ points of piercing damage on a successful hit. A creature that enters the spell's\
  \ area or ends its turn there automatically takes 2d6 points of piercing damage."
