description: "This black-and-gray wool coat sports over a dozen pockets on its front\
  \ alone and even more line the insides. Interdimensional magic causes anything placed\
  \ in one pocket to immediately appear in another randomly determined pocket. A character\
  \ wearing this coat gains a +5 circumstance bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to hide\
  \ a small object on her body. However, if a character wearing a coat of pockets\
  \ places anything in one of the coat's pockets, she must spend a standard action\
  \ to retrieve it (rather than a move action)."
