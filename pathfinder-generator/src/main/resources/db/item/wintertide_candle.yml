description: "Even though this translucent, 1-foot-long candle resembles an icicle,\
  \ it refuses to melt when exposed to any normal heat source. When lit, the candle\
  \ transmutes its material composition from wax into gleaming divine ice (frozen\
  \ holy water like that produced by holy ice). The flame of the candle is cool and\
  \ radiates violet-blue light. Lighting the candle is a standard action, and anyone\
  \ adjacent to it can extinguish the flame as a free action. The candle can burn\
  \ for 10 rounds (need not be consecutive) before the ice is entirely consumed.\n\
  While the candle is burning, it emits an aura of divine cold in a 30-foot radius.\
  \ The candle modifies the effect of any channeled positive or negative energy that\
  \ originates inside the aura, and of any cure or inflict spell cast inside the aura.\
  \ Instead of their normal effects, these abilities deal an amount of cold damage\
  \ equal to the number of hit points they would normally cure or inflict. A target\
  \ that succeeds at a Fortitude save (using the normal DC for the ability or spell)\
  \ instead takes half damage.\nA bearer can hurl the lit candle at an enemy as a\
  \ ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet, causing the candle to explode\
  \ into a burst of chilled holy water. A creature struck in this manner is numbed\
  \ by divine cold, becoming staggered for half the remaining time that the candle\
  \ could burn (Fortitude DC 17 negates). An undead creature or evil outsider struck\
  \ in this manner also takes 1d4 points of damage for each remaining round that the\
  \ candle could continue burning, as if it were hit by holy water (no saving throw)."
