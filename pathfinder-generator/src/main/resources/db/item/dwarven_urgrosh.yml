description: "A dwarven urgrosh is a double weaponâ€” an axe head and a spear point\
  \ on opposite ends of a long haft. The urgrosh's axe head is a slashing weapon that\
  \ deals 1d8 points of damage. Its spear head is a piercing weapon that deals 1d6\
  \ points of damage. You can use either head as the primary weapon; the other becomes\
  \ the off-hand weapon. If you use an urgrosh against a charging character, the spear\
  \ head is the part of the weapon that deals damage. Dwarves treat dwarven urgroshes\
  \ as martial weapons."
