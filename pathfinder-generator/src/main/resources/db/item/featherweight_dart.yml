description: "These extremely small and lightweight darts function like blowgun darts,\
  \ except they are used to deliver poisons surreptitiously instead of dealing damage.\
  \ When you hit with a dart, the poison is injected into the target while the dart\
  \ breaks off and falls away, leaving the wound hard to spot. Any amount of damage\
  \ reduction, hardness, or similar protection prevents the featherweight dart from\
  \ delivering its injected poison. Anyone examining the target must succeed at a\
  \ DC 20 Perception check to find the puncture wound, while finding the dart itself\
  \ at the location where it fell requires a successful DC 15 Perception check. This\
  \ ammunition can be used in both blowguns and wrist launchers."
