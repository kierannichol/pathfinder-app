description: "This massive, imposing +2 spell resistance (13) tower shield is a metal\
  \ bulwark engraved with the main edicts of the Laws of Man. The spell resistance\
  \ special ability of this shield works only against divine spells and does not ward\
  \ the bearer against arcane magic. While held, the shield grants a +4 resistance\
  \ bonus on Fortitude saving throws against divine spells and spell-like abilities.\n\
  Three times per day as a swift action, when the wielder of a guard of man is in\
  \ the area of channeled energy (regardless of whether she is excluded by an effect\
  \ such as Selective Channeling), she can rebuke the god powering the ability. Using\
  \ this ability causes the text on the guard of man to glow and decreases the amount\
  \ of channeled energy by half (minimum 1). This reduction affects the channeled\
  \ energy itself, and thus reduces the effect on all targets within its area. The\
  \ power of the channeled energy can be further reduced with a successful Will saving\
  \ throw, as normal."
