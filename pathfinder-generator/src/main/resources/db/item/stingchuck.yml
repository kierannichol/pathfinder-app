description: "A stingchuck is a foul bag made of a humanoid's head with the brain\
  \ removed and the skull heavily scored so that it bursts open when thrown. Normally\
  \ filled with biting vermin, it acts as a splash weapon. When it hits, the vermin\
  \ bite and sting the target, dealing 1d6 points of damage and forcing a DC 11 Fortitude\
  \ save to avoid being nauseated for 1d3 rounds. Each round a creature remains nauseated\
  \ by a stingchuck, it takes 1 additional point of damage from the biting vermin.\
  \ All creatures within the splash effect take 1 point of damage from the vermin\
  \ but do not risk being nauseated."
