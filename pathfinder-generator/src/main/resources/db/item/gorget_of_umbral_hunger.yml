description: "This intricately decorated bronze necklace fits tightly across the neck\
  \ and houses a ruby in its center. Whenever the wearer of the necklace is in an\
  \ area of dim light or darkness, including magical darkness, the ruby begins to\
  \ glow and grants the wearer fast healing 1. The necklace can restore up to 20 hit\
  \ points per day, after which its fast healing effect ends and the gorget becomes\
  \ inert until its magic resets the next day. This fast healing can restore hit points\
  \ regardless of the source of the damage, but the wearer detects as an evil creature\
  \ while the gorget's fast healing ability is active. This has no long-term effect\
  \ on the wearer's alignment."
