description: "You summon a swarm of bats, rats, or spiders (your choice), which attacks\
  \ all other creatures within its area. (You may summon the swarm so that it shares\
  \ the area of other creatures.) If no living creatures are within its area, the\
  \ swarm attacks or pursues the nearest creature as best it can. The caster has no\
  \ control over its target or direction of travel."
