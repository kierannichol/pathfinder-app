description: "When burned, this stick of incense releases a sharp smell and fills\
  \ the surrounding air with bright orange and golden motes. A creature that lights\
  \ this incense (a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity)\
  \ and breathes the smoke for 1 minute gains the fire subtype for 1 hour. This grants\
  \ the creature immunity to fire and vulnerability to cold for the duration of the\
  \ effect. The price listed is for a single stick of incense, which is enough for\
  \ only one creature to use and benefit from as described."
