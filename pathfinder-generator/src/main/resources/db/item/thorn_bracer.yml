description: "These sturdy leather bracers are studded with lacquered rose thorns\
  \ that can be used to pierce foes. You can attack with these bracers even while\
  \ holding objects in your hands. When attacking with thorn bracers, you lose any\
  \ shield bonus to AC gained from a readied shield until your next action. A thorn\
  \ bracer can be used to make an offhand attack if you aren't wielding a weapon or\
  \ shield in that hand."
