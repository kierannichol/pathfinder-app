description: "This adamantine quill pen is the greatest weapon Mephistopheles has\
  \ in the corruption of souls. As a full-round action that does not provoke attacks\
  \ of opportunity, he can use it to inscribe a magic circle against good (or chaos),\
  \ place a mark of justice, or pen an infernal contract. These contracts can grant\
  \ any number of boons, but typically do so in the form of a wish spell or the devilbound\
  \ template"
destruction: "If Visineir is used to pen a contract that results in Asmodeus having\
  \ to void the creation of Mephistopheles, the quill crumbles away to ashes, as does\
  \ Mephistopheles himself."
