description: "Often extracted from phosphorescent insects, tiny marine plants, or\
  \ subterranean fungi, glowing ink emits a faint but steady light (typically red\
  \ or green) that allows you to read it in normal darkness—this includes darkness\
  \ created by spells like darkness, but not the supernatural darkness created by\
  \ deeper darkness. If there is glowing ink on an object, you have a +2 bonus on\
  \ Perception checks to locate it. Mixing glowing ink with marker dye makes the dye\
  \ glow in the dark until it fades."
