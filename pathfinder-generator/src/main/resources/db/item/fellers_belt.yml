description: "The secret weapons of the Lumber Consortium's enforcers throughout Andoran,\
  \ these belts nominally appear as expensive but effective aids for felling trees,\
  \ but are instead used by the Consortium's enforcers. A creature wearing a feller's\
  \ belt gains +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks to sunder wooden objects, ignores\
  \ any hardness possessed by wooden objects, and bypasses the damage reduction of\
  \ any creatures of the plant or fey type. A creature wearing a feller's belt for\
  \ over 24 hours doubles the critical threat range of any held axe, as though that\
  \ weapon possessed the keen weapon special ability. This benefit lasts for as long\
  \ as the belt is worn, and doesn't stack with any other effects that expand the\
  \ critical threat range of a weapon (such as keen edge or the Improved Critical\
  \ feat)."
