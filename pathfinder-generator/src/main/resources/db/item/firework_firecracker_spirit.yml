description: "These firecrackers are covered in magical runes and are mixed with ghost\
  \ salt. One round after you light a spirit firecracker in an adjacent square, the\
  \ firework detonates and deals 1d4+1 points of damage to incorporeal creatures in\
  \ the same space. In addition, an affected incorporeal creature with light sensitivity,\
  \ light blindness, or sunlight powerlessness becomes blinded for 1 round. A spirit\
  \ firecracker has no effect on corporeal creatures."
