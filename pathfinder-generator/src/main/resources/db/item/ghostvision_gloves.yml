description: "These gloves are made of pale gray silk; each is adorned with an embroidered\
  \ silver eye on the back. Once per day the wearer may activate them, as a standard\
  \ action, by bowing her head and pressing her hands to her eyes. The embroidered\
  \ silver eyes flare and open, and when the wearer lowers her hands, deep pools of\
  \ swirling gray mist hide her own eyes and allow her to more clearly see the restless\
  \ dead for the next 10 rounds. While active, ghostvision gloves grant the following\
  \ effects."
