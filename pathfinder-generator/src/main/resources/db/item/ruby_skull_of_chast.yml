description: "This human skull covered in red lacquer bears a holy symbol of Pharasma.\
  \ The area around the Ruby Skull of Chast is treated as though a hallow spell had\
  \ been cast upon it, with the skull as the point of origin. Creatures that are lawful\
  \ neutral or worship Pharasma gain the benefit of death ward while in the area of\
  \ this effect. Despite its powerful effect, the Ruby Skull of Chast does not register\
  \ to detect good, detect magic, or similar divination spells unless the caster of\
  \ the divination succeeds at a DC 20 caster level check."
