description: "This +1 thundering pepperbox (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 138) bears\
  \ a fire-breathing dragon motif, and its wooden grip is ornately carved. Unlike\
  \ a normal pepperbox, each of the six barrels of a doubleshot pepperbox can be fired\
  \ either independently in tandem, firing two barrels with the same action like a\
  \ double-barreled pistol. If two barrels are shot at once, they must both be fired\
  \ at the same target, and the wielder takes a â€“4 penalty on each shot."
