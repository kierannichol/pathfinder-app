description: "This multi-chambered clockwork device is about the size of an ogre's\
  \ fist. Tiny mechanisms whir and grind, powering a constant thump reminiscent of\
  \ a heartbeat. When placed upon the chest of a humanoid creature, the Heart of Nhur\
  \ Athemon phases into the chest cavity, consuming and replacing the user's natural\
  \ heart, and granting the user a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution. Anyone who\
  \ touches the Heart of Nhur Athemon must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be compelled\
  \ to place the heart against her chest (this is a mind-affecting compulsion effect).\n\
  A successful DC 30 caster level check made as part of a remove curse spell or similar\
  \ effect forces the Heart of Nhur Athemon to phase out of its host's chest. Because\
  \ the Heart of Nhur Athemon consumes its host's natural heart, destroying or expelling\
  \ the item while it is keeping a character alive kills the character 1 round after\
  \ it's removed, unless a restoration spell is immediately applied to the host.\n\
  The heart is also the phylactery of the Azlanti lich Nhur Athemon. If Nhur Athemon\
  \ is destroyed, the phylactery immediately begins to rebuild the lich's body nearby.\
  \ The process takes 1d10 days, and begins anew if interrupted so long as the phylactery\
  \ is not destroyed."
destruction: "The heart must be thrown into the chasm in area N7 or targeted with\
  \ a transmute metal to wood spell."
