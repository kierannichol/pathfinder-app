description: "A ring of curved fangs circles the tip of this 7-foot-long bone staff.\
  \ When magic mouth is cast from the staff, the resulting illusory mouth is filled\
  \ with countless needle-like fangs. After magic mouth is cast, one charge remains\
  \ drained from the staff and can't be recharged until the user dismisses the spell\
  \ or until the spell discharges.\nWhen casting beast shape I from the staff, the\
  \ caster can choose only creatures with bite attacks, and the user's bite attacks\
  \ deal damage as if the assumed shape were two sizes larger.\nThe staff allows the\
  \ use of the following spells."
