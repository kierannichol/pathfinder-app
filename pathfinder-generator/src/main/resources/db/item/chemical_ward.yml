description: "This gray paste congeals when spread onto a surface, gradually changing\
  \ color to match its surroundings. When applied, its reagents bond with chemicals\
  \ in the environment, exuding a magnified aura that can fool blindsight and blindsense.\
  \ This affects only blindsight or blindsense based on smell, taste, vibration, and\
  \ similar senses; it does not affect extraordinary sight, hearing, or tremorsense.\
  \ Applying a flask of chemical ward to the edge of a 5-foot square takes a full-round\
  \ action, creating an opaque barrier against blindsense and blindsight that lasts\
  \ for 1 hour. A creature can sense through the barrier with a successful Perception\
  \ check (DC 15 for blindsight, 20 for blindsense), although individuals on the opposite\
  \ side of the barrier can attempt Stealth checks against the creature's blindsight\
  \ or blindsense as though they had concealment. The barrier does not inhibit movement."
