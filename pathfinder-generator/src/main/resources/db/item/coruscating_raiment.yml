description: "Originally crafted by jyoti armorsmiths of the Positive Energy Plane,\
  \ this gleaming suit of +1 radiant full plate has a mirror-like sheen that reflects\
  \ even tiny sparks of light into brilliant ribbons of blazing color. Its ability\
  \ to shine as brightly as a torch cannot be suppressed unless the wearer is in magical\
  \ darkness. Once per day as an immediate action while charging, the wearer can transform\
  \ her body into brilliant light. The wearer becomes incorporeal until she arrives\
  \ at the end of her charge and makes her physical attacks, and she can charge through\
  \ any creatures and obstacles that do not hinder incorporeal creatures (although\
  \ she must have line of sight to her target when she begins her charge, as normal)."
