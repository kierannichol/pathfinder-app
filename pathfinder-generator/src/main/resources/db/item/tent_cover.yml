description: "When fastened over a normal tent, this sheet of resilient waterproof\
  \ animal gut provides an additional layer of protection against harsh weather and\
  \ pestering insects. Attaching the cover requires 1 minute of work. The occupants\
  \ of a tent that is fitted with the cover gain a +5 circumstance bonus on saves\
  \ to resist the adverse effects of dust storms, rain, snow, and other harmful weather\
  \ conditions. The occupants also gain DR 5/â€” against swarm damage caused by swarms\
  \ composed of Diminutive or smaller creatures outside the tent. If an occupant takes\
  \ no damage from a swarm as a result of this DR, she is not affected by the swarm's\
  \ distraction ability. The swarm can attempt a DC 20 Reflex save as a full-round\
  \ action to enter the tent and deal full damage in subsequent rounds."
