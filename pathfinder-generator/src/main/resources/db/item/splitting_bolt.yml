description: "When this +1 bolt hits a foe, it deals damage as normal and then splits\
  \ in two, creating two smaller bolts. Each of these smaller bolts flies toward another\
  \ target within 30 feet of the initial enemy struck. A single splitting bolt can\
  \ thus strike up to three targets. The smaller bolts use the same attack roll result\
  \ as the original splitting bolt and the same damage dice, though the damage for\
  \ each bolt is rolled separately. Neither the attack roll nor the damage of the\
  \ smaller bolts can be affected by any special abilities of the wielder or crossbow."
