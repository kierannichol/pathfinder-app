description: "As a standard action, this +1 seeking light crossbow can generate bolts\
  \ of force that briefly harden to anchor on corners and walls of structures, trailing\
  \ a line of force that connects the bolt to the crossbow. As a move action, the\
  \ wielder of the weapon can pull the crossbow to the anchor, swiftly carrying the\
  \ wielder to the anchor point. The bolt of force has a maximum range of 80 feet,\
  \ and can anchor only to a structure study enough to support the wielder's weight.\
  \ If there is not a platform appropriate for the wielder to land on next to the\
  \ anchor, the wielder must succeed at a Climb check (DC appropriate to climbing\
  \ the surface the bolt of force is anchored to) or immediately fall. The bolt of\
  \ force disappears in 1d4 rounds, just after the crossbow is drawn to it (the wielder\
  \ has time to land), or when the next bolt of force is fired, whichever comes first.\
  \ The bolts of force deal no damage, and creatures other than the wielder are unaffected\
  \ by them."
