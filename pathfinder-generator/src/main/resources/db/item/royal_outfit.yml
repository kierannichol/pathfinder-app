description: "Royal clothes are ostentatious, with gems, gold, silk, and fur in abundance.\
  \ A royal outfit is rarely designed for regular wear or inclement weather—or even\
  \ for donning unaided—as it's presumed that anyone who might be wearing it has plenty\
  \ of servants to take care of his or her every need. This outfit includes only the\
  \ clothing, not a royal scepter, crown, ring, or other regal accoutrements."
