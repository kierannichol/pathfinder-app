description: "This intimidating mantle of gold and silver is set with several large\
  \ gems, which seem to change in cut and type of stone every time it's viewed. The\
  \ wearer of this mantle always appears to be clean, uninjured, and calm, granting\
  \ him a +5 bonus on Diplomacy checks. Also, once per day as a standard action, the\
  \ wearer can bellow a single word in a thundering, imperious tone. This functions\
  \ as the spell shout, and the word can be heard by any creature within 200 feet.\
  \ If this word is one of the five orders detailed by the spell command, in addition\
  \ to the effects of shout, all creatures within 25 feet must make a DC 16 Will save\
  \ or be affected as if by the spell command. Those damaged by shout take a –4 penalty\
  \ on this Will save."
