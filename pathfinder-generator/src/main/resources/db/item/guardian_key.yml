description: "This simple-looking key seems to be carved crudely from stone, but is\
  \ in fact a sort of skeleton key that can be used to wind all clockwork constructs\
  \ swiftly and efficiently. Originally, the key allowed the carrier to command limitless\
  \ numbers of clockworks simultaneously. With this key, Xin could command his entire\
  \ clockwork army effortlessly, and its use was key to his power over Thassilon.\
  \ But when Xin used it as an element in the clockwork reliquary's construction,\
  \ the key's powers were vastly diminished. Xin accepted this as a necessity, since\
  \ if all had gone according to plan, he would still be able to command his army\
  \ using his new body. The diminished key can be recovered from the destroyed reliquary's\
  \ remains.\nThe guardian key can fit into any clockwork construct's keyhole, and\
  \ fully winds a clockwork with a single turn made as a move action. Clockworks wound\
  \ by the guardian key are healed of 5d8+20 points of damage, remain active for 10\
  \ times longer than they normally would, and during this period gain a +2 bonus\
  \ on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. The guardian key can also be\
  \ used to seize control of a clockwork. To do so, a creature must attempt a touch\
  \ attack against the target clockwork as a standard action. If it hits, the clockwork\
  \ can attempt a DC 15 Will save to resist. If the clockwork's save fails, that clockwork\
  \ regards the key's carrier as its creator, and follows that person's commands to\
  \ the letter—provided the commands are spoken in Thassilonian. The guardian key\
  \ can control only one construct at a time. If it is used to control a second clockwork,\
  \ the previous one is released from its duties immediately."
destruction: "The guardian key must be steeped in the tears of a wistful clockwork\
  \ lover and then used by that clockwork to unwind itself permanently."
