name: "Potion of Saddle Surge"
description: "You and your mount form a perfect synergy that endows both of you with\
  \ advantages based upon how far you travel each round. For every 5 feet your mount\
  \ moves in a given round, you gain a +1 competence bonus on Ride checks and both\
  \ you and your mount gain a +1 morale bonus on damage rolls made with weapons or\
  \ natural attacks for 1 round. For instance, if your mount traveled 40 feet in a\
  \ round, you would gain a +8 bonus on Ride checks and you and your mount would both\
  \ gain a +8 bonus on damage rolls for 1 round, to a maximum bonus equal to your\
  \ caster level. You must be mounted to enjoy the benefits of this spell. If you\
  \ dismount, get knocked off, or take any other action that separates you from your\
  \ mount, the spell immediately ends."
