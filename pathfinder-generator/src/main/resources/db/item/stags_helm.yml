description: "This striking helmet is crafted to resemble the skull of a mighty stag.\
  \ Although made from bone, the antlers and helm are as strong as metal. When worn,\
  \ the helm greatly enhances eyesight and hearing, granting a +2 competence bonus\
  \ on Perception checks. In addition, once per day the helm may be called upon to\
  \ enhance any ranged attack made by the wearer to make an insightful shot. Activating\
  \ this ability is a free action, and once activated, your next ranged attack against\
  \ a target within 30 feet is made as if that target were flat-footed against youâ€”\
  this allows a rogue to gain the benefit of sneak attack with this shot. If you don't\
  \ make a ranged attack within 1 round of activating this power, the insight fades\
  \ and is wasted for that day.\nA worshiper of Erastil who wears this helm may utilize\
  \ the insightful shot ability up to 3 times per day."
