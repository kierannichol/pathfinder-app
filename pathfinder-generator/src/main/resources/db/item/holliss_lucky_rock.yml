description: "This stone of good luck is weathered and resembles nothing so much as\
  \ a hard piece of shale. The stone can cast good hope once per day, and its bearer\
  \ gains a +2 insight bonus on saving throws against fear effects and effects with\
  \ the emotion descriptor (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 137). The stone is very\
  \ chatty, making friendly observations about its bearer and offering unsolicited\
  \ advice about the bearer's current situation. The stone speaks with a slight drawl\
  \ and uses simple words, but its advice is usually quite sound. Around obvious followers\
  \ of Zon-Kuthon, the stone is instead silent and shudders slightly."
