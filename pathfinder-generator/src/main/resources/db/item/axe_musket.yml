description: "This short musket features an axe blade at the end of its barrel. It\
  \ can be used as both a musket and a battleaxe. It is considered a double weapon\
  \ for the purposes of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon. If\
  \ this firearm gains the broken condition, both the firearm component and the axe\
  \ are considered broken. An axe musket uses either a bullet and a single dose of\
  \ black powder or an alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm."
