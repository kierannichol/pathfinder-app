name: "Scroll of Icy Prison"
description: "You trap the target in solid ice 1 inch thick per caster level. If the\
  \ creature fails its save, it is helpless, but can still breathe (the ice blocks\
  \ line of effect to the target). If the target makes its save, it gains the entangled\
  \ condition but can otherwise act normally. Whether or not the target saves, it\
  \ takes 1 point of cold damage per caster level each round it is helpless or entangled\
  \ in the ice. The ice has hardness 0 and 3 hit points per inch of thickness; if\
  \ broken, the creature is freed. A creature can break the ice as a full-round action\
  \ with a successful Strength check (DC 15 + your caster level)."
