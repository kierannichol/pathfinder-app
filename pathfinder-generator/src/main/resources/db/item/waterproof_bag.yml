description: "This leather sack sealed with tar or pitch keeps delicate items from\
  \ being ruined by water. Items kept inside remain relatively dry, making the bag\
  \ ideal for carrying maps, scrolls, spellbooks, and the like, although the bag is\
  \ not impervious and can only be completely immersed for 10 rounds before enough\
  \ water seeps in to ruin such items."
