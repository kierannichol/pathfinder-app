description: "The Thorncrown of Iomedae functions as a major crown of blasting that\
  \ grants the wearer a deflection bonus to her Armor Class equal to her Charisma\
  \ modifier. In the hands of a paladin, the Thorncrown reveals its true powers, bursting\
  \ into flames and spinning above the wearer's head in a halo of divine power. Paladins\
  \ of any faith who wear the Thorncrown have their class abilities enhanced for as\
  \ long as they wear it, gaining three additional mercies (from levels they have\
  \ access to but have not selected), healing the maximum amount possible every time\
  \ they use lay on hands, and gaining a number of additional uses of smite evil equal\
  \ to their Charisma modifier. Additionally, if a paladin wearing the Thorncrown\
  \ is slain, she may choose to instantly be restored to full hit points for a number\
  \ of minutes equal to her Charisma modifier. She may act as normal for this period,\
  \ but at the end of this time she dies and cannot be restored by any means short\
  \ of a miracle cast by a cleric of her faith.\nThe Thorncrown of Iomedae bestows\
  \ two negative levels on any evil creature that wears it. These negative levels\
  \ remain as long as the Thorncrown is held or worn—though they never result in actual\
  \ level loss, they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells)\
  \ while the creature possesses the Thorncrown. Additionally, paladins who either\
  \ break their code of conduct while wearing the Thorncrown or do not have access\
  \ to their class features when they don the artifact must succeed at a DC 30 Will\
  \ save or instantly be disintegrated. Those slain by the Thorncrown cannot be brought\
  \ back to life by clerics with good or lawful components to their alignment—their\
  \ spells simply fail—though clerics of other alignments can restore a paladin as\
  \ normal. Even those who succeed at this save are treated as though they were evil\
  \ creatures and gain negative levels. Paladins who receive atonement can wear the\
  \ Thorncrown again without fear of ill effects."
destruction: "If a paladin temporarily restored to life by the Thorncrown of Iomedae\
  \ forsakes her deity and, of her own free will, swears herself to an evil force,\
  \ the crown consumes the wearer in holy flames, destroying itself and its wearer\
  \ utterly. Nothing can restore a traitorous paladin killed in this way."
