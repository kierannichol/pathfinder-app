description: "This ballista bolt consists of dozens of small steel darts, called flechettes,\
  \ which break away after the bolt is released. If the bolt impacts anything before\
  \ it reaches a distance of 30 feet, it deals 1d8 points of damage. Between 30 and\
  \ 60 feet away, the flechettes deploy, dealing piercing damage to every creature\
  \ and object within a 30-foot-cone burst. After 60 feet, the flechettes lose momentum\
  \ and fall harmlessly to the ground.\nSeparate attack rolls must be made against\
  \ each target hit by the burst. Light ballista flechettes deal 2d8 points of damage,\
  \ while heavy ballista flechettes deal 3d8 points. Additionally, any winged creature\
  \ hit by flechettes has several holes punched in its wings, and has its fly speed\
  \ reduced by 10 feet. The creature takes a â€“4 penalty on Fly checks until the damage\
  \ is healed."
