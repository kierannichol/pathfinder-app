description: "This silver necklace holds a miniature gilded cage, meant to rest against\
  \ the wearer's chest. Once per day as a full-round action, the wearer can absorb\
  \ a single willing Tiny or Small animal into the necklace. Absorbed creatures appear\
  \ within the cage as miniature versions of themselves rendered in silver. The animal\
  \ is effectively in stasis and can't communicate, perceive the world around it,\
  \ or grant any abilities or bonuses (such as a familiar's skill bonus) while absorbed.\
  \ Animal companions, familiars, or mounts can enter the cage without problem, but\
  \ coercing other animals into the cage requires a successful DC 20 Handle Animal\
  \ check. Only one animal can inhabit the pendant at a time.\nThe wearer can causes\
  \ the animal to reappear within 10 feet by speaking a command word and opening the\
  \ door of the cage as a standard action. A creature can remain within the cage for\
  \ 48 hours, after which it is forcibly ejected and must wait 24 hours before reentering\
  \ the cage. If a best friend pendant is destroyed, any held animal is immediately\
  \ ejected and is stunned for 1d4+1 rounds. A creature must be wearing the best friend\
  \ pendant in order to activate the item (for either of its uses), but can freely\
  \ remove or don the item while an animal is stored within."
