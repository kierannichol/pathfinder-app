description: "This rope is 100 feet long and can perform all the functions of a rope\
  \ of climbing. Furthermore, upon command the rope of knots snakes out and knots\
  \ itself into a rope structure. The rope can tie itself into any structure which\
  \ can be created out of 100 feet of rope. Possible structures include (but are not\
  \ limited to) a sturdy rope bridge up to 25 feet long, a 10-foot-square net or hammock,\
  \ or a 40-foot-tall rope ladder. The rope takes up to 10 rounds to create a complex\
  \ structure or half that time to return itself to a simple coil. The rope has hardness\
  \ 1 and 20 hit points. It repairs damage to itself at a rate of 2 hit points every\
  \ 10 minutes."
