description: "A sinner's wage is a round golden coin with two blank faces. When placed\
  \ among nonmagical currency, it adopts the size, shape, and any embellishments (such\
  \ as an engraving or stamp) of the majority of the other coins.\nWhen included as\
  \ payment for any service that compromises the recipient's morals (such as a bribe\
  \ for a lawful city guard to look the other way, or a contribution to a good politician\
  \ to pass dubious legislation), a sinner's wage makes the offered payment more tempting.\
  \ The giver of the sinner's wage gains a +2 profane bonus on Charisma checks and\
  \ Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks to convince the recipient to perform the\
  \ service in question. Thus, the item can be used to pay off a guard as well as\
  \ convince an outsider to perform a service with a planar binding spell (in the\
  \ latter case, the +2 profane bonus stacks with the bonus normally granted for offering\
  \ a reward to the outsider).\nIn addition, a sinner's wage can be used as an optional\
  \ focus component when the owner casts any charm or compulsion spell of 5th level\
  \ or lower. When a creature is subject to a spell incorporating this focus, it takes\
  \ a –2 penalty on all rolls to resist acting against its nature (whether a Will\
  \ saving throw or a Charisma check). Using the sinner's wage in this fashion temporarily\
  \ drains the magic from the coin, rendering it unusable for any purpose for a period\
  \ of 1 week."
