description: "This giant pearl is carved with entwined flying dragons and strung on\
  \ a fine silver chain; the pearl changes size according to the size of the wearer\
  \ so that its diameter is no greater than the wearer's thumb. Once per day, the\
  \ wearer can breathe a cone of searing flame that functions as burning hands, except\
  \ it deals electricity damage instead of fire.\nIf the dragon god Apsu is the wearer's\
  \ patron, once per day the wearer can use eagle's splendor. On command, the orb\
  \ glows with a light spell or darkens again."
