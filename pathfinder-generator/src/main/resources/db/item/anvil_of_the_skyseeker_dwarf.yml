description: "The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of\
  \ the indicated race or ethnicity.\nThis small mithral anvil is sized for fine jewelry\
  \ work and small enough for adventurers to carry. A command word causes it to grow\
  \ large enough for crafting weapons and armor; a second command word causes it to\
  \ shrink again. When enlarged, the anvil is a typical heavy anvil of mithral, weighing\
  \ 200 pounds. When a dwarf crafts a magic item on the anvil while adventuring, she\
  \ gains full progress for the hours she spends, rather than half."
