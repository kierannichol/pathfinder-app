description: "Each spell inscribed in this book becomes a greater glyph of warding\
  \ (DC 19, spell glyph) containing the spell recorded. When an unauthorized person\
  \ reads a spell, the glyph triggers against him. This destroys the pages on which\
  \ the spell is written, but leaves the rest of the book unharmed. Pages containing\
  \ harmless spells or spells that can't be attached to a glyph are unaffected."
