description: "This slim book is carefully but amateurishly bound, with leather stretched\
  \ tight across thin boards. The writing inside is fussy and crammed together, with\
  \ words that are occasionally illegible. Eight of its pages contain spells; the\
  \ final 10 pages are blank. A portrait of a plain woman, unsmiling, has been bound\
  \ into the inside front cover."
