description: "This priestly garment can be commanded to alter its appearance as a\
  \ standard action, able to reshape itself into ceremonial garb or the everyday habit\
  \ of a religious functionary of any faith. Vestments of false faith are always emblazoned\
  \ with the holy symbol and colors of the faith chosen by the wearer, and she can\
  \ disguise an object held in a hand as a holy symbol, censer, candle, or similar\
  \ item of religious paraphernalia. This change is a visual illusion (glamer) effect\
  \ akin to disguise self.\nThe wearer of vestments of false faith gains a +10 bonus\
  \ on Disguise checks to impersonate a member of the faith she has chosen (this doesn't\
  \ stack with disguise self and similar effects). She also gains a +5 competence\
  \ bonus on Use Magic Device checks to activate items that duplicate divine spells\
  \ or emulate a specific religion or alignment, provided they fit the religion she's\
  \ imitating. If she uses a magic item to produce the effect of a divine spell, she\
  \ can make it appear to observers as though she were casting the spell, though a\
  \ Spellcraft check to identify the spell being cast can identify it as coming from\
  \ a magic item if the result exceeds the DC by 5 or more.\nThe wearer's alignment\
  \ is disguised while wearing vestments of false faith, so that it appears identical\
  \ to that of the deity whose holy symbol she bears, and her aura is as strong as\
  \ if she had a number of cleric levels equal to her Hit Dice. This primarily affects\
  \ alignment detection; however, once per day as an immediate action, she can function\
  \ as if she actually had that alignment when she would normally be affected by an\
  \ alignment-based effect, such as blasphemy, chaos hammer, forbiddance, or an unholy\
  \ magic weapon. This effect persists until the end of the wearer's next turn, after\
  \ which any non-instantaneous effects (such as smite evil) suddenly revert to having\
  \ the effects they would normally have on a creature of her true alignment."
