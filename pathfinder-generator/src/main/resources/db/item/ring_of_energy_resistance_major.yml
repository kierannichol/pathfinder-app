description: "Rings of this type come in a wide variety of designs and colorations,\
  \ typically related to the types of energy they defend against. These rings continually\
  \ protect their wearers from damage from one type of energy—acid, cold, electricity,\
  \ fire, or sonic (chosen by the creator of the item; determine randomly if found\
  \ as part of a treasure hoard). Each time the wearer would normally take such damage,\
  \ subtract the ring's resistance value from the damage dealt.\nA minor ring of energy\
  \ resistance grants 10 points of resistance. A major ring of energy resistance grants\
  \ 20 points of resistance. A greater ring of energy resistance grants 30 points\
  \ of resistance."
