description: "This steel tankard functions as a +1 light hammer. Worshipers of Cayden\
  \ Cailean are automatically proficient with it. The interior of the tankard contains\
  \ six identical extradimensional spaces. Each space can hold 1 dose of a different\
  \ potable liquid of up to 1/2 cubic foot in volume (including potions, but not poisons).\
  \ Liquid never sloshes out of the these spaces accidentally (though it often appears\
  \ ready to do so), and when the wielder drinks from the tankard, it provides the\
  \ drink from the desired extradimensional pocket (or a random pocket, if the wielder\
  \ has no preference)."
