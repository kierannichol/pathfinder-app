description: "This gray stone carving of a gaunt older woman is usually painted with\
  \ black hair and black clothing with red trim. Once per day, the bearer can use\
  \ it to cast stabilize, resistance, and virtue â€”this is usually enough to ensure\
  \ that a mother and newborn both live through a difficult birth.\nIf Pharasma is\
  \ the bearer's patron, the bearer can use the icon to cast augury once per day.\
  \ As a standard action, the bearer can touch a pregnant woman and know whether she\
  \ is carrying a boy or girl and whether it will be a single birth or multiple. Once\
  \ per day, the bearer can consecrate a corpse so if it is buried within 24 hours\
  \ it cannot be reanimated as an undead."
