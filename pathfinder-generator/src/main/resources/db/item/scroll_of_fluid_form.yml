name: "Scroll of Fluid Form"
description: "When you cast this spell, your body takes on a slick, oily appearance.\
  \ For the duration of this spell, your form can stretch and shift with ease and\
  \ becomes slightly transparent, as if you were composed of liquid. This transparency\
  \ is not enough to grant concealment. You gain DR 10/slashing and your reach increases\
  \ by 10 feet. In addition, you can pass through small holes or narrow openings,\
  \ even mere cracks, with anything you were carrying at the time the spell was cast\
  \ (except other creatures). Finally, you can move through water with a swim speed\
  \ of 60 feet and can breathe both water and air for the duration of this effect.\
  \ You are treated as if you had the water subtype while this spell is in effect."
