description: "Created by a race of unknown undersea creatures only passingly familiar\
  \ with humanoid physiology, these tall, uncomfortable boots are made of slimy skin\
  \ that wriggles slightly. The boots function as slippers of the triton, allowing\
  \ the wearer to breathe and swim underwater. The boots constantly murmur telepathically\
  \ to the wearer, alternating between sycophantic praise of the wearer's prowess\
  \ and smug assurance that the boots will ensure that the wearer comes to no harm\
  \ while underwater. The unctuous waders urge the wearer to explore beneath the waves,\
  \ hoping to find some clues as to their creators and purpose, which the boots have\
  \ long ago forgotten. If the wearer goes for more than a week without submerging\
  \ herself in the ocean, the unctuous waders become less obsequious and more demanding.\
  \ The unctuous waders can remove the ability to allow the wielder to breathe underwater,\
  \ which they might do as a threat to compel obedience, or out of mere petulance.\n\
  Three times per day as a standard action, the unctuous waders can exude slimy water\
  \ from the heels to propel the user, as the slipstream spell."
