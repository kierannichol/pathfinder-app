description: "This set of fine, masterwork thieves' tools glimmer when exposed to\
  \ light. When held in hand, they glow with light visible only to the individual\
  \ holding them. This light allows the holder to work in all manners of darkness,\
  \ including magical darkness, unimpeded and without attracting the attention of\
  \ other creatures. This light does not provide enough illumination to see anything\
  \ beyond a single lock or similar device on which the tools are used. As they glow,\
  \ the tools vary their color, indicating favorable or unfavorable positioning within\
  \ a device. These guiding lights grant a +5 circumstance bonus on Disable Device\
  \ checks."
