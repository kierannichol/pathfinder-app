description: "This iridescent kilt seems stitched together from thousands of tiny\
  \ scales. When an aquatic creature with a tail dons the shimmering kilt, her tail\
  \ transforms into legs and feet, allowing her to walk on land. The wearer loses\
  \ her swim speed but gains a base land speed of 30 feet (or 20 feet if the wearer\
  \ is Small or smaller). This transformation lasts until the shimmering kilt is removed.\n\
  As a standard action, the wearer can cause the shimmering kilt to take on the appearance\
  \ of any suitable garb that covers the legs, such as trousers or a long skirt. The\
  \ shimmering kilt retains all its properties, including its weight, when so disguised.\
  \ Only true seeing or similar magic reveals the true nature of the shimmering kilt\
  \ when it is disguised."
