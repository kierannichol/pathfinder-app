description: "As a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a character\
  \ can wind the key on this 4-foot-long serpentine clockwork enough to power it until\
  \ the end of her next turn. For every additional standard action spent winding it,\
  \ the rattler is powered for another round, to a maximum of 10 total rounds. The\
  \ mechanism ticks softly while being wound and unwinding (Perception DC 15 to hear).\n\
  When a character removes the key (a swift action) until the rattler winds down,\
  \ at the start of each of that character's turn, the rattler slithers 20 feet in\
  \ a straight line, rearing up every few seconds to extend its forked tongue and\
  \ make noise with its rattle (Perception DC 0 to hear). Anyone who sees it from\
  \ farther than 30 feet away must succeed at a DC 10 Perception check to realize\
  \ it is not an actual snake. The key-wound rattler can neither see nor hear. If\
  \ it runs into an unyielding surface, it bumps around until it feels an open path,\
  \ rotating first to the right and then to the left before going back the way it\
  \ came. If it bumps into anything that is neither hard nor still, it attacks with\
  \ its bite (+5 attack, 1d3 nonlethal damage) until the obstacle moves away. While\
  \ moving, a key-wound rattler's AC is 12 and it provokes attacks of opportunity\
  \ as normal. At the end of the turn in which it winds down, it curls up as if to\
  \ sleep. A key-wound rattler has hardness 10 and 10 hit points. It is not a creature,\
  \ and does not threaten spaces or act except as described above."
