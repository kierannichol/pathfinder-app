description: "Notations on surviving in the wilderness (and accompanying illustrations)\
  \ fill this manual. If you have no skill ranks in Survival, you can consult this\
  \ manual as part of attempting a Survival check to perform one of the following\
  \ tasks: avoid natural hazards, follow tracks, gain a save bonus against severe\
  \ weather, predict the weather, or provide food and water. Doing so grants you a\
  \ +4 circumstance bonus on the check, but it takes twice as long to perform the\
  \ action (for example, providing food and water takes 48 hours instead of 24 hours).\
  \ If you fail the check, you cannot consult the manual for another check until you\
  \ move to a new area."
