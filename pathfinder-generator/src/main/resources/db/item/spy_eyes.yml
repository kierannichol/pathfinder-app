description: "At first glance, spy eyes appear to be cat's-eye marbles. When activated,\
  \ each comes to life and blinks, transforming into an eyeball. When pressed against\
  \ an inanimate surface (such as a wall or article of clothing), the eyeball absorbs\
  \ into it, leaving a magical sensor of the same size on the surface. Anyone holding\
  \ an eye from a particular cluster of spy eyes can share the view from any other\
  \ eye in the cluster as if that eye were her own, provided she is within 10 miles\
  \ of that sensor. To recover a sensor, she can press a spy eye she holds from the\
  \ same cluster against the one that's in sensor form to make the sensor emerge and\
  \ return to marble form.\nA single bag of spy eyes contains five marbles (meaning\
  \ that up to four may be deployed at any given time). Spy eyes in sensor form can\
  \ be detected via the normal means for detecting scrying."
