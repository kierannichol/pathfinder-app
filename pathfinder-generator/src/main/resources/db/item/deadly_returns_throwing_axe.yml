description: "This weapon appears to be a +2 returning throwing axe. Instead of the\
  \ normal returning ability, this axe only returns when the wielder misses her target.\
  \ When it does return, it attacks the wielder. It uses the wielder's full base attack\
  \ bonus with this attack. If it hits, it sticks in the wielder, and the wielder\
  \ can pull out the axe with a swift action. If it misses the wielder, it falls to\
  \ a random unoccupied square adjacent to the wielder and must be picked up as soon\
  \ as possible. The wielder of the deadly returns throwing axe always uses it as\
  \ her primary weapon until subject to a remove curse spell or similar effect."
