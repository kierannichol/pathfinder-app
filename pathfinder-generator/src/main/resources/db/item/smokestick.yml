description: "This alchemically treated wooden stick instantly creates thick, opaque\
  \ smoke when burned. The smoke fills a 10-foot cube (treat the effect as a fog cloud\
  \ spell, except that a moderate or stronger wind dissipates the smoke in 1 round).\
  \ The stick is consumed after 1 round, and the smoke dissipates naturally after\
  \ 1 minute."
