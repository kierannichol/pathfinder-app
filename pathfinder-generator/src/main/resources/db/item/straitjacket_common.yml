description: "Fashioned of durable canvas and leather straps, this instrument of restraint\
  \ prevents its wearer from using his arms entirely. Properly binding a creature\
  \ in a straitjacket requires 1 minute, and the creature must be willing or helpless.\
  \ This time can be reduced to 5 rounds, but doing so lowers the DC to escape the\
  \ restraints by 5. A creature wearing a straitjacket gains the grappled condition,\
  \ except it is able to move. Escaping from the straitjacket requires a successful\
  \ DC 28 Escape Artist check (DC 30 for a masterwork straitjacket.)"
