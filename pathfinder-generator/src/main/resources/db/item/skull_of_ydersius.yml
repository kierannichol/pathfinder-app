description: "More than just a powerful artifact, the Skull of Ydersius is the actual\
  \ skull of a deity, the vessel through which the much-diminished god of serpents\
  \ perceives and influences existence. Ydersius's clerics still receive spells from\
  \ their prayers, granted by the skull regardless of its location or ownership. There\
  \ is no way a mortal can block this effect. Possession of the skull grants several\
  \ abilities.\nBlessing of Scales: All reptilian creatures (including worshipers\
  \ of Ydersius, sorcerers with the serpentine or draconic bloodline, and druids wild-shaped\
  \ into reptilian forms) within 160 feet of the Skull of Ydersius gain spell resistance\
  \ 25 and fast healing 10.\nUnholy Aura: The skull treats the 80-foot-radius area\
  \ around it as though an unhallow spell had been cast with the Skull of Ydersius\
  \ as the point of origin. This effect carries with it two linked spells that affect\
  \ only worshipers of Ydersius (death ward and freedom of movement), and two linked\
  \ spells that affect all non-worshipers of Ydersius (bane and dimensional anchor).\n\
  Voice of the Serpent: Once per day, a creature that touches the skull may cast commune\
  \ to speak with Ydersius. A non-worshiper of Ydersius who uses this power must make\
  \ a successful DC 25 Will save each time the power is used to avoid succumbing to\
  \ a feeblemind spell.\nAny good-aligned creature that carries the Skull of Ydersius,\
  \ even via an extradimensional space such as a portable hole, gains three negative\
  \ levels. These negative levels remain as long as the skull is carried and disappear\
  \ when the skull is released. These negative levels never result in actual level\
  \ loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while\
  \ the skull is carried. A creature that suffers from these negative levels has a\
  \ 50% spell failure chance on all divine spellcasting attempts."
destruction: "The only way to destroy the Skull of Ydersius is to reunite it with\
  \ Ydersius's mindless, decapitated body. Doing so returns Ydersius to life, though\
  \ in a weakened state. This manifestation can be combated and even slain, though\
  \ it regenerates from nearly any wound short of re-decapitation. For an instant,\
  \ before the whole body begins to regenerate, Ydersius's spirit is untethered from\
  \ his form. If Ydersius is dragged to the Boneyard and slain in Pharasma's presence,\
  \ the goddess of death can judge the serpent god, causing his body and skull to\
  \ disintegrate to dust."
