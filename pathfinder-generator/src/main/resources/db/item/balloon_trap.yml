description: "This trap consists of a buoyant balloon tied to an anchor by a very\
  \ thin strand of metal. The strand acts as a vertical tripwire that triggers the\
  \ trap, targeting any flying creature that contacts it. The trap's creator may set\
  \ any number of mechanical or magical effects to be triggered when the trap is activated.\
  \ Balloon traps are especially useful against creatures with large wingspans, or\
  \ when the balloon is concealed, as in a tree canopy or smoke cover. Below is a\
  \ sample balloon trap."
