description: "This painted silk kite depicts a shining golden dragon. In an area with\
  \ 40 feet or more of vertical space and in conditions of light to moderate wind,\
  \ a golden dragon kite can be unfolded and raised into the air as a full-round action.\
  \ The user can direct the kite to move up to 100 feet from him in a single turn\
  \ (but no farther). Three times per day, the kite can cast burning hands. The spell\
  \ originates from the kite but acts as normal in all other ways. This spell can\
  \ only be reproduced while the kite is flying, a process that takes 1 minute to\
  \ achieve.\nRumors say that in Minkai, versions of these kites exist that deliver\
  \ other spells at great range."
