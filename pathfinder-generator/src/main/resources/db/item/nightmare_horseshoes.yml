description: "These horseshoes are made of blackened steel and are typically stamped\
  \ with infernal symbols or, less subtly, horrific images of terrified and tortured\
  \ steeds of the darkest hues. They typically give off a slight smell of brimstone,\
  \ as though they had been crafted in some hellish forge. On command, the mount's\
  \ rider may grant it the smoke supernatural ability (Bestiary 216). The horseshoes\
  \ can be used for 10 rounds per day, split up as the mount's rider chooses (minimum\
  \ 1 round per use). While this power is activated, the mount's eyes, hooves, mane,\
  \ and tail burst into flame, and its hooves deal an extra 1d4 points of fire damage."
