description: "This regal-looking robe is trimmed with softly glowing sigils and attuned\
  \ to one of three types of alignment. It can have geometric sigils (1–45 on d%,\
  \ lawful alignment), smooth sigils (46–75 on d%, neither lawful nor chaotic alignment),\
  \ or jagged sigils (76–100 on d%, chaotic alignment). To most wearers, the robe\
  \ offers no powers and has no effects unless the wearer's alignment doesn't match\
  \ that of the robe (see below). Only a psychic spellcaster can call upon this potent\
  \ magic item's powers, which are as follows."
