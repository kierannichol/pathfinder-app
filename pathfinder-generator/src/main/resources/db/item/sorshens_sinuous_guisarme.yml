description: "Sorshen's Sinuous Guisarme is a +5 keen speed spell-storing mithral\
  \ guisarme. Although it has a blade at each end, it is not technically a double\
  \ weapon—when its speed special ability is used to make an extra attack, that extra\
  \ attack is made with the alternate blade. As a swift action, the guisarme can transform\
  \ itself into a staff of enchantment. If it uses up all of its charges, it automatically\
  \ reverts to guisarme form. Created to defeat non-spellcasters, the glaive grants\
  \ its wielder a +2 luck bonus on attacks, saves, and ability and skill checks. It\
  \ can cast charm monster once per day, mirror image upon its wielder three times\
  \ per day, and suggestion three times per day.\nWith Sorshen's recent shift in alignment,\
  \ her Sinuous Guisarme finds itself increasingly in conflict with the runelord.\
  \ Whether this will eventually result in the guisarme's alignment adjusting to match\
  \ its owner or whether the glaive's fell influence might cause Sorshen to backslide\
  \ to evil, only time (and GM whim) can tell."
destruction: "Sorshen's Sinuous Glaive can be destroyed if it is hurled under the\
  \ crushing feet of the Oliphaunt of Jandelay, but only if there is no current Runelord\
  \ of Lust living in the world (note that when Sorshen fully takes on the mantle\
  \ of ruler of New Thassilon, she abandons her role as Runelord of Lust for the purpose\
  \ of fulfilling this latter requirement for destruction)."
