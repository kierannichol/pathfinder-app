description: "These small capsules consist of a concentrated mix of nauseainducing\
  \ herbs. To use a capsule, you bite down and ingest its contents, which almost immediately\
  \ cause you to projectile vomit. The vomiting lasts 1 full round, during which you\
  \ can take no other actions. The following round you recover fully, and suffer no\
  \ other ill effects. These capsules are most often used by rogues working in teams\
  \ to create distractions and spectacles in order to draw people's attention away\
  \ from their activities, as well as by those interested in faking illness, such\
  \ as pugilists trying to throw fights or criminals seeking to create chaos during\
  \ an arrest."
