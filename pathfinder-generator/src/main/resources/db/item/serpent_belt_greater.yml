description: "This belt functions as a serpent belt, except it grants the wearer a\
  \ +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity. Treat this as a temporary ability\
  \ bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn. When the wearer animates the belt\
  \ as a venomous or constrictor snake, she may speak a second command word to give\
  \ the snake the advanced, celestial, entropic (Bestiary 2), fiendish, or resolute\
  \ (Bestiary 2) simple template. Adding a planar template changes the snake's alignment\
  \ to that of the corresponding planes."
