description: "This ring is crafted of hardened leather strips, into which bits of\
  \ fur, feathers, bone, and ivory have been woven. Twice per day, when the wearer\
  \ is flanking an opponent, he can as a swift action deal an additional 1d6 points\
  \ of damage on a successful melee attack against that opponent. This is a sneak\
  \ attack for any effects that reduce or negate such damage."
