description: "Forged centuries ago for a master poisoner known for her seductive assassinations,\
  \ Deadly Kiss is a Tian-style +1 dagger with a blue metal blade. If the wielder\
  \ is carrying poison on her person, she can, as a swift action, magically apply\
  \ the poison to the blade with no chance of exposing herself to the poison. The\
  \ poison simply disappears from its container and reappears on the blade. This consumes\
  \ the dose of poison. As with any poisoned weapon, if an attack with the blade results\
  \ in a natural 1, the wielder exposes herself to the poison unless she has the poison\
  \ use special ability."
