description: "Silvery, pearlescent light seeps out of this skull-sized glass orb.\
  \ When shattered (a standard action), the globe floods a 30-footradius burst in\
  \ moonlight. Creatures that are affected by the light of the full moon (such as\
  \ an afflicted lycanthrope) are affected as if exposed to such light, and effects\
  \ that rely on moonlight function within range of this effect. This moonlight persists\
  \ for 1 minute, is treated as dim light (replacing any current illumination in the\
  \ area), and is equivalent to a 4th-level light spell for the purpose of interacting\
  \ with other light or darkness effects."
