description: "These battered iron manacles are typically found with a small spiked\
  \ iron key in one of the locks. The shackles magically adjust themselves to fit\
  \ around the wrists of any creature from Small to Large size and automatically lock.\
  \ A creature wearing shackles of compliance becomes more susceptible to intimidation.\
  \ Any creature attempting to intimidate or demoralize a target wearing shackles\
  \ of compliance gains a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks. In addition, the holder of\
  \ the manacles' key can cast command (DC 25 Will) on the wearer of the shackles\
  \ three times per day.\nShackles of compliance have hardness 10 and 10 hit points,\
  \ and a DC 30 Disable Device check is required to pick the shackles' lock. A manacled\
  \ creature can break free with a DC 28 Strength check or DC 35 Escape Artist check.\
  \ The manacles lock can be opened with a DC 30 Disable Device check."
