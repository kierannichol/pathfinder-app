description: "This animated wood and metal snake squirms and hisses when handled,\
  \ attempting to bite its holder just as a real snake might. To use the snakebiter\
  \ arrow as a projectile, the bearer must first succeed at a DC 10 Handle Animal\
  \ or wild empathy check to get the snake to shape itself into a +1 seeking arrow\
  \ or a +1 seeking bolt (this is considered a trick known by the snake) for 1 minute.\
  \ Failure means the snake attacks the bearer for 1 round, using the statistics of\
  \ a Tiny viper familiar (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 133). A target struck by the projectile\
  \ must succeed at a saving throw or be affected by a powerful variant black adder\
  \ venom (Fortitude DC 20). Normally, these items are carried in a pouch rather than\
  \ a quiver to prevent them from getting loose."
