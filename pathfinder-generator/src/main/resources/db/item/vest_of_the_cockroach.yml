description: "This padded and slightly bulky vest, made from red-brown cloth, causes\
  \ its wearer to feel vaguely uncomfortable whenever she is lying prone. If the wearer\
  \ is a rogue, she gains the resiliency rogue talent. If she already has this talent,\
  \ activating the talent grants her 2 hit points per rogue level instead of 1."
