description: "This stylish silk shirt has a loose and flowing fit except for the sleeves,\
  \ which cling snugly to the wearer's arms from elbow to wrist. The sleeves guide\
  \ the wearer's attacks to take advantage of brief gaps in a foe's defenses. Five\
  \ times per day, the wearer can make a lunging melee maneuver and extend his reach\
  \ by 5 feet for a single melee attack. If the wearer has the Lunge feat, he can\
  \ instead use that feat five times per day without taking the normal –2 penalty."
