description: "This lengthy rod looks like a walking cane with a stylized crystal skull\
  \ at its top. As a standard action up to three times per day, the wielder can slam\
  \ the base of the rod into the ground while designating a target within 60 feet.\
  \ Grasping hands of ectoplasm manifest from the ground surrounding the target in\
  \ a 5-foot radius. Creatures within the radius must succeed at a DC 14 Reflex save\
  \ or they are entangled by the grasping hands and unable to move more than 10 feet\
  \ from the affected area (as if snared by a net with a trailing rope). Creatures\
  \ moving through the ectoplasm must also succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled.\
  \ As a standard action, a creature entangled by the ectoplasm can attempt an additional\
  \ DC 14 Reflex save to attempt to escape and end the effect. The summoned ectoplasm\
  \ lasts for 10 rounds before disappearing."
