description: "The long, threadbare tatters of this well-worn cloak coalesce into the\
  \ rough form of a claw with opposable appendages, aiding the wearer with a helpful\
  \ additional appendage when he might need it most. As a swift action, the wearer\
  \ can use the cloak to retrieve any one small, stowed item carried on his person\
  \ or any such unattended item within 5 feet. The wearer can hold one such item in\
  \ the cloak, but he can't use the cloak to manipulate it (other than to put it in\
  \ his hand) and can't wield a weapon or shield with the cloak. Additionally, once\
  \ per day, the wearer can brace himself with the cloak's claw as a standard action,\
  \ gaining a +4 competence bonus to CMD for 1 round. While the cloak is providing\
  \ this bonus, it can't be used to hold or retrieve a stowed or unattended item"
