description: "This scabbard is an improvised weapon designed to allow you to remove\
  \ it from your belt as a swift action when drawing the weapon it contains. Taking\
  \ the Equipment Trick feat (see page 22) for a scabbard gives you additional combat\
  \ options for using a scabbard. For the purpose of fighter weapon groups, a scabbard\
  \ for a heavy blade is considered a hammer, and a scabbard for a light blade is\
  \ considered a close weapon."
