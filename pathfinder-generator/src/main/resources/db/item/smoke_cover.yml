description: "This small cauldron of alchemically treated tar gives off thick, acrid\
  \ smoke when ignited. The smoke rises to an altitude of 25 feet, then spreads horizontally,\
  \ creating an artificial smoke ceiling 5 feet thick. The smoke spreads to a 100-foot\
  \ radius at a rate of 20 feet per round. The cauldron smokes for 5 rounds before\
  \ burning out. After the cauldron finishes burning, the smoke lasts for 3 more rounds\
  \ before dissipating. A moderate wind (11+ mph) does not affect the heavy smoke,\
  \ while a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the smoke in 2 rounds.\nThe smoke is entirely\
  \ opaque, which means creatures above the smoke can't see the ground, and those\
  \ on the ground have a visual ceiling of 25 feet. Creatures on the other side of\
  \ the smoke have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use\
  \ sight to locate the target).\nSmoke cover is noxious, and any creature that begins\
  \ its turn inside the smoke must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or become sickened\
  \ for 1d4 rounds. Previously sickened creatures that fail their saves are instead\
  \ nauseated for 1d6 rounds. Creatures immune to poison are not affected by smoke\
  \ cover's sickening effects."
