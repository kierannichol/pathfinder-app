description: "Pathfinders are often called upon to take notes during their adventures,\
  \ but sometimes finding a place where one can write in comfort while on a mission\
  \ can be rather difficult. The field scrivener's desk attempts to address this need.\
  \ This magic desk can be folded up into a 3-inch-wide cube of lacquered wood for\
  \ easy transport. Once per day, a single command causes this block of wood to unfold\
  \ in the space of 1 round into an exquisite writing desk sized for a Small or Medium\
  \ author, complete with four vials of ink, two writing quills, and 50 blank sheets\
  \ of paper. The desk creates new supplies of ink, quills, and paper each time it\
  \ is unfolded. Once the desk is unfolded, it creates a 20-footradius hemisphere\
  \ centered on the desk's locationâ€”this effect is identical to that created by a\
  \ tiny hut spell. Once activated, the desk's tiny hut effect lasts for up to 10\
  \ hours or until the desk is folded up or moved more than a few inches. Of course,\
  \ the effect also works to provide an ideal spot for a campsite, and in most parties\
  \ a field scrivener's desk is used solely for this effect."
