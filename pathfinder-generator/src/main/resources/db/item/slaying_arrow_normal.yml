description: "This +1 arrow is keyed to a particular type or subtype of creature.\
  \ If it strikes such a creature, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save\
  \ or take 50 points of damage. Note that even creatures normally exempt from Fortitude\
  \ saves (undead and constructs) are subject to this attack. When keyed to a living\
  \ creature, this is a death effect (and thus death ward protects a target). To determine\
  \ the type or subtype of creature the arrow is keyed to, roll on the table below.\n\
  A greater slaying arrow functions just like a normal slaying arrow, but the DC to\
  \ avoid the death effect is 23 and the arrow deals 100 points of damage if the saving\
  \ throw is failed."
