description: "This altar is built from skulls and bones as black as onyx. When placed\
  \ upright on a solid surface, the altar begins radiating negative energy, as per\
  \ desecrate. If the altar is knocked over, the effect ends until the altar is righted\
  \ as a move action. A spellcaster can use a as a focus when casting animate dead\
  \ or create undead. The spell then doesn't require onyx gems as a material component.\
  \ Instead, the altar supplies the unholy energy needed for casting the spell. The\
  \ altar can sustain a maximum of 20 Hit Dice of undead creatures created this way,\
  \ and it can't create more than 20 HD of undead creatures in a week even if previously\
  \ created undead are destroyed. The undead creatures can't create spawn or use similar\
  \ abilities.\nWhen undead creatures created with the altar as a focus move farther\
  \ than 100 feet away from it, dark fumes continuously pour out from their eyes (or\
  \ eye sockets) and mouths. Any such undead creature needs to return to the altar's\
  \ vicinity within 4 hours to replenish its negative energy. If unable to do so,\
  \ the creature is immediately destroyed after 4 hours."
