description: "This figurine stands several inches tall and is carved of black stone\
  \ with gold highlights, resembling a man with the head of a jackal. With a successful\
  \ DC 20 Knowledge (religion) check, a character identifies the figure as Anubis,\
  \ the Ancient Osirian god of burial, funeral rites, mummification, and a protector\
  \ of the dead and their tombs. Once per week, an effigy of Anubis enables its possessor\
  \ to use speak with dead and ask up to six questions. The effigy must be placed\
  \ within the rib cage of a corpse, and the corpse's answers come through the effigyâ€”\
  \ the jackal's mouth moves with the words. The corpse must still be mostly intact\
  \ and have a mouth for the spell to work.\nIn addition, an effigy of Anubis can\
  \ be used to bring a dead creature back to life, though Anubis, as god of the dead,\
  \ is willing to grant only a temporary reprieve from oblivion. Breaking the figurine\
  \ reveals a hollow interior filled with diamond dust. If this diamond dust is sprinkled\
  \ on a corpse that has been dead for less than 48 hours, the creature comes back\
  \ to life as with temporary resurrection (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 243). This\
  \ effect lasts for 24 hours, at which point the creature dies again. Once used in\
  \ this way, an effigy of Anubis loses all of its magic and is destroyed."
