  \ preserved. Any creature no more than one size category different from the skinned\
  \ creature can don the skin with 1 minute of effort, whereupon the wearer gains\
  \ the physical appearance and size the skinned creature had while alive, and its\
  \ abilities as defined in the spell alter self, but not its immunities, weapon proficiencies,\
  \ weaknesses, or spell resistance. Otherwise, this effect functions like recorporeal\
  \ incarnation."
