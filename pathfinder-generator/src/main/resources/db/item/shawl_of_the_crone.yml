description: "The yarn making up this knitted gray wrap is frayed and tattered. As\
  \ soon as a creature puts on the shawl, she immediately takes the form of a venerable\
  \ female of her race (regardless of the wearer's actual gender) and remains so until\
  \ the shawl is removed. Though this is an actual physical transformation, the wearer\
  \ does not experience any infirmities due to advanced age, including penalties to\
  \ her physical attributes, nor does she gain any bonuses to her mental attributes.\
  \ The wearer also gains a +4 circumstance bonus on any Charisma-based check intended\
  \ to make her appear friendly, harmless, helpless, or otherwise in need of assistance\
  \ or deserving of proper respect for someone of her apparent age. This bonus increases\
  \ to +8 when directed against children. The wearer also counts as a hag for the\
  \ purposes of forming a covey, but this covey must always include at least one actual\
  \ hag."
