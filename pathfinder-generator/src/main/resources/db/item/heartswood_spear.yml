description: "This humble weapon appears to be little more than a crudely sharpened\
  \ stake or makeshift spear, but in truth it is a far more formidable weapon. In\
  \ addition to being a +2 undead bane spear, a heartswood spear deals bludgeoning\
  \ damage when it is swung as a staff. When employed in such a manner, it also possesses\
  \ the disruption property."
