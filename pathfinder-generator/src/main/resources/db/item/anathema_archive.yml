description: "This unusually heavy scroll consists of a rather long sheet of supple,\
  \ impossible-to-tear parchment wound between two rods. When the anathema archive\
  \ is opened, it presents a tangle of Thassilonian runes to the observer. Each time\
  \ the scroll is unfurled, the runes are in a different order, the contents of the\
  \ archive shifting according to the user's state of mind and desires each time it\
  \ is used. The archive itself can be used for two purposes: to cast ancient spells\
  \ and to divulge lore about hateful secrets and hidden horrors.\nWhen using the\
  \ anathema archive to cast spells, the user can either simply open it (in which\
  \ case it randomly opens to one of the new Thassilonian spells presented earlier\
  \ in this chapter) or the user can attempt to force the anathema archive to open\
  \ to a specific spell from that list or to any arcane spell she knows how to cast.\
  \ Doing so requires a Spellcraft check (DC = 20 + double spell level)—failure indicates\
  \ the archive opens to a random spell from this chapter's seven earlier options.\
  \ Whatever spell the anathema archive is opened to, the user may cast that spell\
  \ from the scroll as if she were casting a spell from a normal scroll, save that\
  \ the spell is not consumed from the anathema archive upon being cast.\nWhen used\
  \ for research, the anathema archive grants a +10 insight bonus into any one Knowledge\
  \ check associated with sinister or frightening ancient topics (subject to the GM's\
  \ discretion—sample subjects include evil outsiders, runelords, Thassilon, Leng,\
  \ evil religions, or undead). This allows a character to make the Knowledge skill\
  \ check untrained.\nEach time a character uses the anathema archive, her mind becomes\
  \ increasingly haunted and unhinged. Upon using the archive, the user must make\
  \ a Will save (DC = 15 + twice the total number of times the user has used the anathema\
  \ archive). Failure results in the user taking 1d4 points of Wisdom drain and becoming\
  \ confused for a number of rounds equal to 1 + the total number of times she has\
  \ used the artifact.\nThe anathema archive closes automatically each time it is\
  \ used, and cannot be opened again for 24 hours by any force."
destruction: "The anathema archive must be eaten by an angel who has been rendered\
  \ deaf and blind by an evil source—the angel must not know that it is eating an\
  \ artifact."
