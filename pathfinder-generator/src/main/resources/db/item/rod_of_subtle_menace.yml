description: "This crude shaft of blackened steel functions as a +1 light mace. Those\
  \ who can see the wielder of the rod feel a vague sense of being in danger. This\
  \ ominous aura is faint but encourages others to avoid angering the wielder, although\
  \ they may not realize why. When holding the rod in her hand, the wielder can attempt\
  \ an Intimidate check in place of a Diplomacy check when trying to gather information\
  \ and always counts as larger than its target for the purpose of Intimidate checks."
