description: "This black iron neckpiece is forged in the likeness of Rovagug's holy\
  \ symbol. An evil wearer gains a +2 profane bonus on all saving throws. A creature\
  \ with the touch of corruption class ability that wears the choker of the Rough\
  \ Beast increases the damage dice of that ability from 1d6 per 2 antipaladin levels\
  \ to 1d8 per 2 levels.\nGood-aligned creatures within 120 feet of the choker of\
  \ the Rough Beast hear distant bellows of unimaginable rage, giving them a â€“2 penalty\
  \ on all Perception checks as the sounds distract them. Within 30 feet of the necklace,\
  \ the sound increases, and all good-aligned creatures must succeed at a DC 18 Will\
  \ save or be shaken while within range. They can attempt another save after 24 hours.\n\
  If the wearer willingly breaks the choker in half (a fullround action), the ground\
  \ under his feet ruptures open and consumes him (as the imprisonment spell). The\
  \ blood of Rovagug seeps up from the wound in the earth 1d6 rounds after the wielder\
  \ is consumed. Treat this as a fiendish carnivorous blob (Bestiary 2 51, 292) that\
  \ attacks any living creature within sight. The hole seals immediately after the\
  \ blood rises."
