description: "This rod functions as a +2 light mace. It takes the form of a light\
  \ mace with a head in the shape of a clenched fist. While a character wields this\
  \ rod, it grants all his allies within a 20-footradius burst a +2 morale bonus on\
  \ saving throws against fear and emotion effects, or a +4 morale bonus on such saves\
  \ if the ally has the human subtype.\nAlso, once per day as an immediate action,\
  \ the wielder can activate the rod to allow himself or a single ally within the\
  \ rod's aura to reroll a failed saving throw against a spell or effect with the\
  \ fear or emotion descriptor. The affected creature must take the result of the\
  \ reroll, even if it is worse."
