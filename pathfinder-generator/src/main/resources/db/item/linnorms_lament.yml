description: "This horn operates as a normal horn of Valhalla, save that it can be\
  \ blown more than once per day, with the warriors from previous soundings remaining\
  \ until their 1 hour has passed. When the wielder blows the horn for the third time,\
  \ he becomes destined to die before the next dawn, with chance-based events turning\
  \ against him in more and more improbable ways until he's slain. The manner of this\
  \ curse and any potential methods of defeating it are left to the GM."
destruction: "Linnorm's Lament shatters if someone blows it a third time and survives\
  \ for 1 year afterward."
