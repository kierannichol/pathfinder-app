description: "Appearing as a heavy, elaborate neckpiece while worn, a burglar's torc\
  \ can be removed and disassembled into its component parts in 4 minutes (or in 1\
  \ minute if the user is trained in the Disable Device skill). When dismantled, a\
  \ burglar's torc contains parts that function as a set of mithral masterwork thieves'\
  \ tools, 10 feet of silk rope, and a mithral grappling hook. Reassembling the torc\
  \ takes 8 minutes (or 4 minutes if the user is trained in the Disable Device skill).\
  \ An observer must succeed at a DC 30 Perception check to recognize an assembled\
  \ burglar's torc for what it is; if the observer handles the torc, the DC for this\
  \ check decreases to 15."
