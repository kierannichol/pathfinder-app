description: "This normal mirror is roughly 4 feet long and 3 feet wide. It is similar\
  \ to a mirror of opposition or mirror of life trapping, but it lacks a command word.\
  \ A mirror of soul snaring has 15 extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature\
  \ coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must succeed\
  \ at a DC 23 Will save or have its soul sucked into one of the compartments. A creature\
  \ not aware of the cursed nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The\
  \ probability of a creature seeing its reflection and thus needing to attempt the\
  \ saving throw drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror is cursed and\
  \ seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack).\nWhen a creature's soul\
  \ is trapped, its body remains outside of the mirror. The body becomes possessed\
  \ by a malignant spirit who behaves in a way entirely opposed to how the trapped\
  \ creature would. Treat this spirit as the creature, with a reversed alignment (and\
  \ potentially other factors reversed, such as being an antipaladin instead of a\
  \ paladin). In the case of neutral characters, the spirit can be either chaotic\
  \ evil or lawful good as decided by the GM. The death of the creature's original\
  \ body does not free its soul from the mirror, though if it is ever set free, it\
  \ immediately passes on to the afterlife as it no longer has a body to inhabit.\n\
  If the mirror's capacity is exceeded, one victim's soul (determined randomly) is\
  \ set free and immediately reconnects with its duplicate body if available. If the\
  \ mirror is destroyed (hardness 1, 5 hit points), all victims currently trapped\
  \ in it are freed. Unless the mirror is destroyed, not even a miracle or wish can\
  \ restore the trapped creature's spirit to its body."
