description: "Crafted from gold and lacquer, these elaborate masks resemble various\
  \ outsiders. Once per day when the wearer casts a summon monster spell, he may choose\
  \ to house the summoned outsider within the visage of the bound rather than conjuring\
  \ it onto the Material Plane. For the spell's duration, the wearer can use of any\
  \ of the bound outsider's spell-like abilities as if they were his own. A visage\
  \ of the bound has no effect on outsiders already summoned or on summoning spells\
  \ cast by other creatures. Removing the mask immediately releases a bound outsider.\n\
  The wearer cannot use the bound outsider's spell-like abilities to summon other\
  \ creatures, and a summoner cannot activate a visage of the bound while his eidolon\
  \ is summoned. Effects that extend the duration of a summon monster spell (such\
  \ a the Extend Spell metamagic feat or the conjurer's summoner's charm class ability)\
  \ have no effect on the duration of a spell contained by a visage of the bound.\
  \ Outsiders who are opposed to one or more axes of the wearer's alignment cannot\
  \ be housed within a visage of the bound."
