description: "This scabbard contains strips of natural sea sponges on its interior.\
  \ By carefully pouring a dose of poison into the empty scabbard (a full-round action),\
  \ you saturate the sponges with the toxin, which keeps it viable and wet for up\
  \ to 4 hours. Preparing the scabbard carries the normal risk of poisoning yourself,\
  \ just like poisoning a weapon. The next weapon you draw from the scabbard is automatically\
  \ poisoned as if you had directly applied poison to it (but does not risk poisoning\
  \ you); this consumes the poison in the scabbard. A scabbard only fits one type\
  \ of bladed weapon, such as a dagger, shortsword, or longsword. This kind of item\
  \ is usually illegal in areas that outlaw poison."
