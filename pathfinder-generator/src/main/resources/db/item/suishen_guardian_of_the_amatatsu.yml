description: "Suishen is a +2 defending flaming katana (see page 27). The ancestral\
  \ blade of the Amatatsu family, Suishen is believed to contain the soul of the first\
  \ Amatatsu emperor of Minkai. It has been passed down through generations of the\
  \ family, serving as advisor and spiritual guide. It was actually Suishen's idea\
  \ to be sold to Fynn Snaevald in order to save the family line.\nSuishen can detect\
  \ any scion of the Amatatsu family within 60 feet, whether a natural-born descendant\
  \ or a person invested with the right to rule as an Amatatsu (such as a creature\
  \ marked by the Amatatsu Seal). Although Suishen is neutral good, any Amatatsu scion,\
  \ regardless of alignment, can wield the sword without gaining a negative level.\
  \ This boon is at Suishen's discretion, however, and should such a scion ever betray\
  \ the family or prove unworthy as an heir, the sword can reinstate this penalty\
  \ and cause a personality conflict. Even though Suishen can likely dominate anyone\
  \ who tries to wield it, the sword usually acquiesces to the wishes of its wielder,\
  \ provided she is a rightful Amatatsu scion-though after 50 years of holding its\
  \ silence, Suishen is a bit rough as a conversationalist, communicating in a very\
  \ gruff, no-nonsense manner.\nSuishen has a number of additional abilities as well,\
  \ though it reveals these powers to its wielder only after she has shown herself\
  \ honorable and worthy of bearing the family's heirloom blade. Each time Suishen's\
  \ wielder is involved in a fight in which an oni of the Five Storms (such as Kimandatsu)\
  \ is killed, the wielder is made aware of one new power in the following order.\
  \ If a new person wields Suishen, that person must learn the sword's additional\
  \ powers all over again."
destruction: "Suishen is destroyed if the blade is used to slay the last Amatatsu\
  \ scion."
