description: "This belt-and-scabbard set is decorated with golden depictions of garudas.\
  \ The scabbard automatically reshapes itself to fit the weapon that the wielder\
  \ is currently using. If the wielder is not using a weapon that would fit into a\
  \ scabbard, as a free action the wielder can command the khangarad scabbard to take\
  \ the shape of any weapon with which she has proficiency.\nOnce per day as a standard\
  \ action, the wielder can speak the scabbard's command word to blast nearby creatures\
  \ with gale-force winds. As part of activating the scabbard, the wielder can attempt\
  \ a special trip combat maneuver check against all creatures within 10 feet using\
  \ her normal CMB; this does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures whose\
  \ CMD is lower than the result are tripped. The wielder is not knocked down if the\
  \ trip attempt fails by 10 or more."
