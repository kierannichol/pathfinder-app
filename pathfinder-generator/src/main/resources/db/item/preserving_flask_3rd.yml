description: "This small, durable flask is designed to preserve alchemical extracts\
  \ indefinitely. An extract stored in a preserving flask remains potent until it\
  \ is consumed or otherwise removed from the flask. Preserved extracts count against\
  \ an alchemist's extracts per day on the day they are prepared, but not on subsequent\
  \ days. Each flask is capable of preserving an extract of a particular level. An\
  \ extract stored in the flask retains duration, caster level, and other properties\
  \ it had when it was created. The flask works on extracts and infusions, but not\
  \ mutagens."
