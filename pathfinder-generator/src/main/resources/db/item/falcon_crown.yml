description: "This metal headdress is shaped like a falcon's head and enameled in\
  \ brilliant colors. Originally crafted for a wizard dedicated to Horus as a reward\
  \ from his pharaoh for his prowess on the battlefield, the falcon crown was believed\
  \ lost when the wizard was struck down by an ancient blue dragon. Centuries later,\
  \ however, archaeologists discovered the falcon crown among the ruins of Tumen.\
  \ Researcher-priests of Nethys acquired the crown shortly after, and when the Nethysian\
  \ priestess Serethet became the Forgotten Pharaoh, she claimed the falcon crown\
  \ for herself.\nThe wearer of the falcon crown gains a +2 insight bonus to her Armor\
  \ Class. In addition, up to three times per day as an immediate action, the wearer\
  \ of the falcon crown can sacrifice a prepared spell or unused spell slot of 1st\
  \ level or higher and transform it into a damaging ray, targeting any foe within\
  \ 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. This ray deals 1d4 points of damage for every\
  \ level of the spell or spell slot sacrificed. A non-spellcaster cannot create rays\
  \ with the falcon crown, but can still gain the AC bonus."
