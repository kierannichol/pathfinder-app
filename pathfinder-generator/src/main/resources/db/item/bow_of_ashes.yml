description: "This +1 adaptive flaming composite longbow is made of a single piece\
  \ of petrified wood that appears to have been burnt black but is magically sturdy.\
  \ When the wielder pulls the bowstring while within 5 feet of a flame at least as\
  \ large as a lit torch, the bow generates and nocks an arrow of rock-hard ash. Attacks\
  \ made with an ash arrow deal damage as a normal bow but ignore concealment miss\
  \ chances from smoke, ash, dust, fog, and other airborne particles (though the wielder\
  \ still risks targeting the wrong square when trying to shoot at foes with total\
  \ concealment). The ash arrow crumbles to nothing 1 round after leaving the bow."
