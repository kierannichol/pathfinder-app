description: "As servants of the rightful ruler of Osirion, the Ruby Prince Khemet\
  \ III, members of the organization known as the Risen G uard often wield these specially\
  \ ordained blades. Each +2 flaming khopesh was crafted by one of the predominant\
  \ Osirian churches, such as the church of Abadar, Nethys, or Pharasma.\nAnytime\
  \ its wielder is healed by channeled positive energy, a risen blade gains a charge.\
  \ Whenever the wielder confirms a critical hit, she can release the stored energy\
  \ in the blade as a free action. The wielder channels positive energy (as the class\
  \ feature) and must choose to damage undead or heal the living. This action expends\
  \ all the blade's charges. Each charge is worth 1d6 points of damage or healing,\
  \ and for each charge spent, the wielder can choose to exclude one creature in the\
  \ area from being affected. The DC to save against this positive energy is equal\
  \ to 15 + 1 per stored charge expended. A risen blade can't gain a charge from healing\
  \ caused by the release of charges from itself or another risen blade.\nA risen\
  \ blade can store up to 5 charges. Each charge dissipates if not used within 24\
  \ hours."
