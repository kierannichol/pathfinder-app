description: "You trace mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing\
  \ written information. The explosive runes detonate when read, dealing 6d6 points\
  \ of force damage. Anyone next to the explosive runes (close enough to read them)\
  \ takes the full damage with no saving throw; any other creature within 10 feet\
  \ of the explosive runes is entitled to a Reflex save for half damage. The object\
  \ on which the explosive runes were written also takes full damage (no saving throw)."
