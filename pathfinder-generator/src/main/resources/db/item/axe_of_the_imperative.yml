description: "An axe of the imperative is a +1 battleaxe that cuts through willpower\
  \ and resolve as surely as it hews flesh and bone. On a successful hit against a\
  \ creature, the wielder can utter a short command as an immediate action to prohibit\
  \ the struck creature from a specific course of action. This command must consist\
  \ five words or fewer, such as, \"Never attack me again!\" or \"Never cast an enchantment\
  \ spell!\" or \"Don't set foot in Sothis!\" Once the imperative is uttered, the\
  \ wound caused by the hit glows with faint golden light, as does the blade of the\
  \ axe. This glow persists even after the damage is healed. The imperative lasts\
  \ until one of two things occurs. It ends if the wielder utters another imperative\
  \ (only one imperative can be in effect at a time), or if the target creature attempts\
  \ an action that would break the imperative. When the target takes that action,\
  \ it takes damage as if struck with a successful critical hit by the wielder of\
  \ the axe of the imperative. A successful DC 15 Fortitude save negates this damage.\
  \ When this occurs, the wielder immediately knows that the target broke the imperative.\
  \ A lingering imperative can be removed without harming the target as if it were\
  \ a curse effect. The imperative is a sonic language-dependent effect."
