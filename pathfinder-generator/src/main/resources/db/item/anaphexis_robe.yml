description: "Sewn from deep purple fabric, an Anaphexis robe appears to be a plain\
  \ version of Pharasmin holy vestments. A creature wearing this robe can speak directly\
  \ into the minds of other creatures wearing Anaphexis robes or carrying an unholy\
  \ symbol of Norgorber within 100 feet, as long as they share a common language.\
  \ The robes grant a +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear as a monk\
  \ of Pharasma and a +10 circumstance bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal\
  \ weapons. Once per day, a wearer with the death attack class ability can reduce\
  \ the number of rounds required to study a target for a death attack by 1."
