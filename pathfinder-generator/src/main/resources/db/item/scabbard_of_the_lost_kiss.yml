description: "This aged and worn scabbard is believed to have once held one of a dozen\
  \ legendary scimitar relics named Dawnflower's Kiss. From its prolonged proximity\
  \ to such a divine blade, the scabbard has acquired its own unique magical abilities.\
  \ Twice per day on command, the wearer can draw forth a blazing beam of red-hot\
  \ fire from the scabbard that can be wielded as if it were a scimitar, as per flame\
  \ blade.\nIf Sarenrae is the wearer's patron, half of the flame blade's damage is\
  \ fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore\
  \ not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire."
