description: "On a successful critical hit, this +1 kukri deals 2 points of bleed\
  \ damage, which stacks with any bleed damage already caused by the attack. Each\
  \ time the wielder strikes a blow that deals bleed damage with this weapon, he gains\
  \ temporary hit points equal to the amount of bleed damage dealt. No temporary hit\
  \ points are gained if the target was already bleeding, even for a lesser amount.\
  \ Temporary hit points bestowed by the bloodletting kukri last for 1 minute."
