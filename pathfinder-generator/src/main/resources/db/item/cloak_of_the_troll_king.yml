description: "This long cloak is a patchwork of beast and humanoid hides roughly stitched\
  \ together. A crude, crown-shaped patch of yellow-dyed fabric is sewn on the back,\
  \ and a length of knotted hemp rope secures the cloak around the wearer's neck.\
  \ The wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Intimidate checks and the ability to\
  \ use burning hands as a spell-like ability three times per day."
