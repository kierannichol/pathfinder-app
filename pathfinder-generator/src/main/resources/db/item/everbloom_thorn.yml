description: "When the command word is spoken as a move action, this +1 morningstar\
  \ transforms into a pendant in the shape of a single red rose that does not radiate\
  \ magic. Only true seeing or similar magic reveals the true nature of this weapon.\n\
  Once per day as part of an initiative check, as long as she holds the everbloom\
  \ thorn in its pendant shape in one hand, the wielder can cause the pendant to instantaneously\
  \ transform back into its +1 morningstar form. When she does so, the wielder of\
  \ the everbloom thorn adds her Charisma bonus (minimum of +1) to her initiative\
  \ check."
