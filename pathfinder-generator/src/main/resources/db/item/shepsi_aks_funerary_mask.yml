description: "An undead wearing this golden mask is treated as both an undead and\
  \ a creature of the type it was before becoming undead (including any associated\
  \ subtypes) for the purposes of determining its eligibility as a target of illusion\
  \ and transmutation spells (such as alter self or disguise self). A corpse wearing\
  \ the mask gains the effects of gentle repose and sanctify corpse. A living creature\
  \ wearing the mask gains no effects."
