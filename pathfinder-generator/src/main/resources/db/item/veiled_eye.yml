description: "This banded agate attaches itself to its wearer's forehead and then,\
  \ blinking and focusing, begins to act as an additional eye. When worn, the veiled\
  \ eye has the same vision as the wearer (such as low-light vision, darkvision 60\
  \ ft., or the oracle's clouded vision curse). It grants the wearer no particular\
  \ advantages so long as his original eyes continue to function normally. However,\
  \ should his original eyes stop working, whether because of the wearer becoming\
  \ blinded or even his own decision to close them, he can see through the veiled\
  \ eye instead. When the wearer is using the veiled eye as his only vision source,\
  \ he takes a –2 penalty on ranged attack rolls but gains a +2 insight bonus on saves\
  \ against gaze attacks."
