description: "Rather than narrowing to a single point, a pronged arrow has a wide\
  \ face with two points resembling a crescent or V-shape. Originally used for hunting\
  \ game, a pronged arrow deals damage as if one size category smaller, but you gain\
  \ a +1 bonus on attack rolls against creatures or objects one or more size categories\
  \ smaller than you."
