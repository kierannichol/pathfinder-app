description: "This leather pouch contains a set of black stones, each engraved with\
  \ a different rune of ill fortune. When used as part of spell kenning, they allow\
  \ the user to cast spells from the witch spell list. To cast a witch spell, the\
  \ possessor must spend twice as long casting as for normal spell kenning, and must\
  \ use a spell slot 1 level higher than normal. If the possessor has the master skald\
  \ class feature, determine casting time as though he lacked that class feature instead\
  \ of doubling casting time. The tiles can be used once per day."
