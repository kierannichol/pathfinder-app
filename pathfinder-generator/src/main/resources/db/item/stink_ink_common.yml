description: "Stink ink is a special, pungent, musk-based ink that allows its user\
  \ to encode information with smell rather than visually. Stink ink dries clear but\
  \ its sharp, extremely localized smell can be picked out by those with sensitive\
  \ enough noses to make it possible to read by sense of smell. Only creatures with\
  \ the keen senses trait or scent ability can read stink ink without aid of some\
  \ form of magic. Reading or writing something with stink ink takes twice as long\
  \ as going through the same amount of information written in normal ink."
