description: "This +2 huntsman bastard sword has a grip bound in leather and trimmed\
  \ with fur. Once per round when the wielder strikes a target with the sword, he\
  \ can allow an ally of his choice to perform a trip combat maneuver against the\
  \ target as an immediate action, provided the ally is adjacent to the target struck.\
  \ This trip attempt doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If the attempt fails,\
  \ the wielder's ally is not tripped in return.\nAs a standard action on command\
  \ three times per day, the wielder can unleash a spine-chilling howl. When he does\
  \ so, he attempts a single Intimidate check to demoralize all opponents within 30\
  \ feet that can hear the howl. Allies within 30 feet can join the howl as an immediate\
  \ action to aid the wielder's Intimidate check, granting a +2 bonus to the wielder's\
  \ check for each ally who succeeds at a DC 10 Intimidate check. Allies who howl\
  \ can also immediately take a 5-foot step. This movement does not count against\
  \ their ability to move or take a 5-foot step earlier or later in the round."
