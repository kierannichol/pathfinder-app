description: "These sturdy leather robes are edged in fine linen embroidered with\
  \ runes and holy symbols. If worn by a creature capable of casting divination spells\
  \ who worships a specific deity, the embroidery shifts to depict symbols and icons\
  \ appropriate to the wearer's faith. The robes act as a divine focus for such wearers,\
  \ allowing spells requiring a divine focus to be cast without the need to hold any\
  \ other holy symbol. Additionally, if the wearer can channel energy, she can do\
  \ so one additional time per day. If the wearer can lay on hands, she instead gains\
  \ two additional uses of that ability per day. If the wearer has the fervor class\
  \ feature, she instead gains two additional uses of fervor per day."
