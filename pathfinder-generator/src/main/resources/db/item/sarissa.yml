description: "This spearlike weapon is about 15 feet long. Its unwieldy length is\
  \ counterbalanced by a heavy brass base. A sarissa provides extended reachâ€”tripling\
  \ your reach rather than doubling it. A Medium wielder would threaten spaces 10\
  \ to 15 feet away, but not adjacent squares or squares 5 to 10 feet away (as with\
  \ a typical reach weapon). Because of its great length and weight, a sarissa can\
  \ be used to attack foes in only one direction each round. You must select a cone\
  \ each round before you make any attacks with the sarissa. The weapon threatens\
  \ only foes within this cone and within its extended reach. You can't change the\
  \ area you threaten with the sarissa until your next turn. While you carry the sarissa\
  \ pointed upward (typical for overland movement), you threaten only squares in the\
  \ sarissa's reach in a cone pointed upward."
