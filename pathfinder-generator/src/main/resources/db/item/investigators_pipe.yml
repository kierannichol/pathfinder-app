description: "This long-stemmed, wooden pipe can burn any number of substances, but\
  \ is primarily used for smoking tobacco. The pipe smoker can command a small, smoky\
  \ servant to emerge from the pipe to do minor tasks. The servant can move or fetch\
  \ small objects, and in general acts as an unseen servant, except that it is visible\
  \ as a small, wispy cloud of gray smoke. Additionally, the servant is capable of\
  \ clearing one 5-foot square of smoke or fog per round. The servant can be used\
  \ for up to 1 hour per day; this time doesn't need to be continuous, but must be\
  \ used in 10-minute increments.\nAn investigator gains some additional benefits\
  \ while smoking the pipe. He can use inspiration on Survival checks to track or\
  \ Perception checks to notice fine details without spending a use of inspiration.\
  \ Additionally, once per day he can attempt a Knowledge check as if he had the eidetic\
  \ recollection investigator talent."
