description: "A barbed spear is a 10-foot-long polearm with a fourpronged head similar\
  \ to a caltrop. The head is connected to the pole by a single weak bolt, giving\
  \ the weapon the fragile condition. When you use a barbed spear to attack a creature\
  \ that is prone, flying above you, or at least one size category larger than you,\
  \ you can make a melee attack with a â€“4 penalty to jam the barbed head into the\
  \ target's foot. If you're successful, the target takes 1 point of damage and the\
  \ barbed head breaks off in the target's foot. The barb then acts as a caltrop,\
  \ wounding the creature's foot and halving its speed. This movement penalty lasts\
  \ for 24 hours, or until the creature is treated with a successful DC 15 Heal check\
  \ or receives at least 1 point of magical healing. Like caltrops, barbed spears\
  \ may not work against unusual opponents. A barbed spear that embeds its caltrop-like\
  \ head into a target's foot gains the broken condition, and can't be used as a weapon\
  \ until it's repaired."
