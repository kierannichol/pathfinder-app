description: "This mummified human hand comes from an honest man punished for a crime\
  \ he didn't commit, and is dried and hung from a simple twine thong around the neck.\
  \ The hand's scapegoat origins offer some protection to its wearer. When the wearer\
  \ of a hand of the honest man is targeted by a curse or a misfortune effect such\
  \ as a witch's misfortune or evil eye hex, the curse is instead transferred to the\
  \ hand with no ill effects to the wearer. The hand retains the curse (even if it\
  \ normally expires after a set duration) until the effect is removed with a remove\
  \ curse spell or similar effect. A spellcaster receives a +2 bonus on her caster\
  \ level check to remove a curse stored in a hand of the honest man. Removing a hand\
  \ of the honest man while it holds a curse instantly transfers the curse to its\
  \ wearer. A hand of the honest man can hold only one curse or effect at a time.\
  \ If the wearer is targeted by another curse while the hand is currently storing\
  \ a curse, the new curse takes effect normally. A hand of the honest man has no\
  \ effect on curses already affecting a creature.\nThe wearer of a hand of the honest\
  \ man is riddled with guilt over any untruths she utters, and takes a â€“2 penalty\
  \ on all Bluff checks while wearing the hand."
