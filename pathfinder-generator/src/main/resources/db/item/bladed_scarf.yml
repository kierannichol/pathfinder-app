description: "Knowing that seductive performances can bring out the worst in watchers,\
  \ some Varisians craft rows of razor-sharp blades into their scarves. The skill\
  \ required in using such scarves effectively and not revealing their deadly nature\
  \ makes them exotic weapons. If you are proficient with a bladed scarf, you deal\
  \ 1d4 points of slashing damage to any creature that makes a successful grapple\
  \ check against you while you wield the scarf. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat\
  \ to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls\
  \ with a bladed scarf sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon."
