description: "This sea-green statue is 18 inches tall and 12 inches wide, and depicts\
  \ a muscular iguana with bulging eyes and a beard of tentacles underneath its jaw.\
  \ The idol always appears wet and constantly drips water.\nThe bearer of the Doom\
  \ Idol of Ib is immune to Wisdom damage and confusion effects, although picking\
  \ up the idol does not restore lost Wisdom or remove an ongoing confusion effect.\
  \ Once per day, the bearer can use horrid wilting as a spell-like ability, using\
  \ her own Hit Dice as the caster level of the effect, but the bearer must include\
  \ herself among the spell's targets.\nThe once-living, inhuman residents of the\
  \ ruined city of Ib have a preternatural connection to the Doom Idol of Ib. Ib shades—\
  ghosts of the past inhabitants of Ib—instinctively know the distance and direction\
  \ to the Doom Idol of Ib, so long as it is on the same plane. The enigmatic creatures\
  \ relentlessly pursue the idol, attempting to recover it and return it to their\
  \ ruined city."
destruction: "The Doom Idol of Ib must be smashed against Bokrug's hide when the Great\
  \ Old One is at least a mile from any natural body of water."
