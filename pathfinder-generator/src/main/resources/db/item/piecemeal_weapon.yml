description: "This set of belts, buttons, straps, and metal pieces can be disassembled\
  \ and reassembled with 1 minute of effort to create any light or one-handed melee\
  \ or martial weapon with which the assembler is proficient (no further Craft check\
  \ is required). It can be used this way repeatedly. All weapons created with a piecemeal\
  \ weapon have and cannot lose the broken condition. A piecemeal weapon can be used\
  \ to create only a single weapon at a time, and it can't be enhanced to create magical\
  \ weapons. A light weapon created with a piecemeal weapon grants a +4 bonus on Sleight\
  \ of Hand checks to hide it on one's person."
