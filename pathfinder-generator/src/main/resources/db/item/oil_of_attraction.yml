description: "This vial of foul-smelling unguent is a great boon for trackers and\
  \ hunters. Each vial of oil is keyed to a particular kind of creature and functions\
  \ only against such creatures. The kind of creature is fairly narrow. The most common\
  \ kinds are demons, devils, dragons, hags, lycanthropes, and vampires, but others\
  \ might have corresponding oils of attraction at the GM's discretion. Whenever a\
  \ creature throws a vial at a target (treat this as a touch attack, like throwing\
  \ a splash weapon without a splash radius), the vial shatters, coating the target\
  \ on a direct hit. The foul slime drips off the coated creature, granting anyone\
  \ trying to track it a +10 circumstance bonus on Survival checks.\nThe scent of\
  \ the oil grants anyone who can smell it a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception,\
  \ Sense Motive, and Survival checks against that creature, as well as a +1 bonus\
  \ on attack and damage rolls against it. These bonuses stack with the favored enemy\
  \ class feature.\nThe oil lasts for 1 hour, during which no amount of washing with\
  \ ordinary cleaning supplies can remove the slime from a creature. Only universal\
  \ solvent denatures the oil. Bonuses from multiple oils of attraction don't stack."
