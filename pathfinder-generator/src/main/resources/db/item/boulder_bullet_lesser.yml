description: "A boulder bullet appears to be a magical sling bullet when held, but\
  \ it is actually a shrunken piece of catapult ammunition. A boulder bullet expands\
  \ rapidly when launched from a sling or sling staff, increasing in size and dealing\
  \ greater base damage depending on the version used. This doesn't affect the bullet's\
  \ range or any of the normal mechanics for using a sling bullet, though the boulder\
  \ bullet is treated as siege weapon ammunition for the purposes of wind effects\
  \ and similar penalties. Similarly, if a boulder bullet is launched and misses its\
  \ target, roll 1d8 to determine the adjacent square in which it lands. Once it has\
  \ been thrown and has expanded, a boulder bullet loses its magic and remains boulder-sized\
  \ thereafter.\nLesser Boulder Bullet (CL 10th): A lesser boulder bullet is a +1\
  \ sling bullet that expands to the size of light catapult ammunition, increasing\
  \ its base damage to 4d6.\nBoulder Bullet (CL 14th): A boulder bullet is a +2 sling\
  \ bullet that expands to the size of standard catapult ammunition, increasing its\
  \ base damage to 6d6.\nGreater Boulder Bullet (CL 18th): A greater boulder bullet\
  \ is a +3 sling bullet that expands to the size of heavy catapult ammunition, increasing\
  \ its base damage to 8d6."
