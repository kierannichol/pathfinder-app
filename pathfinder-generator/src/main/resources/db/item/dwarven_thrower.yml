description: "This weapon functions as a +2 warhammer in the hands of most users.\
  \ Yet in the hands of a dwarf, the warhammer gains an additional +1 enhancement\
  \ bonus (for a total enhancement bonus of +3) and gains the returning special ability.\
  \ It can be hurled with a 30-foot range increment. When hurled, a dwarven thrower\
  \ deals an extra 2d8 points of damage against creatures of the giant subtype or\
  \ an extra 1d8 points of damage against any other target."
