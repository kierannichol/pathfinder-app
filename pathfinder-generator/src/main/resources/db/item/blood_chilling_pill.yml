description: "Swallowing this pale green tea pill causes your blood to slow and chill,\
  \ allowing you to ignore the first 20 points of bleed damage you take during the\
  \ following 8 hours. In addition, you gain a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws\
  \ against fire effects during this time. However, you take a –2 penalty on initiative\
  \ checks. Swallowing a blood-boiling pill while under the effects of a blood-chilling\
  \ pill negates the effects of both pills."
