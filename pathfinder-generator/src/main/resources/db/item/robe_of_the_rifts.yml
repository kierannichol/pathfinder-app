description: "The Robe of the Rifts is crafted of what appears to be fine silk, but\
  \ is in fact forged of congealed dreams siphoned from the minds of slumbering spellcasters\
  \ as they were ritually murdered. It was created by Areelu Vorlesh to augment her\
  \ melee prowess soon after her transformation into a half-succubus in a process\
  \ that involved humiliating favors granted to 13 separate demon lords. The Robe\
  \ of the Rifts grants the following enhancements when it is worn."
destruction: "The Robe of the Rifts must be donned by a humanoid with an Intelligence\
  \ score of 3 or lower, who must repeat the 13 debasements Areelu performed for demon\
  \ lords when creating the robe with 13 different and unwilling angels."
