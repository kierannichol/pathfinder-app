description: "Pirates who lose a hand in the course of their adventures sometimes\
  \ attach hooks to their wrists. Hook hands can't be disarmed. They generally don't\
  \ interfere with day-to-day activities, but can't be used for tasks that would require\
  \ an actual hand (such as completing somatic components, drawing arrows, or holding\
  \ a weapon with both hands)."
