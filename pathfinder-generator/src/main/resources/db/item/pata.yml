description: "An evolution of the punching dagger, the pata is a short sword that\
  \ ends in a full, fingerless gauntlet hilt. You punch rather than stab with the\
  \ weapon, allowing you to put more force behind each strike. While wearing a pata,\
  \ you cannot use that hand for anything else. A pata provides a +10 bonus to your\
  \ CMD against disarm attempts."
