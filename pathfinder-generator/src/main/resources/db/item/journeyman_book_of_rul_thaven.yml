description: "This medium-sized book has a creased spine and supple gray leather covers.\
  \ The leather has rubbed away in certain spots, tiny pinhole burns pock the surface,\
  \ and a brass lock holds the book shut. A woman's portrait has been bound into the\
  \ front cover, and text covers almost all of the image except her face: text in\
  \ circles, with arrows pointing to new circles with suppositions. Underneath the\
  \ woman's chin are the words \"Diabolist sacrifice?\""
