description: "This crudely carved wax doll is roughly humanoid in shape. If the bearer\
  \ of a corpse puppet dies while in an alternate form (such as that of a shapechanger\
  \ using her change shape ability, a caster using a polymorph spell, or one obtained\
  \ through some other effect), the creature automatically retains the shape it had\
  \ upon dying instead of reverting to its natural form. Creatures with reason to\
  \ suspect deception can attempt a DC 12 Will save; if successful, they realize the\
  \ unnatural state of the corpse. A corpse puppet melts into nothingness when activated."
