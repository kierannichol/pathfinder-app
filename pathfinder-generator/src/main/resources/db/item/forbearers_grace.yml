description: "This circular amulet is formed from three elegantly curved golden rods\
  \ and has a deep yellow topaz in its center. When worn, the amulet provides a +2\
  \ resistance bonus on Fortitude saves against poisons and ongoing effects from poisons.\
  \ If at any point any of the wearer's ability scores would be reduced to 1 due to\
  \ ability score damage from poison, the amulet immediately shatters and the wearer\
  \ benefits from a casting of restoration. This effect does not cure any poisons\
  \ still affecting the wearer, but it destroys the amulet."
