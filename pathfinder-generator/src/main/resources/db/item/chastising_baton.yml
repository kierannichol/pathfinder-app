description: "This short metal rod is etched with the outlines of various weapons\
  \ and is usually owned by strong-armed rulers who keep a tight rein on their nation's\
  \ military. A chastising baton adds 1 to the saving throw DC of any compulsion spell\
  \ cast by the wielder and adds the pain descriptor to the spell. Creatures that\
  \ succeed at a Will save against a compulsion spell cast by the wielder are racked\
  \ with pain, taking 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and becoming sickened for 1 round."
