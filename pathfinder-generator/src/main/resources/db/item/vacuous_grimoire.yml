description: "A book of this sort looks like a normal volume on some mildly interesting\
  \ topic. Any character who opens the work and reads so much as a single word therein\
  \ must make two DC 15 Will saves. The first is to determine if the reader takes\
  \ 1 point of permanent Intelligence and Charisma drain. The second is to find out\
  \ if the reader takes 2 points of permanent Wisdom drain. To destroy the book, it\
  \ must be burned while remove curse is being cast. If the grimoire is placed with\
  \ other books, its appearance instantly alters to conform to the look of those other\
  \ works."
