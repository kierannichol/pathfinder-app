description: "Upon a frail silver chain dangles a tiny crystalline phial filled with\
  \ light blue dust. When one shatters the phial, it releases a potent flash of abjuration\
  \ magic that affects all evocation and necromancy magic in a 30-foot-radius with\
  \ a targeted dispel magic. Each phial holds one use of the dust and, once used,\
  \ the item is destroyed. This phial can be used as a thrown weapon.\nWhile legends\
  \ credit Runelord Belimarius with creating dust of envy, further historical accounts\
  \ imply that the remaining runelords also uncovered the secrets of making their\
  \ own virtue-related dusts — all of which activate under similar circumstances and\
  \ produce similar effects, being attuned to a specific sin and targeting spells\
  \ of the schools related to the two opposing sins."
