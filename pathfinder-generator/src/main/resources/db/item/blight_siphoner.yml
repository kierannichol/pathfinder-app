description: "This Shory glass needle is surrounded by a floating, spiraling glass\
  \ tube and can easily hook onto armor, clothing, or jewelry. As an immediate action,\
  \ as long as the wearer of the blight siphoner has one hand free and has the needle\
  \ within easy reach, she can stab herself with the needle when she attempts a Fortitude\
  \ saving throw against a disease she has contracted. This grants the user a +2 competence\
  \ bonus on that saving throw. In addition, if the user succeeds at the saving throw,\
  \ it counts as two consecutive saves for the purpose of curing the disease. Once\
  \ the user has succeeded at a saving throw against a disease using the blight siphoner,\
  \ the needle shatters and the item is destroyed."
