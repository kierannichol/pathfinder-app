description: "This pitch-black +1 flaming warhammer is bereft of any ornamentation\
  \ beyond an engraving on its face of a bull's head with an open flame, the unholy\
  \ symbol of the archdevil Moloch. Whenever the wielder of Sinderbos successfully\
  \ strikes a creature with the hammer, he can create a cloud of ash around the target\
  \ as an immediate action. This ash shares the target's space and persists for 1\
  \ round before dissipating. The ash does not obscure sight, but the target and any\
  \ creatures that enter the cloud must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or take\
  \ a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls for 1 round as they cough and choke on the fiery\
  \ ash. Holding one's breath provides no benefit, but creatures that don't breathe\
  \ or that have any kind of fire immunity or resistance are immune to the cloud's\
  \ effects.\nIf Moloch is the wielder's patron, the wielder can forge masterwork\
  \ armor and weapons with Sinderbos, which reduces the DC of the Craft check for\
  \ items' masterwork components to 10 (the Craft DC for the items' standard components\
  \ are unchanged). Items crafted in this way have a faint evil aura for the purposes\
  \ of detect evil or similar effects."
