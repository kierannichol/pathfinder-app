description: "This bronze, serpentine bracelet has five dangling charms, each depicting\
  \ an open and staring eye. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can touch\
  \ the bracelet to a creature with a gaze attack (requiring a successful touch attack\
  \ for unwilling creatures) and become immune to natural gaze attacks from all creatures\
  \ of that kind for the following 24 hours. The wearer could, for example, touch\
  \ the bracelet to a basilisk to gain immunity to the gaze attacks of all basilisks,\
  \ but would not be immune to the gaze of a medusa. This ability does not grant immunity\
  \ to gaze attacks from spells or magic items such as eyes of doom. For the duration\
  \ of this immunity, the charms on the bracelet each appear to be closed eyes.\n\
  When the wearer fails a save against a gaze attack, she can expend a charm from\
  \ the bracelet as an immediate action to reroll that saving throw, but must take\
  \ the second result even if it is worse. An expended charm crumbles to dust. When\
  \ the last charm is expended, the lidless charm bracelet loses all magical properties."
