description: "Made of exquisite crimson silk, this variant monk's robe is embroidered\
  \ with golden pentagrams and other fiendish symbols. If the wearer is evil and has\
  \ levels in monk, her AC bonus and unarmed damage are treated as if she were a monk\
  \ of 5 levels higher (maximum 20).\nIf the wearer is evil but not a monk, she gains\
  \ the AC bonus and unarmed damage of a 5th-level monk (although she doesn't add\
  \ her Wisdom bonus to her AC). This AC bonus otherwise functions just like the monk's\
  \ AC bonus.\nIf the robe is donned by a character with the Hamatulatsu feat (Pathfinder\
  \ Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 287), the duration of the sickened\
  \ effect increases to 2 rounds. If the wearer doesn't have the Hamatulatsu feat,\
  \ she gains this feat while wearing the robes, but gains no further benefits to\
  \ that ability."
