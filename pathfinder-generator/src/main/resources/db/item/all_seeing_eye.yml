description: "This hardened, oversized eyeball is nearly a foot in diameter. The possessor\
  \ gains a +1 insight bonus on the saving throw DCs of any spells of the divination\
  \ school he casts, as well as a +1 insight bonus on dispel checks made against divination\
  \ effects. In addition, once per week, the possessor of an all-seeing eye can cast\
  \ commune as a spell-like ability without the need for a material component. Using\
  \ an all-seeing eye in this way effectively uses up its magic for a week, and the\
  \ possessor does not benefit from the insight bonuses it grants until a week after\
  \ commune was cast."
