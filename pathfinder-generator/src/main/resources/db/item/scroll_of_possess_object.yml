name: "Scroll of Possess Object"
description: "This spell functions as magic jar, except you transfer your mind to\
  \ a single object, animating it as if using animate objects, except your mind controls\
  \ the object as if it were your own body. You cannot speak or cast spells while\
  \ possessing the object. Because your original body is effectively dead while under\
  \ the effect of this spell, this temporarily suspends disease, poisons, and other\
  \ afflictions affecting you."
