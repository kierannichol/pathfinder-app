description: "Each amulet of the Abyss bears a demon lord's rune on its face, indicating\
  \ the entity to which the amulet is attuned. An amulet of the Abyss functions as\
  \ an unholy symbol of the demon lord. For a worshiper of that demon lord, an amulet\
  \ of the Abyss also functions as a phylactery of faithfulness. An amulet of the\
  \ Abyss grants its wearer the ability to cast each of the three spell-like abilities\
  \ granted by the associated demon lord's first exalted demonic boon once per day.\
  \ See the individual demon lord entries in Chapter 1 for lists of the spells each\
  \ demon lord grants as an exalted boon. Any lawful or good character who wears this\
  \ amulet gains 2 negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the amulet\
  \ is worn and cannot be overcome in any way as long as the amulet is worn (though\
  \ they never result in actual level loss)."
