description: "The jewel of everlasting gold is a fist-sized ruby mounted in a bejeweled,\
  \ rune-carved scepter and held in place with platinum stems. Tar-Baphon, the Whispering\
  \ Tyrant, crafted the jewel of everlasting gold to be the centerpiece of his treasure\
  \ city, Xin-Grafar. He used the jewel to summon the city's rivers of molten gold\
  \ directly from the Elemental Plane of Earth and to create much of the wealth within\
  \ the city. He also placed a small portion of his intelligence inside the jewel—\
  not enough to make it an intelligent item, but just enough for the jewel to act\
  \ on Tar-Baphon's instincts. Tar-Baphon enshrined the jewel in the heart of Xin-\
  \ Grafar, forever the linking it to the city. Should the jewel of everlasting gold\
  \ ever be taken beyond the boundaries of the city, it simply disappears and returns\
  \ to its perch at the city's heart. Because he knew thieves would eventually gain\
  \ access to the city, Tar-Baphon also created a trap using the powers of the jewel.\
  \ Once the city is sealed, the jewel can sense intruders entering the city. When\
  \ a trespasser is detected, Tar-Baphon's trap is activated and the city floods with\
  \ molten gold (see page 14). This is an automatic response that cannot be stopped.\n\
  The jewel also has several additional powers, all of which the bearer knows how\
  \ to use the moment she touches the artifact."
destruction: "The jewel of everlasting gold crumbles to dust if thrown into Karzoug's\
  \ runewell of greed."
