description: "A hand-cranked press uses a plate on which all of the text on a page\
  \ is carved in reverse. Changing the plate is a simple process, but creating a new\
  \ one is expensive and laborintensive. The press prints one page at a time, at a\
  \ rate of about five pages per minute. A stationer then needs to cut and trim the\
  \ pages and bind the book."
