description: "This stylish, purple silk shirt trimmed with designs embroidered in\
  \ golden thread brings out reckless behavior in even the most conservative swashbucklers.\
  \ If the wearer has the panache class feature, when she takes damage from a successful\
  \ critical hit, she regains 1 panache point. This shirt has no effect on someone\
  \ who is not a panache user."
