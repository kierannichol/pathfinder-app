description: "An improved form of leather armor, studded leather armor is covered\
  \ with dozens of metal protuberances. While these rounded studs offer little defense\
  \ individually, in the numbers they are arrayed in upon such armor, they help catch\
  \ lethal edges and channel them away from vital spots. The rigidity caused by the\
  \ additional metal does, however, result in less mobility than is afforded by a\
  \ suit of normal leather armor."
