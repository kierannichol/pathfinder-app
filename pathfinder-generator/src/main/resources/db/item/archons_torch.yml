  \ When lit, it burns as a regular torch, but only lasts for 5 minutes. When held\
  \ by a lawful good creature, it functions as an archon's aura spell. The magical\
  \ aura ends if a lawful good creature isn't holding it, and resumes automatically\
  \ if a lawful good creature holds it again."
