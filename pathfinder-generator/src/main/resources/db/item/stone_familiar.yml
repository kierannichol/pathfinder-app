description: "This life-sized carving of a Tiny animal is crafted from dark, rough\
  \ stone. It has a hardness of 8 and 20 hit points. A witch can use the stone familiar\
  \ to store up to 500 levels of spells (cantrips count as 1/2 level for this purpose).\
  \ A witch can use the stone familiar to teach her living familiar any spells stored\
  \ in it, and vice versa. A witch who identifies a stone familiar immediately knows\
  \ what spells are stored inside it. A stone familiar is never found as randomly\
  \ generated treasure with spells already stored in it."
