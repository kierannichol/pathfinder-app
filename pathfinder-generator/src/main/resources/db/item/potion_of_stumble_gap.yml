name: "Potion of Stumble Gap"
description: "You create a shallow extradimensional hole perfectly sized to trip anyone\
  \ who steps within it. This hole occupies a single 5-foot square with a depth of\
  \ six inches. Any creature occupying the square when you first create the hole,\
  \ or who later steps into the square containing the hole, must make a Reflex saving\
  \ throw to avoid falling prone in an adjacent square and taking 1d6 points of damage.\
  \ A creature that makes its saving throw still stumbles ever so slightly and takes\
  \ a â€“1 penalty on all rolls and checks for 1 round. The spell has no effect on creatures\
  \ adjacent to the square containing the hole."
