description: "The user can sound this ornate silver horn as a normal signal horn.\
  \ Once per day as a standard action, the user can make the horn emit an eerie, canine\
  \ howl. The sound entices up to four wolves within 200 feet to answer the howl.\
  \ This includes dire wolves, winter wolves, wolves, worgs, and dogs, as well as\
  \ any creatures capable of turning into wolves with the change shape ability (such\
  \ as barghests, vampires, or werewolves). If there are more than four such creatures\
  \ within the area, those that are closest to the user are affected first.\nThe subjects\
  \ can't take any actions other than to howl, making them effectively dazed for 1\
  \ round. A successful DC 17 Will save negates this effect. The horn affects werewolves\
  \ in any form, though werewolves who are aware of their condition receive a +5 bonus\
  \ on the saving throw while in humanoid form."
