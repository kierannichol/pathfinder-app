description: "This sphere of wood and metal about 3 inches in diameter is engraved\
  \ with waves, a boat, sails, and clouds.\nThe bearer of the Spherical Boat of Zutha\
  \ can hear a faint ticking sound and see the waves, boat, and clouds engraved upon\
  \ it moving slowly, as if animated by miniature clockwork mechanisms. When the bearer\
  \ speaks a command word as a standard action, the sphere quickly unfolds, its many\
  \ parts twisting, turning, and growing to form a ship as large as a small manor\
  \ in the space of a single round, in the same manner as a folding boat. While expanding,\
  \ the ship destroys any nonmagical barriers of hardness 10 or less. If barriers\
  \ of greater hardness constrain it, the ship returns to its spherical form.\nThe\
  \ ship has the statistics presented below. The bearer of the Spherical Boat of Zutha\
  \ can mentally steer the ship while aboard it. If the ship loses all its hit points,\
  \ it returns to its spherical form and cannot be commanded to unfold for 1 month;\
  \ after this time, the ship is restored to its maximum hit points.\nA second command\
  \ word causes the ship to fold itself again to a small sphere. When the ship returns\
  \ to its spherical form, whether due to hit point damage or its spoken command word,\
  \ everything inside the ship (including its cargo and all creatures other than the\
  \ bearer) enters an extradimensional space shaped like the ship. The bearer is safely\
  \ ejected during this shrinking, occupying the same space as the small sphere. Creatures\
  \ trapped inside the ship don't need food or drink and do not age, but every month\
  \ the ship consumes the life energy of one random creature stored inside it, killing\
  \ the creature instantly."
destruction: "If the Spherical Boat of Zutha is filled with ash while in ship form\
  \ and then commanded to shrink, it bursts, dealing 20d6 points of slashing damage\
  \ to creatures within 100 feet and leaving behind only blackened metal and sawdust."
