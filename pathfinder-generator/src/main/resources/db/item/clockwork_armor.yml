description: "This suit of +2 field plate is composed of durable plates of steel layered\
  \ over an intricate framework of gears, springs, and pistons that move with mechanical\
  \ precision. A suit of clockwork armor requires a special winding key to function;\
  \ this key is created as part of making a suit of clockwork armor.\nIn order to\
  \ function, a suit of clockwork armor must be fully wound as a full-round action.\
  \ Once fully wound, a suit of clockwork armor functions for 4 hours. If a suit of\
  \ clockwork armor is not fully wound, its gears grind to a halt and it imposes double\
  \ its normal armor check penalty and a â€“2 penalty to its wearer's Strength and Dexterity\
  \ scores. Donning or removing a suit of unwound clockwork armor requires 10 minutes.\n\
  When fully wound, a suit of clockwork armor can be donned or removed as a full-round\
  \ action that provokes attacks of opportunity. It grants the wearer a +4 temporary\
  \ enhancement bonus to Strength and Constitution, and its weight does not count\
  \ against the wearer's total encumbrance. A single crossbow or firearm sized appropriately\
  \ for the wearer can be added to the armor with a successful DC 20 Craft (armorer)\
  \ check. Such a weapon can be fired once as a standard action by the wearer, then\
  \ automatically reloads itself in 2d4 rounds, as long as the wearer has the appropriate\
  \ ammunition in his gear."
