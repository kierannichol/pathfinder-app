description: "Crafted from brass and polished quartz, these expensive bifocals grant\
  \ the wearer a +5 bonus on Appraise checks, and on Linguistics or Perception checks\
  \ to detect a forgery. However, after they have been worn for 1 week, they begin\
  \ distorting the wearer's perception of value, replacing this bonus with a –10 penalty\
  \ on the same checks. This penalty persists even when a victim is not wearing the\
  \ spendthrift spectacles. Whenever the wearer is making a purchase that costs more\
  \ than 10 gp, he must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be compelled to make extravagant\
  \ offers and pay outrageous prices (1d10 × 10% more than the asking price) for the\
  \ item, paying with coin and valuables if available, or bartering with other equipment\
  \ if not."
