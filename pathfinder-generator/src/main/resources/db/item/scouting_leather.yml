description: "The Sargavan government often issues this armor to scouts traveling\
  \ through the jungle. This +1 expeditious glamered leather armor is colored a deep\
  \ brown and painted with jungle camouflage. Scouts transform the armor to match\
  \ the armor style and symbology of communities they visit, and use the expeditious\
  \ special ability if they find they're unwelcome. In its true form, the armor grants\
  \ a +3 competence bonus on Stealth checks. When transformed to fit a culture's style\
  \ of dress, it instead grants a +3 competence bonus on Diplomacy checks against\
  \ people of that culture."
