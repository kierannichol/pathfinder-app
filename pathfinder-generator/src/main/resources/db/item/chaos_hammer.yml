description: "This oversized hammer crackles with chaotic energy. Once per day as\
  \ a standard action, the wielder of this +1 anarchic warhammer can strike the ground\
  \ to create the effects of the chaos hammer spell (Will DC 16, CL 9th) that bursts\
  \ out from the warhammer's wielder. A mythic creature wielding this weapon can expend\
  \ one use of mythic power to activate this ability without using up its daily use."
