description: "This ring is shaped like a silver snake with an onyx in its mouth. Once\
  \ per day, if the wearer would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points but not be dead,\
  \ she is instead reduced to 0 hit points and subject to an effect similar to mislead.\
  \ Her illusory double appears to die or to take on the dying condition in her place,\
  \ as appropriate for the negated effect. The wearer cannot control the double. In\
  \ addition, the wearer can touch the ring's stone as a standard action once per\
  \ day to use dimension door but only while the ring's mislead effect is active."
