description: "This small canister has a hand pump, allowing it to forcefully eject\
  \ the semi-ethereal green concoction held within. Spraying a creature with ectoplasmic\
  \ tracer is a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A single canister\
  \ holds enough ectoplasmic tracer to coat one Medium or smaller incorporeal creature.\
  \ When coated with ectoplasmic tracer, an incorporeal creature leaves behind a trail\
  \ of vibrant mucus that allows it to be tracked by mundane means. Calculate the\
  \ Survival DC to track an incorporeal creature covered in ectoplasmic tracer as\
  \ though you were following tracks left on soft ground. Once discharged, ectoplasmic\
  \ tracer dissolves after 1d4 days. Ectoplasmic tracer has no effect when sprayed\
  \ on a corporeal creature. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 20 Craft\
  \ (alchemy) check."
