description: "Generally stored in a glass vial, an antidote is formulated to counteract\
  \ a specific poison chosen at the time of the antidote's creation. Drinking the\
  \ antidote grants a +10 alchemical bonus on saving throws against that poison for\
  \ 4 hours. If the imbiber succeeds at a saving throw with this bonus, she is automatically\
  \ cured even if she would not normally be cured by successful saving throws or the\
  \ number required to cure her has not been met yet. However, the antidote has no\
  \ effect against other poisons. An antidote's price is half that of the poison it\
  \ counteracts. An antidote has no effect against a magical poison. The Craft (alchemy)\
  \ DC to create an antidote is equal to the save DC of the poison."
