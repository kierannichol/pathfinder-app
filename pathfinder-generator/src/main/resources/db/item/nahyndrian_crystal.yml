description: "Normally, when a demon lord is slain while its Abyssal resurrection\
  \ ability has already been used, its body joins the countless others petrified into\
  \ the walls of the Rift of Repose. The demon lord Nocticula discovered a method\
  \ to bypass this, however, and now any demon lord slain by her is instead absorbed\
  \ into her realm, creating an island in her domain. The demon lord's personality\
  \ and themes influence the nature of the newly formed isle, but little of its physical\
  \ form remains save for its ichor. This lifeblood fossilizes deep within the island\
  \ into Nahyndrian crystals.\nThe majority of Nahyndrian crystals are flawed, but\
  \ the most perfect of them retain the mythic power of their demonic source. These\
  \ Nahyndrian crystals have hardness 30 and 120 hit points, and can be used in the\
  \ creation of various powerful items.\nNahyndrian crystals feel cold to the touch,\
  \ and contact with one can be debilitating. When a creature touches a Nahyndrian\
  \ crystal, it takes 1d4 points of Wisdom drain as flashes of horrific anguish flood\
  \ the creature's mind (Fortitude DC 25 negates). A creature can only be affected\
  \ in this way by a Nahyndrian crystal once in a 24-hour period.\nA creature that\
  \ carries a Nahyndrian crystal on its person (even if the crystal is carried in\
  \ an extradimensional space, such as a bag of holding) gains 2 negative levels;\
  \ creatures with both the chaotic and evil subtypes only gain 1 negative level in\
  \ this manner. These negative levels remain as long as the crystal is carried and\
  \ are removed as soon as the crystal is abandoned. The negative levels from multiple\
  \ Nahyndrian crystals stack. These negative levels never result in actual level\
  \ loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way while the crystal is possessed (including\
  \ via restoration spells). A creature who carries enough Nahyndrian crystals to\
  \ gain enough negative levels to equal or exceed its Hit Dice immediately dies—\
  a humanoid slain in this manner immediately rises as an advanced bodak.\nA Nahyndrian\
  \ crystal cannot be teleported. Anyone attempting to use a teleportation effect\
  \ on a creature carrying a Nahyndrian crystal (including the creature itself) must\
  \ attempt a DC 30 caster level check. If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn't\
  \ work and is wasted; otherwise, the spell works normally, but any Nahyndrian crystals\
  \ carried by the teleporter remain behind, dropping to the ground where the teleporter\
  \ was previously standing."
destruction: "A Nahyndrian crystal can be destroyed by physical damage, provided the\
  \ source can penetrate the crystal's hardness."
