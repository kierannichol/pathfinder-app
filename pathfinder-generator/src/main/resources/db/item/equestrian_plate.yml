description: "Shined to a mirror finish, this suit of +2 full plate is decorated with\
  \ gold inlay. As a move action when the wearer is mounted, the plates of the armor\
  \ expand and reposition to protect the wearer's mount. In this form, the armor becomes\
  \ a suit of +2 banded mail for the wearer and a suit of +1 banded mail barding worn\
  \ by the mount. A second move action merges it back into +2 full plate. Equestrian\
  \ plate cannot transform and protect a mount more than one size larger than its\
  \ wearer or a creature that cannot wear barding. It can create exotic barding, however,\
  \ such as for a griffon or dragon.\nIf extra enhancements or spells are placed upon\
  \ equestrian plate in full plate form, they affect only the wearer's armor when\
  \ the suit is split. Effects on the barding are suppressed when it is merged into\
  \ the armor. If either suit of armor is broken while separated, the other half immediately\
  \ gains the broken condition as well. Destroying one suit destroys the other as\
  \ well."
