description: "This large lens of green crystal has the Thassilonian rune for transmutation\
  \ and greed inscribed upon its surface. The lens is fitted in an iron ring, which\
  \ is attached to an articulated arm that allows the lens's position to be adjusted\
  \ to any angle and configuration. The soul lens has but a single purpose—whenever\
  \ a creature is subjected to a specific ritual in which its body is branded, tattooed,\
  \ or otherwise marked with the Sihedron rune, the lens can focus upon that creature's\
  \ soul. At any point thereafter when the marked creature dies, its soul passes through\
  \ this lens on its way into the afterlife and eventual judgement before Pharasma—\
  as the soul passes through, the soul lens filters elements of the sin of greed from\
  \ the soul and focuses that fragment of soul-energy into the runewell of greed.\
  \ This does not significantly damage the soul (although it does cause it a severe\
  \ amount of spiritual anguish)—a creature that dies and has its soul filtered through\
  \ the soul lens can still be brought back to life as normal."
destruction: "A dominant weapon must be used to smash the soul lens. The soul lens\
  \ has hardness 20 (this hardness cannot be bypassed) and 200 hit points, but the\
  \ dominant weapon gains the full benefits of its bane special abilities when damaging\
  \ the soul lens. The soul lens takes no damage from other attacks."
