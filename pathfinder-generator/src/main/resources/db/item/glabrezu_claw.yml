description: "This gruesome artifact looks like the mummified, hollowed-out arm of\
  \ a glabrezu. This graft contains an imprisoned parasitic demon that can be satiated\
  \ only by mythic power. To use the artifact, the user must place his own naked arm\
  \ into the hollow graft, which then permanently bonds itself to his flesh and muscle.\
  \ If placed upon the arm of a nonmythic character, the graft instead devours the\
  \ limb, dealing 5d6 points of damage and amputating the arm.\nOnce attached, the\
  \ glabrezu claw surrounds its wearer with a field of force. This provides a deflection\
  \ bonus to AC equal to the wearer's mythic tier. The wearer also gains immunity\
  \ to electricity and poison. In addition, the wearer can feed the glabrezu claw\
  \ some of his mythic power in order to activate spell-like abilities. All these\
  \ spell-like abilities have a caster level equivalent to the graft wearer's total\
  \ class levels plus his mythic tier.\nThe graft wearer can expend one use of mythic\
  \ power to gain telepathy with a range of 100 feet for 2 hours (Bestiary 300) or\
  \ cast any of the following spells: chaos hammer, confusion, dispel magic, mirror\
  \ image, reverse gravity, or true seeing.\nBy expending two uses, he can cast greater\
  \ teleport (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), veil (self only), or unholy blight.\n\
  By expending three uses, he can cast power word stun or summon (level 4, either\
  \ 1 glabrezu 30% or 1d2 vrocks 70%; Bestiary 300)."
destruction: "A glabrezu claw crumbles to dust and the demon within is destroyed if\
  \ placed upon arm of a formerly evil high priest who has atoned for his past and\
  \ converted to worship a good deity."
