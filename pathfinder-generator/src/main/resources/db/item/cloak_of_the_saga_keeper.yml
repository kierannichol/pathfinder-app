description: "Not all who board Ulfen longships or travel the paths of Kellid mammoth\
  \ hunters are capable warriors, even though they may be just as brave. A cloak of\
  \ the saga keeper is made from layers of fox fur and leather cut in strips reminiscent\
  \ of fluttering lengths of scroll. Seven of these strips are dyed vibrant red. The\
  \ wearer of the cloak constantly benefits from the effects of endure elements while\
  \ in cold conditions, and gains resist energy 2 against cold damage. Additionally,\
  \ the wearer of the cloak can, as an immediate action, pluck one of the cloak's\
  \ seven dyed strips to gain a +6 bonus to a Climb, Handle Animal, Ride, Survival,\
  \ or Swim check made that round. These strips dissolve immediately upon being plucked.\
  \ Once all seven of the cloak's strips have been torn off, the wearer can no longer\
  \ maker use of the cloak's skill-improving effects, but continues to benefit from\
  \ the endure elements and resistance abilities."
