description: "A stormstone functions like a thunderstone, but deals 1d6 points of\
  \ sonic damage in addition to deafening creatures; a successful DC 15 Fortitude\
  \ save halves the damage and reduces the deafness to 1 round rather than negating\
  \ it.\nMythic: If you expend one use of mythic power while throwing a stormstone,\
  \ the item deals an amount of electricity damage equal to your mythic tier to all\
  \ affected creatures, regardless of whether they succeed at their save. Creatures\
  \ that fail their saving throws against a mythic stormstone become staggered for\
  \ 1 round in addition to the other effects. The stormstone ignores non-mythic resistances,\
  \ non-mythic immunity to electricity or sonic damage, and non-mythic silencing effects."
