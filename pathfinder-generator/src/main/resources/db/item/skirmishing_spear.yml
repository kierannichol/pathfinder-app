description: "When thrown, this +1 returning spear is considered a one-handed weapon\
  \ and gains a +2 bonus on the attack roll. If the spear hits when thrown, the wielder\
  \ can, as an immediate action, expend one use of mythic power to teleport to an\
  \ unoccupied space adjacent to the creature struck. This effect is treated as dimension\
  \ door, except the wielder can act after teleporting. The spear comes back to its\
  \ wielder's hand when he appears. If he hadn't taken a move action prior to throwing\
  \ the spear, he can continue a full attack with the spear."
