description: "This fantastic vehicle was fashioned specifically for General Tawaret,\
  \ who rode it into battle throughout her military career. The chariot of the conqueror\
  \ is a light chariot pulled by a team of two ghostly manticores controlled by beaded\
  \ reigns. The manticores can only draw the chariot; they cannot attack or otherwise\
  \ act. The chariot's statistics are Hardness 10, hp 180, Base Save +2, Maximum Speed\
  \ 200 ft., fly 200 ft. (perfect); Acceleration 100 ft., fly 100 ft.; all other statistics\
  \ conform to those of a standard light chariot (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 181).\n\
  The chariot of the conqueror treats all terrain as normal, including water—the vehicle\
  \ glides smoothly over liquid as though it were pavement—and can even fly. On command,\
  \ the chariot can drive itself for up to 1 hour with a +20 bonus on drive checks,\
  \ following the driver's verbal orders. Otherwise, the driver must attempt driving\
  \ checks to control the ghostly steeds drawing the chariot as normal (Ultimate Combat\
  \ 170).\nThe chariot of the conqueror can carry up to two Medium creatures: one\
  \ driver and one passenger. Creatures riding in the chariot gain a +4 cover bonus\
  \ to AC. Passengers balance perfectly while riding in the vehicle, even if it's\
  \ moving sideways or upside down, making it a perfect platform for archers or others\
  \ making ranged attacks. Damage to the chariot can be magically repaired, but if\
  \ reduced to 0 hit points, it's destroyed."
