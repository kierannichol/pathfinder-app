description: "A short whip with a leather loop at the end, this whip can be felt through\
  \ a horse's armor but does not deal damage to the horse. A rider who uses a horse\
  \ whip while using the Ride skill to spur her mount does not deal damage to the\
  \ mount, as opposed to the 1d3 points of damage normally dealt by this action. Using\
  \ a horse whip does not negate the fatigue that spurring a mount can cause."
