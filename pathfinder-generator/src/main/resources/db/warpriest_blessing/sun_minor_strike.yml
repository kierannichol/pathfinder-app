description: "At 1st level, you can create a flash of sunlight in the eyes of one\
  \ of your opponents. The target is blinded for 1 round. If it succeeds at a Reflex\
  \ saving throw, it’s instead dazzled for 1 round. Creatures with light blindness\
  \ or light sensitivity take a –4 penalty on this saving throw. This is a light effect.\
  \ Sightless creatures are unaffected by this ability."
