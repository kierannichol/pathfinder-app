description: "At 1st level, as a swift action you can target a creature within 30\
  \ feet that has the cowering, frightened, panicked, or paralyzed condition. That\
  \ condition is suspended for 1 round, and the chosen creature gains the confused\
  \ condition instead. The confused creature rerolls any result other than “attack\
  \ self” or “attack nearest creature.” The round spent confused counts toward the\
  \ duration of the suspended effect. At the end of the confused round, the suspended\
  \ condition resumes."
