description: "At 10th level, when using channel energy to heal living creatures, you\
  \ can take a swift action on that same turn to also deal damage to undead creatures\
  \ (as your channel energy ability). Undead take an amount of damage equal to half\
  \ the amount healed, and can attempt the normal saving throw to halve this damage."
