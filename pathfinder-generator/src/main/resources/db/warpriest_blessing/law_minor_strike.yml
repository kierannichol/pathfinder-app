description: "At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and enhance it with the essence\
  \ of law. For 1 minute, this weapon glows blue, pale yellow, or white and deals\
  \ an additional 1d6 points of damage against chaotic creatures. During this time,\
  \ it’s treated as lawful for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This additional\
  \ damage doesn’t stack with the additional damage from the axiomatic weapon special\
  \ ability."
