description: "At 10th level, as a swift or immediate action, you can inflict a curse\
  \ on any adjacent creature that scores a critical hit against you or deals precision\
  \ damage to you. The target must succeed at a Will saving throw or be cursed. Select\
  \ one of the following effects: the target takes a –2 penalty to one ability score\
  \ of your choice (the ability cannot be reduced below 1); the target takes a –2\
  \ penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks; each\
  \ turn, the target has a 25% chance of taking no action (otherwise, it acts normally).\
  \ This curse lasts for 1 hour. A creature can be subjected to only one instance\
  \ of retributive curse at a time. This otherwise functions as bestow curse."
