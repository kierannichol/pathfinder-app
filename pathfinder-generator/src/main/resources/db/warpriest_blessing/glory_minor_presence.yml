description: "At 1st level, you can touch an ally and grant it a glorious blessing.\
  \ For 1 minute, the ally becomes mesmerizing to her foes. This functions as sanctuary,\
  \ except if the ally attacks an opponent, this effect ends with respect to only\
  \ that opponent. This is a mind-affecting effect."
