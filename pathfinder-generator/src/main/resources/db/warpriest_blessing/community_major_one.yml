description: "At 10th level, you can rally your allies to fight together. For 1 minute,\
  \ whenever you make a successful melee or ranged attack against a foe, allies within\
  \ 10 feet of you gain a +2 insight bonus on attacks of the same type you made against\
  \ that foe—melee attacks if you made a melee attack, or ranged attacks if you made\
  \ a ranged attack. If you score a critical hit, this bonus increases to +4 until\
  \ the start of your next turn."
