description: "At 10th level, you can make a melee touch attack against an opponent\
  \ to deliver grim suffering. If you succeed, you inflict 1 temporary negative level\
  \ on the target for 1 minute. Alternatively, you can activate this ability as a\
  \ swift action upon hitting an opponent with a melee attack. These temporary negative\
  \ levels stack. You gain no benefit from imposing these negative levels (such as\
  \ the temporary hit points undead gain from enervation)."
