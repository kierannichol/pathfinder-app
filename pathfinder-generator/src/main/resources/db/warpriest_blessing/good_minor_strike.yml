description: "At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and bless it with the power of\
  \ purity and goodness. For 1 minute, this weapon glows green, white, or yellow-gold\
  \ and deals an additional 1d6 points of damage against evil creatures. During this\
  \ time, it’s treated as good for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This\
  \ additional damage doesn’t stack with the additional damage from the holy weapon\
  \ special ability."
