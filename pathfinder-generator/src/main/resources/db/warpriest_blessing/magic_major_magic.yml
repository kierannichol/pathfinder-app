description: "At 10th level, you can cast a prepared warpriest spell without expending\
  \ its spell slot. The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action and must\
  \ use a spell slot that is at least 3 spell levels lower than the highest warpriest\
  \ spell level you can cast. In addition, the spell must be one that damages a creature\
  \ or causes a creature to take penalties (such as inflict light wounds or bane).\
  \ For example, if you are 10th level and can cast 4th-level warpriest spells, you\
  \ could use this blessing to cast a 1st-level warpriest spell without expending\
  \ its spell slot."
