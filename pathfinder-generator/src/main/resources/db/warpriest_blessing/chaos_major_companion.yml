description: "At 10th level, you can summon a battle companion. This ability functions\
  \ as summon monster IV with a duration of 1 minute, but for only a chaotic outsider\
  \ or an animal with the entropic creature simple template. This ability can summon\
  \ only one creature, regardless of the list used. For every 2 levels beyond 10th,\
  \ the level of the summon monster spell increases by 1 (to a maximum of summon monster\
  \ IX at 20th level)."
