description: "At 10th level, you can teleport up to 20 feet as a move action. You\
  \ can increase this distance by expending another use of your blessing—each use\
  \ spent grants an additional 20 feet. You must have line of sight to your destination.\
  \ This teleportation doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity. You can bring other\
  \ willing creatures with you, but each such creature requires expending one additional\
  \ use of your blessing, regardless of the distance traveled. (For example, transporting\
  \ yourself 40 feet costs 2 uses of your blessing, and transporting an additional\
  \ person this distance costs 1 more use.)"
