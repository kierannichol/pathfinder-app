description: "At 1st level, with a successful melee touch attack you can steal the\
  \ breath from an opponent’s lungs, leaving it unable to speak, use breath weapons,\
  \ cast spells with verbal components, or do anything else requiring breath for 1\
  \ round. If the target fails at a Fortitude saving throw, it’s also staggered for\
  \ 1 round as it catches its breath. If the target was attempting to hold its breath,\
  \ it can no longer do so: it must breathe on its turn or risk suffocation and unconsciousness.\
  \ Creatures that don’t need to breathe are unaffected. Regardless of whether it\
  \ succeeds at its saving throw, the target is immune to further uses of your airless\
  \ touch for 24 hours."
