description: "At 10th level, you can rally your allies within 30 feet, allowing each\
  \ to immediately do one of the following as a free action that does not provoke\
  \ attacks of opportunity: remove the flat-footed condition, take a 5-foot step,\
  \ draw a weapon, ready a shield, or gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round. You\
  \ can affect a number of allies equal to your Wisdom bonus. These actions do not\
  \ count against your alliesâ€™ total movement or actions on their next turn."
