description: "The alchemist can develop special pigments and combine them with his\
  \ alchemical reagents to create unique dyes that cling to the empty space around\
  \ him, allowing him to paint images in the air to fool his enemies. By expending\
  \ two daily uses of his bombs, he can use the dyes to create an image in a space\
  \ adjacent to him, as silent image, using his alchemist level as the spellâ€™s caster\
  \ level. The image he creates remains for a number of minutes equal to his alchemist\
  \ level. He can dismiss this image as a standard action."
