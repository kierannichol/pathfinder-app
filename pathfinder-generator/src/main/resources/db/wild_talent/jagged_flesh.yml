description: "You painfully push forth jagged chunks of rock from your flesh. Until\
  \ the next time your burn is removed, while your flesh of stone is active, any creature\
  \ that strikes you with an unarmed strike or natural weapon or that grapples you\
  \ takes 1d6 points of piercing damage. Weapons that strike you also take this damage,\
  \ though the damage is unlikely to penetrate the weaponâ€™s hardness."
