description: "You use kinetic healer, void healer, or wood healer (whichever you have,\
  \ or either if you have both) to heal all creatures in a 30-foot radius around you.\
  \ Healing burst heals half as much damage as normal, unless your healing amount\
  \ is based on positive blast, in which case it heals the full amount. Unlike kinetic\
  \ healer, you must accept the burn yourself. This counts as kinetic healer for the\
  \ purpose of the kinetic chirurgeon archetype; the 17th-level metahealer ability\
  \ heals the kinetic chirurgeon twice, once for half and once for full."
