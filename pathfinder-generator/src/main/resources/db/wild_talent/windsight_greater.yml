description: "You can send a slight breeze in a path up to 480 feet long and then\
  \ back to where you wait. This allows you to use your windsight wild talent to catch\
  \ a quick glimpse and hear a tiny snippet from any location that could be reached\
  \ by the wind traveling that distance (the wind’s path can’t pass through openings\
  \ smaller than 1 inch in diameter). The breeze travels 100 feet per round, so what\
  \ you see and hear is delayed by 1 round for every 50 feet of the path. If you spend\
  \ at least 10 minutes to set up a steady flow of wind, you can concentrate for up\
  \ to 1 minute per level to gain continuous visual and auditory information for as\
  \ long as you concentrate, delayed by 1 round for every 100 feet the wind travels\
  \ (since the steady flow of wind has to travel only one way). While there is no\
  \ invisible sensor to detect with this ability, creatures along the path of the\
  \ breeze may notice a light wind, though it may not seem out of the ordinary."
