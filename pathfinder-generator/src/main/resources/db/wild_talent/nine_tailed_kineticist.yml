description: "You can cast a spell-like ability granted to you by any Magical TailARG\
  \ feat you have by accepting 1 point of burn, even if you have no daily uses of\
  \ that spell-like ability remaining. You must be able to use wild talents of a level\
  \ equal to the number of extra tails required to use a spell-like ability granted\
  \ by a Magic Tail feat to use this ability to cast that spell-like ability (for\
  \ example, you would need to be 15th level and able to use 8th-level wild talents\
  \ to use this talent to cast the dominate person spell-like ability granted by Magical\
  \ Tail). In addition, you can learn a Magical Tail feat that you qualify for in\
  \ place of gaining a new infusion or utility wild talent."
