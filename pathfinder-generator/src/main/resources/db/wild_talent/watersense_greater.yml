name: "Watersense, Greater"
description: "You project your watersense outward through the tides and water around\
  \ you, allowing you to spy on others at a distance.You can take 10 minutes to project\
  \ your senses, choosing a location within 480 feet that is connected to your current\
  \ location via the same continuous body of water, or you can take 1 hour to attempt\
  \ to spy on a specific creature within 1 mile per kineticist level that is visible\
  \ from a location connected to your current location via the same continuous body\
  \ of water.In the latter case, the creature receives a Will save as per scrying\
  \ (including bonuses and penalties based on connection and knowledge); a target\
  \ that saves is immune to your greater watersense for 24 hours. In either case,\
  \ an extremely thin funnel of water, lasting for 1 minute per kineticist level,\
  \ carries light and sound to your location, where your target area or location appears\
  \ in the water next to you and you can view it as if through a scrying sensor, allowing\
  \ you to both see and hear the area immediately surrounding the other end of the\
  \ funnel.In the case of a distance greater than 480 feet, the sound comes 1 round\
  \ later than its corresponding visual information for every mile away you are (for\
  \ instance, if you were 5 miles away, you would see your target start talking 5\
  \ rounds before you heard what it said). When you are tracking a creature, the funnel\
  \ moves as best it can through the water to follow that creature, up to 150 feet\
  \ per round, but the target can escape by simply moving away from the water. If\
  \ you also possess the voice of the wind wild talent, you can use its message effect\
  \ to send your voice through the funnel with a delay of 1 round per mile. This wild\
  \ talent is a divination and scrying effect."
