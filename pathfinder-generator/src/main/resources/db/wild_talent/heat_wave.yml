description: "You create an aura of shimmering heat that distorts the area around\
  \ you. Until the next time your burn is removed, you can begin or end the heat aura\
  \ as a swift action. The temperature in the area 30 feet around you rises by 5°\
  \ F per kineticist level you possess, to a maximum modified temperature of 120°\
  \ F. If this brings the temperature to at least 90° F, all attacks made by creatures\
  \ within 5 feet of you suffer a 20% miss chance due to concealment. You are immune\
  \ to these effects, as are those immune to fire or benefiting from endure elements."
