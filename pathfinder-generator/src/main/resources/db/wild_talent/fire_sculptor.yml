name: "Fire Sculptor"
description: "You can sculpt shapes out of flame or alter a fire’s spread. As a standard\
  \ action, you can move one 5-foot square of an ongoing fire per kineticist level\
  \ you possess to any square contiguous to that fire. For instance, a 4th-level kineticist\
  \ could move 4 contiguous squares from the center of a 20-foot-by-20-foot fire to\
  \ the fire’s edge in order to create a safe path to escape. The fire continues to\
  \ spread normally after you sculpt it."
