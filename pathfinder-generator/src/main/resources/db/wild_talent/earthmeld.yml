name: "Earthmeld"
description: "You meld a creature into stone, where it can listen to conversations\
  \ without being detected. This functions as the meld into stone spell, except it\
  \ can work on any willing creature, not just you, and it lasts for 10 minutes per\
  \ kineticist level or until you use earthmeld again. The melded creature, not you,\
  \ decides when to step out of the stone. You can accept 1 point of burn to increase\
  \ the duration of an earthmeld until the next time you recover burn. Such increased\
  \ earthmelds donâ€™t end if you use earthmeld again, allowing you to maintain multiple\
  \ earthmelds."
