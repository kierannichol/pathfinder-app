description: "You chill your shroud of water and send the cold around you, creating\
  \ an aura of numbing cold around yourself. Until the next time your burn is removed,\
  \ you can begin or end the cold aura at will as a swift action. The temperature\
  \ in the area 30 feet around you lowers by 5° F per kineticist level you possess,\
  \ to a minimum modified temperature of –10° F. If this brings the temperature in\
  \ the area below 40° F, all creatures within 5 feet of you take a –4 penalty to\
  \ Dexterity. You are immune to these effects, as are creatures that are immune to\
  \ cold or that benefit from effects that protect against temperature, such as endure\
  \ elements."
