description: "Your presence animates surrounding plant life and causes it to fight\
  \ by your side. Each time you recover burn, you automatically use this ability once\
  \ and ignore the burn cost. This functions as wooden phalanx, except you always\
  \ animate four golems, and the duration lasts until the next time you recover burn.\
  \ If you have spring blast, one of your golems gains a 30-foot fly speed (average\
  \ maneuverability). If you have summer blast, one of your golems is healed by fire\
  \ damage, is vulnerable to cold, and deals 1d6 extra points of fire damage on slam\
  \ attacks and when splintering. If you have autumn blast, one of your golems gains\
  \ a 20-foot burrow speed. If you have winter blast, one of your golems deals 1d6\
  \ extra points of cold damage on its slam attacks and when splintering. Each of\
  \ the above modifications must apply to a different golem."
