description: "You are able to suspend your body in a large mass of elemental matter.\
  \ Until the next time your burn is removed, you can change your size to Large or\
  \ shift back to your original size as a standard action. This doesnâ€™t change your\
  \ ability scores in any way. At 16th level, you can accept 1 additional point of\
  \ burn to instead change your size to Huge. You cannot use kinetic form to decrease\
  \ your size."
