description: "Your strands of aether surround you, making it virtually impossible\
  \ for a violent motion to catch you off guard, so long as the motion originates\
  \ within their range. You are never denied your Dexterity bonus to AC against attacks\
  \ from within 30 feet because of being flat-footed or because your assailant is\
  \ unseen or invisible. You always succeed at any Perception check to act on the\
  \ surprise round against opponents within 30 feet."
