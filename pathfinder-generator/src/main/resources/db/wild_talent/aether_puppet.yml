description: "You use strands of aether to animate an object. You can animate a Medium\
  \ or smaller object as an animated object with no Construction Point abilities (except\
  \ for stone or metal [common], if the object is constructed of one of those materials).\
  \ Each round on your turn, you must take a move action to guide the object, or it\
  \ reverts to its inanimate state.By accepting 1 point of burn, you can pour a bit\
  \ of your own sentience into the aether puppet, allowing the effect to persist for\
  \ 1 round per kineticist level without requiring additional actions. At 12th level,\
  \ you can animate a Large or smaller object, Which gains all the abilities of the\
  \ Medium animated object plus the additional attack ability. At 14th level, you\
  \ can animate a Huge or smaller object, which gains all the abilities of the Large\
  \ animated object. At 16th level, you can animate a Gargantuan or smaller object,\
  \ which gains all the abilities of the Huge animated object, as well as the metal\
  \ (mithral) ability if the object is made of mithral. At 18th level, you can animate\
  \ a Colossal or smaller object, which gains all the abilities of the Gargantuan\
  \ animated object, plus the metal (adamantine) ability if the object is made of\
  \ adamantine."
