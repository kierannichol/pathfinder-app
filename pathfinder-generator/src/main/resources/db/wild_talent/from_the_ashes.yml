description: "When you are about to fall unconscious or die from hit point damage,\
  \ as an immediate action you can burst into flames that leave behind only ash, which\
  \ cannot be appreciably affected by most attacks or effects, though a disintegrate\
  \ spell or similar magic can annihilate it. At the start of your next turn, unless\
  \ the ash has been completely destroyed, you arise in the square where the most\
  \ ash is located, having taken the damage from the triggering effect but having\
  \ also healed 5 points of damage per kineticist level you possess."
