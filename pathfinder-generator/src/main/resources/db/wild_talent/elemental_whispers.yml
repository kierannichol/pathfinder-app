description: "You form a friendship with a fragment of your element. The element speaks\
  \ back to you empathically, like a familiar. Pick a type of creature usually allowed\
  \ as a familiar when you gain this wild talent. You gain the Alertness feat and\
  \ the special abilities granted by a familiar of that type. As a standard action,\
  \ you can give the voice of the element the body of such a creature, using elemental\
  \ matter of the appropriate element within 30 feet. As long as you concentrate,\
  \ the familiar can take actions as a normal animal of its type, and it can move\
  \ any distance away from you, though if it takes any damage or you cease concentrating,\
  \ it returns to your mind. You lose Alertness while the familiar is manifested in\
  \ this way. The familiar gains abilities as usual for a familiar of its type, though\
  \ it never gains the ability to speak with animals of its kind."
