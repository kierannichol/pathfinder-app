description: "Over time, your burning infusion sears away your foe’s fire resistance.\
  \ When you roll burn damage from burning infusion against a foe, decrease the foe’\
  s fire resistance by an amount equal to the unmodified burn damage; don’t apply\
  \ fire resistance to this roll for the purpose of determining the reduction. This\
  \ decrease lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your kineticist level.These\
  \ decreases stack, to a minimum resistance of 0."
