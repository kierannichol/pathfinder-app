description: "You use fire to burn poison from within a creatureâ€™s veins. You must\
  \ attempt a caster level check (1d20 + your kineticist level) against the DC of\
  \ each poison affecting the target. Success means that the poison is neutralized,\
  \ as neutralize poison. When you attempt to neutralize poison in this way, you can\
  \ choose to deal a number of points of fire damage to the poisoned creature equal\
  \ to the amount of damage you normally take from accepting burn in order to reduce\
  \ the DC of one poison affecting the target by 2.This reduction remains until the\
  \ end of your next turn."
