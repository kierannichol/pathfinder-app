description: "You can enter a tree and magically transport to a tree of the same type\
  \ within range, as per tree stride. Each time you activate this ability, it lasts\
  \ until you have taken a number of tree steps equal to your kineticist level, your\
  \ burn is removed, or you accept burn again to refresh it. Each time your burn is\
  \ removed, you can automatically activate this ability once and ignore the burn\
  \ cost. You can accept 1 additional point of burn while this ability is active to\
  \ use all remaining tree steps at once, adding up the total distance traveled and\
  \ instantly reaching your destination tree even if there wouldnâ€™t have been enough\
  \ trees along the way to make the journey one at a time."
