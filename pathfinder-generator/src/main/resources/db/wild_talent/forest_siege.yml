description: "You can transform available plant life into a besieging army. This functions\
  \ as greater siege of trees, except you need to concentrate or the effect ends,\
  \ and you can change targets as a free action. If you accept 1 point of burn, you\
  \ can prolong the effect without the need for concentration until the next time\
  \ you recover burn, but you do need to spend a standard action to change targets."
