description: "You use your element to halt a creature associated with your element,\
  \ as hold monster except it requires concentration to maintain, and it works only\
  \ on creatures with a subtype matching one of your elements (for example, a pyrokineticist\
  \ could use it on creatures of the fire subtype). At any time, you can accept 1\
  \ point of burn to remove the need to concentrate."
