name: "Touchsight, Spying"
description: "You attach a sticky strand of invisible aether to a target and then\
  \ project your senses along the strand, allowing you to spy on that target. Attaching\
  \ the strand of aether requires a ranged touch attack, but if you activate this\
  \ ability while your target is under the effect of your touchsight, you can use\
  \ the strands from your touchsight instead. Once you have activated spying touchsight,\
  \ you can concentrate on it to spy on your target with any of your five senses (though\
  \ your own body no longer benefits from the senses you project); the strand lasts\
  \ as long you concentrate, though you can switch which senses you are projecting\
  \ each round. A creature using see invisibility or a similar effect can notice the\
  \ trailing strand of aether and follow it back to you.A creature can break your\
  \ spying touchsight by dispelling it, but otherwise, the only way to break the strand\
  \ is if one of you uses a teleportation effect, moves more than 1 mile from the\
  \ other, or is completely blocked from the other in all directions (such as if one\
  \ of you were inside a telekinetic sphere)."
