name: "Aether Architect"
description: "You can spin a small building, bridge, or other edifice out of aether,\
  \ and even use aether to tether a building to a flat surface other than the ground.\
  \ By concentrating for 10 minutes, you can create an edifice out of scintillating\
  \ aether (same hardness and hit points as a wall of force) as long as the edifice\
  \ is no larger than one 10-foot cube per kineticist level. Unless the creation is\
  \ extremely simplistic, you must succeed at a Craft or Knowledge (engineering) check\
  \ to add embellishments. This ability can also create a series of tethers to securely\
  \ attach a normal building to a vertical surface or even a cavern ceiling. Aether\
  \ architect lasts as long as you concentrate, and you can accept 1 point of burn\
  \ to make the effect last until destroyed; by accepting this burn, you can use this\
  \ ability any number of times in a row to create a larger edifice."
