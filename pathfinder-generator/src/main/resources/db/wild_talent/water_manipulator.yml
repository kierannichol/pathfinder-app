name: "Water Manipulator"
description: "You can manipulate massive quantities of water. As a standard action,\
  \ you can raise or lower the level of water as if using control water, or move an\
  \ amount of water equal to 1/1,000th the amount controlled by that spell to a different\
  \ location in range.The water remains where you placed it for as long as you remain\
  \ motionless and take a standard action each round to concentrate on this effect.\
  \ This wild talent causes a slow effect on creatures made of water, just like control\
  \ water (Will negates). When you cease concentrating, the water flows normally unless\
  \ you accept 1 point of burn to extend the duration and hold the water in its current\
  \ position for 10 minutes per kineticist level you possess."
