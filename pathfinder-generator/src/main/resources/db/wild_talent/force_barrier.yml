name: "Force Barrier"
description: "You create an immobile sphere or hemisphere of force around your square\
  \ or squares. The force barrier functions as a wall of force in all other ways.\
  \ Activating this ability is a standard action, and the barrier lasts until the\
  \ beginning of your next turn. Each round, just before the barrier would disappear,\
  \ you can extend its duration by accepting 1 point of burn. If an attack manages\
  \ to destroy the force barrier, you immediately take 1 point of burn."
