name: "Telekinetic Invisibility"
description: "You weave strands of aether, bending light and dampening sound; This\
  \ works as invisibility except that the aetheric bending is easier to notice than\
  \ normal invisibility, so your bonus on Stealth checks is halved (+10 while moving\
  \ and +20 while perfectly still).However, the dampened sound allows you to avoid\
  \ automatic detection via sound-based blindsense and blindsight, but you do not\
  \ receive the bonus on Stealth checks from this wild talent against a creature with\
  \ such abilities."
