description: "This functions as kinetic healer, but you must base the amount of healing\
  \ on your positive blast, not wood blast. A phytokineticist with positive blast\
  \ as her first blast qualifies for the kinetic chirurgeon archetype and gains this\
  \ utility talent instead of kinetic healer. This wild talent counts as kinetic healer\
  \ for prerequisites for selecting other kineticist wild talents."
