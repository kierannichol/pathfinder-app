description: "You weave strands of aether around yourself in order to deflect targeted\
  \ magic back at the caster. Until the beginning of your next turn, every time you\
  \ are targeted by a spell that could be affected by spell turning, roll 1d10–1 and\
  \ determine the effects of the spell as if you had spell turning with that many\
  \ spell levels remaining. You can accept 1 point of burn to increase the duration\
  \ to 10 minutes per kineticist level you possess, but in that case, it deflects\
  \ only 10 spell levels in total (still rolled 1d10–1 at a time) before ending early."
