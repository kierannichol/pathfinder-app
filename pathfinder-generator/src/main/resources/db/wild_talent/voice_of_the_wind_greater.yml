name: "Voice of The Wind, Greater"
description: "Your voice of the wind ability gains both power and finesse. You can\
  \ use voice of the wind to create unusual sounds, as ghost sound, to throw your\
  \ voice, as ventriloquism, and even to alter your voice, as vocal alteration. You\
  \ can send messages at a much greater distance than before and at a faster rate.When\
  \ using voice of the windâ€™s whispering wind effect, you can choose to have the wind\
  \ rise high into the sky, where it can gust at 50 miles per hour before descending\
  \ to deliver the message. While the gust is still small, abnormal wind that fast\
  \ is noticeable, unlike the normal gentle zephyr from whispering wind. If you choose\
  \ to use the faster gust, you can deliver a message as far as 50 miles per kineticist\
  \ level, instead of 1 mile per kineticist level."
