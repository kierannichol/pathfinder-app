description: "The power of void protects you from curses and allows you to remove\
  \ or suppress them. You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against curses and hexes.\
  \ You can accept 1 point of burn as a standard action to attempt a caster level\
  \ check to remove a curse on yourself or another as per remove curse. If the curse\
  \ normally could not be removed by remove curse, you can instead suppress the curse\
  \ until the next time your burn is removed with a successful caster level check.\
  \ When your burn is removed, you can choose not to remove the burn you spent in\
  \ this way to continue suppressing the curse without interruption. If you die, any\
  \ curse suppressed in this way returns instantly."
