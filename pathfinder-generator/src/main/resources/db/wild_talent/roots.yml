description: "Your body sinks roots into soft surfaces, making it hard to move you.\
  \ This functions as the earth walk wild talent, except it works only on soft surfaces\
  \ (like soil or snow) and not on stone. If you have both roots and earth walk, the\
  \ bonuses stack while youâ€™re on soft earth surfaces."
