name: "Elemental Whispers, Greater"
description: "Your friendship with the elements has grown. You gain your choice of\
  \ a wysp or Small elemental of your primary element as an improved familiar, without\
  \ needing to meet any of the usual prerequisites for gaining such a familiar. Unlike\
  \ with elemental whispers, this improved familiar acts in all ways like a familiar:\
  \ it’s always manifested, it has hit points equal to 1/2 your own, and so on. You\
  \ no longer receive the familiar benefits from the original creature you selected.\
  \ If your improved familiar dies, you can still contact its voice in your mind and\
  \ gain the Alertness feat, but you can’t cause it to manifest. If you pay the usual\
  \ costs for replacing a familiar, you manifest a new form for your elemental friend."
