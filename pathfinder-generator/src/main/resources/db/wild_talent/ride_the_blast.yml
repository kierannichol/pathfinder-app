name: "Ride the Blast"
description: "You can use this wild talent as part of activating a kinetic blast other\
  \ than telekinetic blast. You transform yourself into your element or energy and\
  \ send yourself along with your kinetic blast. You appear at the end of the blast’\
  s path, adjacent to the blast’s target (or final target, for form infusions like\
  \ chain) or at the center of the burst or spread for form infusions like explosion.\
  \ This ability doesn’t work with form infusions that involve melee attacks (such\
  \ as kinetic blade) or that use a cone shape (such as spray)."
