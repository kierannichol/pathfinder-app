description: "With a touch, you can heal a willing living creature of an amount of\
  \ damage equal to your kinetic blast‘s damage. Instead of paying the burn cost yourself,\
  \ you can cause the recipient to take 1 point of burn. If you do so, the recipient\
  \ takes 1 point of nonlethal damage per Hit Die he possesses, as usual for burn;\
  \ This damage can’t be healed by any means until the recipient takes a full night’\
  s rest."
