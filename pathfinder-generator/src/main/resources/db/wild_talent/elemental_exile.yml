description: "You transport a single creature you touch to the plane associated with\
  \ your element. Precise accuracy regarding a particular arrival location on the\
  \ intended plane is almost impossible.The creature appears 5 to 500 miles (5d%)\
  \ from your intended destination. Elemental exile transports creatures instantaneously\
  \ and then ends. The creature must find other means to travel back (such as casting\
  \ plane shift or using elemental exile again)."
