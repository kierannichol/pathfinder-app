description: "When using air blasts, air wild talents, or composite blasts that include\
  \ air, double the blast’s effective range. This effect applies after altering the\
  \ range due to effects such as the extended range infusion. This doubles only the\
  \ blast’s effective range, not the area of effect for infusions like cloud and cyclone."
