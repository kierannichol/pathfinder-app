name: "Reverse Shift"
description: "You reverse the flow of your connection to the planes, sending your\
  \ body into the Ethereal Plane as ethereal jaunt. As long as you concentrate on\
  \ reverse shift, you remain on the Ethereal Plane; after a number of consecutive\
  \ rounds spent on the Ethereal Plane equal to your kineticist level (and every such\
  \ interval thereafter), you must accept 1 point of burn. Once you return to the\
  \ Material Plane, you cannot use reverse shift again for a number of rounds equal\
  \ to the number of rounds you spent on the Ethereal Plane."
