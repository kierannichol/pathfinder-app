name: "Flame Shield"
description: "Flickering flames surround you until the next time your burn is removed.\
  \ While your searing flesh infusion is active, any creature that strikes you with\
  \ a melee attack takes an amount of fire damage equal to 1/2 your kineticist level\
  \ unless it is using a reach weapon. If the creature also takes damage from your\
  \ searing flesh, it applies fire resistance only once against the total damage from\
  \ both effects. You also gain the protection from cold of a warm fire shield. An\
  \ attack that would deal an amount of cold damage equal to at least double your\
  \ kineticist level (before you applied the protection) freezes away your flame shield\
  \ after you apply its protection, ending the flame shield early."
