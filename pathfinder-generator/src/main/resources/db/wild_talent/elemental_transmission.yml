description: "You reach out to a creature with which you are familiar by using a conduit\
  \ through an elemental plane. By concentrating for 10 minutes, you create one end\
  \ of the conduit in a manifestation of your chosen element, such as a fire, pool\
  \ of water, or section of earth, which must be at least 2 feet in diameter. If the\
  \ creature you are attempting to contact is within earshot of a similar elemental\
  \ manifestation and on the same plane, the conduit forms successfully, allowing\
  \ both sides to see a likeness of the other. You can hear and talk to each other,\
  \ though you cannot perceive anything else from the other side of the connection.\
  \ If the creature is not within earshot of a similar elemental manifestation, you\
  \ can maintain your concentration to wait until the creature comes close enough\
  \ to such a feature. The connection lasts until you stop concentrating on it, use\
  \ this ability again, or until the creature moves away from the conduit."
