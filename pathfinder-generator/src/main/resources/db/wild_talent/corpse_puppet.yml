description: "You draw upon negative energy to animate a nearby corpse as a zombie\
  \ or a fast zombie (your choice). You can animate a zombie only if its Hit Dice\
  \ are no greater than your kineticist level – 4. Each round on your turn, you must\
  \ take a move action to guide the zombie, or it reverts to a corpse (but retains\
  \ any damage if you later turn it into a zombie again with this utility talent).\
  \ By accepting 1 point of burn, you can pour a bit of your own sentience into the\
  \ zombie, allowing it to persist for 1 round per kineticist level without requiring\
  \ additional actions on your part, or until the next time your burn is removed if\
  \ the zombie has half your maximum zombie Hit Dice or fewer. At 12th level, you\
  \ can animate a zombie with a number of Hit Dice no greater than your kineticist\
  \ level – 2. At 16th level, you can animate a zombie with a number of Hit Dice no\
  \ greater than your kineticist level."
