name: "Flame Trap"
description: "You lay a fiery trap on a container, ensuring the destruction of sensitive\
  \ documents while punishing those who would steal your secrets. In order to weave\
  \ the trap, you must spend 10 minutes in contact with the container you wish to\
  \ trap. At the end of that time, the container is trapped until the next time you\
  \ use this wild talent or until it triggers. Any creature other than you who opens\
  \ the container takes damage as from your fire blast (or blue flame blast, if you\
  \ have it). The damage affects the creature automatically if it is touching the\
  \ container, but if it opens the container from within 30 feet, it can attempt a\
  \ Reflex save to negate the damage, and if it opens the container from farther still,\
  \ it takes no damage. Whether or not the creature that opened the container takes\
  \ damage, your kinetic blast damage also affects any items within the container\
  \ that you choose, as well as the container, if you wish it, and leaves all other\
  \ items undamaged. This counts as a magical trap with a Perception and Disable Device\
  \ DC equal to 10 + your kineticist level + your Dexterity modifier. You can accept\
  \ 1 point of burn when using flame trap to make a new trap without dismissing any\
  \ previous traps. If you do, the trap lasts until the next time you recover burn."
