description: "Your body can produce the herbal remedies necessary to counter almost\
  \ any poison. You gain a +5 alchemical bonus on saving throws against poison as\
  \ if always under the effect of antitoxin. You can use the treat poison action from\
  \ the Heal skill as a standard action with a mere touch, without a healerâ€™s kit,\
  \ and even on yourself; if you succeed, you grant the touched creature a +5 alchemical\
  \ bonus against that specific instance of poison in addition to the normal +4 bonus\
  \ from treat poison. You can accept 1 point of burn while using the treat poison\
  \ action in this way to also produce the effects of neutralize poison."
