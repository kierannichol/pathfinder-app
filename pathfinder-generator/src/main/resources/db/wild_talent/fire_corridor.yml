name: "Fire Corridor"
description: "You create a passage through a fire or pool of lava. The passage is\
  \ 5 feet wide and 8 feet high. It is 10 feet long, plus 5 feet longer for every\
  \ 3 kineticist levels you have. Any heat generated by the fire or lava through which\
  \ the passage passes is radiated outwards, making the passage comfortable and safe.\
  \ The passage lasts for 1 hour, though you can end the effect at any time as a free\
  \ action. If this effect ends while a creature is inside the tunnel, that creature\
  \ is affected by the fire or lava as normal."
