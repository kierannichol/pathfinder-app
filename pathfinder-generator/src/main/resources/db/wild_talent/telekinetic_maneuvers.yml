  \ or Charisma modifier. If you possess the telekinetic finesse wild talent, add\
  \ dirty trick and steal combat maneuvers to the list of combat maneuvers you can\
  \ perform; when performing these maneuvers, determine your Combat Maneuver Bonus\
  \ using your Dexterity modifier instead of your Constitution modifier."
