description: "You can bring an ally who died within 1 round back from the dead with\
  \ your kinetic healer wild talent similarly to the breath of life spell, except\
  \ the ally regains the normal number of hit points from the kinetic healer utility\
  \ wild talent instead of the amount healed by breath of life. An ally revived in\
  \ this way takes 1 point of burn + any points of burn from the kinetic healer utility\
  \ wild talent (if you choose to have the ally take points of burn instead of taking\
  \ it yourself). If you have the metahealer ability (such as from the kinetic chirurgeon\
  \ kineticist archetype), this feat instead allows you to bring an ally back who\
  \ died within a number of rounds equal to 3 + the ally’s Constitution modifier (minimum\
  \ 0) – the number of points of burn the ally had taken before it died. For each\
  \ round that the ally was dead, when it is brought back to life in this way, it\
  \ takes 1 additional point of burn + any points of burn from the kinetic healer\
  \ talent."
