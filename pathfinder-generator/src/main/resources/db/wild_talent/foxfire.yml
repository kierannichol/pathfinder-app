description: "You surround a creature with glowing flames that outline it, as per\
  \ faerie fire. If you use foxfire with positive energy, the flames don’t give off\
  \ heat. If you use it with fire, the flames still aren’t hot enough to deal damage\
  \ immediately, but the illuminated creature counts as being under the effects of\
  \ severe heat and must succeed at a Fortitude save against nonlethal damage after\
  \ 10 minutes. A creature can extinguish the foxfire automatically as a full-round\
  \ action."
