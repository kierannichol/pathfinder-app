description: "A freebooter is a natural leader, a pirate who works well with a variety\
  \ of people and in a variety of roles. Her specialized combat tactics help organize\
  \ and direct a crew, and freebooters' talents are in high demand. Most freebooters\
  \ work as independent agents. A freebooter signs on with a crew when she feels the\
  \ urge to travel, and often moves to a new ship when her contract ends."

  description: "At 1st level, the freebooter can, as a move action, indicate an enemy\
    \ in combat and rally her allies to focus on that target. The freebooter and her\
    \ allies gain a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against the target.\
    \ This ability applies only to allies who can see or hear the freebooter and who\
    \ are within 30 feet of the freebooter at the time she activates this ability.\
    \ At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the\
    \ bonus increases by 1. The freebooter's bane lasts until the target dies or the\
    \ freebooter selects a new target.\nFAQ Pirates of the Inner Sea, Freebooter:\
    \ A freebooter ranger has quarry but not favored enemy. How does a freebooter\
    \ use quarry? A freebooter's quarry must be the target of the freebooter's freebooter's\
    \ bane ability, rather than a favored enemy. [Source]"
