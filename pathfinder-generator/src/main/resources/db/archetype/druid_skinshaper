  description: "At 4th level, a skinshaper gains the ability to turn herself into\
    \ any Small or Medium humanoid and back again once per day. This ability functions\
    \ as per alter self, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid\
    \ level, or until the skinshaper changes back. Changing form is a standard action\
    \ and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The skinshaper must be familiar\
    \ with the form she has chosen. She can use this ability an additional time per\
    \ day at 6th level and every 2 druid levels thereafter, up to a total of eight\
    \ times at 18th level. At 20th level, she can use skinshaping at will.\nThe skinshaper\
    \ learns to intuitively use her body as a weapon. While skinshaping, she gains\
    \ the benefit of the Improved Unarmed Strike feat, and her unarmed strike deals\
    \ damage as if she were a monk with a monk level equal to her druid level – 3.\n\
    At 6th level, a skinshaper gains the ability to channel the versatile nature of\
    \ humanoids to enhance her body and mind. Whenever she uses skinshaping to assume\
    \ a humanoid shape other than her own, she gains a +2 enhancement bonus to any\
    \ one ability score. The bonus persists as long as she remains in that form. At\
    \ 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, she gains an additional +2 enhancement bonus to\
    \ one ability score. She can distribute these bonuses as she wishes in increments\
    \ of +2, but the enhancement bonus on any single ability score cannot exceed +4.\n\
    At 8th level, a skinshaper can imitate humanoid creatures even more accurately.\
    \ She gains any of the following abilities that the form she assumes has: darkvision\
    \ 90 feet, low-light vision, scent, climb 60 feet, fly 60 feet (good maneuverability),\
    \ swim 60 feet, ferocity, orc ferocity, and hold breath. If the form she assumes\
    \ has the aquatic subtype, she gains the aquatic subtype and the amphibious special\
    \ quality.\nAt 12th level, a skinshaper can access the racial memory of the humanoid\
    \ she is imitating. If the form she assumes has any of the following racial abilities,\
    \ she gains those abilities: defensive training, hatred, poison use, sneak attack\
    \ +2d6, stability, and weapon familiarity.\nAdditionally, she can speak any racial\
    \ languages of the chosen form.\nAt 16th level, a skinshaper gains the racial\
    \ skill bonuses of the imitated humanoid, to a maximum of a +4 bonus on a given\
    \ skill. The skinshaper cannot benefit from any variable racial skill bonuses\
    \ associated with the chosen form (such as gnomes‘ racial bonus on any one Craft\
    \ or Profession skill)."
