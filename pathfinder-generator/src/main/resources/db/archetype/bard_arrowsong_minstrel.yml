  description: "An Arrowsong minstrel's skill at ranged martial arts allows her to\
    \ learn to cast a number of powerful, offensive spells that would otherwise be\
    \ unavailable to her.\nAt 1st level, she selects a number of spells from the sorcerer/wizard\
    \ spell list equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1) and adds them to her bard\
    \ spell list as bard spells of the same level. The spells selected must not already\
    \ be on the bard spell list, and must be 6th level or lower. At 4th level and\
    \ every 4 bard levels thereafter, she adds an additional sorcerer/wizard spell\
    \ to her bard spell list. An Arrowsong minstrel is limited to the following spells\
    \ when adding spells to her spell list in this manner: acid arrow, arrow eruption,\
    \ flame arrow, gravity bow, greater magic weapon, longshot, magic weapon, protection\
    \ from arrows, spectral hand, true strike, and sorcerer/wizard spells of the evocation\
    \ school. An Arrowsong minstrel must still select these spells as spells known\
    \ before she can cast them.\nIn addition, for the purpose of meeting the requirements\
    \ of combat feats and prestige classes, an Arrowsong minstrel treats her bard\
    \ level as her base attack bonus (in addition to base attack bonuses gained from\
    \ other classes and Hit Dice). Her skilled blending of archery and arcane magic\
    \ also allows an Arrowsong minstrel to fulfill a spell's somatic components even\
    \ when using a bow in both hands (though not other ranged weapons)."

  description: "At 6th level, an Arrowsong minstrel can use spellstrike (as per the\
    \ magus class feature) to cast a single-target ranged touch attack spell and deliver\
    \ it through a ranged weapon attack. Even if the spell can normally affect multiple\
    \ targets, only a single missile, ray, or effect accompanies the attack. She cannot\
    \ use spellstrike with normal touch attacks or melee attacks.\nAt 18th level,\
    \ an Arrowsong minstrel using a multiple-target spell with this ability can deliver\
    \ one ray or line of effect with each attack when using a full-attack action,\
    \ up to the maximum allowed by the spell (in the case of ray effects). Any effects\
    \ not used in the round the spell is cast are lost."
