  description: "A true silvered throne's divine magic arises from communion with spirits\
    \ alongside study of archaic lore compiled into a personal occult grimoire.\n\
    Unlike a wizard's spellbook, this grimoire doesn't contain specific spells. By\
    \ studying his grimoire, a true silvered throne can prepare any spell on the shaman\
    \ spell list or provided by his spirit. If this grimoire is lost or destroyed,\
    \ he cannot prepare new spells or use his spirit magic class feature until it\
    \ is replaced, which requires 1 week of work."

  description: "At 6th level, a true silvered throne can attempt to coax a nearby\
    \ spirit into service with a 1-minute-long ritual once per day, gaining that spirit's\
    \ spirit ability and adding its list of spells to those he can cast using his\
    \ spirit magic. The silvered throne can maintain this bond for 1 hour, or until\
    \ he dismisses the spirit as a free action. At 12th level, he also gains this\
    \ spirit's greater spirit power while bonded, and at 20th level gains its true\
    \ spirit power as well. He can perform a wandering ritual one additional time\
    \ per day at 8th level and 14th level."

    \ true silvered throne is the ritual's primary caster, he also adds this bonus\
