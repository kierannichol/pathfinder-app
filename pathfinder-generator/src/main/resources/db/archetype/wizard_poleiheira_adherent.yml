  description: "A Poleiheira adherent forms a bond with a spellbook. This bonded book\
    \ becomes intrinsically tied to a Poleiheira adherent's conscious and subconscious\
    \ mind. The book always opens to the right page, and she can record any number\
    \ of spells and other information in her bonded book--when she turns pages, more\
    \ blank pages appear. Other wizards find it difficult to read the book, which\
    \ displays information in a seemingly random order: the DC of all Spellcraft checks\
    \ to copy or prepare spells from the book increases by 10.\nEach time a Poleiheira\
    \ adherent attains a new wizard level, she gains four spells (rather than two)\
    \ to add to the bonded book. The cost and time requirement for writing a new spell\
    \ into the book are halved. The time to prepare spells is reduced to one third\
    \ (20 minutes to prepare all spells, and 5 minutes to prepare up to one quarter\
    \ of her spells). Once per day while holding the book in one hand, she can use\
    \ it to cast any one spell she has written in the bonded book, even if the spell\
    \ is not prepared.\nA Poleiheira adherent can replace a lost or destroyed bonded\
    \ book in the same manner as a bonded item. The new bonded book retains a number\
    \ of spells per spell level equal to the Poleiheira adherent's Intelligence modifier\
    \ from the previous bonded book, as well as all the mundane information that was\
    \ recorded in the previous bonded book. If a Poleiheira adherent replaces her\
    \ bonded book or dies, the previous book reverts to an ordinary blank spellbook."
