  description: "At 2nd level, a boar shaman may adopt an aspect of the boar while\
    \ retaining her normal form. She gains one of the following bonuses:\nmovement\
    \ (+10 enhancement bonus to land speed) senses (low-light vision, scent) natural\
    \ weapons (gore [1d8 for a Medium druid], +2 on combat maneuver checks to overrun)\
    \ toughness (+2 natural armor bonus to AC, Endurance feat)\nWhile using totem\
    \ transformation, the boar shaman may speak normally and can cast speak with animals\
    \ (boars and related animals only) at will. Using this ability is a standard action\
    \ at 2nd level, a move action at 7th level, and a swift action at 12th level.\
    \ The boar shaman can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to\
    \ her druid level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must\
    \ be used in 1-minute increments. This is a polymorph effect and cannot be used\
    \ while the druid is using another polymorph effect, such as wild shape.\nThis\
    \ ability replaces woodland stride."
