  description: "At 3rd level, a wilderness medic can mimic the effects of stabilize\
    \ at will in any wilderness area by spending one use of a healer's kit as long\
    \ as he can see the target.\nAdditionally, as a standard action a number of times\
    \ per day equal to 3 + his Wisdom modifier, the wilderness medic can use encouraging\
    \ words and herbs to lessen the severity of certain conditions affecting a touched\
    \ target. If the target is exhausted, it becomes fatigued instead. If the target\
    \ is frightened, it becomes shaken instead. If the target is nauseated, it becomes\
    \ sickened instead. The duration of the effect is unchanged; the effect is simply\
    \ reduced to the lesser version.\nAt 9th level, the wilderness medic can lessen\
    \ the severity of additional conditions for the target and cure other conditions\
    \ that the target suffers. If the target creature is blinded, it becomes dazzled\
    \ instead. If the target is panicked, it becomes shaken instead. If it has any\
    \ of the following conditions, they are cured: deafened, fatigued, shaken, and\
    \ sickened. The wilderness medic is able to use this ability on a given touched\
    \ target once every 24 hours."
