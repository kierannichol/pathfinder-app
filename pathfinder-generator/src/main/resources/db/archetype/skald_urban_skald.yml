  description: "At 10th level, the urban skald can ostracize a foe. The song has one\
    \ primary target, who the skald must see and name or describe. That target must\
    \ attempt a Will save. On a failed save, the primary target cannot benefit from\
    \ any morale bonus or teamwork feats, cannot treat any creature as an ally, and\
    \ must attempt to save against any spell cast on it (including harmless spells,\
    \ even if it casts them on itself ). These effects remain as long as the primary\
    \ target can hear the skald and the skald maintains the performance.\nAll other\
    \ foes within 60 feet of the skald are secondary targets. Secondary targets must\
    \ succeed at Will saves or they cannot treat the primary target as an ally, and\
    \ cannot target it with spells or abilities that are harmless.\nThese effects\
    \ remain as long as the secondary targets are within 60 feet of the skald and\
    \ the skald maintains the performance. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect."
