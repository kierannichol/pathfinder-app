  description: "A blood arcanist selects one bloodline from those available through\
    \ the sorcerer bloodline class feature. The blood arcanist gains the bloodline\
    \ arcana and bloodline powers of that bloodline, treating her arcanist level as\
    \ her sorcerer level. The blood arcanist does not gain the class skill, bonus\
    \ feats, or bonus spells from her bloodline.\nIf the blood arcanist takes levels\
    \ in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type,\
    \ even if that means that the bloodline of one of her classes must change. Subject\
    \ to GM discretion, the blood arcanist can change her former bloodline to make\
    \ them conform."
