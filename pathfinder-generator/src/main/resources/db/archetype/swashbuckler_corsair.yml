description: "While it doesn't take much more than a ship and a crew to become a pirate,\
  \ corsairs are a finer breed of freebooter. A corsair's debonair charm and style\
  \ make her a paradoxical celebrity even among the nations whose ships she plunders."

  description: "At 3rd level, a corsair's confident swagger unnerves her foes and\
    \ inspires her crew. She gains a +1 bonus on Intimidate checks, and the DC of\
    \ Intimidate checks made against her increases by 1. She and her allies gain a\
    \ +1 morale bonus on Profession (sailor) checks. These bonuses and her Intimidate\
    \ DC increase by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 3rd.\nAt 7th level, a corsair's swagger\
    \ gives her an additional benefit when she uses charmed life. If she succeeds\
    \ at a saving throw against an opponent's attack or ability while using charmed\
    \ life on that save, she can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize that opponent\
    \ without using an action."
