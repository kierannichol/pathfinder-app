  description: "At 2nd level, as a move action, a blood hunter can declare a creature\
    \ type from the ranger favored enemies table as the target of his hunt. The blood\
    \ hunter then gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive,\
    \ and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type and a +1 bonus on\
    \ weapon attack and damage rolls against these creatures. A blood hunter can maintain\
    \ these bonuses against only one creature type at a time; these bonuses remain\
    \ in effect until either the blood hunter declares a new favored target or 1 hour\
    \ passes, whichever comes first.\nAt 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses\
    \ on weapon attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks against this favored\
    \ target increase by 1.\nAt 7th level, a blood hunter can declare a favored target\
    \ as a move or swift action.\nFavored target is modified by any feat, spell, or\
    \ effect that specifically works with the favored enemy ranger class feature.\
    \ Additionally, the favored target ability always grants or uses a minimum of\
    \ the blood hunter's full favored target bonus for the purposes of effects that\
    \ use the value of the ranger's favored enemy bonus. For example, a blood hunter\
    \ grants his full favored target bonus to his companion when using the hunter's\
    \ bond class feature."

  description: "A blood hunter selects only one type of terrain as his favored terrain.\
    \ The bonuses he gains while in this terrain increase by 2 at 8th level and every\

    \ terrain as his favored terrain. This requires studying the terrain in a process\
    \ that requires 1> hour of time within the terrain. Once the new terrain is declared\
    \ as his favored terrain, it remains his favored terrain until the blood hunter\
    \ declares a new favored terrain.\nAt 7th level, a blood hunter gains Blessed\
    \ Hunter as a bonus feat. The territory he chooses with the Blessed Hunter feat\
    \ must always be a location that matches his favored terrain. When the blood hunter\
    \ chooses a new favored terrain, he can also choose a new territory with the Blessed\
    \ Hunter feat. At 10th level, he gains Blessed Hunter's Stride as a bonus feat.\
    \ At 13th level, he gains Blessed Hunter's Focus as a bonus feat, except he treats\
    \ his ranger level as his hunter level for the purposes of that feat."
