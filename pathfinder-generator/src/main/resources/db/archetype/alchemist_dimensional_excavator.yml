  description: "The intense study a dimensional excavator applies to dimensional forces\
    \ causes him to treat his class level as 2 lower when qualifying for alchemist\
    \ discoveries other than those granted by Precipitous Discoveries (see below).\
    \ At 4th level, the dimensional excavator adds create pit to his list of extracts\
    \ known, treating it as a 2nd-level alchemist extract. He can create an extract\
    \ of this spell, which can then be thrown as a ranged attack, targeting a creature\
    \ or square. If it strikes a square, the pit manifests in that area and all nearby\
    \ creatures are affected normally. If a creature is struck, the pit manifests\
    \ in the creature's location, and the struck creature must succeed at a Reflex\
    \ save with a â€“2 penalty or fall into the pit."

  description: "At 6th level, a dimensional excavator can choose to learn an additional\
    \ pit spell in place of learning a new discovery. The alchemist must be able to\
    \ use an extract of the appropriate level to select a pit spell as an extract.\
    \ He can add the following spells to his extracts known, and use them as per the\
    \ extradimensional extract ability: spiked pit (3rd-level extract), acid pit (4th-level\
    \ extract), hungry pit (5th-level extract). This alters the discovery ability."
