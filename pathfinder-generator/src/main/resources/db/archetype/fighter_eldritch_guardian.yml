    \ use any combat feat possessed by the eldritch guardian. The familiar doesn't\
    \ have to meet the feat's prerequisites, but at the GM's discretion may be precluded\
    \ from using certain combat feats due to its physical form. For example, an eldritch\
    \ guardian's pig familiar with access to Exotic Weapon Proficiency (spiked chain)\
    \ would not gain the ability to use spiked chains, since it doesn't have any limbs\
    \ capable of properly handling them."
