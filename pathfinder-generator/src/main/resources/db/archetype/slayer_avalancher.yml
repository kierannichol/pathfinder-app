    At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses from falling strike increase\

    \ increment of 10 by which his Acrobatics check result exceeds the DC (a 2d6 reduction\
    \ at DC 25, 3d6 at DC 35, and so on). At 11th level, the avalancher reduces the\
    \ DC of his Acrobatics checks to soften a fall by 5."

  description: "At 14th level, if the avalancher makes a single jump of at least 20\
    \ feet in any direction and lands at an elevation at least 10 feet lower than\
    \ his starting elevation, he can make ranged or melee attacks during his fall\
    \ as if he were making a full-round attack. He can make any number of attacks\
    \ in any combination of squares along this single jump, up to his maximum number\
    \ of attacks, but he can attack a given creature once at most. If the avalancher\
    \ attempts a jump but fails the Acrobatics check, he makes no attacks and suffers\
    \ the consequences of his failed jump normally. At 19th level, he can add his\
    \ extra damage from sneak attack against each creature he hits while using this\
    \ ability, even if the targets have acted in combat or retain their Dexterity\
    \ bonuses to AC."

  description: "At 20th level, an avalancher can take down his foe with a single attack.\
    \ During a round, if he falls at least 10 feet (the action type depends on how\
    \ he comes to be falling), he can make a single attack at his full base attack\
    \ bonus as a standard action, choosing one of the following effects: kill, knock\
    \ unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6 rounds. If the attack hits, the\
    \ target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude save or suffer\
    \ the additional effect. The save DC is equal to 20 + 1 for every 10 feet the\
    \ avalancher fell before making the attack (to a maximum of DC 30 for a fall of\
    \ 100 feet or more). Whether or not the target succeeds, it can't be targeted\
    \ by this ability again (by any avalancher) for 24 hours."
