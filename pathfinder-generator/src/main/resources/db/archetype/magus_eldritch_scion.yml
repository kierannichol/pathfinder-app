  description: "An eldritch scion casts arcane spells drawn from the magus spell list.\
    \ He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn\
    \ or cast a spell, an eldritch scion must have a Charisma score equal to at least\
    \ 10 + the spell's level. The DC for a saving throw against an eldritch scion's\
    \ spell is 10 + the spell's level + the eldritch scion's Charisma modifier. An\
    \ eldritch scion can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level\
    \ per day. His base daily spell allotment is the same as a bard of the same level.\
    \ In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score.\n\
    An eldritch scion's selection of spells is limited. He has the same number of\
    \ spells known as a bard of the same level, and can choose new spells to replace\
    \ old ones at 5th level and every 3 class levels after that, just as a bard does.\
    \ See the bard for more information on swapping spells known."

    \ bloodrager level for his bloodline abilities is equal to his eldritch scion\
    \ level. He does not gain any bonus feats, and he gains bonus spells from his\
    \ bloodline at different levels (see the bonus spell class feature below). To\
    \ use any ability that normally functions when in a bloodrage, an eldritch scion\
    \ must spend a point from his eldritch pool (see below). If an eldritch scion\
    \ takes levels in another class that grant a bloodline, the bloodlines must be\
    \ the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must\
    \ change. Subject to GM discretion, an eldritch scion can change his former bloodline\
    \ to make them conform."

  description: "An eldritch scion gains an eldritch pool of personal magical energy,\
    \ equal to 1/2 his magus level (minimum 1) + his Charisma modifier. As a swift\
    \ action, he can spend a point of eldritch energy to enter a state of mystical\
    \ focus for 2 rounds. This allows him to use abilities from his bloodrager bloodline\
    \ as though he were in a bloodrage, though he gains none of the other benefits\
    \ or drawbacks of bloodraging. At 4th level, an eldritch scion can also use his\
    \ eldritch pool as an arcane pool, gaining all the benefits listed with the magus's\
    \ arcane pool class feature.\nAdditionally, any magus's class feature or spell\
    \ from the magus spell list that normally uses a calculation based on Intelligence\
    \ is instead based on Charisma for an eldritch scion. For example, an eldritch\
    \ scion with the arcane accuracy magus arcana grants himself an insight bonus\
    \ on attacks equal to his Charisma bonus, not his Intelligence bonus. This has\
    \ no effect on the eldritch scion's skills or skill points."
