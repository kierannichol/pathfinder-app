  description: "At 4th level, a hinyasi learns to confound and befuddle her opponents\
    \ with improvised weapons. She chooses one of the following combat maneuvers:\
    \ bull rush, drag, disarm, sunder, reposition, or trip. When she hits an opponent\
    \ with an improvised weapon, the hinyasi can perform her chosen combat maneuver\
    \ against the same target as a free action. She takes a â€“4 penalty on the combat\
    \ maneuver check, and she can't attempt an improvised maneuver check more than\
    \ once per round. This combat maneuver still provokes attacks of opportunity unless\
    \ the hinyasi has a feat or ability that allows her to perform it without provoking\
    \ attacks of opportunity.\nAt 10th level, she chooses a second combat maneuver\
    \ that she can use with this ability, though she can still perform only one improvised\
    \ maneuver per round. At 16th level, she chooses a third, though she can still\
    \ perform only one improvised maneuver per round."
