    \ it were a weapon (and can thus the Quick Draw feat to draw flasks of holy water).\
    \ As a swift action, he can open a flask of holy water and pour it onto a held\
    \ or adjacent melee weapon. If the weapon successfully hits an undead creature\
    \ before the end of the grave warden's next turn, the undead takes damage as if\
    \ it took a direct hit from the holy water, in addition to the damage from the\
    \ weapon, if any."

  description: "At 10th level, a grave warden can slay a studied undead opponent.\
    \ This functions as the assassinate slayer talent, except it requires a successful\
    \ Will saving throw instead of a successful Fortitude save, affects only undead,\
    \ and destroys the target instead of killing it. If the target succeeds at its\
    \ saving throw, it becomes immune to that grave warden's dustbringer ability for\
    \ 24 hours.\nThis ability replaces the advanced slayer talent gained at 10th level.\n\
    Slayer Talents: The following slayer talents (and rogue talents) complement the\
    \ deliverer archetype: fast stealth, finesse rogue, surprise attack, swift poison,\
    \ terrain mastery, trap spotter, and unwitting ally."
