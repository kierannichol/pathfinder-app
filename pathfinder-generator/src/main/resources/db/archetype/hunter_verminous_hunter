description: "A verminous hunter calls on the ceaseless, single-minded dedication\
  \ of vermin to hunt and overwhelm her prey. Where other hunters invoke the cunning,\
  \ animalistic powers of the alpha predators, she calls on the powers of the lowest\
  \ life forms, reaching out to the spider instead of the monkey, the mantis instead\
  \ of the snake, or the moth instead of the owl."
