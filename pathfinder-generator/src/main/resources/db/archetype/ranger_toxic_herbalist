    \ the ranger creates one additional poultice when using this ability, to a maximum\
    \ of four at 18th level. Poultices remain potent for 1 hour.\nAdditionally, at\
    \ 8th level, the poultice neutralizes one poison affecting the recipient, as per\
    \ neutralize poison. At 13th level, it also attempts to cure one disease affecting\
    \ the recipient, as per remove disease. The caster level of both of these effects\
