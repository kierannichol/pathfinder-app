  description: "At 1st level, a circuit judge chooses a single community. While in\
    \ that community or within 25 miles of it, she adds half her cavalier level (minimum\
    \ 1) on Intimidate, Knowledge (local), and Sense Motive skill checks (as well\
    \ as any other law-related skill checks, at the GM's discretion). Whenever she\
    \ advances in level, the range within which she gains this bonus expands by another\
    \ 25 miles--50 miles at 2nd level, 75 miles at 3rd level, and so forth. This bonus\
    \ on Intimidate checks increases by 2 when she enters a community within this\
    \ area that she hasn't visited for 1 week or more.\nAt 9th level and 17th level,\
    \ the circuit judge can select another community within the range in which she\
    \ gains this ability's bonus. She can measure from that community (as well as\
    \ previous communities) to determine whether she gains this ability's bonus on\
    \ the relevant skill checks."

  description: "Once per day as a swift action, the circuit judge can choose one target\
    \ within sight to sentence. The circuit judge gains the potential for a variety\
    \ of bonuses related to that target. The circuit judge chooses the form of these\
    \ benefits from the following list of inquisitor judgments: destruction, justice,\
    \ protection, purity, or smiting.\nThe benefits of these judgments apply only\
    \ to the circuit judge and the target--the protection judgment's bonus to Armor\
    \ Class, for example, applies only to attacks made by the sentenced target (not\
    \ any creature who attacks the circuit judge while the judgment is active). Treat\
    \ the circuit judge's level as her inquisitor level for the purposes of determining\
    \ how these judgments increase in power. The circuit judge can use this ability\
    \ twice per day at 1st level, plus two additional times per day for every 3 cavalier\
    \ levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of 14 times per day at 19th level. She can switch\
    \ her sentence as a swift action, but doing so expends an additional daily use\
    \ of this ability.\nSentencing a foe requires much of the circuit judge's concentration.\
    \ The circuit judge takes a â€“2 penalty to her Armor Class, except against attacks\
    \ made by the target of her sentence.\nThe sentence remains in effect either until\
    \ the target is dead or unconscious or until the combat ends.\nSentences are considered\
    \ challenges for the purposes of the effects listed in the challenge section describing\
    \ the cavalier's order."
