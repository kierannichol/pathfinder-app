description: "Civilization grows stronger and more decadent with each passing year.\
  \ It tears into unclaimed wilderness and destroys the fragile ecology in its constant\
  \ push for expansion and exploitation. The wild stalker forsakes the bonds of community\
  \ and lives in the trackless wilds far from others of his kind, or perhaps grew\
  \ up there, never knowing of civilization as anything more than his enemy. He drives\
  \ pioneers back to civilization and strives to keep the land unspoiled."
