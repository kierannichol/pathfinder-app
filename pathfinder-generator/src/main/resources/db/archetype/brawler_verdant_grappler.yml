  description: "At 2nd level, a verdant grappler gains Improved Grapple as a bonus\
    \ feat. At 3rd level, she must choose grapple as her first combat maneuver for\
    \ maneuver training. When she pins a creature, she can cause roots and vines to\
    \ burst from the ground (no matter the surrounding terrain), allowing the verdant\
    \ grappler to attempt to tie up the creature without needing to retrieve rope\
    \ or use a hand to hold the rope; as usual, a tied-up creature is pinned and not\
    \ helpless. The verdant grappler must remain within 30 feet of the tied-up creature,\
    \ or the vines automatically release it. She can tie up only one creature at a\
    \ time with green grasp."
