    \ effects of the spell to last longer than normal. A spell with a duration of\
    \ 1 round per level lasts an additional number of rounds equal to the arcane warden's\
    \ Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 additional round). A spell with a duration\
    \ of 1 minute per level lasts for an additional number of minutes equal to the\
    \ arcane warden's Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 additional minute). Spells\
    \ with different durations than this are not enhanced by this ability. Only one\
    \ spell can be enhanced in this way on any individual creature at a time."

  description: "While an arcane warden can find refuge in many naturally occurring\
    \ hideaways, his preferred places of rest are magically created cottages, homes,\
    \ and even manors. An arcane warden learns the following spells: mage's magnificent\
    \ mansion, rope trick, secure shelter, and tiny hut. These spells do not take\
    \ up room in the arcane warden's spellbook, and he does not need his spellbook\
    \ to prepare these spells. He must still be the appropriate level to prepare the\
    \ spell in question. The arcane warden's caster level is treated as 2 higher than\
    \ his actual caster level for the purposes of determining the duration of these\
    \ spells and resolving attempts to dispel these spells. Any creature that spends\
    \ at least 8 hours relaxing in one of these shelters gains a bonus equal to the\
    \ level of the spell that created it on any saving throws against disease or poison\
    \ effects made in the next 24 hours."
