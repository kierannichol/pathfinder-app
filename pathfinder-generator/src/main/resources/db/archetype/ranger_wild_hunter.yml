description: "A wild hunter seeks to emulate the animals around him to keep him safe\
  \ while he tracks his prey. Instead of studying the traits and behaviors of a favored\
  \ enemy, a wild hunter studies those of various animals, incorporating those attributes\
  \ into his hunting strategy."

  description: "At 1st level, as a swift action a wild hunter can take on the aspect\
    \ of an animal, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal\
    \ emulated. This functions as the hunter's animal focus class feature, though\
    \ this only applies to the wild hunter and not an animal companion (see shared\
    \ focus, below). The wild hunter can use this ability for 1 minute per day per\
    \ ranger level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be\
    \ spent in 1-minute increments. He can only emulate one animal at a time."

  description: "At 7th level, a wild hunter can share his current animal focus with\
    \ one creature appropriate to his hunter's bond. If the wild hunter's bond is\
    \ with an animal companion, the companion automatically gains the benefits of\
    \ the wild hunter's current animal focus. If the wild hunter's bond is with his\
    \ companions, as a swift action he can select one bonded ally to gain the benefits\
    \ of the hunter's current animal focus; this lasts until the hunter's bond ends,\
    \ the animal focus ends for the wild hunter, or the wild hunter selects a different\
    \ companion."
