  description: "At 1st level, a school savant chooses a school of magic. The arcanist\
    \ gains the abilities granted by that school, as the arcane school class feature\
    \ of the wizard, treating her arcanist level as her wizard level for these abilities.\
    \ She can also further specialize by selecting a subschool. In addition, the arcanist\
    \ can prepare one additional spell per day of each level she can cast, but this\
    \ spell must be chosen from the selected school.\nFinally, the arcanist must select\
    \ two additional schools of magic as her opposition schools. Whenever she prepares\
    \ spells from one of her opposition schools, the spell takes up two of her prepared\
    \ spell slots. In addition, a school savant takes a â€“4 penalty on any skill checks\
    \ when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of her opposition schools\
    \ as a prerequisite. A school savant cannot select the school understanding arcanist\
    \ exploit."
