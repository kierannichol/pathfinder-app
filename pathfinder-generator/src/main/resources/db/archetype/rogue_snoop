    \ inspiration class ability. The snoop begins with an inspiration pool equal to\
    \ half her rogue level plus her Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Unlike an\
    \ investigator, a snoop can only use inspiration on skill checks, not on attack\
    \ rolls or saving throws. This ability is otherwise identical to the investigator\
    \ class ability of the same name."
