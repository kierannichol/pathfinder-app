  description: "At 8th level, a sacred servant can call upon her deity for aid, in\
    \ the form of a powerful servant. This allows the sacred servant to cast lesser\
    \ planar ally once per week as a spell-like ability without having to pay the\
    \ material component cost or the servant (for reasonable tasks). At 12th level,\
    \ this improves to planar ally and at 16th level, this improves to greater planar\
    \ ally. The sacred servant's caster level for this effect is equal to her paladin\
    \ level."
