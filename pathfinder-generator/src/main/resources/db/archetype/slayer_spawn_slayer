  description: "A spawn slayer specializes in fighting against larger, single targets.\
    \ At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack rolls, damage\
    \ rolls, and skill checks against a studied target increase by 1, as do the DCs\
    \ of slayer abilities against a studied target. He can also ignore size restrictions\
    \ against a studied target when attempting combat maneuvers against larger foes.\
    \ At 5th level, if the target is Large or larger, these bonuses increase by an\
    \ additional 1. At 10th level, if the target is Huge or larger, the bonuses increase\
    \ by an additional 2. At 15th level, if the target is Gargantuan or larger, the\
    \ bonuses increase by an additional 3. At 20th level, if the target is Colossal\
    \ in size, the bonuses increase by an additional 4. A spawn slayer cannot maintain\
    \ these bonuses against more than one target at a time. He does not gain the ability\
    \ to study an opponent as a swift action at 7th level."

  description: "At 7th level, a spawn slayer learns techniques to counteract a foe's\
    \ size advantage. When performing a combat maneuver against a studied target of\
    \ Large or larger size, the spawn slayer gains a bonus on the check equal to the\
    \ creature's size modifier to CMB (Large +1, Huge +2, Gargantuan +4, and Colossal\
    \ +8). The spawn slayer adds this same bonus to his CMD when defending against\
    \ combat maneuvers from a Large or larger studied target."

  description: "At 20th level, a spawn slayer can create an opening in even an invulnerable\
    \ foe's defenses. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a\
    \ studied target at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the damage bypasses\
    \ any damage reduction and the target must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC\
    \ 10 + half the slayer's level + the slayer's Intelligence modifier) or lose one\
    \ of its defensive abilities for 2d6 rounds. The slayer can choose which defensive\
    \ ability is lost from the following options: a single immunity, all resistances,\
    \ regeneration, or spell resistance. Whether or not the target fails this save,\
    \ it cannot be targeted by force vulnerability again (by you or another slayer)\
    \ for 24 hours."
