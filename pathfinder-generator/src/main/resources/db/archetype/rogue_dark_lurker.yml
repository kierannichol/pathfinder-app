    \ (A character using the unchained rogue class instead gains the ability to make\
    \ attacks of opportunity against foes with cover, though not foes with improved\
    \ cover or total cover).\nAt 6th level, the dark lurker can deal precision damage\
    \ to targets with total concealment (though any miss chance applies normally,\
