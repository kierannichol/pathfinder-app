description: "Not all rogues live in the city. Scouts frequently roam the wilderness,\
  \ often banding together as bandits, but sometimes serving as guides, as trailblazers,\
  \ or as companions to a ranger or barbarian warrior. More comfortable with sneaking\
  \ and hiding outdoors, the scout is still effective in the city and the dungeon."
