  description: "A coral witch crafts her familiar out of living coral, coaxing the\
    \ tiny organisms to grow in the shape of a larger animal or vermin. The coral\
    \ witch chooses a familiar as normal, but its type changes to vermin (aquatic)\
    \ and it gains the amphibious special quality. The coral witch's familiar has\
    \ an Intelligence score as normal for the witch's level, but it has immunity to\
    \ mind-affecting effects. When underwater near a coral reef of any size, a coral\
    \ witch can spend 8 hours to restore her familiar to full health at no cost, unless\
    \ the familiar is killed, in which case she must follow the usual rules for replacing\
    \ her familiar. A coral witch can never gain an improved familiar."

  description: "At 8th level, a coral witch can naturally emulate coral's ability\
    \ to affix itself in place. At the end of any round in which the coral witch did\
    \ not move from her space and is standing on solid ground, she adds her class\
    \ level to her CMD against any bull rush, overrun, and reposition combat maneuvers,\
    \ grapple attempts to move her, and attempts to pull or push her. This bonus lasts\
    \ until the start of the coral witch's next turn.\nThis ability replaces the hex\
    \ gained at 8th level.\nHexes: The following witch hexes complement the coral\
    \ witch archetype: evil eye, feral speech, water lung.\nMajor Hexes: The following\
    \ major hexes complement the coral witch archetype: Beast Eye, hag's eye, Weather\
    \ Control."
