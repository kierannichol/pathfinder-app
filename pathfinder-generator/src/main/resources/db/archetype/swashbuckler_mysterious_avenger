    \ and damage rolls against it, and a +1 bonus to DCs of any deeds used against\
    \ that opponent. A mysterious avenger can maintain these bonuses against only\
    \ one opponent at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent\
    \ is dead or the mysterious avenger studies a new target.\nAt 10th, 15th, and\
    \ 20th levels, these mysterious avenger's bonuses against a studied target increase\
    \ by 1. In addition, at each such interval, a mysterious avenger is able to maintain\
    \ these bonuses against an additional studied target at the same time. A mysterious\
    \ avenger can discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing\
    \ her to study another target in its place.\nAt 10th level, a mysterious avenger\
    \ can study an opponent as a move or swift action."
