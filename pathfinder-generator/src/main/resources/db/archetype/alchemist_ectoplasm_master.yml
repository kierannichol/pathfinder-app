  description: "Instead of using alchemical reagents in order to create alchemical\
    \ items (including his bombs, extracts, and mutagens), an ectoplasm master uses\
    \ reagents such as corpse dust, crystallized ectoplasm, and similar reagents as\
    \ alchemical catalysts. Just as with standard alchemists, the costs of these materials\
    \ are insignificant and are comparable to the costs of the valueless material\
    \ components of most spells.\nAs a result of his eccentric techniques and use\
    \ of odd alchemical components, an ectoplasm master has an expanded formula list.\
    \ He adds all sorcerer/wizard spells of 6th level or lower from the necromancy\
    \ school to his alchemist formula list (but must still learn each of these spells\
    \ normally). If a spell appears on both the alchemist formula list and the sorcerer/wizard\
    \ spell list, the ectoplasm master uses the lower of the two spell levels listed\
    \ for the spell."

  description: "An ectoplasm master is able to select the following alchemist discoveries,\
    \ in addition to general discoveries.\nEctoplasmic Mutagen: Whenever the ectoplasm\
    \ master imbibes a mutagen, his living flesh transmutes into ectoplasm, causing\
    \ him to take on a semiliquid form. He no longer gains a natural armor bonus from\
    \ his mutagen, but instead becomes immune to critical hits and precision damage\
    \ (such as sneak attacks) while under the mutagen's effects. An ectoplasm master\
    \ must be at least 6th level to learn this discovery.\nEctoplasmic Servant: An\
    \ ectoplasm master who selects this discovery adds all summon monster spells of\
    \ 6th level or lower to his alchemist formula list as ectoplasmic extracts. Whenever\
    \ he summons a creature using an ectoplasmic extract, the creature must appear\
    \ in a square adjacent to his own, and it gains the ectoplasmic creature template.\
    \ Creatures summoned using ectoplasmic extracts cannot have templates other than\
    \ the ectoplasmic creature template."
