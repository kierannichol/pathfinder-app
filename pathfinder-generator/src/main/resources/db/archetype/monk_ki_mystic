    \ These visions can come as a dream, an epiphany, or even as the voice of an old\
    \ friend whispering in the monk's mind. The effect is similar to a divination\
    \ spell with a caster level equal to the monk's level. The divination has no casting\
    \ time; it is just part of the normal dreams or visions that occur every night.\
    \ Using this ability costs 2 ki points that are removed from the next day's total."

    \ radius. The monk and all allies within the aura can roll two dice when making\
    \ an attack roll or a saving throw and take the better result. The aura lasts\
    \ for 1 round, plus an additional round for every 2 ki points spent when the monk\
    \ created the aura. The monk can dismiss the aura at any time as a free action,\
    \ but the ki points for the full duration of the aura are lost."
