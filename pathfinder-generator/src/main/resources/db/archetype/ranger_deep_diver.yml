  description: "At 20th level, a deep diver is peerless at detecting prey underwater\
    \ and delivering killing blows. He can notice other creatures by scent in a 180-foot\
    \ radius underwater and can detect blood in the water up to a mile away. As a\
    \ standard action, he can make a single attack against a favored enemy at his\
    \ full attack bonus while underwater. If the attack hits, the target takes damage\
    \ normally and must succeed at a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is\
    \ equal to 10 + half the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A deep\
    \ diver can instead deal an additional amount of nonlethal damage equal to the\
    \ creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage.\nA deep\
    \ diver can use this ability once per day against each of his favored enemy types\
    \ but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period."
