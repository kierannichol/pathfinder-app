description: "The rake is a rogue who is open about her skills and talents, often\
  \ to the point of being boastful. Usually she has the protection of an important\
  \ figure who finds her services useful, but sometimes her bravado is enough to keep\
  \ enemies away. She is often used as a face for the group for diplomacy, gathering\
  \ information, negotiations, or to gain the most lucrative contracts and quests\
  \ from local authorities."
