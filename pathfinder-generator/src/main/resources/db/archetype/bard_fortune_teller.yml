  description: "At 2nd level, whenever he casts a spell from the divination school,\
    \ a fortune-teller can use a fortune-teller's deck, crystal ball, or similar item\
    \ instead of the spell's material component, as long as the cost of the material\
    \ component is no more than 100 gp per bard level. If he chooses to cast the spell\
    \ using such an item and the spell's normal material component (regardless of\
    \ that component's cost), he casts the spell at +1 caster level. This special\
    \ focus can't be used with other special foci that have a similar effect, but\
    \ can be used with spells that normally require a focus component (which must\
    \ also be provided)."

  description: "A fortune-teller gains the following bardic performance.\nTransparent\
    \ Fate (Su): At 8th level, the fortune-teller can cause all enemies within 30\
    \ feet to have their near future revealed for all to see. A successful Will saving\
    \ throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the fortune-teller's level + the fortune-teller's Cha modifier)\
    \ negates the effect. This ability causes any creature attacked by an affected\
    \ enemy to gain a +2 bonus to AC and on saving throws against the attack. As a\
    \ secondary effect, if an affected creature's hit points are reduced to less than\
    \ its Constitution score, it also sees a vision of its own death and must succeed\
    \ at another Will save or become frightened for 1 round. A given creature needs\
    \ to save against this secondary effect at most once per performance of transparent\
    \ fate, even if its hit points are reduced to less than its Constitution score\
    \ multiple times. A creature that was targeted by oracular performance when this\
    \ performance began applies any save DC adjustment to this secondary save as well.\
    \ At the GM's discretion, the revelation of the creature's fate might have other\
    \ consequences; for example, a creature's allies might see it was planning to\
    \ betray them."
