  description: "At each class level, she chooses one spell from the druid spell list\
    \ or one spell with the good descriptor from the cleric spell list. The spell\
    \ must be of a spell level that she can cast, and cannot be a spell that already\
    \ appears on her arcanist spell list. A Collegiate initiate can cast a spell that\
    \ she has chosen with this ability as if it were on her spell list and prepared\
    \ by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to half the\
    \ spell's level (minimum 1) and expending a spell slot of the spell's level. At\
    \ 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Collegiate initiate can choose to\
    \ lose a spell that she has chosen with this ability in exchange for a new spell\
    \ of the same spell level that meets the same requirements."

  description: "At 5th level, a Collegiate initiate gains Spell Mastery as a bonus\
    \ feat. Her arcanist levels count as wizard levels for the purpose of satisfying\
    \ feat prerequisites, both when selecting this bonus feat and when selecting feats\
    \ gained from character advancement. If she uses her arcanist level to satisfy\
    \ the prerequisites for Spell Mastery, she can prepare spells selected with this\
    \ feat as arcanist spells without referring to a spellbook, but not as wizard\
    \ spells. The Collegiate initiate can also select Spell Mastery as a feat gained\
    \ from character advancement, allowing her to select the feat multiple times.\n\
    In addition, if the Collegiate initiate gains levels in the collegiate arcanist\
    \ prestige class, her prestige class levels stack with her arcanist levels when\
    \ determining the number of points in her arcane reservoir (though not the effectiveness\
    \ of arcane exploits based on class level). A Collegiate initiate who takes levels\
    \ in collegiate arcanist and gains the spontaneous spell Mastery class feature\
    \ can use that ability to instantly lose one of her prepared spells and immediately\
    \ prepare a different arcanist spell of the same level or lower that she has mastered\
    \ with Spell Mastery, rather than spontaneous spell mastery's normal effect. She\
    \ is still limited to the same number of times per day she can use spontaneous\
    \ spell mastery."
