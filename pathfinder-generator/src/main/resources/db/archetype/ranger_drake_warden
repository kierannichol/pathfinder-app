description: "Some rangers specialize in dealing with rambunctious younger drakes,\
  \ protecting them and teaching them to tolerate, and even trust, humanoid creatures.\
  \ These drake wardens follow and pass along secret techniques for raising drakes\
  \ effectively, and thanks to their methods, their drakes are both fiercely loyal\
  \ and extremely useful for scouting and stealth missions."

  description: "At 4th level, a drake warden gains a drake companion instead of an\
    \ animal companion, but his effective charge's level is equal to his ranger level\
    \ â€“ 3.\nThe young drake gains drake powers only when its charge reaches 3rd and\
    \ 7th levels (not 11th or 15th level) and increases in size only when its charge\
    \ reaches 5th level (not 9th, 13th, or 17th level)."
