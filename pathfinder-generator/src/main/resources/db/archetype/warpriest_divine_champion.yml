  description: "At 6th level, the divine champion becomes an expert at combating enemies\
    \ of his faith. He must choose a deity whose alignment is opposed to his own deity's\
    \ alignment in at least one way (good versus evil or law versus chaos); preferably,\
    \ he should choose a deity whose alignment diametrically opposes that of his own\
    \ deity.\nIf the divine champion worships a deity whose alignment is neutral,\
    \ he must instead select a deity whose alignment is chaotic evil, chaotic good,\
    \ lawful evil, or lawful good. The choice of this enemy deity is subject to GM\
    \ approval. At the GM's discretion, the divine champion may be allowed to choose\
    \ a philosophy or religious organization that's not affiliated with a deity, but\
    \ only if that philosophy or religious organization is an enemy of the divine\
    \ champion's deity.\nThe divine champion gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Intimidate,\
    \ Knowledge, Perception, and Sense Motive checks against followers of the enemy\
    \ faith, as well as a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls made against\
    \ them. Additionally, he can attempt Knowledge skill checks relating to the deity\
    \ and its church untrained, even if the DC is higher than 10.\nEvery 6 paladin\
    \ levels thereafter (12th and 18th level), the divine champion can select an additional\
    \ deity to oppose. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against the followers\
    \ of any one deity he selected previously (including the one just selected, if\
    \ so desired) increases by +2."
