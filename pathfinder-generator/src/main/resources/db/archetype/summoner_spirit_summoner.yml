  description: "A spirit summoner forms a mystical bond with one spirit from the shaman\
    \ class. He gains the spirit ability of that spirit and uses his summoner level\
    \ as his shaman level for determining its effects. The spirit summoner can select\
    \ spells granted by that spirit as summoner spells known, using the shaman level\
    \ of the spell as the summoner spell level. The summoner cannot select spirit\
    \ spells that are above 6th level.\nAt 9th level, the summoner gains the abilities\
    \ listed in the greater version of his selected spirit.\nAt 17th level, the summoner\
    \ gains the abilities listed for the true version of his selected spirit."

  description: "At 1st level, a spirit summoner begins play with a powerful outsider\
    \ called an eidolon. The eidolon's form and abilities must be appropriate to his\
    \ chosen spirit, at the GM's discretion--for example, a summoner with the flame\
    \ spirit cannot have an eidolon with ice or water abilities, a summoner with a\
    \ heavens spirit cannot have a fiend-like eidolon, and so on. The summoner can\
    \ use temporary effects (such as evolution surge) to alter the eidolon into an\
    \ inappropriate form, but cannot use permanent effects (such as transmogrify)\
    \ to do so."

  description: "At 6th level, a spirit summoner can select a shaman hex that is appropriate\
    \ to his spirit, chosen from the general list of shaman hexes or the specific\
    \ hexes allowed by his spirit. This otherwise functions as a shaman's hex, and\
    \ uses his summoner level as his shaman level. Like a shaman, a spirit summoner\
    \ uses his Wisdom modifier to determine hex DCs.\nAt 8th, 10th, and 16th levels,\
    \ the summoner can select another hex."
