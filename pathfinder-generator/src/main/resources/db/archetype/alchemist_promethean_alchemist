  description: "At 1st level, a promethean alchemist gains the service of a homunculus\
    \ companion. The means for creating this special homunculus are more exotic than\
    \ normal and require investiture of the promethean alchemist's own life essence\
    \ into the homunculus. This construct generally resembles a small humanoid or\
    \ child when first created; the specific appearance is up to its creator, though\
    \ a homunculus is always humanoid in shape and obviously unnatural on close inspection.\
    \ While every homunculus companion is absolutely devoted to its master, some homunculi's\
    \ loyalty borders on the unsettling; such companions jealously protect their masters\
    \ from threats or construct strange shrines in their masters' honor. A homunculus\
    \ companion can be of any alignment, even one that is different from its master's.\
    \ A destroyed homunculus companion can be restored to life by performing a ritual\
    \ with its corpse that requires 1 pint of its creator's blood per Hit Die of the\
    \ homunculus and rare materials worth 100 gp per Hit Die of the homunculus. Performing\
    \ this ritual takes 1 hour (though it may take some time to gather enough blood\
    \ at higher levels, so many promethean alchemists keep chilled blood samples in\
    \ storage just in case). A promethean alchemist can't take the mutagen or cognatogen\
    \ discoveries."
