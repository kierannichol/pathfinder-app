description: "Charlatans and stage magicians use slight of hand to fake magic. A counterfeit\
  \ mage goes a step further, parroting the motions and activation phrases used by\
  \ arcane casters to activate wands or other magical accoutrements. While counterfeit\
  \ mages rarely fool a real wizard, their command of the arcane is enough to convince\
  \ most lay people."
