  description: "At 4th level, a hexbreaker has the chance to protect others from being\
    \ cursed. As an immediate action when a spell with the curse descriptor or a curse-style\
    \ effect (such as a witch's evil eye or misfortune hex or a sea hag's evil eye)\
    \ targets a creature within 30 feet of him, a hexbreaker can spend 1 point from\
    \ his arcane pool to attempt to dispel that effect, as if he had cast remove curse.\
    \ This ability has no effect on ongoing effects, such as a sea hag's horrific\
    \ appearance or a pugwampi's unluck aura.\nThe magus adds remove curse to his\
    \ spell list as a 3rd-level spell and adds break enchantment as a 4th-level spell."
