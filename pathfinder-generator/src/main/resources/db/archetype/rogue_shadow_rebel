  description: "At 4th level, a shadow rebel gains the ability to cast misdirection\
    \ on herself once per day, though instead of choosing an object for the second\
    \ target, she must choose a creature in range. The caster level for this ability\
    \ is equal to her class level, and the save DC for this spell is 12 + the shadow\
    \ rebel's Intelligence modifier. The save DC of this ability increases by 1 if\
    \ the secondary target is lawful or evil."
