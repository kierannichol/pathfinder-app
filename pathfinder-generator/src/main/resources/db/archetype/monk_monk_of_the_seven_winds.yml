  description: "At 1st level, as an immediate action, a monk of the seven winds can\
    \ make a single attack with a manufactured light or one-handed slashing weapon\
    \ he is currently wielding against any target he has successfully hit at least\
    \ twice with his unarmed strike during his turn. This attack deals normal damage\
    \ but without the normal Strength bonus to damage.\nAt 4th level, he can take\
    \ a 5-foot step before or after performing a lightning finish so long as he ends\
    \ adjacent to his target, though if he takes this step, he cannot perform a 5-foot\
    \ step during his next turn. At 8th level, he applies his full Strength bonus\
    \ to his damage roll for the extra attack, even if he made the attack with an\
    \ off-hand weapon or with a weapon wielded in two hands. At 12th level, if he\
    \ hit the target at least three times with his unarmed strike during his turn,\
    \ taking the 5-foot step granted by lightning finish does not prevent him from\
    \ taking a 5-foot step during his next turn.\nA monk of the seven winds can use\
    \ this ability a number of times per day equal to his monk level, but no more\
    \ than once per round."

  description: "At 11th level, a monk of the seven winds can spend 2 ki points as\
    \ a full-round action to enter a meditative trance that replicates the spell dance\
    \ of a hundred cuts, using his monk level as his caster level. Unlike the spell,\
    \ a monk of the seven winds must both move 10 feet and make a melee attack each\
    \ round after he begins this trance to prevent the effect from ending. At 15th\
    \ level, he can instead spend 3 ki points when using this ability to make his\
    \ trance replicate dance of a thousand cuts with the same limitations."
