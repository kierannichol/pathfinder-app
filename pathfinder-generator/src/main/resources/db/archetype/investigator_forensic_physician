    \ after only 1 minute of examining the symptoms (DC = the disease's saving throw\
    \ DC), and he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Heal check at the same DC to disinfect\
    \ an infected object or corpse. At 3rd level, he receives a +2 bonus on saving\
    \ throws against diseases. This bonus increases by 2 at 6th level and every 3\
    \ investigator levels thereafter."

  description: "At 5th level, a forensic physician can study a sample of blood and\
    \ learn about its origins by attempting a Heal check with a DC of 20 for a creature\
    \ very familiar to the forensic physician (generally common PC races for a PC\
    \ forensic physician), 25 if the creature is somewhat familiar to the forensic\
    \ physician (typically a commonly known monster, but not the subject of many investigations),\
    \ and 30 or more for rarer creatures. This allows the forensic physician to identify\
    \ the race of creature that spilled the blood, and the creature's age and gender\
    \ (if any).\nIf the forensic physician succeeds at the Heal check but might not\
    \ have heard of the creature's race before, he can attempt an automatic Knowledge\
    \ check to see if he knows about the creature. If he succeeds, he identifies the\
    \ blood (and gains all other benefits of the Knowledge check); otherwise, he knows\
    \ that he succeeded at the Heal check but the blood is not from a creature he\
    \ recognizes.\nIf the blood is in its original setting, and the forensic physician\
    \ exceeds the DC by 5 or more, he can study the blood to determine a rough estimate\
    \ of when the blood was shed, and he can study the bloodstain patterns to get\
    \ an approximate idea of how the creatures involved were positioned and moving."
