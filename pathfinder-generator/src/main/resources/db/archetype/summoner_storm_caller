  description: "A storm caller can summon creatures infused with the power of the\
    \ storm to help him. This functions as the summoner's summon monster Iâ€“IX abilities,\
    \ except the storm caller can summon only the following creatures at the indicated\
    \ spell levels: I--eagle; II--small air elemental, small lightning elemental;\
    \ III--dire bat; IV--medium air elemental, medium lightning elemental, pteranodon;\
    \ V--large air elemental, large lightning elemental; VI--huge air elemental, huge\
    \ lightning elemental; VII--roc; VIII--elder air elemental, elder lightning elemental;\
    \ IX--advanced elder air elemental, advanced elder lightning elemental. Any creatures\
    \ summoned with this ability gain immunity to electricity.\nAlternatively, whenever\
    \ his eidolon is not summoned, a storm caller can expend a daily use of this ability\
    \ to summon a magical storm as a standard action.\nThis functions as call lightning\
    \ with a caster level equal to his summoner level, except as noted below.\nEach\
    \ bolt of lightning deals 1d6 points of electricity damage. This damage increases\
    \ by 1d6 at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th\
    \ level. The prevailing weather has no effect on the damage of the lightning bolts.\
    \ The Reflex save DC is equal to 10 + half the storm caller's summoner level +\
    \ his Charisma modifier. If the storm caller uses this ability again before he\
    \ has used all of his available bolts of lightning (to summon another magical\
    \ storm, to summon a monster, or to use the gate spell), any unused bolts are\
    \ expended with no effect.\nThe storm caller adds call lightning to his summoner\
    \ spell list as a 3rd-level spell and call lightning storm to his summoner spell\
    \ list as a 5th-level spell, but he does not automatically add them to his list\
    \ of spells known."

  description: "At 4th level, a storm caller and his eidolon can temporarily form\
    \ an electrical current between them. The storm caller can expend a use of his\
    \ summon storm's fury ability as a standard action to create an instantaneous\
    \ line of lightning between him and his eidolon, provided that the eidolon is\
    \ within 60 feet of him.\nThe lightning arc deals the same amount of damage to\
    \ all creatures in the line and has the same save DC as a bolt of lightning from\
    \ the summon storm's fury ability (unlike call lightning, this damage is dealt\
    \ only once). The storm caller and his eidolon are not affected by this lightning.\n\
    At 12th level, the storm caller gains the benefit of his eidolon's resistance\
    \ (electricity) or immunity (electricity) evolution whenever he is within 30 feet\
    \ of the eidolon."

  description: "At 6th level, a storm caller can borrow some of his eidolon's elemental\
    \ might. He can gain the flight evolution as though he were using the summoner's\
    \ aspect ability, deducting 2 evolution points from the eidolon's evolution pool.\
    \ If he does so, his eidolon is unable to take the flight evolution as long as\
    \ the storm caller has that evolution.\nAt 8th level, the storm caller's eidolon\
    \ can have the flight evolution even if the storm caller has that evolution.\n\
    At 10th level, the storm caller automatically gains the flight evolution without\
    \ reducing the number of evolution points available to the eidolon. He can use\
    \ the aspect ability (and at 18th level, the greater aspect ability) to gain additional\
    \ evolutions."
