description: "Pistols and other one-handed firearms are often easy to conceal and\
  \ faster to load than other firearms, and do sufficient damage for most situations.\
  \ But some gunslingers want a little more firepower and range. These are the musket\
  \ masters; the best of these gunslingers can reload a musket with dazzling speed,\
  \ potentially putting even their pistol-wielding brethren to shame."

  description: "Starting at 5th level, a musket master increases her skill with two-handed\
    \ firearms. She gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to her Dexterity modifier,\
    \ and when she misfires with a two-handed firearm, the misfire value increases\
    \ by 2 instead of 4. Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the bonus\
    \ on damage rolls increases by +1."
