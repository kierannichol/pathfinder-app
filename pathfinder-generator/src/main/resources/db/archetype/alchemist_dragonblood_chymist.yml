  description: "At 1st level, a dragonblood chymist discovers how to create a mutagen\
    \ that he can imbibe in order to mimic the might of a dragon. While he maintains\
    \ his original form, his features take on a draconic appearance, becoming scaly\
    \ and lizard-like. He gains a +2 natural armor bonus and a +2 alchemical bonus\
    \ to his Strength for 10 minutes per class level.\nAt 2nd level, the dragonblood\
    \ chymist has learned to concentrate the potency of his dragonblood mutagen such\
    \ that it grants him two claw attacks and a bite attack. If these are the only\
    \ attacks the dragonblood chymist makes in a round, they are primary attacks and\
    \ are made using his full base attack bonus. Otherwise, these natural attacks\
    \ are treated as secondary attacks. The claw attacks deal 1d4 points of damage\
    \ (1d3 if he is Small) and the bite attack deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if\
    \ he is Small). While the mutagen is in effect, he gains a +2 competence bonus\
    \ on Intimidate checks. At 12th level, the dragonblood mutagen grants a +4 natural\
    \ armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to his Strength. At 16th level, the dragonblood\
    \ mutagen grants a +6 natural armor bonus and a +6 alchemical bonus to his Strength.\
    \ This ability otherwise functions as mutagen."
