description: "Whether a changeling in the process of succumbing to her mother's call,\
  \ a witch cursed by a hag to become her instrument of torment, a vain and petty\
  \ witch overeager for power, or some other unfortunate soul, a hagbound witch finds\
  \ its soul has been infected by a hag's spite and powerful, corrupt arcane magic.\
  \ Her mind and body begin to transform to reflect her new being. Hagbound witches\
  \ suffer a slow transformative taint that is similar to the accursed corruption\
  \ and make ideal candidates for this additional power--and tragedy."
