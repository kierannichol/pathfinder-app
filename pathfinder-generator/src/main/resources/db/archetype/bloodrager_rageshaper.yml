description: "All bloodragers blend the unpredictable surge of arcane power with the\
  \ savage fury of battle lust. For most, their rage is a conduit for the eldritch\
  \ power locked in their heritage, but for a rageshaper, the latent magical energies\
  \ in his blood bring about physical transformations and facilitate the blending\
  \ of arcana and aggression into a deadly synthesis that few other barbarians (or\
  \ even other bloodragers) can match."

  description: "At 4th level, whenever a rageshaper gains a natural attack through\
    \ the use of a polymorph spell, he can increase the damage done by that attack\
    \ by one die. If the spell grants multiple natural attacks, the rageshaper must\
    \ choose one kind of natural attack for the ability to enhance. At 9th level,\
    \ if the rageshaper's altered form grants him a new mode of movement, that movement's\
    \ base speed increases by 10 feet. This is an enhancement bonus. If the rageshaper's\
    \ bloodrage powers already grant natural attacks or alternate modes of movement,\
    \ then the bonuses granted by bestial aspect also apply to these bloodrage powers."

  description: "At 5th level, a rageshaper can attempt to bolster any transmutation\
    \ spell from the bloodrager spell list with the polymorph subschool while bloodraging.\
    \ The rageshaper must succeed at a concentration check as if casting defensively\
    \ to modify the spell; otherwise, the spell is wasted. If he succeeds, the spell\
    \ is treated as if the rageshaper had the Extend Spell metamagic feat. The rageshaper\
    \ must be the spell's intended target or cast a spell with a range of personal\
    \ to gain this effect. If the rageshaper casts a spell that is linked to the rageshaper's\
    \ own bloodline, such as a rageshaper with the elemental bloodline who casts elemental\
    \ body I, the spell is automatically extended without forcing the concentration\
    \ check, so long as the rageshaper casts it while in a bloodrage."
