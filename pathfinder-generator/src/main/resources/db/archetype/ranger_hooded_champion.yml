description: "The hooded champion lives on the periphery of civilized lands, and is\
  \ often at odds with the forces of law and order. He is frequently a hero of oppressed\
  \ peoples, lurking in the woods near their homes and trying to right the injustices\
  \ inflicted upon them by the wealthy and powerful."

  description: "At 1st level, the hooded champion gains the swashbuckler's panache\
    \ class feature. He regains panache through critical hits and killing blows when\
    \ using a bow of any kind, rather than when using a light or one-handed piercing\
    \ melee weapon. If the hooded champion has this ability and the panache ability\
    \ from another class or archetype, the panache points from the two sources do\
    \ not stack, but the hooded champion regains panache in any way either class feature\
    \ allows him to. For example, a character with a Charisma score of 16 who has\
    \ both the hooded champion's and the swashbuckler's panache has a base of 3 panache\
    \ points, and regains panache from critical hits and killing blows from both bows\
    \ and light or one-handed piercing melee weapons."
