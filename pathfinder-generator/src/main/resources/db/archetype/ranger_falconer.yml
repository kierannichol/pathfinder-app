  description: "At 1st level, a falconer earns the trust and companionship of a bird\
    \ of prey. The bird can be of any type of large hunting or scavenging bird (even\
    \ a vulture). This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which\
    \ is part of the nature bond class feature), but the falconer must take the bird\
    \ animal companion, and that companion has only half the normal hit points. The\
    \ falconer cannot teach the bird of prey the work trick, but can teach it either\
    \ the roam or distract trick for free. Whichever trick the falconer does not pick\
    \ then can be picked as a trick later.\nRoam (DC 15) The falconer can let his\
    \ animal companion loose to roam and forage. He must let it roam for no more than\
    \ a week. When the falconer lets it roam, it agrees to return to the place he\
    \ let it loose within the time period he designates. Distract (DC 20; bird only)\
    \ The animal companion flutters wildly around any enemy it would normally attack\
    \ with the attack trick. It makes an attack roll against that enemy. On a hit,\
    \ the enemy is shaken for 1 round."

  description: "At 6th level, when outdoors, a falconer can direct his feathered companion\
    \ to strike an enemy from high above. His feathered companion gains the following\
    \ trick as a bonus trick.\nSwooping Charge (DC 20; bird) The falconer's bird companion\
    \ flies up and then swoops down into a charge. To perform this trick, the companion\
    \ must be able to fly, and it must be outdoors or someplace with enough room for\
    \ the bird to fly great distances in (a grand cathedral may have enough room,\
    \ but dungeons usually do not). It spends a full-round action flying to a high\
    \ vantage point, and on the next round makes a charge attack upon an enemy the\
    \ falconer designates. If that charge attack hits, the bird deals 2d4 points of\
    \ damage instead of 1d4 with its bite and gains a Ã—4 critical modifier when making\
    \ the attack. If the bird hits, the target is staggered for 1 round."
