  description: "At 1st level, a counter-summoner can attempt to counter a conjuration\
    \ spell cast by another creature. He must identify the spell being cast as normal\
    \ for counterspelling. If he does so, he can attempt to counter the spell as a\
    \ swift or immediate action. To counter the spell, the counter-summoner must attempt\
    \ a dispel check as if using dispel magic. If the spell being countered is a summon\
    \ monster or summon nature's ally spell, the counter-summoner gains a +5 bonus\
    \ on the dispel check. The counter-summoner can use this ability a number of times\
    \ per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier."

  description: "At 2nd level, as a swift action, a counter-summoner can target a single\
    \ creature he can see and determine if it has been summoned to its current plane\
    \ from another. This ability reveals whether the target has been conjured by a\
    \ conjuration (summoning) or (calling) spell, and allows the counter-summoner\
    \ to attempt a Spellcraft check to identify the spell that conjured it (using\
    \ the same DC as if the counter-summoner had witnessed the spell being cast)."

    \ per summoner level. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the counter-summoner's\

    \ can't be targeted by this ability more than once per 24-hour period."
