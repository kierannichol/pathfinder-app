  description: "A mooncursed can call upon an animal totem or inner curse, transforming\
    \ her into a savage beast.\nStarting at 1st (level, she chooses bear, boar, crocodile,\
    \ shark, tiger, or wolf. Once chosen, this animal can't be changed.\nWhen using\
    \ rounds of her shifting rage, instead of the usual bonuses and penalties from\
    \ rage, the mooncursed transforms into a Medium version of this animal's form\
    \ as if under the influence of beast shape I, treating her class level as her\
    \ caster level whenever relevant. Other aspects of rage aside from the bonuses\
    \ and penalties, such as the skill restrictions on skills and effects that require\
    \ concentration, still apply during a shifting rage."

  description: "Beginning at 5th level, a mooncursed can choose to assume a hybrid\
    \ of her base type and alternate form instead of her usual alternate form during\
    \ her shifting rage. If she does, the animal's forelimbs (or pectoral fins for\
    \ the shark) remain hands able to manipulate objects and wield weapons as well\
    \ as human hands do, she can walk on two legs (the shark's tail fins remain legs),\
    \ and she can talk."
