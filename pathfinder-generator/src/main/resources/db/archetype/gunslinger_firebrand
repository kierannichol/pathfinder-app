  description: "At 7th level, a firebrand can channel her explosive potential into\
    \ a mighty blast. As a standard action, the firebrand shoots a 30-foot cone of\
    \ fire from the barrel of her gun. The firebrand designates one creature in the\
    \ squares affected by the cone to be the target and makes an attack roll with\
    \ her firearm against that creature; on a hit, the target takes damage as if it\
    \ were directly hit by both the firebrand's firearm and her bomb. Creatures in\
    \ all other squares in the cone (as well as the target's square, if the gunslinger's\
    \ attack missed) take splash damage as if they were in the area of the firebrand's\
    \ bomb, with a Reflex saving throw for half damage. (The DC of this saving throw\
    \ is equal to 10 + half the firebrand's gunslinger level + the firebrand's Charisma\
    \ modifier.) Using this deed costs 2 grit points and expends one of the firebrand's\
    \ daily uses of bombs (see the bombs ability on page 5), as well as the appropriate\
    \ ammunition for the firearm attack; ammunition that does not require an attack\
    \ roll cannot be used this way."

    \ modifier to determine her number of bombs per day and the DC to avoid splash\
    \ damage. The firebrand adds her Charisma modifier to her bombs' damage instead\
    \ of her Intelligence modifier, even if she has the throw anything class feature.\
    \ In addition, the firebrand's bombs are always under the effect of the explosive\
    \ bombs discovery. Firebrand levels do not stack with levels in other classes\
    \ with the bombs class feature."
