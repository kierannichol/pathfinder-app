  description: "At 4th level, a wildcat gains additional training with the dirty trick\
    \ combat maneuver. He gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when attempting\
    \ this combat maneuver and a +1 bonus to his CMD when defending against this maneuver.\n\
    At 7th, 10th, and 16th levels, a wildcat becomes further trained in another combat\
    \ maneuver, gaining the above +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD. In\
    \ addition, the bonuses granted by previous maneuver training increase by 1 each.\
    \ For example, when a wildcat reaches 7th level, he gains a +1 bonus on one type\
    \ of combat maneuver, +1 to her CMD against that combat maneuver, and the bonuses\
    \ for the dirty trick combat maneuver increase to +2."

  description: "Starting at 4th level, a wildcat's damage with improvised weapons\
    \ increases. When wielding an improvised weapon, he uses the unarmed strike damage\
    \ of a monk four levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (minimum\
    \ monk level 1).\nFor example, a 6th-level Medium wildcat wielding a broken bottle\
    \ deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon's normal 1d4. If the weapon\
    \ normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This increase\
    \ in damage does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The wildcat can decide\
    \ to use the weapon's base damage instead of his adjusted unarmed strike damage.\
    \ This must be declared before the attack roll is attempted."

  description: "Starting at 9th level, once per day a wildcat can unleash a devastating\
    \ attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. He must announce this\
    \ intent before making his attack roll. If the wildcat's strike is successful\
    \ and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude\
    \ saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the wildcat's level + the higher of the wildcat's\
    \ Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round\
    \ on its turn, the unconscious target can attempt a new saving throw to end the\
    \ effect; this is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\
    \ Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability.\
    \ At 12th level, a wildcat can use this ability twice per day."
