  description: "By spending 10 minutes preparing and applying special paints to his\
    \ or an ally's skin, a war painter can create patterns that store the effects\
    \ of one of his raging songs. The war painter must expend 1 or more rounds of\
    \ his raging song class ability while anointing the ally, and the paint retains\
    \ its potency until the war painter recovers his daily uses of raging song. The\
    \ ally can activate the paint as a move action, gaining the benefits of the raging\
    \ song, including any rage powers as appropriate.\nThis effect lasts a number\
    \ of rounds equal to the rounds of raging song the war painter expended + the\
    \ war painter's ranks in Craft (calligraphy, paintings, or tattoos)--but no more\
    \ than double the number of rounds of raging song expended. By halving the remaining\
    \ number of rounds of raging song, an ally can suspend the paint's effects as\
    \ a free action and activate the paint again later as a move action.\nA war painter\
    \ cab apply the effects of any feats that affect bardic performance to his furious\
    \ paint, except effects that extend the effects of performances, such as the Lingering\
    \ Song feat. A creature can be subject to only one application of furious paint\
    \ at a time."

  description: "At 5th level, a war painter can channel a powerful totem into his\
    \ furious paints while applying the pigments on an ally. This grants the painted\
    \ ally the benefits of one additional rage power when the ally activates the furious\
    \ paints. The war painter does not need to know the rage power, but it must be\
    \ one for which he qualifies. Furthermore, the war painter can select only a blood\
    \ rage power or a totem rage power. If the war painter already has a different\
    \ blood rage or totem rage power that would be applied to the painted ally, this\
    \ new rage power replaces it and any other rage powers that require it as a prerequisite.\n\
    A war painter can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and he gains one\
    \ additional use at 11th and 17th levels. He can apply this ability multiple times\
    \ to the same creature, though only to give it rage powers that use the granted\
    \ rage power as a prerequisite (such as beast totem and greater beast totem)."

  description: "At 7th level, once per day as he finishes applying his furious paint\
    \ to a creature, a war painter can cast one skald spell with a casting time of\
    \ no more than 1 standard action and infuse the spell into the paint. Once while\
    \ benefiting from the paint's raging song, the painted ally can use a standard\
    \ action to cast the infused spell on herself as if the war painter had cast it.\
    \ The spell ends when the paint's other effects end.\nA war painter can infuse\
    \ only a skald spell whose level is at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level\
    \ skald spell he can cast. He can infuse any targeted spell in a painted ally,\
    \ even if its range is personal.\nThe war painter can use this ability twice per\
    \ day at 13th level and three times per day at 19th level."
