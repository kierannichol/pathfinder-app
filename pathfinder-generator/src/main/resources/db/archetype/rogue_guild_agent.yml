    \ the Leadership feat (including the +2 bonus for his guildhouse), to a maximum\
    \ of a number of lesser members equal to his rogue level. If the guild agent possesses\
    \ the Leadership feat, he gains twice as many followers as normal. If he spends\

    \ benefit to gain even more lesser members for a particularly difficult job. Each\

    \ works like the renown vigilante social talent except as follows. It applies\
    \ in all towns and cities on the same continent as the guild agent's base of operations,\
    \ without requiring him to select a particular settlement.\nHe has only one identity,\
    \ and only other criminals and members of the underworld treat their attitudes\
    \ toward the guild agent as one step closer to helpful at all times (rather than\
    \ while only in his social identity), while the bonus on Intimidate checks applies\
    \ against everyone at all times (rather than while only in his vigilante identity)."
