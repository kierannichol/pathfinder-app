    \ light spells by burning a magic extract, infusion, or potion of a spell of the\
    \ same or greater level than the light spell in a lit lantern or torch. If the\
    \ spell has a range of touch, the lantern or torch counts as the object touched.\
    \ The spell's DC, if any, equals 10 + spell level + the lamplighter's Intelligence\
    \ modifier.\nAt 2nd level, the lamplighter can cast light and continual flame\
    \ (24 hour duration).\nAt 5th level, the lamplighter can cast daylight and discovery\

  description: "At 3rd level, a lamplighter can use inspiration on initiative checks\
    \ without spending a use of inspiration. He can use his Intelligence modifier\
    \ in place of his Dexterity modifier on initiative checks. At 6th level, if the\
    \ lamplighter has Quick Draw, he can draw a weapon as part of his initiative check.\
    \ At 9th level, the lamplighter isn't flat-footed before he acts in the first\
    \ round of combat. At 12th level, the lamplighter adds his Intelligence bonus\
    \ as well as his Dexterity bonus to initiative checks. At 15th level, the lamplighter\
    \ can act last during the surprise round even if he is otherwise unaware combat\
    \ has started. At 18th level, the lamplighter is not limited to just a move or\
    \ standard action during the surprise round--he can act normally."
