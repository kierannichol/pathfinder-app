  description: "When a leshy caller summons her eidolon, the eidolon's body is created\
    \ from extraplanar plant material and imbued with the intelligence of a leshy\

    \ An unchained summoner uses the plant eidolon subtype.\nType: The eidolon is\
    \ still an outsider, and its statistics don't change, but it also counts as a\
    \ plant. As it isn't truly a plant, it doesn't gain the plant immunities.\nBase\
    \ Form: The leshy caller chooses one of the base forms listed below for her eidolon.\
    \ When the eidolon is summoned in an environment matching one of these base forms,\

  description: "A leshy caller can cast summon nature's ally as a spell-like ability\
    \ a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. At levels where\
    \ a regular summoner would gain access to a new level of summon monster as a spell-like\
    \ ability, the leshy caller instead gains the equivalent summon nature's ally\
    \ spell; at 19th level, she can cast summon nature's ally IX or gate. When a leshy\
    \ caller gains a summon nature's ally spell as a spell-like ability, she adds\
    \ it to her class spell list (though she must still select it as a spell known\
    \ if she wants to gain the ability to cast it as a normal spell). She adds leaf\
    \ leshys, gourd leshys, fungus leshys, seaweed leshys, and lotus leshys to her\
    \ list of creatures for summon nature's ally I, II, III, IV, and V, respectively."
