  description: "A scavenger is a master of mechanical arts rather than alchemical\
    \ ones, and he gains a competence bonus on Craft (clockwork) checks equal to his\
    \ class level.\nHe can use Knowledge (engineering) to identify wondrous items\
    \ as if using detect magic and Spellcraft. A scavenger does not gain any bonuses\
    \ to or special uses of the Craft (alchemy) skill.\nRather than prepare his extracts\
    \ as consumable liquids, a scavenger constructs small, single-use devices infused\
    \ with bits of his own magic aura to achieve the same effects. Alchemist and investigator\
    \ discoveries that affect extracts result in identical effects on a scavenger's\
    \ gadgets (such as the infusion discovery, which would allow another creature\
    \ to use a gadget, just as it would allow that creature to use an extract)."

  description: "Beginning at 2nd level, a scavenger can sacrifice one of his gadgets\
    \ to repair or enhance an adjacent mechanical device, such as a lock, trap, or\
    \ vehicle. Doing so either repairs 1d6 points of damage per extract level of the\
    \ gadget sacrificed or applies a bonus or penalty to one specific skill check\
    \ involved in using the device. The scavenger could, for example, sacrifice a\
    \ gadget to impose a penalty on all Disable Device checks to disarm a trap, add\
    \ a bonus on all Disable Device checks to open a lock, or add a bonus on all Profession\
    \ (driver) checks to drive a carriage.\nThis modifier is equal to twice the extract\
    \ level of the gadget sacrificed, and lasts for 10 minutes per class level."
