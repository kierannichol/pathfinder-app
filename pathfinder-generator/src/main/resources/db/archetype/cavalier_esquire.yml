  description: "At 3rd level, an esquire acquires the services of a loyal aide-de-camp.\
    \ This NPC functions similarly to a cohort, though the aide-de-camp must advance\
    \ in a class that grants proficiency with all martial weapons and cannot multiclass\
    \ until the esquire reaches 7th level (though the aide-de-camp can select an archetype).\n\
    If the aide-de-camp is a cavalier, he must follow the same order as the esquire.\n\
    The aide-de-camp gains Swift Aid as a bonus feat, and provides a +2 (rather than\
    \ +1) bonus when using this feat to aid the esquire. As a move action, the aide-de-camp\
    \ can retrieve a stored item or an item on the ground and hand it to the esquire.\
    \ The esquire does not have to take an action to receive the item, though he must\
    \ be conscious and have a free hand. This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity\
    \ for the aide-de-camp or esquire.\nIf the aide-de-camp dies performing an act\
    \ that directly supports the edicts of the esquire's order (GM's discretion),\
    \ the esquire does not take a penalty to his Leadership score. If an aide-de-camp\
    \ dies, or is released from the esquire's service, the esquire may gain a new\
    \ aide-de-camp by scouting for potential candidates in a city or large town. This\
    \ requires 1 day per 5 levels of the aide-de-camp to be recruited."

    \ the same target, these bonuses do not stack. Like the esquire, his aide-decamp\
