description: "Consiglieres act as trusted mediators and administrators for crime families\
  \ and various criminal organizations, and many serve as the right hand to the leaders\
  \ of such groups. Other consiglieres prefer to work as independent operators and\
  \ sell their advice and expertise to the highest bidder. Though some consiglieres\
  \ insulate themselves from violence and criminal activities, many enjoy getting\
  \ their hands dirty leading strike teams or gangs of hardened thugs."
