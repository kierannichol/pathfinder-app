    \ to as shots--in any combination equal to her rogue level, representing ammunition\
    \ smuggled to her by contacts. Her contacts provide only enough shots to replenish\
    \ this small supply, so she can't accumulate ammunition indefinitely, and these\
    \ shots have a market price of 0 gp.\nAt 6th level, the gun smuggler can elect\
    \ to gain one or more pieces of magic ammunition, though each one replaces a number\
    \ of her daily shots equal to the ammunition's enhancement bonus (maximum enhancement\
    \ bonus of +2 for any one piece of ammunition).\nShe can choose to add any of\
    \ the following weapon special abilities to the shot, though the shot must have\
    \ at least a +1 enhancement bonus, and these special abilities use an amount of\
    \ bonus equal to the ability's normal price:\nDistance, flaming, flaming burst,\
    \ merciful, seeking, or thundering.\nAt 9th level and every 3 rogue levels thereafter,\
    \ the maximum enhancement bonus of a gun smuggler's shots increases by 1 (to a\
    \ maximum of +6 at 18th level)."
