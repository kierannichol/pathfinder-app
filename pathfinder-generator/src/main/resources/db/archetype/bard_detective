  description: "A detective gains the following types of bardic performance:\nCareful\
    \ Teamwork (Su): A detective uses performance to keep allies coordinated, alert,\
    \ and ready for action. All allies within 30 feet gain a +1 bonus on Initiative\
    \ checks, Perception, and Disable Device checks for 1 hour. They also gain a +1\
    \ insight bonus on Reflex saves and to AC against traps and when they are flat-footed.\
    \ These bonuses increase by +1 at 5th level and every six levels thereafter. Using\
    \ this ability requires 3 rounds of continuous performance, and the targets must\
    \ be able to see and hear the bard throughout the performance. This ability is\
    \ language-dependent and requires visual and audible components.\nThis performance\
    \ replaces inspire courage.\nTrue Confession (Su): At 9th level, a detective can\
    \ use performance to trick a creature into revealing its secrets. Using this ability\
    \ requires a successful Sense Motive check to see through a Bluff or notice mental\
    \ compulsion. After 3 continuous rounds of performance, the target must make a\
    \ Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier). Success\
    \ renders the target immune to this power for 24 hours. On a failed save, a liar\
    \ inadvertently reveals the lie and the truth behind it. A creature under a charm\
    \ or compulsion reveals the nature of its enchantment and who placed it (if the\
    \ creature knows) and gains a new saving throw to break free from the enchantment.\
    \ This ability is language-dependent and requires audible components. Using this\
    \ power requires only 2 rounds of performance at 15th level, and 1 round of performance\
    \ at 20th level.\nThis performance replaces inspire greatness.\nShow Yourselves\
    \ (Ex): At 15th level, a detective can use performance to compel creatures to\
    \ reveal themselves when hiding. All enemies within 30 feet must make a Will save\
    \ (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier). If they fail, they\
    \ must cease using Stealth, unlock and open doors between themselves and the detective,\
    \ and dismiss, suppress, or dispel if necessary magical effects that grant invisibility\
    \ or any other form of concealment from the detective. As long as they can hear\
    \ the performance, affected creatures may not attack or flee until they have eliminated\
    \ every such effect, though they are freed from this compulsion immediately if\
    \ attacked. Creatures in the area must make this save each round the bard continues\
    \ his performance. This ability is language-dependent and requires audible components."
