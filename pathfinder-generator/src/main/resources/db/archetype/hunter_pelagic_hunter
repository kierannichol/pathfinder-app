  description: "At 5th level, when a pelagic hunter or her animal companion bleeds\
    \ underwater into the surrounding water (whether from piercing or slashing damage,\
    \ a bleed effect, or another effect that causes blood to spill), the blood transmutes\
    \ into ordinary water within 1 round. This prevents sharks and other predators\
    \ with keen scent from being drawn to the pelagic hunter's position by the blood\
    \ and makes it harder for such creatures to track her."
