  description: "At 1st level, a sacred shield can call upon the powers of good to\
    \ defend her and her allies against evil. This ability functions as smite evil,\
    \ except that the paladin gains no benefit on attack or damage rolls against her\
    \ target. Instead, any attacks the target makes against allies within 10 feet\
    \ of the paladin deal half damage. Attacks against the paladin deal full damage,\
    \ but the paladin gains a deflection bonus to her AC equal to her Charisma bonus\
    \ (if any) against attacks made by the target of the smite. This bonus increases\
    \ by +1 for every four paladin levels (to a maximum of +6 at 20th level). As with\
    \ smite evil, if the paladin targets a creature that is not evil, her bastion\
    \ of good ability is wasted with no effect. Feats, abilities, and the like that\
    \ increase a paladin's number of uses of smite evil per day increase a sacred\
    \ shield's uses of bastion of good per day."

  description: "At 4th level, a sacred shield can channel her faith into her shield,\
    \ protecting any nearby allies. All allies adjacent to the paladin gain a shield\
    \ bonus equal to the sacred shield's own shield bonus, including any increase\
    \ from the shield's enhancement bonus. This bonus does not stack with any existing\
    \ shield bonuses. The paladin herself radiates light as a light spell while the\
    \ shielding is active.\nAt 11th level, this protection expands to cover any allies\
    \ within 10 feet and the radiance increases to the effects of a daylight spell.\n\
    At 20th level, any allies within 20 feet are protected.\nUsing this ability consumes\
    \ two uses of the sacred shield's lay on hands ability, and the effects last for\
    \ 3 rounds plus a number of rounds equal to her Charisma bonus (if any).\nThis\
    \ ability replaces channel positive energy."
