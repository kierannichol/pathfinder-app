  description: "As a standard action, the martyr can chant hymns of faith and cause\
    \ bleeding stigmata to visibly appear on his body; at 7th level, he can manifest\
    \ stigmata as a move action, and at 13th level, he can do so as a swift action.\
    \ He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Charisma\
    \ modifier at 1st level, plus 1 additional round per day for each level beyond\
    \ 1st. While his stigmata are active, he takes 1 point of bleed damage, which\
    \ automatically ceases when he ends this ability but otherwise does not relent,\
    \ even in the face of magical healing or Heal checks. His stigmata assist his\
    \ allies, duplicating the effect of the countersong, distraction, or inspire courage\
    \ bardic performance of a bard of his paladin level, though both countersong and\
    \ distraction use Heal skill checks instead of Perform skill checks. At 10th level,\
    \ he can choose to duplicate the effects of inspire greatness. At 16th level,\
    \ he can choose to duplicate the effects of inspire heroics."

  description: "At 3rd level, a martyr can apply any of the mercies for which he qualifies\
    \ based on his paladin level to his lay on hands, even if he didn't select that\
    \ mercy (or its prerequisites). However, when he uses a mercy he didn't select,\
    \ he transfers the condition to himself for the remaining duration (ignoring any\
    \ immunity he might have to the condition), and he can't use this ability if he\
    \ already has that condition. If he transfers a condition to himself in this way,\
    \ he can't remove it from himself with a personal-only ability. The martyr can\
    \ use lay on hands on any ally within 30 feet, rather than needing to touch the\
    \ ally, but using lay on hands on himself is a standard action, not a swift action."
