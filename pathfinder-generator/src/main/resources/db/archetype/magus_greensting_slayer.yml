  description: "At 1st level, a greensting slayer can expend 1 point from his arcane\
    \ pool as a swift action to add 1d6 points of sneak attack damage to his next\
    \ melee attack that round. The attack must meet all of the usual prerequisites\
    \ for making a sneak attack, as the rogue class feature. For every 4 levels beyond\
    \ 1st, the amount of sneak attack damage dealt by this ability increases by 1d6\
    \ (to a maximum of 5d6 at 17th level). If a greensting slayer gets a sneak attack\
    \ from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.\nA greensting slayer cannot\
    \ use his arcane pool to enhance his weapon."
