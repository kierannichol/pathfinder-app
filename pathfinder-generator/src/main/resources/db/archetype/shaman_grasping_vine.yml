    \ a number of times per day equal to half her shaman level. In addition, while\
    \ under the effects of speak with plants, the grasping vine can deliver a suggestion\
    \ (as per the spell) to a single plant creature within 30 feet, ignoring the plant's\
    \ immunity to mind-affecting effects. The grasping vine can use this ability once\
