  description: "At 1st level, the argent voice can sing a song that causes fiends\
    \ to glow with an aura of silvery light. Outsiders with the evil subtype within\
    \ 10 feet of the argent voice are affected as per faerie fire. At 4th level and\
    \ every 4 levels thereafter, the range of this ability increases by 10 feet, to\
    \ a maximum of 60 feet at 20th level. Any defense that prevents the detection\
    \ of alignment or evil also prevents limning verse from outlining a creature."

  description: "At 6th level, the argent voice learns to sing at frequencies capable\
    \ of shattering magical effects. As a full-round action, an argent voice can use\
    \ 2 rounds of bardic performance to attempt to dispel a single evil spell or enchantment\
    \ spell cast by an evil creature. This functions as per dispel magic, using the\
    \ bard's level as his caster level. At 18th level, this ability can be used on\
    \ effects that can be removed by the spell break enchantment."

    \ magical Song of Silver with his performance, enhancing his allies' ability to\
    \ combat devils and similar fiends. To be affected, a creature must be able to\
    \ hear the argent voice's singing and be within 30 feet of him. Natural and manufactured\
    \ weapons wielded by affected allies are treated as though they were silver for\
    \ the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. At 14th level, allies' natural and\
    \ manufactured weapons also gain the benefit of the evil outsider bane weapon\
