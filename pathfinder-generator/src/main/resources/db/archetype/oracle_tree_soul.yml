description: "Tree souls develop an affinity not just with trees but also with objects\
  \ carved from them, feeling the essence of the tree's spirit living within. By bonding\
  \ to trees, they learn to manipulate the trees' power to produce divine energy.\
  \ The type of tree a tree soul oracle bonds to often seems to influence the oracle's\
  \ personality. A tree soul who is bound to a towering redwood may value traditions\
  \ and be slow to anger, while a tree soul bound to a smaller pine tree might be\
  \ quick to react and have a somewhat prickly personality. Regardless of the trees\
  \ they form their metaphysical attachment to, tree soul oracles tend to be steadfast\
  \ and stubborn, having an aura of timelessness even as the world changes around\
  \ them."

  description: "You bind your power to a specific tree. Any damage to the tree deals\
    \ the same amount of damage to you, overcoming DR, energy resistance, and immunities.\
    \ Damage you take in this way cannot be healed by normal or magical means until\
    \ your bonded tree is healed or destroyed. The damage can reduce you to 0 hit\
    \ points but not below. If the tree is destroyed, you are considered to be staggered\
    \ and are unable to cast oracle spells or use supernatural or spell-like class\
    \ abilities until you bond with a new tree in a ceremony that takes 12 hours to\
    \ complete. Once per month, you can create a new bond with a different tree in\
    \ a ceremony at that tree that takes 12 hours to complete. You lose your bond\
    \ with your previous tree in the process."

  description: "A tree soul oracle must take the following revelations at the listed\
    \ levels.\nTransform Wood (Su) At 1st level, as a standard action you can temporarily\
    \ transform a number of 5-foot cubes of wood each day equal to 1 + your Charisma\
    \ modifier. The wood takes on the quality of darkwood for 1 minute per oracle\
    \ level. At 11th level, you can have it instead take on the quality of living\
    \ steel for the same duration. Living Steel Dolls (Ex) At 11th level, you add\
    \ animate objects to your list of spells known. When you cast this spell on wooden\
    \ objects, the objects' wooden parts immediately transform into living steel.\
    \ If the objects are destroyed or the duration ends, the wooden parts revert back\
    \ to their original material. Tree Soul Revelation (Su) At 20th level, your skin\
    \ takes on the appearance and properties of a tree trunk. This bark-like skin\
    \ grants you a +4 natural armor bonus to your Armor Class and DR 10/slashing.\
    \ You also regrow any severed limbs except your head within 24 hours as per regenerate.\
    \ Finally, once a day as a standard action, you can assume the form of a treant,\
    \ as per plant shape III, for a number of minutes equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier\
    \ (minimum 1)."
