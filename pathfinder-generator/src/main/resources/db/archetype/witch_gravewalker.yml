description: "Having much in common with necromancers, the gravewalker is obsessed\
  \ with the occult manipulations of the dead, particularly mindless undead such as\
  \ zombies. Unlike the creations of standard necromancers, a gravewalker's creations\
  \ remain forever tied to her will, and she can produce vile apparitions of tremendous\
  \ power."

  description: "Each gravewalker carries around a gristly, inanimate poppet stitched\
    \ from human skin and stuffed with shards of bone, fingernails, and grave dirt.\
    \ A gravewalker's spells come from the will of evil spirits residing in the poppet,\
    \ and its ability to hold spells functions in a manner identical to the way a\
    \ witch's spells are granted by her familiar. The gravewalker must commune with\
    \ her poppet each day to prepare her spells and cannot prepare spells that are\
    \ not stored in the poppet.\nThis ability replaces familiar."

  description: "At 1st level, a gravewalker can take control of an undead creature\

    \ she had used command undead (once control is established, the undead remain\
    \ controlled even if outside the witch's aura). Intelligent undead receive a new\
    \ saving throw each day to resist her command. The witch can control up to 1 HD\
    \ of undead creatures per caster level. If an undead creature is under the control\
    \ of another creature, the witch must make an opposed Charisma check whenever\
    \ her orders conflict with that creature's."
