  description: "An archivist gains the following types of bardic performance:\nNaturalist\
    \ (Ex): An archivist who has identified a creature with a Knowledge check appropriate\
    \ to its type can use performance to share strategies for defeating it with allies\
    \ in combat. The archivist and any allies within 30 feet gain a +1 insight bonus\
    \ to AC and on attack rolls and saving throws against extraordinary, supernatural,\
    \ and spell-like abilities used by creatures of that specific kind of monster\
    \ (e.g., frost giants, not all giants or all humanoids). This bonus increases\
    \ by +1 at 5th level and every six levels thereafter. This language-dependent\
    \ ability requires visual and audible components.\nThis ability replaces inspire\
    \ courage.\nLamentable Belaborment (Ex): At 6th level, an archivist can bewilder\
    \ a creature already fascinated by his performance. Using this ability does not\
    \ disrupt the fascinate effect, but it does require a standard action to activate\
    \ (in addition to the free action to continue the fascinate effect). The target\
    \ must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier).\
    \ Success renders the target immune to this power for 24 hours, but failure leaves\
    \ the target either dazed or confused (archivist's choice) for as long as the\
    \ performance continues. If the target takes damage, this effect ends immediately.\
    \ This mind-affecting ability relies on audible components.\nThis ability replaces\
    \ suggestion.\nPedantic Lecture (Su): At 18th level, an archivist can affect as\
    \ many creatures with lamentable belaborment as he currently has fascinated. In\
    \ addition, he may choose to cause targets to fall asleep rather than be dazed\
    \ or confused."
