  description: "At 3rd level, a scrapper learns to salvage scrap from constructs or\
    \ other pieces of armor and attach them to his own armor. Salvaging scrap from\
    \ a destroyed construct or from another creature's armor takes 1 minute.\nScrap\
    \ from a construct grants the scrapper a natural armor bonus to AC equal to one-quarter\
    \ the construct's Hit Dice (minimum +1). If the scrap is salvaged from a piece\
    \ of armor, it instead grants a natural armor bonus to AC equal to 1 + the armor's\
    \ enhancement bonus (if any). The salvaged armor piece is flimsy and prone to\
    \ breaking. Scrap is immediately destroyed by any sunder combat maneuver that\
    \ targets the armor to which the scrap is attached. Otherwise, scrap crumbles\
    \ and falls away after a number of days equal to the natural armor bonus that\
    \ it grants. At 11th level, scrap salvaged from a construct also grants DR/adamantine\
    \ equal to one-quarter of the construct's Hit Dice."

  description: "At 5th level, a scrapper selects one fighter weapon group. He gains\
    \ a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when performing a sunder combat maneuver\
    \ with a weapon from the chosen group. He does not provoke attacks of opportunity\
    \ when performing a sunder combat maneuver with a weapon from the chosen group.\
    \ If the scrapper has the Improved Sunder feat, the bonuses on attack and damage\
    \ rolls from this ability double. At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter,\
    \ a scrapper can either take the fighter's weapon training class feature or improve\
    \ his bonuses from the scrapper training class feature by 1."
