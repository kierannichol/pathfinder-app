    \ of qualifying for this feat. At 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, she\

  description: "A dwarven scholar gains the following type of bardic performance.\n\
    War Chant (Su): At 1st level, a dwarven scholar can use her performance to inspire\
    \ the martial prowess of the ancient dwarves in her allies. The dwarven scholar\
    \ selects a single combat feat she knows. Allies affected by this performance\
    \ gain the benefit of this feat for as long as the performance is maintained.\
    \ To be affected, an ally must be able to perceive the dwarven scholar's performance.\
    \ If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses\
    \ of that combat feat by the dwarven scholar's allies while using this ability\
    \ counts toward the dwarven scholar's feat's daily limit.\nAt 6th level, the dwarven\
    \ scholar may grant the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may\
    \ use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat. Maintaining\
    \ two feats in this way requires spending 2 rounds of bardic performance every\
    \ round."
