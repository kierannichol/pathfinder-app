  description: "At 6th level, the studious librarian is exposed to a wide variety\
    \ of magical writing, and can use his own magic to duplicate spells from other\
    \ classes' spell lists.\nOnce per day, a studious librarian can cast any spell\
    \ from the bard, sorcerer/wizard, or witch spell lists from a scroll or spellbook\
    \ in hand as if it were one of his bard spells known, expending a bard spell slot\
    \ of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a spell from a scroll\
    \ this way does not cause the spell to vanish from the scroll. A spell cast in\
    \ this way cannot be modified by metamagic. The studious librarian gains one additional\
    \ daily use of this ability at 10th level and again every 4 bard levels thereafter,\
    \ to a maximum of four times per day at 18th level."
