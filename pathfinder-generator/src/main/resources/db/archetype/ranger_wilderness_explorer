  description: "A wilderness explorer gains the ability to communicate with creatures\
    \ with which he doesn't share a common language. Only basic concepts can be conveyed\
    \ or understood, such as “I need help,\"“I come in peace,\"“Come over here,\"“\
    Go over there,\"and the like. This allows the wilderness explorer to ignore the\
    \ common language requirement of social interaction and language-dependent spells\
    \ and effects, but he can do so only when the information being shared is relatively\
    \ simple. The creature with which the wilderness explorer communicates must understand\
    \ at least one language for this ability to function.\nAdditionally, a wilderness\
    \ explorer can peacefully influence the initial attitude of humanoids that have\
    \ Intelligence scores of 2 or lower. This ability functions just like wild empathy,\
    \ but it works on humanoids instead of on animals. The wilderness explorer can\
    \ also use this ability to influence a monstrous humanoid with 2 or lower Intelligence,\
    \ but the wilderness explorer takes a –4 penalty on the check."
