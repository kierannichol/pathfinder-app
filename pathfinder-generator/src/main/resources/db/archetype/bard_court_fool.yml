name: "Court Fool"
description: "Arguably the oldest and most widespread role for a court entertainer\
  \ is that of the court jester or fool. This role arose from the need to offset the\
  \ intense, even deadly, seriousness of court business. The court fool serves as\
  \ an outlet for the constant pressure of aristocratic dealings, relieving tensions\
  \ through humor. The motley clad acrobat is a good example of this style of court\
  \ fool, using physical comedy to generate belly laughs and raise spirits. In other\
  \ courts, the court fool might ridicule social conventions with bawdy songs or engage\
  \ in biting satire, parodying manners or even mocking individuals to spread good\
  \ cheer. The court fool holds up an unflattering mirror to those in charge or speaks\
  \ truths, however veiled, that no one else can safely utter."
