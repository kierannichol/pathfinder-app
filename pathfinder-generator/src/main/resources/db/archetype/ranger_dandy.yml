description: "The antithesis of the gruff and wild woodsmen, a dandy takes effort\
  \ to master the subtle etiquette of noble courts, the whispers of dark rumors, and\
  \ the customs of the cultured world. Nonetheless, he is still a ranger at heart,\
  \ and he hunts for rumors and gossip throughout the grand ballrooms of the wealthy\
  \ and powerful just as most rangers hunt for enemies in the wilderness."

  label: null
  type: null
  description: "A dandy can alter the flow and spread of rumors in his favor. This\
    \ functions similarly to wild empathy, except that it takes 1 day (8 hours of\
    \ work), instead of 1 minute, and it affects the general tenor of a rumor instead\
    \ of a wild animal.\nA successful rumor empathy check allows the dandy to increase\
    \ or decrease the rumor's tone by one step. For example, he could make an indifferent\
    \ rumor friendly and thus positive toward its target, or an unfriendly rumor hostile\
    \ and thus even more negative toward its target than it was originally.\nThe difficulty\
    \ of influencing a rumor depends on the size of the community in which it is spreading.\
    \ The DC of the check is 15 in a village or smaller settlement. This DC increases\
    \ by 5 and the number of days required to attempt the check increases by 2 for\
    \ every settlement size category larger than a village--to a maximum of DC 40\
    \ and 11 days to affect a rumor spreading through an entire metropolis.\nIf the\
    \ rumor is only spreading through a smaller segment of the population, such as\
    \ the elven district in a larger metropolis, use the population of that smaller\
    \ segment to determine the DC and number of days of work required to use rumor\
    \ empathy. The DC also increases by 10 if the rumor is about the dandy himself,\
    \ since the dandy is obviously a biased source with respects to rumors about his\
    \ own person."
