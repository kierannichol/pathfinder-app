  description: "At 1st level, a crimson chymist discovers how to create a specialized\
    \ mutagen that grants her aspects of a praying mantis. A mantis mutagen functions\
    \ as an alchemist mutagen, save that it always enhances Dexterity and applies\
    \ a penalty to Charisma. When imbibed, the mutagen causes the crimson chymist's\
    \ flesh to grow red chitinous plates on her body as natural armor and a row of\
    \ small, cosmetic barbed hooks along her arms."
