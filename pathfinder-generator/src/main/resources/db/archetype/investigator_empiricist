  description: "An empiricist's ability to notice the minutiae of almost everything\
    \ that happens around him allows him to make shrewd and insightful calculations\
    \ about people and even inanimate objects. At 2nd level, an empiricist uses his\
    \ Intelligence modifier instead of the skill's typical ability for all Disable\
    \ Device, Perception, Sense Motive, and Use Magic Device checks. He can also use\
    \ his Intelligence modifier instead of Charisma on any Diplomacy checks made to\
    \ gather information."

  description: "An empiricist's grasp of facts and data teaches him to anchor himself\
    \ in reality, granting resistance to even the most potent illusions. At 4th level,\
    \ an empiricist gains a +2 insight bonus on all Will saving throws against illusion\
    \ spells or spell-like abilities that allow a save to disbelieve their effects.\
    \ In addition he can spend one point from his inspiration pool as an immediate\
    \ action to use his Intelligence bonus instead of her Wisdom bonus on all such\
    \ saves for one round. At 8th level, the empiricist's insight bonus increases\
    \ to +4. At 16th level, he gains immunity to all illusion spells and spell-like\
    \ abilities that allow a save to disbelieve the effects."
