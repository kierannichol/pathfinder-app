  description: "At 6th level, once per day as a full-round action, an alley witch\
    \ can bind a hex she knows into a feather, bead, or other small token. Any creature\
    \ holding this token can use that hex once as if using a potion, targeting itself\
    \ or a creature it touches. While a hex is sealed into a token, the alley witch\
    \ loses her ability to use that hex until the token is used or she can recover\
    \ the token. If a hex can be used in increments (like the disguise hex), the alley\
    \ witch decides how many increments the token contains when making it. If a hex\
    \ has no set duration, it lasts for 1 minute once activated."
