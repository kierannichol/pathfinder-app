  description: "Starting at 3rd level, a trench fighter can select one specific type\
    \ of firearm (such as a machine gun, revolver, or rifle). He gains a bonus equal\
    \ to his Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm.\
    \ Every 4 levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), the trench fighter picks up\
    \ another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well. Furthermore,\
    \ when behind partial, normal, or improved cover, a trench fighter gains an additional\
    \ +2 AC bonus from the cover."
