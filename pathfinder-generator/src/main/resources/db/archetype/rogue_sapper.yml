  description: "A sapper is able to quickly breach obstacles. Using a combination\
    \ of engineering, explosives, alchemical reagents, and sheer bloody-mindedness,\
    \ she can deal up to 10 points of damage per sapper level upon an object once\
    \ per day, ignoring the object's hardness. She might crack open a stone wall with\
    \ an explosive charge, or collapse a ceiling by tunneling through its supports.\
    \ This ability requires 1d4+1 hours of preparation, so it can be used only on\
    \ immobile and unresisting objects."

    \ checks to find or disable traps. She also grants a +4 bonus when using the aid\
    \ another action to assist with Strength checks to lift gates, bend bars, or force\
    \ open doors. However, the sapper is focused, so it takes her a full-round action\
    \ to complete any aid another action."

  description: "At 4th level, a sapper loots a dungeon or other adventuring complex\
    \ of its mundane goods and sells them to her various contacts. These mundane goods\
    \ include things like brass fittings, stewpots, scrap metal, and so on. The sapper\
    \ automatically loots this junk while in the dungeon, and must spend 24 uninterrupted\
    \ hours selling the objects in town. She shares a portion of the proceeds with\
    \ the adventurers; the amount typically equals 1d10 gp per sapper level per dungeon."
