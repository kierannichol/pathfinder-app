  description: "A charger counts as having the Mounted Combat feat only for the purpose\
    \ of meeting feat prerequisites, and substitutes the Acrobatics skill for any\
    \ Ride skill prerequisites when acquiring feats that have Mounted Combat as a\
    \ prerequisite. Because of his equine form, a charger can wield a lance one-handed\
    \ as if mounted and deals double damage with a lance while charging. A charger\
    \ can never gain the benefit of the Mounted Combat feat (or other similar feats\
    \ or effects, such as Trick Riding) if ridden by another creature."

  description: "At 3rd level, a charger's hoof attack deals an additional 1d6 points\
    \ of damage and its critical threat range increases to 19–20. This effect doesn't\
    \ stack with any other effect that expands the critical threat range of a weapon.\
    \ Whenever he performs a charge, the charger can make an additional hoof attack\
    \ against his target with a –5 penalty on his attack roll."

    \ each round as if it were normal terrain. These benefits apply only when he is\
    \ wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load.\
    \ Apply this bonus before modifying the charger's speed because of any load carried\
    \ or armor worn. These bonuses stack with any other bonuses to the charger's land\
    \ speed or ability to ignore difficult terrain."

  description: "At 11th level, a charger can attempt to overrun any number of targets\
    \ in the path of his charge as a free action. For each successful overrun combat\
    \ maneuver check, the charger automatically deals an amount of damage to the overrun\
    \ target equal to that of his hoof attack and can continue with his charge. If\
    \ any overrun attempt fails during the charge, the charger's progress ends in\
    \ the space directly in front of the target where the maneuver failed. These overrun\
    \ attempts do not provoke attacks of opportunity. For each target in the path\
    \ of his charge, the charger incurs a cumulative –2 penalty on his overrun combat\
    \ maneuver checks."
