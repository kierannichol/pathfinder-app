  description: "A halcyon druid forms a powerful bond with a mask, which functions\
    \ identically to a wizard's bonded object except that it can be used to cast druid\
    \ spells (including those gained from class abilities) instead of wizard spells.\

    \ A halcyon druid can enhance her mask with abilities appropriate for a head slot\
    \ item, and can designate an existing head slot item as her bonded mask (but only\
    \ if it covers her face)."

    \ following abilities if the assumed form has them: aura of menace, protective\
    \ aura, speak with animals, telepathy, and truespeech. If the assumed form has\
    \ immunity to a condition, the druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against\
    \ effects that cause that condition. A halcyon druid can use this ability for\
    \ a number of minutes per day equal to her druid level. The duration does not\
    \ need to be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments."
