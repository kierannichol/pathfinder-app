  label: null

  description: "At 9th level, a courtly knight develops a commanding demeanor, and\
    \ the strength of her conviction is often enough to get others to do as she asks,\
    \ merely because she expects it to be done. In a social setting, the courtly knight\
    \ can attempt Diplomacy checks to make a request of a creature whose attitude\
    \ toward her is unfriendly, provided that creature does not intend to harm or\
    \ oppose the courtly knight or her allies in the immediate future. Further, whenever\
    \ she attempts a Diplomacy check to make a request, a courtly knight can first\
    \ attempt an Intimidate check (DC = 20 + the creature's Charisma modifier). If\
    \ she succeeds, she gains a +5 bonus on the subsequent Diplomacy check. Neither\
    \ aspect of imperious attitude applies if the requested creature considers itself\
    \ to be of an equal or higher social rank than the courtly knight, which includes\
    \ creatures that don't understand or value the concept of social ranks."

  description: "At 17th level, whenever a courtly knight uses her challenge class\
    \ feature against an opponent who is at full health and under no negative afflictions,\
    \ conditions, spells, or other effects, she can make a grand boast, declaring\
    \ that she can defeat her foe with ease. She does not gain the benefits of her\
    \ challenge (including any additional benefits granted by her order) when making\
    \ a grand boast. If she successfully defeats the target of her challenge within\
    \ 1 minute, however, she is vindicated in her boast and gains the benefits of\
    \ her challenge against all allies of the defeated enemy who witnessed her grand\
    \ boast and who are of the same or lower CR as the defeated enemy. If any of the\
    \ courtly knight's allies attack the initial target of the challenge or assist\
    \ the courtly knight after the boast, this ability has no effect."
