description: "While most gunslingers have favorite firearms, there are those rare\
  \ ones who choose to specialize in one-handed firearms exclusively. These gunslingers\
  \ are called pistoleros. While they lack the flexibility of being able to pick up\
  \ any kind of firearm and use it with reasonable proficiency, they are crackerjack\
  \ shots with pistols and similar firearms. Their skill and aim with these firearms\
  \ at close range is second to none, and they rarely misfire with these weapons."

  description: "Starting at 5th level, a pistolero increases her skill with one-handed\
    \ firearms. She gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to her Dexterity modifier,\
    \ and when she misfires with a one-handed firearm, the misfire value increases\
    \ by 2 instead of 4. Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the bonus\
    \ on damage rolls increases by +1."
