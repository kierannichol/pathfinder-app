    \ feat she knows with a magic item that doesn't have an appropriate spell in its\
    \ construction requirements. The magic item must meet all other requirements of\
    \ the item mastery feat. Alternatively, if she is using a magic item with an appropriate\
    \ spell in its construction requirements, she can use an item mastery feat without\
    \ it counting against the feat's total uses per day. She can use this ability\
    \ one additional time per day at 7th, 11th, and 15th levels."

  description: "At 5th level, a relic master can increase the potency of a magic item\
    \ she wields by investing it with a bit of her vitality as a swift action. If\
    \ the item is armor, a shield, or a weapon, its enhancement bonus increases by\
    \ 1 to a maximum of +5. If the magic item creates a spell or has a save DC, its\
    \ effective caster level increases by 1. A relic master can use this ability for\
    \ a number of minutes per day equal to 1 + her Constitution modifier (minimum\
    \ 1 minute). This duration doesn't need to be consecutive, but it must be used\
    \ in 1-minute increments."

    \ for other feats or options. If she selects a different item mastery feat, she\
    \ loses access to her previous use of improvised item mastery and any magic effect\
    \ created with it ends immediately. Any daily uses of a selected improvised item\
    \ mastery feat count against all improvised mastery feats selected in the same\
