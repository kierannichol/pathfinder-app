  description: "A wit gains the following bardic performance.\nCutting Remark (Su):\
    \ At 3rd level, a wit can wound with his words. The wit can spend 1 round of bardic\
    \ performance as a standard action to deal 1d4 points of nonlethal damage + the\
    \ wit's bard level to a creature within 30 feet. Damage Reduction applies to this\
    \ damage. At 8th level, a target who takes damage from cutting remark is also\
    \ sickened for as long as it remains within 30 feet of the wit and for 1 round\
    \ thereafter. Additionally, the nonlethal damage counts as magic for purposes\
    \ such as overcoming damage reduction. At 14th level, a target who takes damage\
    \ from cutting remark must also succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the wit's\
    \ bard level + his Charisma modifier) or be dazed for 1 round. A creature that\
    \ makes a successful save is immune to the dazing effect of the wit's cutting\
    \ remark for 24 hours. Cutting remark is a mind-affecting, language-dependent\
    \ effect, and relies on audible components."

    \ seed one of the biases that he discovered. Once during a verbal duel, he can\
    \ reassign an appropriate skill from one tactic to another tactic in which he\
