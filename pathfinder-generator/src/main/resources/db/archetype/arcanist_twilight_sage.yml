  description: "By wresting a soul from life to death, a twilight sage gains a slightly\
    \ deeper understanding of mortality, fueling her curiosity and eldritch power.\
    \ As a full-round action, she can consume the life energy of a helpless living\
    \ creature, killing it.\nThis creature must have 2 or more Hit Dice and be below\
    \ 0 hit points. The twilight sage adds 2 points to her arcane reservoir if the\
    \ creature's Hit Dice equaled or exceeded the sage's character level, or 1 point\
    \ if the creature's Hit Dice equaled at least 1/2 her character level.\nThis ability\

  description: "A twilight sage's arcane barrier differs from those of other arcanists,\
    \ as it draws upon both negative and positive energy to protect the sage. At 1st\
    \ level, a twilight sage must choose the arcane barrier exploit as her first arcanist\
    \ exploit. Whenever an attack removes the last temporary hit point from the twilight\
    \ sage's arcane barrier, the barrier's negative energy lashes back at the attacker,\
    \ dealing an amount of negative energy damage equal to the barrier's maximum temporary\
    \ hit point capacity."

  description: "At 11th level, a twilight sage's mastery over life and death allows\
    \ her to transfer life energy into a fading vessel. Once per day, she can expend\
    \ 1 point from her arcane reservoir while touching a creature that died within\
    \ the past round to affect that creature as if it had received a breath of life\
    \ spell, using her arcanist level as the caster level. At the same time, a willing\
    \ or unconscious living creature within 300 feet that has a number of Hit Dice\
    \ equal to or greater than the recipient's instantly dies. This ability is a death\
    \ effect, and if the victim doesn't actually die (such as if it was summoned or\
    \ is immune to death effects), the recipient doesn't receive the breath of life\
    \ effect."

  description: "At 20th level, a twilight sage has mastered the relationship between\
    \ death and arcane power, and has gained a limited ability to surpass her own\
    \ mortality. Whenever she dies (but not if she becomes undead), if she still has\
    \ points in her arcane reservoir she appears as an ephemeral spirit in the air\
    \ above her corpse.\nShe can still cast spells in this form, using her corpse\
    \ as the origin point and determining whether she can see or target any creature\
    \ or area as though she were alive in that square. To cast a spell, she must expend\
    \ a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the spell's level.\
    \ The spirit disappears if she has no points remaining in her arcane reservoir\
    \ or she spends a round without casting a spell. The spirit can't move, deliver\
    \ touch or ranged touch spells, or do anything that isn't part of casting a spell.\
    \ Her spirit completes the verbal and somatic components of her spells, any material\
    \ components are consumed from the supply on the corpse, and any focus components\
    \ must be on the corpse."
