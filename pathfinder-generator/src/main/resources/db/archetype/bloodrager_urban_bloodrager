description: "Like the urban barbarian, the urban bloodrager has learned to control\
  \ her rage in so-called polite society. Though she lacks the untamed resilience\
  \ of her wilder fellows, she's an expert at keeping her rage from causing collateral\
  \ damage in crowds."

  description: "When an urban bloodrager rages, she does not gain the normal benefits.\
    \ Instead, she can apply a +4 morale bonus to her Constitution, Dexterity, or\
    \ Strength. This bonus increases to +6 when she gains greater bloodrage and to\
    \ +8 when she gains mighty bloodrage. She can apply the full bonus to one ability\
    \ score or split the bonus between several scores in increments of 2. When using\
    \ a controlled bloodrage, an urban bloodrager gains no bonus on Will saves, takes\
    \ no penalties to AC, and can still use Charisma-, Dexterity-, and Intelligence-based\
    \ skills. A controlled bloodrage still counts as a bloodrage for the purposes\
    \ of any spells, feats, and other effects."

  description: "At 3rd level, an urban bloodrager can attune her spells so they are\
    \ less likely to impact her allies or innocent bystanders. When the bloodrager\
    \ casts a spell, she can grant a +2 bonus on the saving throw against that spell\
    \ to any creatures she is aware of that are targeted by the spell or within the\
    \ spell's area. Any creature that receives this bonus and succeeds at its save\
    \ is unaffected by the spell, as if it hadn't been targeted or wasn't in the area."

  description: "At 7th level, an urban bloodrager learns some of the secrets of other\
    \ magical traditions from other denizens of the city. She can select from the\
    \ bard or magus spell list any spell of a level she can cast, and add it to her\
    \ bloodrager spell list and to her bloodrager spells known.\nAt 10th level and\
    \ every 3 levels thereafter, the urban bloodrager can add another such spell to\
    \ her spell list and spells known. If she chooses to learn a new spell in place\
    \ of an old one, she can exchange a bard or magus spell for another.\nThis ability\
    \ replaces damage reduction."
