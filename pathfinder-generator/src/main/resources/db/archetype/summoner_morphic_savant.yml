  description: "A morphic savant's eidolon must be of a chaotic alignment (if using\
    \ the Unchained Summoner, the eidolon must have the azata, demon, or protean subtype).\
    \ The morphic savant's eidolon has three base forms: biped, quadruped, and serpentine.\
    \ Each form has the same feats and skills, but has its own set of evolutions.\n\
    When the summoner meditates and regains his spell slots for the day, he can select\
    \ any of the three base forms of his eidolon. The eidolon has 1 fewer evolution\
    \ point than normal for an eidolon of the morphic savant's summoner level, and\
    \ has 1 fewer skill point per Hit Die."

  description: "Since a morphic savant's power is drawn from planar energies aligned\
    \ with chaos, all the creatures he summons must be of a chaotic alignment.\nIf\
    \ a creature would normally be celestial or fiendish, it is instead an entropic\
    \ creature.\nThis also causes the morphic savant's summoning power to be less\
    \ reliable than a standard summoner‘s.\nEach time he uses his summon monster spell-like\
    \ ability to summon multiple creatures, there is a 50% chance he summons one more\
    \ monster than normal for the summon monster spell he uses, in which case the\
    \ creatures remain for only 1 round per level (instead of 1 minute per level).\n\
    Also, starting at 2nd level, the morphic savant can grant one 1-point evolution\
    \ to all the creatures he summons with his summon monster spell-like ability.\
    \ He can't grant an evolution that duplicates the function of, or has the same\
    \ name as, any ability the summoned creatures already possess (for example, he\
    \ can't grant a creature with a bite attack another bite attack), nor can he add\
    \ an evolution that causes the summoned monsters to have more attacks than his\
    \ eidolon‘s maximum number of attacks. The creatures do not have to be of the\
    \ correct subtype to gain an evolution, but do have to meet any other prerequisites."
