  description: "At 4th level, a cleaner is able to study a location, conceal evidence,\
    \ and hide in or extricate himself quickly from that location. Studying a location\
    \ takes 1 minute for each 10-foot square. Once he has studied an area, the cleaner\
    \ can attempt a Disguise check to alter evidence or a Stealth check to conceal\
    \ evidence (by doing things such as cleaning up bloodstains, obscuring footprints,\
    \ moving a dead body, and so on). Altering an area takes 1d3 x 10 minutes of work\
    \ per 10-foot square. Anyone attempting to determine what actually happened in\
    \ that area must succeed at an opposed Perception check against the result of\
    \ the cleaner's Disguise or Stealth check (cleaner's choice) or accept the altered\
    \ scene as truth. The cleaner gains a +4 bonus on this check, on Sleight of Hand\
    \ checks to hide objects from that location on his person, and on Stealth checks\
    \ to hide within or escape from that location. This lasts as long as the scene\
    \ remains unaltered (except by the cleaner)."
