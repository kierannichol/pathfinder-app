  description: "At 2nd level, a vanguard receives a teamwork feat as a bonus feat.\
    \ He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. Once per day as a standard action,\
    \ the vanguard can grant one of his teamwork feats to all allies within 30 feet\
    \ who can see and hear him. Allies retain the use of this bonus feat for 3 rounds\
    \ plus 1 round for every 2 levels the vanguard possesses. Allies do not need to\
    \ meet the prerequisites of this bonus feat. Whenever the vanguard is able to\
    \ select a new slayer talent, he can instead choose to gain an additional use\
    \ per day of this ability."
