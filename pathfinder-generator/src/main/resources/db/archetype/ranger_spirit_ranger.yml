  description: "At 4th level, instead of forming a bond with his hunting companions\
    \ or an animal companion, the spirit Ranger forms a bond with the spirits of nature\
    \ themselves. Each day, as long as he is within one of his favored terrains, the\
    \ Ranger can cast augury as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to\
    \ his Ranger level. In addition, he can call upon these spirits to cast any one\
    \ Ranger spell that he is capable of casting, without having to prepare the spell.\
    \ At 8th level, and every four levels thereafter, he can cast an additional spell\
    \ in this way."
