    \ he can spend up to 3 consecutive rounds studying an area of terrain to gain\
    \ the benefits below. Each round of studying terrain is a standard action. During\
    \ the first round of studying terrain, the battle scout designates a 60-foot-radius-burst\
    \ area from a single square within line of sight. Depending on how many rounds\
    \ the battle scout spends studying the area, he or his allies gain the following\
    \ benefits for 10 minutes per ranger level he possesses. (For example, if he spends\
    \ 2 rounds, he or his allies gain the first two benefits.)\n1st Round: Allies\
    \ within line of sight and that can hear the battle scout gain a +2 bonus on initiative\
    \ checks while within the advantageous terrain area.\n2nd Round: Allies within\
    \ line of sight and that can hear the battle scout gain a +2 on Perception, Stealth,\
    \ and Survival checks while within the advantageous terrain area.\n3rd Round:\
    \ The battle scout's movement is not hampered by difficult terrain while within\
    \ the advantageous terrain area. Furthermore, the battle scout can take 10 on\
    \ Climb and Swim checks and checks to jump while within the area, even when in\
    \ immediate danger or distracted."
