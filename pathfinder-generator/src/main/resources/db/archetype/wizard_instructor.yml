  description: "At 1st level, an instructor acquires the services of a loyal apprentice.\
    \ She functions similarly to a cohort, though your apprentice begins as a 1st-level\
    \ commoner with Magical Aptitude as their 1st-level feat and NPC ability scores\
    \ (13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8 before racial modifiers). When the instructor reaches\
    \ 3rd level, if his Leadership score is at least 2, the apprentice becomes a 1st-level\
    \ wizard of the same school specialization as the instructor, and she gains heroic\
    \ ability scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8 before racial modifiers). The apprentice\
    \ never gains item creation feats, but otherwise follows the normal rules for\
    \ a cohort.\nEach time the instructor gains a level, he may dismiss his existing\
    \ apprentice as graduated (or expelled, depending on her performance), and gain\
    \ a new cohort following the same rules. If an apprentice dies in service to the\
    \ instructor, the instructor takes a â€“2 penalty to his Leadership score. This\
    \ penalty is reduced by 1 for every level the instructor gains after the death,\
    \ to a minimum of 0.\nBecause cohorts are most interested in the instructor's\
    \ magical ability, the instructor uses his Intelligence modifier, rather than\
    \ Charisma, to determine his Leadership score. At 7th level, an instructor may\
    \ select the Leadership feat--using his Intelligence modifier to determine his\
    \ Leadership score--but doing so only provides followers, never a second cohort."
