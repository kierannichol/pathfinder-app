name: "Urban Barbarian"
description: "Every barbarian knows that city life can soften the spirit and the body,\
  \ but some barbarians take on the trappings and ways of their adoptive homes and\
  \ bend their savage powers to its challenges. While these urban barbarians' rough\
  \ edges are smoothed into civility, they can use their primal nature and upbringing\
  \ to move with the ebb and flow of civilization's natural rhythms."

  type: null
  description: "When an urban barbarian rages, instead of making a normal rage she\
    \ applies a +4 morale bonus to her Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. This\
    \ bonus increases to +6 when she gains greater rage and +8 when she gains mighty\
    \ rage. She may apply the full bonus to one ability score or may split the bonus\
    \ between several scores in increments of +2. When using a controlled rage, an\
    \ urban barbarian gains no bonus on Will saves, takes no penalties to AC, and\
    \ can still use Intelligence-, Dexterity-, and Charisma-based skills.\nThis ability\
    \ alters rage."
