  description: "At 1st level, as a standard action, a Contemplative can touch a creature\
    \ to grant it a temporary ki point until the beginning of the Contemplative's\
    \ next turn. In addition to any other ways in which the target can use ki, it\
    \ can expend the ki point as a swift action in order to either gain a +2 dodge\
    \ bonus to AC for 1 round or increase its base speed by 20 feet for 1 round. The\
    \ Contemplative can target himself with this ability as a swift action, but doing\
    \ so costs 2 uses of the ability.\nAt 4th level, the dodge bonus to AC increases\
    \ to +4. At 8th level, an affected creature can spend the ki point to ignore all\
    \ Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution penalties it would otherwise take for\
    \ 1 round. At 12th level, an Contemplative can target two adjacent creatures with\
    \ this ability as a standard action, but must expend one use of the ability for\
    \ each target affected. At 16th level, an affected creature can spend this ki\
    \ point to roll all saving throws twice and take the higher result for 1 round.\
    \ At 20th level, an affected creature can spend the ki point to benefit from the\
    \ Contemplative's perfect self class ability for 1 round. If the creature already\
    \ has the perfect self class feature, its damage reduction and any spell resistance\
    \ it has increases by 2 for 1 round.\nA Contemplative can use this ability a number\
    \ of times per day equal to his class level, but no more than once per round."
