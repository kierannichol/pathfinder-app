  description: "At 1st level, a hidden priest is able to disguise his cleric spellcasting,\
    \ presenting it as arcane magic of some kind. Typically, this is as alchemist,\
    \ bard, sorcerer, or wizard magic, and the cleric disguises the words and gestures\
    \ of the cleric spell with accoutrements appropriate to his apparent profession.\n\
    He must make a skill check (DC 10 + twice the level of the spell) to disguise\
    \ his casting and successfully cast the spell. The type of skill check depends\
    \ on the type of caster he pretends to be: Craft (alchemy) for alchemist, Perform\
    \ for bard, Knowledge (arcana) for sorcerer or wizard. Using Spellcraft to identify\
    \ the spell works normally, though unless the observer beats the DC by 10 or more,\
    \ she doesn't suspect the source of the magic is divine.\nFor example, a hidden\
    \ priest pretending to be an alchemist wants to cast cure light wounds on a wounded\
    \ townsperson. If he makes a DC 12 Craft (alchemy) check, he disguises his spellcasting\
    \ as the mixing of an alchemical extract or potion (perhaps with the words disguised\
    \ as reciting an obscure formula or talking herself through the list of ingredients),\
    \ which he gives to the target. An observer making a DC 16 Spellcraft check can\
    \ identify his spell as cure light wounds, but doesn't realize his â€œalchemical\"\
    methods are a sham unless her check result is 26 or higher.\nWhen the hidden priest\
    \ uses this ability, he must still provide any divine focus components for the\
    \ spells he casts. However, the divine focus doesn't need to be an obvious symbol\
    \ of his faith. It could be a small coin, tattoo, or garment bearing the symbol,\
    \ whether presented openly, disguised, or hidden within a larger picture.\nFor\
    \ example, a hidden priest of a god of dawn or light could use a coin with an\
    \ ankh or sunburst, a complex tattoo or scar that has an ankh shape hidden within\
    \ it, a glove with an ankh stitched on the inside of the palm, and so on. He must\
    \ use this replacement divine focus just as he would his true one (for example,\
    \ he couldn't leave the coin in his shoe). If a spell requires a divine focus\
    \ with a specific or minimum cost, the replacement divine focus must be of similar\
    \ value to be used as the divine focus.\nA hidden priest adds half his class level\
    \ (minimum +1) on all Bluff skill checks to send secret messages about religious\
    \ matters, and on all Sense Motive checks to recognize similar messages. He also\
    \ adds this bonus on Perception and Sense Motive checks relating to agents of\
    \ the laws against his religion (including city guards in lands where these laws\
    \ are in effect)."

  description: "At 8th level, a hidden priest can apply the Silent Spell and Still\
    \ Spell feats to a spell he is about to cast. This does not alter the level of\
    \ the spell or the casting time. He can use this ability once per day at 8th level\
    \ and one additional time per day for every four additional cleric levels beyond\
    \ 8th. Even though this ability does not modify the spell's actual level, he cannot\
    \ use this ability to cast a spell whose modified spell level would be above the\
    \ level of the highest-level spell that he is capable of casting. This ability\
    \ always applies both feats (the cleric cannot use it to just apply one or the\
    \ other)."
