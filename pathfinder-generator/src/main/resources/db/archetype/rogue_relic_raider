  description: "At 8th level, a relic raider can attempt to disable a curse as she\
    \ would a magical trap. This ability acts as remove curse, except instead of a\
    \ caster level check, the relic raider attempts a Disable Device check (DC = 15\
    \ + the DC of the curse). Disabling a curse takes 2d4 rounds, and the relic raider\
    \ cannot take 10 or 20 on this check. A relic raider can use this ability once\
    \ per day at 8th level. At 12th level and every 4 rogue levels thereafter, a relic\
    \ raider can use disable curse one additional time per day."
