  description: "At 3rd level, a cinderwalker gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks\
    \ and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks when in\
    \ volcanic or geothermally active areas. Such areas include calderas, hot springs,\
    \ lava plains, and volcanically formed hills or mountains. In addition, the cinderwalker\
    \ adds this bonus on any ability checks, saving throws, or skill checks to avoid\
    \ geothermal or volcanic hazards. The cinderwalker can choose to improve this\
    \ bonus in place of improving a favored terrain bonus. A cinderwalker traveling\
    \ through volcanic or geothermally active areas leaves no trail and cannot be\
    \ tracked (though he can leave a trail if he chooses)."
