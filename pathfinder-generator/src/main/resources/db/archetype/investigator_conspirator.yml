  description: "Conspirators find their skill sets firmly aligned with the goals of\
    \ the criminal underworld. At 1st level, a conspirator can use inspiration on\
    \ any Bluff, Disable Device, Disguise, Intimidate, and Sleight of Hand check without\
    \ expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill, instead\
    \ of on any Knowledge, Linguistics, and Spellcraft check. He can later choose\
    \ to trade an investigator talent for the ability to use inspiration on any Knowledge,\
    \ Linguistics, and Spellcraft check without expending a use of inspiration, provided\
    \ he is trained in the skill. A conspirator adds half his investigator level (minimum\
    \ 1) on Bluff checks to appear innocent and on Disguise checks."

  description: "At 3rd level, a conspirator is able to sense when someone else is\
    \ watching him. He gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to notice scrying sensors,\
    \ prying eyes, and other magical effects used to watch him, as well as on Perception\
    \ checks to act on the surprise round. This bonus increases by 1 at 6th level\
    \ and every 3 investigator levels thereafter.\nAdditionally, at 7th level, if\
    \ a scrying sensor is invisible, the invisibility does not increase the DC of\
    \ the conspirator's Perception check to notice it, regardless of whether or not\
    \ he is using an ability that allows him to see invisible things. The DC for his\
    \ Perception check is equal to 20 + the spell's level (with no +20 increase to\
    \ the Perception DC for a moving invisible sensor or no +40 increase for an immobile\
    \ invisible sensor)."
