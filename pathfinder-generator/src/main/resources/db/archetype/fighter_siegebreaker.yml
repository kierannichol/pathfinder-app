    \ maneuvers without provoking attacks of opportunity. When he performs either\
    \ combat maneuver, he deals an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to his Strength\
    \ bonus (minimum 1). If he has Improved Bull Rush or Improved Overrun, the damage\
    \ dealt by the appropriate maneuver increases by 2 and he adds any enhancement\
    \ bonus from his armor or shield (though such enhancement bonuses do not stack,\
    \ if both armor and shield are magic)."
