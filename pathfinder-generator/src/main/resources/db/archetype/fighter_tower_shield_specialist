description: "Many fighters believe the tower shield is a tool suitable only for troops\
  \ on the battlefield, claiming it is too large and bulky to use in skirmishes or\
  \ within dungeon corridors. tower shield specialists defy those notions, using their\
  \ massive shields with startling skill and incredible effect. They use these seemingly\
  \ clumsy shields to perform deft maneuvers that confound their enemies."
