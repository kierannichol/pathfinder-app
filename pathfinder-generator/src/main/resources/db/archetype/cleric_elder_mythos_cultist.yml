  description: "At 1st level, when an Elder Mythos cultist channels energy, he taps\
    \ into the unthinkable void between the stars. This is similar to channeling negative\
    \ energy, but instead of healing undead, this blast of energy harms and devours\
    \ living beings, corporeal non-skeletal undead, and constructs crafted from flesh\
    \ (such as flesh golems). This is not negative energy damage; instead, the damage\
    \ manifests in the form of wounds from supernatural deterioration and rot. A creature\
    \ that would take damage from this energy can attempt a Fortitude save to halve\
    \ the damage, rather than a Will save. At 8th level, a creature that both fails\
    \ the Fortitude save and would be killed or destroyed by this effect is entirely\
    \ disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature's\
    \ equipment is unaffected. This ability still counts as channel energy, but it\
    \ counts as neither positive nor negative energy specifically (for example, the\
    \ Elder Mythos cultist couldn't take the Turn Undead or Command Undead feat).\n\
    For the purposes of feats that require channel energy but refer to what happens\
    \ if the character channels positive or negative energy, this ability alters the\
    \ listed effect for negative energy. For instance, an Elder Mythos cultist could\
    \ use Channel Smite to damage living or fleshy creatures with his melee attack."

  name: "Maddening Gaze"
  label: null
  type: null
  description: "At 5th level, as a standard action, an Elder Mythos cultist can focus\
    \ his gaze on a single living creature within 30 feet and inundate the creature's\
    \ mind with visions of alien horror. The target takes 2 points of Wisdom damage\
    \ and becomes confused and sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save (DC\
    \ = 10 + 1/2 the Elder Mythos cultist's cleric level + his Charisma modifier)\
    \ negates the Wisdom damage and the confusion effect, though the target is sickened\
    \ for 1 round. This gaze attack is a mind-affecting effect. An Elder Mythos cultist\
    \ can use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus an additional time per\
    \ day for every 3 cleric levels thereafter.\nAt 11th level, the target takes 1d6+1\
    \ points of Wisdom damage and is confused and sickened for 2d4 rounds. A successful\
    \ Will save reduces the Wisdom damage to 1 point, and the target is instead sickened\
    \ for 1d6 rounds.\nAt 19th level, the target takes 2d6 points of Wisdom damage\
    \ and is rendered permanently confused and sickened. Only greater restoration,\
    \ heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish can remove the confused and sickened conditions.\n\
    A successful Will save halves the Wisdom damage, and the target is instead sickened\
    \ for 2d6 rounds."
