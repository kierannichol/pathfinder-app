  description: "A demagogue gains the following type of bardic performance:\nGather\
    \ Crowd (Ex): At 5th level, the demagogue gains the ability to quickly gather\
    \ a crowd. This is identical to the gather crowd ability of the celebrity bard\
    \ archetype.\nThis ability replaces lore master.\nIncite Violence (Ex): At 6th\
    \ level, the demagogue can use his performance to fan the fury of a crowd of people\
    \ he has fascinated. Using this ability does not disrupt the fascinate effect,\
    \ but does require a standard action to activate (in addition to the free action\
    \ to continue the fascinate effect). The bard selects a number of targets equal\
    \ to his level, who must make Will saves (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's\
    \ Charisma modifier) or be affected by rage for a number of rounds equal to the\
    \ bard's level. The bard indicates who is the intended target of violence (either\
    \ after using this ability or as part of the performance leading to it) and the\
    \ enraged members of the crowd immediately attack the target if possible. The\
    \ target does not need to be present (“kill the king\" is a suitable choice) and\
    \ can be an object instead of a person (“destroy the prison!\"is likewise appropriate).\
    \ Other members of the crowd may follow suit, though they do not gain the benefits\
    \ of rage. This is a sound-based effect and is affected by countersong. If two\
    \ or more bards are attempting to direct the crowd against different targets,\
    \ they must make opposed Charisma checks, with the crowd following the directions\
    \ of the winner.\nThis ability replaces suggestion.\nRighteous Cause (Ex): At\
    \ 18th level, the demagogue can lift a crowd's emotions and turn them toward a\
    \ common purpose. First, he must fascinate the crowd, and then use incite violence\
    \ without designating a target, at which point he can use righteous cause. Instead\
    \ of driving the crowd with anger, he fills them with purpose. Fascinated creatures\
    \ must make Will saves (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma modifier)\
    \ to resist. Those who fail are affected by mass suggestion of a plausible idea\
    \ that lingers with them for one day. Typical uses of this ability are to spark\
    \ rebellion, overthrow a king, build a beneficial structure such as an orphanage,\
    \ or donate money to a cause."
