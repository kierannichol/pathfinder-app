    name: "Aeromantic Concoction"
    description: "An aerochemist learns to craft a special alchemical concoction. It
      takes 10 minutes to brew a dose of this concoction, and once brewed, it
      remains potent until used. An aerochemist can maintain only 1 dose of this
      concoction at a time--if he brews a second dose, any existing concoction
      becomes inert. As with an extract or bomb, an aeromantic concoction that
      is not in the aerochemist's possession becomes inert until he picks it up
      again. Anyone other than the aerochemist who attempts to drink his
      aeromantic concoction is affected in the same fashion as is a
      non-alchemist who drinks an alchemist's mutagen.

      When consumed, an aerochemist's aeromantic concoction makes his body
      become incredibly buoyant for 10 minutes per alchemist level. The
      concoction grants the aerochemist a +5 bonus on Acrobatics checks to
      attempt high jumps or long jumps, and he is always treated as having a
      running start when attempting long jumps. In addition, the aerochemist
      gains the benefits of feather fall for the concoction's duration. At 6th
      level, the aerochemist gains the benefits of fly for the concoction's
      duration. At 10th level, the aerochemist can choose to gain the benefits
      of air walk instead of fly for the concoction's duration. At 14th level,
      the duration of the concoction increases to 1 hour per alchemist level.

      An aerochemist with the infusion discovery can instead create a shared
      alchemical concoction intended for his allies. This shared concoction
      grants the same benefits as the normal aeromantic concoction, except the
      duration is only 1 minute per alchemist level its creator has. At 14th
      level, the duration increases to 10 minutes per alchemist level. An
      aerochemist can have only a standard concoction or shared concoction in
      effect, not both."

    description: "At 2nd level, an aerochemist becomes an expert at attacking from
      above. He gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls made with thrown weapons
      against targets that are at least 10 feet below him. This bonus increases
      to +2 at 6th level, and increases by an additional 1 every 4 levels
      thereafter, to a maximum bonus of +5 at 18th level."
