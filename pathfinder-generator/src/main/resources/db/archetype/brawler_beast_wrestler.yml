  description: "At 3rd level, a beast-wrestler selects a creature type from the ranger\
    \ favored enemies table. The only humanoid subtype the beast-wrestler can select\
    \ is giant. She gains a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to her CMD against\
    \ creatures of the type she selected.\nAt 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, the\
    \ beast-wrestler can select an additional type of creature. In addition, at each\
    \ such interval the bonuses against any one type of creature she's chosen (including\
    \ the one just selected, if so desired) increase by 2. If a specific creature\
    \ falls into more than one category, the beast-wrestler's bonuses don't stack;\
    \ she simply uses whichever bonus is higher."
