description: "A tribal fighter knows that it is not the weapon that matters but the\
  \ hand that wields it. Instead of encasing himself in metal armor like the soldiers\
  \ fighting and dying for the so-called civilized lands do, he prefers to wear something\
  \ he or his ancestors have killed. These relics and trophies help the tribal fighter\
  \ attain a battle focus that allows him to perform incredible feats of violence\
  \ with the simplest of weapons."

    \ tribal weapons so effortlessly that they are almost extensions of his arms.\
    \ He gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. For the purpose of meeting\
    \ the prerequisites of style feats and feats that have style feats as prerequisites,\
    \ the tribal fighter counts as having a number of skill ranks equal to his fighter\
    \ level in all skills in which he is trained."

  description: "At 5th level, when a tribal fighter gains the weapon training ability,\
    \ he must choose the tribal weapon group and doesn't later gain additional weapon\
    \ groups, though the weapon training bonus for tribal weapons still improves at\
    \ 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Additionally, if the tribal fighter\
    \ has combat feats that apply to a specific weapon type (such as Improved Critical\
    \ or Weapon Focus) and he has selected a weapon that belongs to the tribal weapon\
    \ group, he can apply the benefits of that feat to all weapons that belong to\
    \ the tribal weapon group that would legally apply (for instance, a feat that\
    \ applies only to throwing weapons wouldn't apply to greatclubs). This benefit\
    \ applies only to feats selected as fighter bonus feats."
