    \ receive a +1 bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities\
    \ for a number of rounds equal to his warpriest level. This is a sacred bonus\
    \ if the warpriest is good-aligned or able to spontaneously cast cure spells,\
    \ and a profane bonus if the warpriest is evil-aligned or able to spontaneously\
    \ cast inflict spells. Using this ability consumes two uses of his fervor ability.\
    \ At 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the bonus granted by mystic interference\
    \ increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level)."
