description: "Witchguards are the sworn defenders of the witches of the north. Although\
  \ the witches are spellcasters of immense power, even they cannot defend themselves\
  \ against every attack. Witchguards dedicate their lives to protecting their charges,\
  \ and they gain some arcane knowledge in return. They are trained to work closely\
  \ with witches and defend their charges from harm. Witchguards learn magical abilities\
  \ from the same patrons that grant witches their powers, though they can use their\
  \ abilities to protect any kind of spellcaster, not just a witch. A witchguard is\
  \ ready to face any foe that might threaten his charge, and he is ever prepared\
  \ to lay down his life to protect the life of the person he is sworn to defend."

  description: "At 4th level, a witchguard forms a bond with a spellcaster he has\
    \ sworn to defend. Once per day, this bond allows the witchguard to spend a move\
    \ action to grant an adjacent spellcaster a +2 dodge bonus to AC and a +2 circumstance\
    \ bonus on concentration checks.\nAt 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter,\
    \ these bonuses increase by 2. The bonuses last for a number of rounds equal to\
    \ the witchguard's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).\nAt 4th level and every 3 levels\
    \ thereafter, the witchguard can use this ability one additional time per day."
