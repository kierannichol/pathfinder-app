  description: "At 2nd level, a spellblade magus can sacrifice a prepared magus spell\
    \ of 1st level or higher as a swift action to create a dagger of force in his\
    \ off hand. The athame lasts for 1 minute or until dismissed, has an enhancement\
    \ bonus on attack and damage rolls equal to the level of the spell sacrificed\
    \ (maximum +5), and is considered a weapon the spellblade is holding for purposes\
    \ of his arcane pool feature (using the pool to add abilities to a held weapon\
    \ applies to the magus's physical weapon and to the athame for no additional cost).\
    \ The athame acts as a dagger, but the hand holding it is still considered free\
    \ for the purpose of casting spells and delivering touch attacks. The magus can\
    \ use the athame as if he were fighting with two weapons, or can use that hand\
    \ to cast spells as part of the spell combat class ability (but not both in the\
    \ same round). Attacks with the athame are force attacks and deal force damage."
