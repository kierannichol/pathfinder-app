  description: "At 3rd level, once per day when the banishing warden confirms a critical\
    \ hit against a target of her smite evil effect, she can attempt to forcibly banish\
    \ the target to its home plane. The creature struck must succeed at a Will save\
    \ (DC = 10 + half the banishing warden's level + the banishing warden's Charisma\
    \ modifier) or be sent back to its home plane as per dismissal. At 10th level,\
    \ a creature dismissed in this manner takes an amount of damage equal to 2 points\
    \ per paladin level at the start of its next turn. The banishing warden gains\
    \ an additional daily use of this ability at 9th and 15th level."
