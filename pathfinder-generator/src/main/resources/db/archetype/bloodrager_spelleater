  description: "A spelleater's blood empowers him to slowly recover from his wounds.\
    \ At 2nd level, while bloodraging a spelleater gains fast healing 1. At 7th level\
    \ and every 3 levels thereafter, this increases by 1 (to a maximum of fast healing\
    \ 6 at 19th level). If the spelleater gains an increase to damage reduction from\
    \ a bloodline, feat, or other ability, he is considered to have an effective damage\
    \ reduction of 0, and the increase is added to this effective damage reduction."
