  description: "At 3rd level, a serpent herald can call down his herald's features\
    \ onto his allies. Allies affected by the serpent herald's inspired rage ability\
    \ gain a serpentine aspect of the serpent herald's choice (all affected allies\
    \ gain the same aspect). The serpent herald may choose from the following aspects:\
    \ movement (+8 competence bonus on Climb and Swim checks, and targets can take\
    \ 10 on these checks even when rushed or threatened), scales (+2 natural armor\
    \ bonus), senses (low-light vision and scent), or a natural bite attack (1d4 damage\
    \ for a Medium creature plus poison [bite--injury; save Fortitude DC 10 + half\
    \ the serpent herald's class level + his Constitution modifier; frequency 1/round\
    \ for 6 rounds; effect 1 Constitution damage, cure 1 save]). This is a polymorph\
    \ effect; a creature under another polymorph effect, such as wild shape, does\
    \ not gain the aspect. If the serpent herald grants one of these aspects to himself,\
    \ he also gains the ability to speak with animals (reptiles and creatures with\
    \ the aquatic subtype only) for as long as he has the aspect. The serpent herald\
    \ must have the inspired rage raging song to use this ability."

  description: "At 5th level, a serpent herald gains the ability to use wild shape\
    \ to take the form of a reptile or an aquatic animal once per day, as the druid\
    \ class feature. His effective druid level for this ability is equal to his serpent\
    \ herald level – 1. This doesn't allow him to assume other forms, such as elementals\
    \ or other kinds of animals. When in animal form, the serpent herald is treated\
    \ as able to speak normally for the purpose of using raging song, but not for\
    \ using other abilities that require speech (such as spellcasting).\nAt 11th level,\
    \ a serpent herald can use this ability twice per day and gains the benefits of\
    \ the Wild Speech feat while using this ability, treating his druid level as his\
    \ serpent herald level – 1.\nAt 17th level, a serpent herald can use this ability\
    \ three times per day. In addition, he gains the supernatural resiliency of a\
    \ linnorm, gaining the effects of freedom of movement while using this ability.\n\
    This ability replaces spell kenning."
