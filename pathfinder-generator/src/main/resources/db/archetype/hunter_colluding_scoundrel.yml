  description: "A colluding scoundrel is adept at redirecting a foe's hostility toward\
    \ another creature, creating openings for her own attacks. A number of times per\
    \ day equal to her hunter level, as a swift action, she can target one foe within\
    \ 30 feet and designate one willing ally adjacent to that foe as a scapegoat.\
    \ For the following minute, the target takes a –2 penalty on attacks against any\
    \ creature other than the designated scapegoat, and the target has a 10% spell\
    \ failure chance on spells that don't target the scapegoat or include the scapegoat\
    \ in their area of effect. The penalty increases to –4 at 8th level and –6 at\
    \ 15th level.\nThe colluding scoundrel can designate her animal companion as a\
    \ scapegoat without it counting against her daily uses of this ability.\nThis\
    \ is a mind-affecting effect. The effect ends if the colluding scoundrel falls\
    \ unconscious or is slain."

    \ targets. As a standard action, she can make a single attack against a foe that\
    \ is taking the penalties of her scapegoat ability and is adjacent to an ally\
    \ currently designated as the scapegoat.\nIf the attack hits, the target takes\
    \ damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half\
    \ the colluding scoundrel's level + her Wisdom modifier) or be slain. Whether\
    \ or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by\
    \ any colluding scoundrel) for 24 hours."
