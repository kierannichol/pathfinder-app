description: "River soul oracles derive their powers from their bonds with rivers,\
  \ whether these waterways are rapid cascades or lazy channels plied by boats. The\
  \ powerful bond formed with a river is also the river soul oracle's curse, as he\
  \ must always carry water from the river with him, and his fate is bound to it.\
  \ River soul oracles can be gentle and still when calm, but they're raging torrents\
  \ when angered."

    \ from the river you are bound to at all times. If the vessel is destroyed or\

    \ or use your supernatural or spell-like class abilities until you recover the\
    \ vessel or fill a new one with water from the river to which you are bound. Once\
    \ per month, you can bond with a different river in a ceremony at that river that\
    \ takes 12 hours to complete. You lose your bond with the previous river in the\

  description: "A river soul oracle must take the following revelations at the listed\
    \ levels.\nRiver Flow (Su) At 1st level, as a free action while you are underwater,\
    \ you can negate the penalties you take for making bludgeoning, piercing, and\
    \ slashing melee attacks underwater. You can use this ability a number of rounds\
    \ per day equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The rounds do not have\
    \ to be used consecutively. River Form (Su) At 11th level, you can become one\
    \ with a river. Once a day as a standard action, while immersed in a river, you\
    \ can completely merge with it. Your body and all your gear meld into the water,\
    \ as per meld into stone, except abilities that control or shape water expel you\
    \ and deal you 5d6 damage rather than abilities that control or shape stone. You\
    \ travel along with the river at the rate it is currently moving. You can remain\
    \ in this form a number of hours equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier (minimum\
    \ 1). Transforming back to your normal form is a swift action. River Soul Revelation\
    \ (Su) At 20th level, you strengthen your ties to the river with which you bonded.\
    \ While traveling on or immersed in the river, you gain fast healing 10 and immunity\
    \ to bleed, death attacks, exhaustion, fatigue, nausea effects, negative levels,\
    \ and sickened effects. Additionally, if you are slain and your body or some part\
    \ of your body (including your ashes, if applicable) is floated down the river\
    \ in a specially prepared vessel costing 5,000 gp, you return to life as per resurrection\
    \ once you reach the mouth of the river, as long as the trip has taken 24 hours\
    \ or longer."
