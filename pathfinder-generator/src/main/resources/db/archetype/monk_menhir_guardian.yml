  type: null
  description: "At 1st level, a menhir guardian can channel his ki into a devastating\
    \ strike that repels his enemies. A menhir guardian must declare that he is using\
    \ rebuking strike before making a natural attack with his claws. On a hit, a foe\
    \ damaged by the menhir guardian's claws must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw\
    \ (DC = 10 + half the menhir guardian's level + his Wisdom modifier) or be pushed\
    \ back 5 feet directly away from the menhir guardian, plus an additional 5 feet\
    \ for every 4 levels the menhir guardian has beyond 1st. If this movement would\
    \ be blocked by a solid object, the target of rebuking strike takes 1d6 points\
    \ of damage per 10 feet moved and falls prone at the end of the movement.\nAt\
    \ 5th level, a creature that fails its save against a menhir guardian's rebuking\
    \ strike also has its speed reduced by half for a number of rounds equal to the\
    \ menhir guardian's level.\nAt 15th level, a creature that fails its save is also\
    \ affected by aversion, making it avoid the menhir guardian's current location\
    \ for 1 round per level the menhir guardian has.\nThe menhir guardian can attempt\
    \ a rebuking strike a number of times per day equal to his monk level but only\
    \ once per round."
