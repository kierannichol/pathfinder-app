description: "Vikings seek to raid â€œsofter societies\"and return with their longships\
  \ filled with plunder. A viking strikes fear into the heart of her foes, and in\
  \ battle she can fly into a terrible rage. Many vikings wear the pelts of bears\
  \ or wolves, drawing on the strength and ferocity of these beasts in battle. Vikings\
  \ do not wear heavy armor, but they are skilled at fighting with an axe or spear\
  \ in conjunction with a shield."
