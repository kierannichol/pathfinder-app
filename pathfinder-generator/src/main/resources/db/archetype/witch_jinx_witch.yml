  description: "At 2nd level, a jinx witch learns to absorb (or â€œeat\") antagonistic\
    \ magical effects targeting her. If a jinx witch succeeds at a Will or Fortitude\
    \ saving throw that negates a hostile spell effect, she can consume the spell\
    \ energy as an immediate action. The witch treats her caster level as 1 higher\
    \ when casting the next prepared spell she casts after eating a jinx in this manner.\
    \ If the spell cast is of the same school as the eaten spell, the witch instead\
    \ treats her caster level as 2 higher. A jinx witch can store only one eaten spell\
    \ at a time, and can use this ability a number of times each day equal to 3 +\
    \ her Intelligence modifier. If the jinx witch uses this ability to eat a spell\
    \ that targets more than one creature or that creates an area of effect, it uses\
    \ 2 of her daily uses of the ability and all other targets or creatures in the\
    \ area of effect receive a +2 bonus on their respective saving throws. If the\
    \ jinx witch does not use the bonus provided by an eaten spell within 1 hour,\
    \ the stored energy dissipates harmlessly."

    \ also gains the ability to cast the eaten spell as a spell-like ability, using\
    \ her witch level as her caster level and her Intelligence modifier to determine\
    \ the spell-like ability's saving throw DC. If the eaten spell is not on her spell\
    \ list or is of a spell level higher than the witch is capable of casting herself,\
    \ she must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + the spell's level) in order\
    \ to cast it; failing this check results in the loss of the spell-like ability\
    \ with no effect."
