  description: "At 3rd level, a galvanic saboteur can dodge the precise attacks of\
    \ even the most technologically advanced foes. The ranger gains a luck bonus to\
    \ AC against attacks that target his touch AC as long as his opponent's type matches\
    \ that of his first favored enemy. This luck bonus is equal to 1/2 the ranger's\
    \ favored enemy bonus against that creature type. At 8th, 13th, and 18th levels,\
    \ the ranger gains this luck bonus to AC against attacks that target touch his\
    \ AC as long as his opponent's type matches his second, third, and fourth favored\
    \ enemy, respectively. A galvanic saboteur's animal companion (if he chose one\
    \ for his hunter's bond) also gains this luck bonus."

  description: "At 8th level, the galvanic saboteur has gathered enough parts and\
    \ scrap from his constructed enemies that he can infuse some of his attacks with\
    \ a bit of their alien energy. Once per day as a standard action, the ranger can\
    \ make a static strike as a melee attack at his full base attack bonus. If the\
    \ attack hits, it deals an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage and the\
    \ ranger can make an additional attack at his full base attack bonus against a\
    \ foe that is adjacent to the previous foe and still within his reach, as if he\
    \ had Cleave, except he doesn't take a –2 penalty to his AC and the second attack\
    \ deals an additional 2d6 points of electricity damage.\nAt 12th level, the ranger\
    \ can continue to make attacks against adjacent creatures, as if he had Greater\
    \ Cleave, with each hit increasing the amount of electricity damage dealt to the\
    \ next foe in line.\nThe ranger can use this ability twice per day at 14th level\
    \ and three times per day at 20th level."
