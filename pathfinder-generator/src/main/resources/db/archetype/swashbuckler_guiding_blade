  description: "A guiding blade uses her panache to inspire her allies to heights\
    \ of teamwork they could never reach alone. At 1st level, a guiding blade gains\
    \ a bonus teamwork feat. She gains an additional teamwork feat at 4th level and\
    \ every 4 swashbuckler levels thereafter.\nAs a standard action, she can spend\
    \ 1 panache point to grant a teamwork feat she gained from this ability to all\
    \ allies within 30 feet who can see and hear her. They do not need to meet the\
    \ feat's prerequisites. She can use this ability multiple times to grant multiple\
    \ teamwork feats. This ability lasts for 3 rounds + 1 round for every 2 swashbuckler\
    \ levels she has, but if the guiding blade ever fails to have at least 1 panache\
    \ point, all of these durations end immediately. At 7th level, the guiding blade\
    \ can activate this ability as a swift action. At 15th level, she can grant two\
    \ teamwork feats each time she activates this ability, and she can grant any teamwork\
    \ feats she possesses, not just the teamwork feats she gained from this ability.\n\
    A guiding blade regains panache whenever an ally reduces a creature to 0 or fewer\
    \ hit points, instead of when she herself does so. She still doesn't regain panache\
    \ from unattended objects, helpless or unaware creatures, or opponents with low\
    \ Hit Dice."

  description: "At 3rd level, a guiding blade learns how to use her weapon to interfere\
    \ with enemies' attacks, protecting her allies from peril. As long as the guiding\
    \ blade is wearing light or no armor, whenever she is aware of an attack against\
    \ an adjacent ally and would not herself be denied her Dexterity bonus against\
    \ that attack, the guiding blade grants that ally a +1 bonus to AC against that\
    \ attack.\nFor example, if an invisible enemy attacks a guiding blade's ally and\
    \ the guiding blade can't see that enemy, she would not grant the bonus from interfering\
    \ blade unless she had the uncanny dodge ability. This bonus does not stack with\
    \ any bonus to AC the guiding blade provides with the aid another action. The\
    \ bonus increases by 1 for every 4 swashbuckler levels beyond 3rd, to a maximum\
    \ of +5 at 19th level."

  description: "A guiding blade receives the following deed.\nOpportune Redirection\
    \ and Riposte (Ex): At 3rd level, when an opponent threatening both the guiding\
    \ blade and an adjacent ally attacks that ally, the guiding blade can spend 1\
    \ point of panache and expend a use of an attack of opportunity to attempt to\
    \ redirect the attack to herself. The guiding blade makes an attack roll as if\
    \ she were making an attack of opportunity; for each size category the attacking\
    \ creature is larger than the guiding blade, the guiding blade takes a â€“2 penalty\
    \ on this roll. If her result is greater than the attacking creature's attack\
    \ result, the creature's attack is redirected to the guiding blade instead of\
    \ the guiding blade's adjacent ally. The guiding blade must declare the use of\
    \ this ability after the creature's attack is announced but before its attack\
    \ roll is made. Upon performing a successful redirection, if the guiding blade\
    \ has at least 1 panache point, the guiding blade can, as an immediate action,\
    \ make an attack against the creature whose attack she redirected, provided that\
    \ creature is within reach. A guiding blade can't select opportune redirection\
    \ and riposte as a signature deed."
