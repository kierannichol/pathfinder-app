  description: "A draconic shaman gains a drake companion instead of a spirit animal,\
    \ and she communes with the drake to prepare her spells just as other shamans\
    \ commune with their spirit animals. She doesn't gain a primary spirit, but she\
    \ still gains wandering spirit at 4th level. She must select all her hexes (other\
    \ than her wandering hexes) from the list of shaman hexes, and she can't select\
    \ the witch hex shaman hex. She doesn't gain spirit magic slots until 4th level\
    \ when she gains her wandering spirit. Any ability granted by a wandering spirit\
    \ that would normally affect a spirit animal (such as nature's true spirit ability)\
    \ has no effect for a draconic shaman."
