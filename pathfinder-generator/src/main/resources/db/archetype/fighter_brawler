description: "All melee is up close and personal, but some warriors bring it as close\
  \ as they can get. Brawlers can be found anywhere, among all races and societies.\
  \ A brawler could be hired muscle in a tavern, a local crime syndicate enforcer,\
  \ or a hotheaded recruit among the ranks of a baron's guard. Often brawlers' in-your-face\
  \ attitudes are as powerful as their tactics."
