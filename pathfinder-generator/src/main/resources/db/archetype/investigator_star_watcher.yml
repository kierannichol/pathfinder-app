description: "Star watchers study the movements and positions of the sun, the moon,\
  \ and the stars, searching for secrets written in the sky. They use a combination\
  \ of scientific study and esoteric arts to measure, record, and predict astronomical\
  \ cycles and their effects on nature, such as the moon's influence on tides and\
  \ rivers. Some star watchers also use these observations to predict fate and significant\
  \ events, such as natural disasters."

  description: "A star watcher studies a symbolic language of the heavens known as\
    \ astrology. Equal parts art form and science, astrology can be used to read the\
    \ future and affect it in subtle ways. Much like an alchemist or investigator,\
    \ a star watcher collects formulae in a formula book. However, the formulae resemble\
    \ star charts, and unlike alchemists or normal investigators, he uses these formulae\
    \ along with personal details and astronomical measurements to make horoscopes--magical\
    \ calculations stored much like scrolls--in which he can store spells. In many\
    \ ways, the star watcher's horoscopes function like extracts, with the following\
    \ exceptions.\nA star watcher's horoscope is always keyed to a specific creature\
    \ that must be willing and present when the star watcher prepares the horoscope.\
    \ Only the creature to which a horoscope is keyed can activate it and be affected\
    \ by it. A horoscope is â€œcast\"by reading it as a standard action, though a star\
    \ watcher can draw and read a horoscope as a single standard action.\nA star watcher\
    \ doesn't gain a competence bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks to create alchemical\
    \ items, and he cannot identify potions with that skill. Furthermore, a star watcher\
    \ cannot select alchemist discoveries as investigator talents. A star watcher\
    \ can study a wizard's spellbook or alchemist's formula book to learn formulae,\
    \ but a star watcher's formula book is too esoteric for anyone except another\
    \ star watcher to learn spells from."
