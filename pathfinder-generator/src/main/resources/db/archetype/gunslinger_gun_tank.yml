description: "Gunslingers usually don't use heavy armor, but there are a few who
  use and modify their armor to protect themselves from both traditional weapons
  and gunfire. These gun tanks trundle into battle with barrels blazing, dealing
  out punishment with their firearms while knowing few can penetrate their hard
  protective shells."

    name: "Gun Tank's Resolve"
    description: "At 1st level, the gun tank can shrug off the most serious of
      attacks. When the gun tank is wearing medium or heavy armor and is subject
      to a critical hit or sneak attack, she can spend 1 grit point as an
      immediate action to attempt to negate the critical hit or sneak attack
      damage. At 1st level, she has a 25% chance of doing so. At 10th level, the
      chance increases to 50%. At 15th level, the chance increases to 75%. While
      a gun tank's resolve does not stack with the fortification armor special
      ability, it does work in concert with that armor special ability or
      similar effects, so a gun tank can use this ability even after the armor
      of fortification has failed to negate the critical hit or sneak attack
      damage.

      This deed replaces the Gunslinger's Dodge deed."

    description: "At 15th level, when the gun tank has at least 1 grit point and
      makes a successful Fortitude saving throw against an attack that would
      deal half damage or have a partial effect, she takes no damage or other
      effects from that attack. Furthermore, she gains a +2 bonus on all saving
      throws against fear and mind-affecting effects.

      This deed replaces the evasive deed."

    name: "Bullet Deflection"
    description: "A gun tank is adept at modifying and using her armor to stop
      firearm attacks. Starting at 2nd level, a gun tank wearing medium or heavy
      armor gains half the armor's bonus plus the armor's enhancement bonus (if
      any) as a deflection bonus against any non-siege firearm or splash weapon
      attack (including the alchemist's bomb class ability; Advanced Player's
      Guide 28). This ability has no affect on spells, spell-like abilities, or
      supernatural abilities that make a touch attack.

      This ability replaces nimble."

    name: "Armor Training"
    description: "At 4th level, a gun tank learns to be more maneuverable while
      wearing armor. Whenever she is wearing armor, the armor check penalty is
      reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed
      by her armor increases by 1. Every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and
      16th), the bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of a â€“4 reduction of the
      armor check penalty and a +4 increase to the maximum Dexterity bonus
      allowed. This ability stacks with the fighter class ability of the same
      name. If the gun tank has both class features, she takes the most
      advantageous benefit of the two class features."
