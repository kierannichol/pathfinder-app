    \ speed). Instead of the +8 bonus granted by a swim speed, she gains a racial\
    \ bonus on Swim checks equal to 4 + half her rogue level (if she has a racial\
    \ swim speed, she uses the better bonus). She gains a bonus on Bluff checks equal\
    \ to half her rogue level. At 3rd level, she gains a +1 bonus on Will saves whenever\
    \ she is underwater; this bonus increases by 1 at 6th level and every 3 levels\

    \ of liquids to disrupt certain foes. She can deal sneak attack damage to oozes\
    \ and creatures with the water subtype that are normally immune to precision damage\
    \ (such as water elementals), and she ignores a hydrokineticist's chance to negate\
    \ precision damage from elemental overflow."

  name: "Tidal Distortion"
  label: null
  type: null
  description: "At 8th level, while making a full attack underwater, a tidal trickster\
    \ can give up one attack to create a tidal distortion. When she creates a tidal\
    \ distortion, the tidal trickster moves up to 10 feet. If any part of her movement\
    \ includes a square adjacent to one or more foes, she can choose one of those\
    \ foes and attempt a Bluff check with a DC of 11 + either the enemy's Sense Motive\
    \ or Swim modifier, whichever is higher. Her Bluff check is subject to any penalties\
    \ the attack roll she sacrificed would have taken, and if she trades an iterative\
    \ attack gained from having a high base attack bonus, she also takes a penalty\
    \ based on that attack's lower base attack bonus (a –5 penalty for the second\
    \ iterative attack, a –10 penalty for the third iterative attack, and a –15 penalty\
    \ for the fourth iterative attack, if she manages to gain one). If she succeeds\
    \ at the Bluff check, the movement doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity from\
    \ that foe and the foe becomes off-balance until its next turn. A tidal trickster\
    \ can give up any number of her attacks in a given full attack to create tidal\
    \ distortions, but she can't give up two consecutive attacks."
