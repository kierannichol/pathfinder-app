  description: "At 12th level, a clockspeaker can reanimate a destroyed construct.\
    \ The clockspeaker selects a destroyed construct within 60 feet and expends 1\
    \ round of bardic performance to reanimate the chosen construct. The construct\
    \ reanimates with a number of hit points equal to the clockspeaker's level, but\
    \ it is staggered. The affected construct follows the clockspeaker's orders while\
    \ reanimated. Each round, the bard can expend another round of bardic performance\
    \ to keep that construct reanimated for another round. The construct regains a\
    \ number of hit points equal to the clockspeaker's level for every round it remains\
    \ reanimated. If the construct recovers all of its hit points in this way, it\
    \ becomes fully reanimated and no longer requires bardic performance to remain\
    \ animated. A construct fully reanimated in this way follows the orders of the\
    \ clockspeaker that reanimated it, as if the clockspeaker were its original creator,\
    \ for 24 hours. Afterwards, the construct reverts to its original programming.\
    \ The construct is completely destroyed if the clockspeaker ends this performance\
    \ before the construct regains its full hit points, is interrupted, or is reduced\
    \ to 0 hit points. A completely destroyed construct cannot be repowered or reanimated,\
    \ even by another clockspeaker. The clockspeaker can reanimate multiple constructs\
    \ with this ability (either at the same time or over successive rounds) but must\
    \ expend 1 round of bardic performance per reanimated construct per round to maintain\
    \ the effect."
