  description: "At 4th level, the horse lord forms a bond with an animal he can use\
    \ as a mount, which becomes his animal companion. A Medium Ranger can select a\
    \ camel or a horse. A small Ranger can select a pony or wolf, but can also select\
    \ a boar or dog if he is at least 7th level.\nThis ability functions like the\
    \ druid animal companion ability except that the Ranger's effective druid level\
    \ is equal to his Ranger level â€“ 3. The Ranger gains a +2 bonus on Handle Animal\
    \ and Ride checks with his animal companion mount.\nThis ability replaces hunter's\
    \ bond."
