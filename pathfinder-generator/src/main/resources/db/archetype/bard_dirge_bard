  description: "A dirge bard gains the following type of bardic performance:\nDance\
    \ of the Dead (Su): At 10th level, a dirge bard can use his bardic performance\
    \ to cause dead bones or bodies to rise up and move or fight at his command. This\
    \ ability functions like animate dead, but the created skeletons or zombies remain\
    \ fully animate only as long as the dirge bard continues the performance. Once\
    \ it stops, any created undead collapse into carrion. Bodies or bones cannot be\
    \ animated more than once using this ability. Unlike animate dead, dance of the\
    \ dead requires no components and does not have the evil descriptor."
