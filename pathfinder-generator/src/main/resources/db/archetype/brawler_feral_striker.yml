  description: "This functions as the shifter aspect class feature of the shifter,\
    \ except the feral striker can choose only from the bear, bull, falcon, snake,\
    \ stag, tiger, and wolf aspects. She has access to only the minor versions all\
    \ these aspects.\nAt 6th level, the feral striker can take on two minor aspects\
    \ simultaneously as a move action. Each aspect counts toward her total number\
    \ of minutes (so if a feral striker who normally has 9 total minutes of aspects\
    \ takes on two aspects simultaneously for 4 minutes, she still has 1 minute remaining).\
    \ She can end one or both aspects as a free action on her turn.\nAt 10th level,\
    \ the feral striker adds her Constitution modifier to the total number of minutes\
    \ per day in which she can use feral aspect.\nAt 12th level, the feral striker\
    \ can take on three aspects simultaneously as a move action or one or two aspects\
    \ as a swift action.\nAt 20th level, the feral striker can take on as many aspects\
    \ as she wishes at once as a swift action, and they count as only one aspect for\
    \ the purpose of calculating duration."
