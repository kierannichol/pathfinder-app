  description: "At 8th level, whenever a burglar is detected while using Stealth,\
    \ she can immediately attempt a Bluff skill check opposed by the Sense Motive\
    \ skill of the creature that spotted her. If this check succeeds, the target assumes\
    \ that the noise was something innocent and disregards the detection. This only\
    \ functions if the creature cannot see the rogue. This ability can only be used\
    \ once during a given Stealth attempt. If the same creature detects the rogue's\
    \ presence again, the ability has no effect.\nThis ability replaces improved uncanny\
    \ dodge.\nRogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement the burglar archetype:\
    \ fast picks, fast stealth*, nimble climber, quick disable*, and trap spotter*."
