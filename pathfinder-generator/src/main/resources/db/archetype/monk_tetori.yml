  description: "A tetori uses his monk level in place of his base attack bonus to\
    \ determine CMB and CMD for grappling. At 4th level, he suffers no penalties on\
    \ attack rolls, can make attacks of opportunity while grappling, and retains his\
    \ Dexterity bonus to AC when pinning an opponent or when grappled. At 8th level,\
    \ a tetori gains the grab special attack when using unarmed strikes, and can use\
    \ this ability against creatures his own size or smaller by spending 1 point from\
    \ his ki pool, or against larger creatures by spending 2 points from his ki pool.\
    \ At 15th level, a tetori gains the constrict special attack, inflicting his unarmed\
    \ strike damage on any successful grapple check."

    \ gains the grappled condition (Reflex negates, DC 10 + 1/2 the wrestler's level\
