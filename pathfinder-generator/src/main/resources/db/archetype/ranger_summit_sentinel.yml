    Additionally, as a move action, she can enter a defensive stance for 1 minute.\
    \ While in this stance, the summit sentinel's speed is reduced to 5 feet, she\
    \ gains a +2 enhancement bonus to her natural armor, and she gains a +2 bonus\
    \ to her CMD against maneuvers that would move her or knock her prone. If the\
    \ ranger loses contact with the ground or other solid surface, the stance ends\
    \ immediately. The ranger can enter this stance a number of times per day equal\
    \ to 3 + her Constitution modifier.\nAt 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter,\
