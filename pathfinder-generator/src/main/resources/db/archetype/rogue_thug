description: "Some criminals steal with finesse, their victims only discovering the\
  \ crime when the rogue is long gone and the coin already spent. A thug, on the other\
  \ hand, cares nothing for finesse. Through both threat and violence, the thug gets\
  \ what she wants by the promise of force, and has no problem making good on that\
  \ promise as needed."

    \ the duration of the shaken condition is increased by 1 round. In addition, if\
    \ the target is shaken for 4 or more rounds, the thug can instead decide to make\
    \ the target frightened for 1 round."

  description: "At 3rd level, whenever a thug deals sneak attack damage, she can choose\
    \ to forgo 1d6 points of sneak attack damage to make the target sickened for a\
    \ number of rounds equal to 1/2 her rogue level. This ability does not stack with\
    \ itself--only the most recent duration applies.\nThis ability replaces trap sense.\n\
    Rogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement the thug archetype: offensive\
    \ defense, powerful sneak, strong impression, and weapon training."
