  description: "At 4th level, a provocateur can cause all observers fascinated by\
    \ her fascinate performance to become less friendly to a target creature or group\
    \ of her choice for 10 minutes per bard level. Affected observers' attitudes toward\
    \ the target, the target's influence with affected observers, and affected observers'\
    \ trust level as contacts for the target are all reduced by one step. If she reveals\
    \ information during the performance that would reduce those creatures' attitudes\
    \ anyway, those attitudes worsen by an additional step for the duration.\nIf the\
    \ provocateur engages in a verbal duel against the target with an audience affected\
    \ by damning performance, she automatically gains two edges.\nAt 18th level, the\
    \ duration increases to 1 day per bard level."
