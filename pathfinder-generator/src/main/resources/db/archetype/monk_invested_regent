  description: "An invested regent gains a pool of investiture points, supernatural\
    \ energy he can use to call upon amazing abilities and divine protection. The\
    \ number of points in the invested regent's investiture pool is equal to 1/2 his\
    \ monk level + his Charisma modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his\
    \ investiture pool, the invested regent can select one of his saving throws as\
    \ a swift action and gain a +1 sacred bonus on saving throws of that type for\
    \ 1 round. If he spends 1 point from his investiture pool during this swift action,\
    \ he instead gains a sacred bonus equal to his Charisma modifier on the saving\
    \ throw selected.\nA character with this feature and the ki pool class feature\
    \ tracks investiture points and ki points separately."
