  description: "At 14th level, a warrior of the holy light can unleash a 30-foot burst\
    \ of pure, white light as a standard action. evil creatures within this burst\
    \ take 1d6 points of damage for every two paladin levels and are blinded for 1\
    \ round. Evil dragons, evil outsiders, and evil undead are blinded for 1d4 rounds\
    \ on a failed save. A Reflex save halves this damage and negates the blindness.\
    \ The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the warrior of the holy light's level\
    \ + the warrior of the holy light's Charisma modifier. good creatures within this\
    \ burst are healed 1d6 points of damage per two paladin levels and receive a +2\
    \ sacred bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks\
    \ for 1 round. A warrior of the holy light can use this ability once per day at\
    \ 14th level plus one additional time per day at 17th and 20th levels."
