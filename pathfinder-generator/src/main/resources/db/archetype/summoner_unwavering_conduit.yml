  description: "An unwavering conduit's eidolon must be of a lawful alignment (if\
    \ using the Unchained Summoner, the eidolon must be of the archon, devil, or inevitable\
    \ subtype). Once selected, the evolutions of the unwavering conduit's eidolon\
    \ cannot be changed when a new class level is gained (though they can be altered\
    \ normally with the transmogrify spell). At least half the eidolon‘s skill points\
    \ must be spent on skills in which the unwavering conduit also has ranks. The\
    \ eidolon gains a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells and abilities\
    \ of the conjuration, enchantment, and transmutation schools. This bonus increases\
    \ to +2 at 3rd level, and by an additional 1 for every 3 levels thereafter. The\
    \ eidolon has 1 fewer evolution point than normal for an eidolon of the unwavering\
    \ conduit's summoner level."

  description: "Since an unwavering conduit's power is drawn from planar energies\
    \ aligned with law, all the creatures he summons must be of a lawful alignment.\n\
    If a creature would normally be celestial or fiendish, it is instead a resolute\
    \ creature.\nThis also causes the unwavering conduit's summoning power to be more\
    \ set than a standard summoner's. Beginning at 3rd level, each time he uses summon\
    \ monster to summon multiple monsters, rather than rolling a die to see how many\
    \ creatures he summons, he receives a specific number (two creatures for 1d3,\
    \ or four creatures for 1d4+1). If an item, spell, or ability would increase the\
    \ number of creatures summoned, the set number increases by that amount.\nAlso,\
    \ starting at 2nd level, creatures summoned by the unwavering conduit receive\
    \ a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells and abilities of the conjuration,\
    \ enchantment, and transmutation schools. This bonus increases to +2 at 6th level,\
    \ and by an additional 1 every 4 class levels thereafter."
