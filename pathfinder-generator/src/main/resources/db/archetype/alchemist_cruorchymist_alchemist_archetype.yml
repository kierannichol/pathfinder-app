  description: "A cruorchymist has created a homunculus from basic materials and his\
    \ own blood. The homunculus takes the shape of a Tiny humanoid. It functions in\
    \ all ways as a familiar, treating the cruorchymist's alchemist level as his effective\
    \ wizard level. If a cruorchymist wishes to replace his blood familiar, he can\
    \ reduce the cost of the replacement ritual by taking 2 points of Constitution\
    \ drain for every 100 gp he wishes to forgo.\nAt 3rd level, if the cruorchymist\
    \ has the infusion discovery, a blood familiar can deliver extracts that have\
    \ a range of touch for its cruorchymist master."
