description: "Smugglers specialize in moving contraband from one area to another while\
  \ avoiding detection by authorities. Sometimes a smuggler's cargo is illegal goods,\
  \ such as drugs or slaves. Other times, a smuggler hides legal goods to avoid paying\
  \ duties or taxes, and some may even use their abilities to help smuggle escaped\
  \ slaves to freedom. Smugglers may work on a ship that does nothing but smuggle\
  \ goods from one port to another, or they may freelance, working on ships that require\
  \ a smuggler's services for a short time."

  description: "An experienced smuggler knows how to smooth over interactions with\
    \ customs officials. At 3rd level, when dealing with officials working at a checkpoint,\
    \ conducting an inspection, or performing another such activity, a smuggler can\
    \ make a Diplomacy check opposed by the presiding official's Sense Motive check\
    \ to ensure her contraband makes it through. She gains a +1 bonus on this Diplomacy\
    \ check. On a successful check, the smuggler pays a small bribe (5d4 gp) to guarantee\
    \ her cargo remains undisturbed. This bonus rises to +2 when the smuggler reaches\
    \ 6th level, +3 at 9th level, +4 at 12th level, +5 at 15th level, and +6 at 18th\
    \ level."

  description: "A smuggler adds 1/2 her level on Sleight of Hand checks (minimum +1).\
    \ A smuggler can use Sleight of Hand to conceal a small item in a container or\
    \ room, such as the false bottom of a chest or beneath floorboards. Anyone attempting\
    \ to find an item concealed by a smuggler makes a Perception check opposed by\
    \ the Sleight of Hand check made by the smuggler when she concealed the object."

  description: "A smuggler uses patter and body language to deflect searchers from\
    \ hidden items. At 2nd level, a smuggler may make a Bluff check opposed by a searcher's\
    \ Perception check when a searcher looks for items the smuggler has concealed.\
    \ If the smuggler's Bluff check succeeds, the searcher must make a second Perception\
    \ check and take the lower of the two rolls.\nThis ability replaces Evasion."
