description: "Some cavaliers make a lifelong mission out of their exceptional ability\
  \ to direct troops on the battlefield, combining tactical insight with a preternatural\
  \ skill at improving the teamwork of their allies in order to win the day. Such\
  \ strategists are masters at learning the strengths and weaknesses of those they\
  \ fight alongside, and at employing those observations at the most opportune moments.\
  \ The best of them are also skilled at determining the strengths and weaknesses\
  \ of their enemies, as well as at countering some of those strengths with their\
  \ own formidable abilities."

  description: "At 4th level, a strategist learns to train his fellow adventurers\
    \ in the nuances of squad combat. By spending 10 minutes and expending 1 use of\
    \ his challenge ability, the strategist can grant the use of a teamwork feat that\
    \ he knows to up to four of his allies, similar to the tactician ability. As with\
    \ tactician, allies need not meet the prerequisites of the granted feat, but they\
    \ retain the use of this feat for 10 minutes plus 1 minute for every two levels\
    \ the cavalier possesses, as long as the cavalier is visible and can be heard\
    \ by his allies. If the cavalier falls unconscious or cannot be both seen and\
    \ heard, his allies lose the benefit of the granted feat until the condition is\
    \ remedied.\nThis ability replaces expert trainer."

    \ of one teamwork feat employed by any of his opponents within 30 feet instead\
    \ of granting the use of a teamwork feat to his allies.\nThis ability replaces\
    \ the cavalier's 18th-level bonus feat."
