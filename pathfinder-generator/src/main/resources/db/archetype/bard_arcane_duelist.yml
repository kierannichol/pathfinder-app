  description: "An arcane duelist gains the following types of bardic performance:\n\
    Rallying Cry (Su): At 1st level, an arcane duelist can use performance to rally\
    \ dispirited allies. Each round he makes an Intimidate check. Any ally (including\
    \ the bard) within 30 feet may use this check in place of his own saving throw\
    \ against fear and despair effects. Those already under a fear or despair effect\
    \ can attempt a new save each round using the bard's Intimidate check. Rallying\
    \ cry does not work on effects that don't allow saves. This is a mind-affecting\
    \ ability that uses audible components.\nThis performance replaces countersong.\n\
    Bladethirst (Su): An arcane duelist of 6th level or higher may use performance\
    \ to grant one weapon, one natural weapon, one end of a double weapon, or 50 items\
    \ of ammunition of the same type within 30 feet a +1 enhancement bonus. This enhancement\
    \ bonus increases by +1 for every three levels after 6th (maximum +5 at 18th level).\
    \ These bonuses stack with existing bonuses and may be used to increase the item's\
    \ enhancement bonus up to +5 or to add any of the following weapon properties:\
    \ defending, distance, ghost touch, keen, mighty cleaving, returning, shock, shocking\
    \ burst, seeking, speed, or wounding. If the weapon is not magical, at least a\
    \ +1 enhancement bonus must be added before adding special abilities.\nThis performance\
    \ replaces suggestion.\nMass Bladethirst (Su): An arcane duelist of 18th level\
    \ or higher can use his bladethirst performance to enhance the weapons of as many\
    \ allies as desired within 30 feet. The bonus provided by this power is +4 if\
    \ conferred on two allies, +3 for three allies, +2 for four allies, and +1 for\
    \ five or more allies. The power granted to each weapon must be identical.\nThis\
    \ ability replaces mass suggestion."
