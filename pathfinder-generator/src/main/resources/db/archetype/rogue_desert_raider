description: "Desert raiders constantly threaten caravans that cross vast, desolate\
  \ expanses. Some desert raiders are tribespeople who raid to supplement their hardscrabble\
  \ existence, while others are career thieves who take to the desert to avoid the\
  \ noose. To survive, a desert raider must learn the secrets of the deserts and become\
  \ inured to their dangers."
