description: "All fighters have two main tools of their trade--weapons and armor.\
  \ While many fighters hone their weapon skills to a point of inescapable grace and\
  \ lethality, there are those who live under the maxim that a good offense can be\
  \ accomplished though an impenetrable defense. To these fighters, proper use of\
  \ armor and shields ensures that they can fight another day, and that the frustration\
  \ of enemies who can't seem to crack an armor master's superior defenses is just\
  \ the first symptom of his foes' eventual defeat."

  description: "At 2nd level, an armor master specializes in using his shield to deflect\
    \ attacks. He gains a +1 bonus to his touch AC, and this bonus increases for every\
    \ four levels beyond 2nd (to a maximum of +6 at 20th level); however, this bonus\
    \ cannot exceed the sum of the armor and enhancement bonus to AC provided by the\
    \ shield that the armor master is currently carrying."

  description: "At 5th level, an armor master gains DR 1/-- when wearing light armor,\
    \ DR 2/-- when wearing medium armor, and DR 3/-- when wearing heavy armor. At\
    \ 19th level, this damage reduction increases to DR 4/-- when wearing light armor,\
    \ DR 8/-- when wearing medium armor, and DR 12/-- when wearing heavy armor. This\
    \ damage reduction stacks with that provided by adamantine armor, but not with\
    \ other forms of damage reduction. This damage reduction does not apply if the\
    \ armor master is stunned, unconscious, or helpless.\nThis ability replaces weapon\

  description: "At 9th level, an armor master can use his armor to shield critical\

    \ special ability. At 13th level, his armor gains the moderate fortification special\
    \ ability. This fortification does not stack in any way with armor that has these\
    \ special abilities. In these cases the armor master takes the better of the two\
    \ fortifications.\nThis ability replaces weapon training 2 and 4."
