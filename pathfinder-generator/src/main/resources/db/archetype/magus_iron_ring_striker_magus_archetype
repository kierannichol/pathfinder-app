    \ prepared magus spell to treat his size as if it were larger for the purposes\
    \ of determining the size modifier to his CMB and CMD, as well as which creatures\
    \ he can affect with combat maneuvers. For every level of the spell he sacrifices,\
    \ his effective size increases by one step, up to a maximum of Colossal. For every\
    \ two effective size increments he increases, he gains a +2 size bonus to Strength,\
    \ to a maximum of +6.\nThis does not change the iron-ring striker's actual size.\
    \ This effect lasts for 1 minute per level of the spell sacrificed."
