  description: "A phantom thief adds Handle Animal, Heal, Ride, Spellcraft, Survival,\
    \ and all Knowledge skills to her list of class skills. Furthermore, she selects\
    \ one of her rogue class skills and adds half her rogue level on all skill checks\
    \ using that skill. At 3rd level and every 2 rogue levels thereafter, she selects\
    \ an additional rogue class skill and adds half her rogue level on all skill checks\
    \ using that skill as well. Starting at 4th level, if the phantom thief is an\
    \ unchained rogue, she gains rogue's edge skill unlocks with each of these skills\
    \ rather than selecting one skill every 5 levels, and she adds half her rogue\
    \ level to her number of ranks to determine when she receives a skill unlock (so\
    \ a 7th level rogue (phantom thief ) with 7 ranks in a chosen skill would count\
    \ as having 10 ranks and receive the second skill unlock)."

    She can select the combat trick, minor magic, and major magic rogue talents as\
    \ many times as she likes, and she can select the Skill Focus feat as a rogue\
    \ talent, also as many times as she likes. Finally, she can select a vigilante\
    \ social talent instead of a rogue talent, except for social grace and vigilante\
    \ social talents that would require her to be a craftsman or professional. For\
    \ the purpose of vigilante social talents, a phantom thief does not have a vigilante\
    \ identity and is always considered to be in her social identity."

    \ checks to surprise a foe, and on initiative checks for surprise rounds that\
    \ involved Bluff and Sense Motive checks to determine surprise. This bonus increases\
