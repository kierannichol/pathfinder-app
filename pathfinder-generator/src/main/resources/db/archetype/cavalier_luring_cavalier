description: "Those who study the perfection of strategy and tactics know that picking\
  \ the battlefield can grant advantages that only overwhelming numbers of allies\
  \ can eclipse. The luring cavalier is a special type of cavalier that helps accomplish\
  \ that goal. Typically, he uses a bow or other ranged weapon to lure opponents toward\
  \ him, and then makes strategic retreats to position his enemies exactly where he\
  \ wants them."

  description: "At 3rd level, when a luring cavalier makes a ranged attack with his\
    \ highest base attack bonus, he can ignore the penalties for firing up to three\
    \ range increments away. If he is using a firearm, he can target touch AC up to\
    \ two range increments away. This effect stacks with effects that allow the cavalier\
    \ to make ranged attacks farther without penalty or that allow him to target touch\
    \ AC with a firearm beyond the first range increment.\nThis ability replaces cavalier's\
