  description: "At 3rd level, a spirit guide can form a temporary bond with a spirit,\
    \ as the shaman's wandering spirit class feature. She must make this selection\
    \ each day when she refreshes her spells. A spirit guide cannot bond with a spirit\
    \ that is incompatible with her alignment, ethos, or mystery (GM's discretion).\n\
    A spirit guide gains one hex of her choice from the list of hexes available from\
    \ that spirit. She uses her oracle level as her shaman level, and she switches\
    \ Wisdom for Charisma and vice versa for the purpose of determining the hex's\
    \ effects.\nShe uses her oracle level as her shaman level and her Charisma score\
    \ instead of Wisdom for the purpose of determining its effects.\nAt 4th level,\
    \ she adds the bonded spirit's spirit magic spells to her oracle spells known\
    \ for that day, but only of spell levels she can cast. At 7th level, she gains\
    \ the spirit ability of her current bonded spirit. At 15th level, she gains the\
    \ greater spirit ability of her current bonded spirit.\nThis ability replaces\
    \ the revelations gained at 3rd, 7th, and 15th levels."
