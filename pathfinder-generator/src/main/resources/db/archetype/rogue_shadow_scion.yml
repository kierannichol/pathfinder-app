  description: "At 8th level, a shadow scion can walk through the Shadow Plane and\
    \ reappear elsewhere on the Material Plane as a standard action. The shadow scion\
    \ can travel up to 30 feet per rogue level per day in this fashion, either in\
    \ a single round or broken up across multiple shadow steps. This movement must\
    \ be used in increments of at least 5 feet and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\
    \ Travel through the Shadow Plane is imprecise; when the shadow scion arrives\
    \ back on the Material Plane, she reenters 1 square off target, as per the rules\
    \ for thrown splash weapons. If this would place her in an occupied square, she\
    \ instead arrives in the nearest safe location. When the shadow scion arrives\
    \ on the Material Plane, she is cloaked in shadow and gains concealment as per\
    \ the blur spell for 1 round."

    \ from the shadows. This functions as commune with nature, except that it functions\
    \ in any terrain to a radius of 100 feet per rogue level, and it cannot reveal\
    \ information about any object or subject that is not currently in dim light or\
    \ darkness. The shadow scion can use this ability once per day at 14th level and\
    \ twice per day at 19th level."

    \ she gains DR 10/cold iron and a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws. In addition,\

    \ light, that foe is blinded for 1d6 rounds.\nThis ability replaces master strike.\n\
    Rogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement the shadow scion archetype:\
