description: "While most alchemists use mutagens to boost their physical ability at\
  \ the cost of mental ability, some use alchemy for the opposite purpose--to boost\
  \ the power of the mind and memory. A mindchemist can reach incredible levels of\
  \ mental acuity, but suffers lingering debilitating effects to his physique."

  description: "At 2nd level, a mindchemist has honed his memory. When making a Knowledge\
    \ check, he may add his Intelligence bonus on the check a second time. Thus, a\
    \ mindchemist with 5 ranks in Knowledge (history) and a +2 Intelligence bonus\
    \ has a total skill bonus of +9 (5 + 2 + 2) using this ability. The mindchemist\
    \ can also use this ability when making an Intelligence check to remember something.\n\
    This ability replaces poison use."
