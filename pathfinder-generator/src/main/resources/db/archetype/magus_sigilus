  description: "At 2nd level, a sigilus learns how to magically inscribe a Sin rune\
    \ onto a weapon. The rune to be inscribed must be chosen from the seven runes\
    \ that symbolize the seven schools of Sin magic. Note that due to the nature of\
    \ magus spells, certain runes (and thus certain schools of magic) are more appropriate\
    \ for inscription than others-the runes for conjuration, evocation, illusion,\
    \ and transmutation are the strongest choices, while those for abjuration, enchantment,\
    \ and necromancy are less enticing. Inscribing a rune takes 10 minutes.\nOnce\
    \ a weapon has been infused with a rune, the sigilus becomes more adept at using\
    \ her spell combat ability with spells of that rune's school. Her penalty on attack\
    \ rolls when using spell combat is reduced by 1 (to -1) when she casts a spell\
    \ from the same school as her inscribed rune, but is increased by 2 (to -4) when\
    \ she uses spell combat with a spell not from her inscribed rune's school. As\
    \ long as she has a rune inscribed on her weapon in this manner, she cannot use\
    \ spells from that rune's opposition schools at all with spell Combat.\nThe sigilus\
    \ can maintain only a single inscribed rune on a weapon at any time; if she inscribes\
    \ a new rune on a weapon, the previously inscribed rune fades."

  description: "At 7th level, a sigilus learns to inscribe a star rune on a suit of\
    \ light armor she wears. When she does so, her armor becomes physically empowered\
    \ with defensive magic, granting her energy resistance 5 to two energy types of\
    \ her choice selected from acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic, and increasing\
    \ the armor's armor bonus by 1. (Note that this increase is an armor bonus increase,\
    \ and thus stacks with any enhancement bonus a suit of magic light armor may have.)\
    \ Inscribing the star rune in this way becomes part of the sigilus's spell preparation\
    \ ritual-she can inscribe a star rune in this way once per day as a result. Each\
    \ day she inscribes the star rune, she can change the two types of energy resistance\
    \ it grants as she wishes.\nAt 13th level, an inscribed star rune grants energy\
    \ resistance 10 to one energy type and energy resistance 5 to two other energy\
    \ types, and its armor bonus increases to +2.\nA star rune can be inscribed only\
    \ on light armor-it cannot be inscribed on medium or heavy armor, even if the\
    \ magus later gains proficiency with medium or heavy armor."
