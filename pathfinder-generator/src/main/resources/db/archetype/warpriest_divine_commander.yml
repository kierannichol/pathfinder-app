    \ be one that she is capable of riding and must be suitable as a mount. A Medium\
    \ divine commander can select a camel or a horse. A Small divine commander can\
    \ select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if she is at least\
    \ 4th level. (The GM might approve other animals as suitable mounts.)\nA divine\
    \ commander does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding this\
    \ mount. The mount is always considered combat trained, and begins play with Light\
    \ Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat. A divine commander's mount does not gain\
    \ the share spells special ability. Should a divine commander's mount die, she\
    \ can find another mount to serve her after 1 week of mourning. This new mount\
    \ does not gain the link, evasion, devotion, or improved evasion special abilities\
    \ until the next time the divine commander gains a level."
