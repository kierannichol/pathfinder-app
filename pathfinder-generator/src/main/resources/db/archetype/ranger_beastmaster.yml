  description: "A beast master forms a close bond with an animal companion. This ability\
    \ functions like the druid animal companion ability except that the ranger's effective\
    \ druid level is equal to his ranger level â€“ 3. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on\
    \ wild empathy and Handle Animal checks made regarding his animal companion. Unlike\
    \ a normal ranger, a beast master's choice of animal companion is not limited\
    \ to a subset of all possible animal companion choices--he may choose freely among\
    \ all animal companion choices, just as a druid can.\nThe beast master may have\
    \ more than one animal companion, but he must divide up his effective druid level\
    \ between his companions to determine the abilities of each companion.\nFor example,\
    \ a beast master with an effective druid level of 4 can have one 4th-level companion,\
    \ two 2nd-level companions, or one 1st-level and one 3rd-level companion.\nEach\
    \ time a beast master's effective druid level increases, he must decide how to\
    \ allocate the increase among his animal companions (including the option of adding\
    \ a new 1st-level companion). Once an effective druid level is allocated to a\
    \ particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in\
    \ the ranger's service (he must release a companion or wait until a companion\
    \ dies to allocate its levels to another companion). The share spells animal companion\
    \ ability does not give the ranger the ability to cast a single spell so that\
    \ it affects all of his animal companions."

    \ as long as he likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it\
    \ as a free action. The ranger can only see through the eyes of one companion\
    \ at a time, and is blinded while maintaining this connection."
