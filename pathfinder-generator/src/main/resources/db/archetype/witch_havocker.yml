  description: "A havocker's patron grants her the ability to devastate her foes with\
    \ a specific element. At 1st level, rather than selecting a standard patron and\
    \ gaining patron spells, the witch selects a specific kineticist element, which\
    \ represents the shadowy forces from which she gains her familiar and class powers.\
    \ The havocker gains the elemental focus and kinetic blast class features with\
    \ the associated element, using her witch level as her effective kineticist level.\
    \ If the havocker takes levels in another class that grants an elemental focus,\
    \ the elemental focuses must be the same type, even if that means that the elemental\
    \ focus of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the havocker\
    \ can change her former elemental focus to make them conform."
