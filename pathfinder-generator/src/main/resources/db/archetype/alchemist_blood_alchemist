  description: "When a blood alchemist performs a coup de grace that kills an intelligent\
    \ humanoid creature (though, not a summoned intelligent humanoid creature), he\
    \ can gather its lifeblood into a vial; this is a death effect.\nHe can use this\
    \ lifeblood any time within the next 24 hours to create an extract of a spell\
    \ level he can cast that is no higher than 1/2 the creature's CR, without spending\
    \ a daily extract slot. He can use this ability once for each spell level each\
    \ day (for example, a 13th-level blood alchemist can use lifeblood to gain additional\
    \ 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-, and 5thlevel extracts). A blood alchemist can't take\
    \ the mutagen or cognatogen discoveries."

  description: "A blood alchemist gains a blood pool with a number of points equal\
    \ to his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier. He can spend 1 point from\
    \ his blood pool to draw a complex alchemical circle of 10ft size in blood on\
    \ the ground or on another permanent fixture in a process that takes 1 minute.\
    \ This blood pool refreshes when his extracts are refreshed. Depending on his\
    \ alchemist level, the alchemical circle can have one of several effects.\nAt\
    \ 1st (level, the blood alchemist can spend an unused extract slot to charge the\
    \ circle with alchemical energy. He chooses one of the spells listed of equal\
    \ or lower level to the extract slot he spent, and until he refreshes his extract\
    \ slots, as long as his body is in physical contact with the circle, he can produce\
    \ the effect of the spell he chose as a spell-like ability. Circles last until\
    \ their physical form is broken or the blood alchemist refreshes his extracts.\
    \ If the spell normally has an expensive material component, he must still provide\
    \ it, either grinding it up and mixing it with the blood used for the circle or\
    \ placing it in the circle (if the component is also the target). The chosen effect\
    \ can target or affect only something contained within the circle, or the surface\
    \ on which the blood alchemist drew the circle. To learn one of these effects,\
    \ he must write it into his formula book, with the same cost as usual for a formula\
    \ (he can also use his free formula from leveling up to learn the chosen effect\
    \ instead of a normal formula).\nThe blood alchemist can choose from the following\
    \ spells for this ability: 1st--expeditious excavation, fabricate bullets, jury-rig,\
    \ magic weapon, reinforce armaments; 2nd--knock, make whole, masterwork transformation,\
    \ silk to steel, soften earth and stone, warp wood; 3rd--keen edge, magic vestment,\
    \ greater magic weapon, obsidian flow, spike stones, stone shape; 4th--fabricate,\
    \ passwall, transmute mud to rock, transmute rock to mud; 5th--flesh to stone,\
    \ move earth, stone to flesh, tar pool, transmute metal to wood; 6th--polymorph\
    \ any object, transmute blood to acid.\nStarting at 8th level, the blood alchemist\
    \ can also create a magic circle, as per the magic circles occultist class ability,\
    \ though it costs 1 point from his blood pool instead of 1 point of mental focus.\n\
    Starting at 12th level, he can also create a binding circle, as per the occultist\
    \ class ability of the same name, though it costs 2 points from his blood pool\
    \ instead of 2 points of mental focus.\nStarting at 16th level, the blood alchemist\
    \ can draw magic circles and binding circles more quickly but with a shorter duration,\
    \ as per the occultist fast circles ability."
