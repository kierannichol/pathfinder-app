description: "Unused to the light of the sun, cave dwellers use their subterranean\
  \ expertise to protect their clans from the manifold dangers of deep caverns and\
  \ tunnels. The typical cave dweller is perfectly content to live his entire life\
  \ underground, and he may even view the light of the sun as particularly abhorrent\
  \ or taboo. While this lifestyle doesn't in and of itself imply evil or sinister\
  \ intent, many outlanders ignorantly assume that cave dwellers avoid the light of\
  \ the sun for malicious reasons."
