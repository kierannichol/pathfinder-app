description: "Gunslingers use a potent mixture of common sense and manual dexterity\
  \ in order to control the fickle power of their weapons. But a few rare gunslingers\
  \ seem to accomplish their chosen tasks purely through willpower and an unwillingness\
  \ to ever give up. These mysterious strangers use their force of personality to\
  \ keep going when the chips are down, often moving on from a region as soon as they\
  \ accomplish their goals--hence the name."

  description: "A mysterious stranger swaps a pair of deeds for the following.\nFocused\
    \ Aim (Ex) At 1st level, as a swift action, the mysterious stranger can spend\
    \ 1 grit point to gain a bonus on all firearm damage rolls equal to her Charisma\
    \ modifier (minimum 1) with all firearm attacks she makes until the end of her\
    \ turn. At 7th level, when she uses the dead shot deed, she multiplies this bonus\
    \ by the number of hits she made while rolling the Dead Shot attack.\nThis deed\
    \ replaces the quick clear deed.\nClipping Shot (Ex) At 11th level, when the mysterious\
    \ stranger misses with a firearm attack, she can spend 1 grit point to deal half\
    \ the damage that attack would have dealt if it were a hit (roll damage normally).\
    \ She can decide to use this deed and spend the grit point after making the attack.\
    \ This deed has no effect if the attack used the dead shot deed. The cost of using\
    \ this deed cannot be reduced with the Signature Deed feat, the true grit class\
    \ feature, or any similar effect."
