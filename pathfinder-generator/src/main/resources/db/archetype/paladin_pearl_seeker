description: "Some paladins are called to their faith by strange empathic visions\
  \ and dreams that beckon them to the oceans and beyond, to right aquatic injustice\
  \ and search for a glorious gasping and whispering pearl they don't understand.\
  \ Their contact with the strange but benevolent entity sending the dreams grants\
  \ them unusual powers compared to other paladins."
