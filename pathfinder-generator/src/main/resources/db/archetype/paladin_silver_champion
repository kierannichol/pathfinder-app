    \ mount drake power as a bonus power. However, a silver champion doesn't gain\
    \ additional uses per day of smite evil at 4th, 10th, and 16th levels, and doesn't\
    \ gain mercies at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels."

    \ Dragon, Exploration, Toil, and Trade to her class spell list. A silver champion\
