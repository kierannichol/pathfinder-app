description: "Pack hunter barbarians team up to hunt dangerous prey to feed, to protect\
  \ their camps, and as a rite of passage. Often, a tribe of pack hunters looks to\
  \ a specific species of animal (such as wolves) who themselves hunt in packs, and\
  \ view these animals as sacred manifestations of their people's traditions and values."
