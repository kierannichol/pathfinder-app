  description: "At 2nd level, a construct saboteur can user her arcane prowess to\
    \ hinder constructs.\nWhenever she uses Arcane Strike to attack a construct, she\
    \ can activate one of the following sabotage abilities that she has gained. She\
    \ gains one sabotage ability at 2nd level and can thereafter select any sabotage\
    \ ability in place of a rogue talent. The DC for any sabotage ability that requires\
    \ a saving throw is 10 + half the construct saboteur's level + the construct saboteur's\
    \ Intelligence modifier.\nDiminish Senses: A jolt of energy overwhelms the construct's\
    \ senses. The construct is blinded for 1 round. A construct saboteur can forgo\
    \ dealing sneak attack damage to extend the duration of the blindness by 1 round\
    \ for every 2d6 points of sneak attack damage forgone in this way. A construct\
    \ can negate this effect with a successful Will save.\nMagic Vulnerability: A\
    \ field of energy enshrouds the construct, disabling its immunity to magic for\
    \ 1 round.\nThe construct instead gains spell resistance equal to 15 + its CR.\
    \ A construct saboteur can forgo dealing sneak attack damage to reduce this spell\
    \ resistance. The construct's spell resistance is reduced by 1 for every 1d6 points\
    \ of sneak attack damage forgone in this way. A construct can negate this effect\
    \ with a successful Will save.\nOverwhelming Jolt: A sudden burst of power moves\
    \ over the surface of the construct, giving it the staggered condition for 1 round.\
    \ A construct can negate this effect with a successful Will save.\nSlowing Pulse:\
    \ A surge of slowing energy ripples through the construct, reducing its speed\
    \ by 5 feet for a number of rounds equal to the construct saboteur's Intelligence\
    \ modifier. A construct saboteur can forgo dealing sneak attack damage to reduce\
    \ the construct's speed by an additional 5 feet for every 1d6 points of sneak\
    \ attack damage forgone in this way. This ability cannot lower a construct's movement\
    \ speed below 5 feet. A construct can reduce the duration of this effect to 1\
    \ round with a successful Reflex save."
