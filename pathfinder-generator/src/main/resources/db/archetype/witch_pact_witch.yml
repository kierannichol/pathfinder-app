  description: "A pact witch chooses one Outer Planes with which to forge a pact.\
    \ This plane determines the alignment a pact witch must maintain and the type\
    \ of improved familiar he gains at 6th level. Many pact witches worship specific\
    \ deities or demigods native to the planes with which they forged their pacts.\
    \ When a pact witch chooses his plane, his body transforms in minor, cosmetic\
    \ ways associated with that plane. A pact with Hell might give a pact witch small\
    \ devil horns, while a pact with the Heaven might cause a pact witch to have a\
    \ softly glowing golden halo, and a pact with Axis might give a pact witch's skin\
    \ strange rune patterns. The nature of this cosmetic change varies from witch\
    \ to witch, but has no mechanical effect. Instead of learning new spells from\
    \ a patron, a pact witch learns new spells from his planar pact, starting at 2nd\
    \ level and again every 2 levels thereafter.\n2nd Level: Protection from chaos/evil/good/law\
    \ (choose one appropriate to your plane) 4th Level: Time shudder. 6th Level: Infuse\
    \ self. 8th Level: Lesser planar ally. 10th Level: Plane shift (as a 5th level\
    \ spell). 12th Level: Planar ally. 14th Level: Banishment. 16th Level: Greater\
    \ planar ally. 18th Level: Gate."

  description: "When a pact witch reaches 6th level, his familiar turns into an outsider\
    \ native to his chosen plane.\nThe familiar retains its spells known; its memories;\
    \ and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, but is treated as a member\
    \ of its new race in all other respects. The type of creature the familiar becomes\
    \ is indicated above on Table 1â€“1: Planar Pacts; if more than one type of familiar\
    \ is listed, a pact witch can choose which type his familiar becomes."
