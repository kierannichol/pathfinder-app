  description: "A deep marshal learns numerous arcane secrets involving the shaping\
    \ and warding of earth and stone. She adds the following sorcerer/wizard spells\
    \ to her magus spell list as magus spells of the same level: crafter's curse,\
    \ crafter's fortune, erase, expeditious excavation, fabricate, greater make whole,\
    \ knock, major creation, make whole, mending, minor creation, move earth, passwall,\
    \ stone shape, transmute mud to rock, transmute rock to mud, and all 0- through\
    \ 6th-level sorcerer/wizard spells of the abjuration school. She must still add\
    \ such spells to her spellbook to prepare them. If a spell appears on both the\
    \ magus and sorcerer/wizard spell lists, the magus uses the lower of the two spell\
    \ levels listed for the spell. A deep marshal cannot cast spells from the enchantment,\
    \ illusion, or necromancy school and she cannot activate spell-completion or spell-trigger\
    \ magic items that use spells from those schools (without making a successful\
    \ Use Magic Device check)."

    \ weapon in order to augment her spellcasting. Whenever she casts a magus spell\
    \ while wielding a magic battleaxe, heavy pick, warhammer, or weapon with the\
    \ word “dwarven\"in its name, she adds half the weapon's enhancement bonus to\
    \ the her caster level (minimum +1). When attempting a caster level check to overcome\
    \ spell resistance, she instead adds her weapon's full enhancement bonus.\nIn\
    \ addition, she is treated as having a number of ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering)\
    \ and Profession (miner) equal to her magus level, and she attempts Profession\
    \ (miner) checks using her Intelligence modifier instead of her Wisdom modifier."
