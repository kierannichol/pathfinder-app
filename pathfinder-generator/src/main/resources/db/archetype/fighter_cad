description: "In combat, most fighters have some sort of code of honor. Some believe\
  \ that one should not kick enemies when they are down, or should limit use of other\
  \ such dirty tricks to the most dire of circumstances. The cad places no such limitations\
  \ on himself. Battles are for winning, and anything that gives the cad the upper\
  \ hand against his enemies is a legitimate tactic. No trick is too treacherous if\
  \ it leads to victory."
