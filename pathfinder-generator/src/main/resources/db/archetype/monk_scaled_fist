    \ energies she studies. She must select one type of energy: acid, cold, electricity,\
    \ or fire.\nOnce this choice is made, it cannot be changed. The scaled fist can\
    \ expend 1 point from her ki pool as a swift action to imbue her natural attacks\
    \ with this energy, causing them to deal an extra 1d6 points of damage of the\
    \ chosen energy type for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 her monk level."

    \ caught in the area of the breath can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the\
