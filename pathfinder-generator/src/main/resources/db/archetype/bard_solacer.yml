  description: "A solacer adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on Heal checks and\
    \ can attempt Knowledge checks untrained.\nAt 5th level, a solacer can take 10\
    \ on checks with any Knowledge skill he has ranks in. The solacer can choose not\
    \ to take 10 and can instead roll normally. In addition, once per day, the solacer\
    \ can take 20 on any Heal check, though this does not affect the time it takes\
    \ to perform the task attempted. He can use this ability one additional time per\
    \ day for every 6 bard levels he has beyond 5th, to a maximum of three times per\
    \ day at 17th level."

  description: "At 10th level, a solacer can use his performances to protect and heal\
    \ a target's soul. The solacer can perform for 1 hour (this requires no skill\
    \ check) and grant several benefits for 24 hours to the creatures that can hear\
    \ or see his performance, or both, depending on whether the performance has audible\
    \ or visual components. Affected creatures gain a +3 bonus on saving throws against\
    \ curses, possession spells and effects (such as magic jar), and domination and\
    \ mind control spells and effects (such as dominate person). If the target is\
    \ suffering any or multiple such effects, it immediately can attempt a new saving\
    \ throw against each; the effect ends if the saving throw is successful. Only\
    \ one such extra saving throw can be granted against each condition in any 24-hour\
    \ period. If a creature benefits from the daily performance between saving throws\
    \ against a corruption (Horror Adventures 14) progressing, it gains a +3 bonus\
    \ on the next saving throw against that corruption.\nThe amount of this bonus\
    \ increases by 1 at 16th and 19th levels (maximum +5 at 19th level)."
