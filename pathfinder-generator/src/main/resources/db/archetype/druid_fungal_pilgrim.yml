  description: "At 4th level, a fungal pilgrim who selected the Plant domain for her\
    \ nature bond gains the ability to grow fungal creatures from the spores of her\
    \ body. Once per day, when casting a summon nature's ally spell to summon a single\
    \ creature, the fungal pilgrim can infuse her fungal connection into the casting.\
    \ The creature summoned must be selected from the summon nature's ally list for\
    \ 1 spell level lower than the spell cast. For example, if the fungal pilgrim\
    \ casts summon nature's ally III, she must choose a creature from the list in\
    \ summon nature's ally II.\nCreatures summoned in this manner gain the fungal\
    \ creature template, except they do not gain the create spawn and poison spore\
    \ cloud special attacks. A creature summoned in this manner cannot be harvested\
    \ for its poison.\nA druid can use this ability an additional time per day at\
    \ 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th\
    \ level. At 20th level, it can be used any number of times per day."
