  description: "A gloomblade can create a shadowy weapon in a free hand as a move\
    \ action. This can take the form of any melee weapon with which he is proficient.\
    \ A gloomblade can have only one shadow weapon in existence at a time; creating\
    \ a new shadow weapon causes an existing shadow weapon to vanish.\nAt 3rd level,\
    \ the shadow weapon acts as a magic weapon with a +1 enhancement bonus; this bonus\
    \ increases by 1 for every 4 levels a gloomblade has beyond 2nd, to a maximum\
    \ enhancement bonus of +5 at 18th level.\nAt 7th level, a gloomblade can create\
    \ (and maintain) two shadow weapons at a time as a move action; if he does, each\
    \ weapon has an enhancement bonus 1 lower than normal. If a gloomblade creates\
    \ only one weapon, it gains a weapon special ability of his choice (chosen upon\
    \ creation); the ability must be valid for the shadow weapon's weapon type and\
    \ must be chosen from defending, flaming, frost, keen, ghost touch, merciful,\
    \ shock, thundering, or vicious. (Additional special abilities might qualify,\
    \ at the GM's discretion.)\nAt 11th level, a gloomblade's shadow weapons each\
    \ gain their full enhancement bonus if he creates two weapons. If a gloomblade\
    \ creates only one shadow weapon, it gains additional weapon special abilities;\
    \ the total effective bonus of these abilities cannot exceed +3. The gloomblade\
    \ can now choose from the of anarchic, axiomatic, flaming burst, icy burst, holy,\
    \ shocking burst, unholy, and wounding weapon special abilities as well as those\
    \ from the list above.\nAt 15th level, a gloomblade's shadow weapons each gain\
    \ magic weapon special abilities with a total effective bonus of +2 per weapon.\
    \ If a gloomblade creates only one shadow weapon, its magic weapon special abilities\
    \ cannot exceed a total effective bonus of +5. The gloomblade adds brilliant energy,\
    \ dancing, and speed to the options he can choose as weapon special abilities\
    \ for his shadow weapon."

  description: "At 5th level, a gloomblade gains weapon training, except that he does\
    \ not select a weapon group; instead, the bonus applies to the shadow weapons\
    \ he creates. A gloomblade does not select additional weapon groups as he gains\
    \ levels.\nAt 9th level, whenever a gloomblade creates one or more shadow weapons,\
    \ he can apply any one of the following shadow effects (chosen upon creation)\
    \ to one of them.\nDuring the gloomblade's turn, he can increase his reach with\
    \ that weapon by 5 feet. The gloomblade can increase a thrown shadow weapon's\
    \ range increment (if any) by 20 feet. When he hits a foe with a melee attack\
    \ with the weapon, he can use it to perform a reposition combat maneuver against\
    \ the creature hit as a swift action. This does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\
    \ Attacks made with the weapon ignore hardness equal to or less than the gloomblade's\
    \ fighter level.\nFor every 4 levels he has beyond 9th, a gloomblade can apply\
    \ an additional effect to his shadow weapons, to a maximum of three effects at\
    \ 17th level; these effects can be split between multiple shadow weapons as a\
    \ gloomblade desires, but they don't stack with themselves."
