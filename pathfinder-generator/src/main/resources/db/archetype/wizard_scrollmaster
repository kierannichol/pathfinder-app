  \ strange wizards enter battle armed with scrolls, often one in each in each hand,\
  \ practicing combat techniques resembling some monk martial arts."

  description: "A scrollmaster can wield any paper, parchment, or cloth scroll as\
    \ if it were a melee weapon. In the hands of the Wizard, the scroll acts as a\
    \ short sword with an enhancement bonus equal to 1/2 the level of the highest-level\
    \ Wizard spell on the scroll; a scroll with only a cantrip or 1st-level spell\
    \ on it counts as a masterwork short sword. The scrollmaster is proficient in\
    \ this weapon, and feats and abilities that affect short swords (such as Weapon\
    \ Focus) apply to this weapon. A scrollmaster cannot wield two scrollblades at\
    \ the same time.\nActivating this ability is a free action. A scroll blade only\
    \ retains its abilities in the hands of the scrollmaster. The scroll blade has\
    \ hardness 0 and hit points equal to the highest-level Wizard spell on the scroll.\
    \ Each successful hit by the scroll blade reduces its hit points by 1; this damage\
    \ cannot be repaired, but does not affect casting from the scroll. When its hit\
    \ points reach 0, the scroll is destroyed. If a scroll contains a spell with a\
    \ metamagic feat, this ability uses the original spell level of the spell (a scroll\
    \ of empowered fireball counts as a 3rd-level spell).\nAt 3rd level, when using\
    \ a 4th-level or higher Wizard scroll as a scroll blade, the scrollmaster can\
    \ choose to reduce its enhancement bonus by 1 (minimum +1 enhancement bonus) to\
    \ treat it as a reach weapon. For example, he could use a scroll of charm monster\
    \ (a 4th-level Wizard spell) as either a +2 short sword or a +1 short sword with\
    \ reach.\nAt 5th level, when using a 4th-level or higher Wizard scroll as a scroll\
    \ blade, the scrollmaster can choose to reduce its enhancement bonus (to a minimum\
    \ of a +1 enhancement bonus) to give any of the following weapon properties: defending,\
    \ frost, icy burst, keen, ki focus, shock, shocking burst, speed. Adding any of\
    \ these properties consumes an amount of enhancement bonus equal to the property's\
    \ cost. The scrollmaster must know the prerequisite spell or spells to craft the\
    \ weapon property in question (for example, he must know haste to be able to give\
    \ his scroll blade the speed property)."

    \ and use his own Intelligence score and relevant feats to set the DC for the\
    \ spell, and can use his own caster level if it is higher than that of the scroll\
    \ (similar to a caster using a staff ). The scrollmaster must have already deciphered\
