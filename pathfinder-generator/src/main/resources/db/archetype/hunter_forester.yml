description: "While all hunters have a bond with the natural world, a forester has\
  \ a stronger tie to her environment than to the animals within it. While most foresters\
  \ feel strong bonds with woodland regions, the archetype functions well in other\
  \ terrains as well. In such cases, a forester might refer to herself by a different\
  \ name that more accurately reflects her chosen terrain. For example, a forester\
  \ who favors bogs and marshes might call herself a “swamper,\"while one who favors\
  \ frozen regions might call herself a “glacier guardian.\"As foresters gain levels\
  \ and take on new favored terrains, they often eschew such titles completely, viewing\
  \ them as unnecessary, and merely refer to themselves as guardians of the wild or\
  \ champions of nature's will--but regardless of the name, their devotion remains."
