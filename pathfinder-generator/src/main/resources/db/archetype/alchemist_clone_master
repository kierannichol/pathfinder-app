  description: "At 8th level, a clone master can prepare a clone of himself that awakens\
    \ if he is slain. Creating the clone costs 5,000 gp, takes 1 week of work, and\
    \ requires 3 additional weeks for the clone to grow to maturity. If he dies, the\
    \ clone awakens as if the alchemist had used the clone spell on himself. He can\
    \ have one inert of himself at a time. Unused clones created by a clone master\
    \ do not rot.\nThis ability replaces poison resistance +6 and poison immunity."
