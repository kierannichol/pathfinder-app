  description: "A brazen deceiver learns the deceptive tale bardic performance, allowing\
    \ him to weave magic into his lies and imbue the most fantastic claims with the\
    \ appearance of truth. While the brazen deceiver maintains this performance, he\
    \ takes half the normal penalty on Bluff checks for unlikely lies (rounding down\
    \ to -2). At 5th level, this effect also applies to Bluff checks for far-fetched\
    \ lies, and at 11th level, it applies to Bluff checks for impossible lies. Deceptive\
    \ tale relies on audible components."
