  description: "At 11th level, when a sword of valor critically hits an enemy with\
    \ a smite, the target must make a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the paladin's\
    \ level + the paladin's Charisma bonus) or be compelled to surrender to the paladin,\
    \ as if affected by a suggestion spell (CL = the paladin's level) to lay down\
    \ arms and give up the fight. An enemy that succumbs to this ability remains docile\
    \ until it is injured by the paladin or one of his obvious allies, at which point\
    \ the compulsion to surrender immediately ends and the enemy is free to make his\
    \ own choices again. If the enemy makes the save, it is not subject to this ability\
    \ for 24 hours. Worthy enemy is a mind-affecting effect."
