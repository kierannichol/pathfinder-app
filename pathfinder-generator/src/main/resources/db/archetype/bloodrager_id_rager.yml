  description: "An id rager chooses one emotional focus to define his core: anger,\
    \ dedication, despair, fear, hatred, jealousy, remorse, or zeal.\nAt 1st level,\
    \ he gains Skill Focus as a bonus feat in one skill associated with his atavistic\
    \ focus.\nAnger: Intimidate or Survival. Dedication: Diplomacy or Sense Motive.\
    \ Despair: Intimidate or Stealth. Fear: Intimidate or Stealth. Hatred: Acrobatics\
    \ or Perception. Jealousy: Appraise or Bluff. Remorse: Perception or Sense Motive.\
    \ Zeal: Acrobatics or Survival.\nWhen the id rager enters a bloodrage, he gains\
    \ additional powers as if he were a phantom with the emotional focus he selected\
    \ as his atavistic focus. He is considered to be both a phantom and a spiritualist\
    \ for the purposes of abilities whose effect references both a phantom and a spiritualist,\
    \ such as a dedication phantom's dutiful strike, and treats his bloodrager level\
    \ as both his spiritualist level and his phantom Hit Dice when determining abilities\
    \ and save DCs.\nThis ability does not allow the id rager to become incorporeal.\n\
    At 4th level, the id rager gains Lightning Reflexes, Great Fortitude, or Iron\
    \ Will as a bonus feat.\nAt 8th level, the id rager can meditate for 1 hour to\
    \ change his atavistic focus for 24 hours or until he decides to return to his\
    \ permanent atavistic focus as a free action. When he changes his focus, he loses\
    \ access to his Skill Focus feat and the feat he gained at 4th level, and he wields\
    \ emotional focus powers as if his spiritualist level and phantom Hit Dice were\
    \ 3 lower.\nAt 12th level, the id rager gains Skill Focus in both of the skills\
    \ associated with his atavistic focus. If circumstances cause him to lose one\
    \ Skill Focus feat, he loses both."
