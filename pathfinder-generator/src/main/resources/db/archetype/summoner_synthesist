  description: "A synthesist summons the essence of a powerful outsider to meld with\
    \ his own being. The synthesist wears the eidolon like translucent, living armor.\
    \ The eidolon mimics all of the synthesist's movements, and the synthesist perceives\
    \ through the eidolon's senses and speaks through its voice, as the two are now\
    \ one creature.\nWhile fused with his eidolon, the synthesist uses the eidolon's\
    \ physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution), but retains\
    \ his own mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma). The synthesist\
    \ gains the eidolon's hit points as temporary hit points. When these hit points\
    \ reach 0, the eidolon is killed and sent back to its home plane. The synthesist\
    \ uses the eidolon's base attack bonus, and gains the eidolon's armor and natural\
    \ armor bonuses and modifiers to ability scores. The synthesist also gains access\
    \ to the eidolon's special abilities and the eidolon's evolutions. The synthesist\
    \ is still limited to the eidolon's maximum number of natural attacks. The eidolon\
    \ has no skills or feats of its own. The eidolon must be at least the same size\
    \ as the synthesist. The eidolon must have limbs for the synthesist to cast spells\
    \ with somatic components. The eidolon's temporary hit points can be restored\
    \ with the rejuvenate eidolon spell.\nWhile fused, the synthesist loses the benefits\
    \ of his armor. He counts as both his original type and as an outsider for any\
    \ effect related to type, whichever is worse for the synthesist. Spells such as\
    \ banishment or dismissal work normally on the eidolon, but the synthesist is\
    \ unaffected. Neither the synthesist nor his eidolon can be targeted separately,\
    \ as they are fused into one creature. The synthesist and eidolon cannot take\
    \ separate actions. While fused with his eidolon, the synthesist can use all of\
    \ his own abilities and gear, except for his armor. In all other cases, this ability\
    \ functions as the summoner's normal eidolon ability (for example, the synthesist\
    \ cannot use his summon monster ability while the eidolon is present).\nThis ability\
    \ replaces the class's eidolon ability, bond senses, and life bond.\nThe following\
    \ class abilities function differently for synthesist summoners."
