description: "Not all barbarians hunt forests, plains, and mountains. Some are raiding\
  \ terrors on the sea and coasts, pillaging those who hoard treasure and pursuing\
  \ monsters of the deep. Some sea reavers are no more than hunters of the open sea,\
  \ while others are raiders striking fear into coastal settlements within reach of\
  \ the sea reavers' longships."
