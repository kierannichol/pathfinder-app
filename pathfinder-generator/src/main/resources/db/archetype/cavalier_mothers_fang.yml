  description: "Instead of the usual choices for a cavalier's mount, mother's fangs\
    \ ride on giant riding constrictors.\nThese use the statistics of the constrictor\
    \ snake druid animal companion, except that they are suitable mounts and begin\
    \ as size Large at 1st level with no other adjustments to their abilities or statistics\
    \ based on this size change.\nA serpent mount is considered to be a quadruped\
    \ for the purpose of determining its carrying capacity, and its base land speed\
    \ is 40 feet (other speeds are unaffected). At 4th level, a giant riding constrictor\
    \ doesn't increase in size again, but it does receive all the other usual 4th-level\
    \ benefits."

  description: "A mother's fang is expected to act as a military leader in wartime\
    \ and a governor in peace time, and as a result, he must be versed both in the\
    \ martial and political arts. At 1st level, he gains Combat Expertise as a bonus\
    \ feat, and if his Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the\
    \ sole purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats that require Combat\
    \ Expertise as a prerequisite.\nAt 2nd, 8th, and 15th levels, the mother's fang\
    \ gains a vigilante social talent and a bonus combat feat. When selecting his\
    \ vigilante social talent, a mother's fang can select celebrity discount, celebrity\
    \ perks, great renown, incredible renown, instant recognition, loyal aid, renown,\
    \ social grace, or triumphant return. He treats his cavalier level as his effective\
    \ vigilante level when determining whether he meets a talent's prerequisites,\
    \ as well as its effects. He gains the improved attitude and Intimidate bonuses\
    \ from renown as if he were in both social and vigilante identities.\nWhen selecting\
    \ skills with social grace, he must choose from the following list: Appraise,\
    \ Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Knowledge (geography, history, local, or nobility),\
    \ Perform, Profession (soldier), or Sense Motive.\nHe is always considered to\
    \ be in his social identity for the purpose of social grace (though he continues\
    \ to receive the benefits for both identities from renown). When selecting his\
    \ bonus combat feat, he can choose from only combat feats that list Combat Expertise\
    \ as a prerequisite."
