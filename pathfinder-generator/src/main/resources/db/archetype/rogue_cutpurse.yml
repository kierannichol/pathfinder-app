description: "Everyone who lives in the city understands that a wealthy man stays\
  \ wealthy by guarding his purse while wandering the streets and markets. Cutpurses\
  \ are often trained by guilds to collect the guild's tax from local businesses on\
  \ a daily basis, whether through intimidation or pickpocketing. Some find themselves\
  \ taking up the mantle of adventurer, and their talents are generally appreciated\
  \ in this role, but the cutpurse is still the first person her companions look to\
  \ when an Item goes missing."

  description: "When a cutpurse makes a Sleight of Hand check to take something from\
    \ a creature, the target makes its Perception check before the rogue makes her\
    \ Sleight of Hand check, and the rogue knows the Perception check result. She\
    \ can decide whether or not to make the check based on the results of the target's\
    \ Perception check. If the rogue elects not to make the check, she can make a\
    \ Bluff check, opposed by the target's Sense Motive, to prevent the target from\
    \ noticing the attempt."

  description: "At 3rd level, as a full-round action, a cutpurse can make an attack\
    \ and also make a Sleight of Hand check to steal something from the target of\
    \ the attack. If the attack deals sneak attack damage, the rogue can use Sleight\
    \ of Hand to take an Item from the creature during combat; otherwise this ability\
    \ can only be used in a surprise round before the target has acted. If the attack\
    \ is successful, the target takes a â€“5 penalty on the Perception check to notice\
    \ the theft.\nThis ability replaces trap sense.\nRogue Talents: The following\
    \ rogue talents complement the cutpurse archetype: combat swipe, fast fingers,\
    \ fast getaway, hard to fool, minor magic, slow reactions, and surprise attack."
