description: "Not all cavaliers are content to ride at the head of a charge, leading\
  \ from the front and facing down their enemies directly. Some prefer to stand away\
  \ from the fray, their banners a beacon shining brightly over the battlefield, rallying\
  \ their troops to victory. The standard bearer employs the banner of his order,\
  \ his lord, or his own house to raise the spirits of his allies and warns enemies\
  \ of impending doom."

    \ symbol of protection and inspiration to those around him. Once per day, while\
    \ his banner is displayed, the standard bearer can wave it through the air as\
    \ a full-round action, granting all allies within 60 feet temporary hit points\
    \ equal to 1/2 his cavalier level, and a +2 morale bonus on their next damage\
    \ rolls. At 15th level, and every four levels thereafter, this bonus increases\
    \ by +1 (to a maximum of +4 at 19th level). The temporary hit points last for\
    \ 10 minutes or until depleted, whichever occurs first."
