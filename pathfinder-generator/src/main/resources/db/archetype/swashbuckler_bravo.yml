  description: "A bravo gains Exotic Weapon Proficiency (dueling sword) as a bonus\
    \ feat.\nThe bravo is not proficient with bucklers, and does not gain Climb or\
    \ Swim as class skills.\nThis ability alters the swashbuckler's class skills and\
    \ armor proficiencies.\nDeeds: A bravo's training and personality set her apart\
    \ from the typical swashbuckler, and as a result of these differences (as well\
    \ as the impact of her training), she gains the following deeds. These deeds function\
    \ only when the bravo is wielding just a dueling sword."

    \ spend 1 panache point to make an additional attack with her dueling sword at\
    \ her highest attack bonus. If she reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points\
    \ with this additional attack, she regains 2 panache points rather than the normal\
    \ 1 point she would gain from striking a killing blow."
