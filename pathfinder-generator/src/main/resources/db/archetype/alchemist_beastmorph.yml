    \ features--whether those of an animal, a magical beast, an animal-like humanoid\

    \ uses his mutagen, he may gain a furry muzzle and pointed ears like a werewolf,\
    \ scaly skin like a lizardfolk or sahuagin, or compound eyes and mandibles like\
    \ a giant insect. The beastmorph also gains his choice of one of the abilities\
    \ listed in the alter self spell, which persists as long as the mutagen. He may\
    \ select a different ability each time he creates a mutagen."
