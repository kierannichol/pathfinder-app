  description: "A chosen one begins her adventuring career without fully understanding\
    \ her true potential. The chosen one uses the barbarian, rogue, sorcerer column\
    \ to calculate her typical starting age. She receives the smite evil ability at\
    \ 2nd level and the divine grace ability at 4th level. This does not affect the\
    \ rate at which she gains additional uses per day of smite evil, so she still\
    \ gains her second use at 4th level, her third at 7th level, and so on."

  description: "At 2nd level, a chosen one's familiar is able to borrow some of her\
    \ divine energy to heal itself and others. The familiar can use the chosen one's\
    \ lay on hands ability, including all of her mercies, but each such use consumes\
    \ two uses of the paladin's lay on hands ability. Starting at 4th level, the familiar\
    \ can also channel positive energy, but each such use consumes four uses of the\
    \ paladin's lay on hands ability."
