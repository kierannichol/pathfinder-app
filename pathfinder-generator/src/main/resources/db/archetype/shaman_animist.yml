  description: "At 2nd level, the animist interacts directly with unwholesome spirits\
    \ of the ills that trouble him or his people. To the animist, negative conditions\
    \ manifest as anthropomorphic spirits or are caused by such spirits (visited upon\
    \ the creature by bad magic). Either way, the animist can attempt to persuade\
    \ the spirit to leave its victim alone, thus performing a miraculous healing.\
    \ As the animist grows in power, he can simply inform these spirits that they\
    \ are unwelcome and command them to depart.\nThe animist can attempt a Diplomacy\
    \ check to persuade the condition's spirit to leave. Conditions the animist can\
    \ affect are ranked from minor to dire, with each category having an accompanying\
    \ Diplomacy DC (see below). The animist cannot take 10 or 20 on the check or receive\
    \ aid from any creature except another shaman. Failure by 5 or less means the\
    \ condition spirit is willing to leave the target and transfer to the animist\
    \ for the rest of the duration or until cured; this happens only if the animist\
    \ is willing. Failure by 10 or more means that not only is the target inflicted\
    \ with the condition, but the animist is as well (whether or not he is willing)\
    \ for the remaining duration or until cured.\nMinor Conditions (DC 15): Fatigued,\
    \ shaken, and sickened. Major Conditions (DC 20): Dazed and staggered. Severe\
    \ Conditions (DC 25): Exhausted, frightened, and nauseated. Dire Conditions (DC\
    \ 30): Blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and stunned.\nThe animist can use this ability\
    \ a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his shaman level + his Wisdom modifier.\
    \ Using this ability is a standard action that requires no contact or shared language\
    \ with the target, but it relies on audible components and the target must be\
    \ within 30 feet.\nUsing this ability is a standard action that requires no contact\
    \ or shared language with the target, but it includes verbal and somatic components.\
    \ If a target is afflicted with multiple conditions, the animist targets one condition\
    \ at a time (of her choosing). The animist cannot use this ability on himself.\n\
    At 5th level, the animist can use this ability to exorcise minor conditions without\
    \ needing to attempt a Diplomacy check. He can dispatch major conditions without\
    \ a roll at 9th level, severe conditions at 13th level, and dire conditions at\
    \ 17th level. Doing so still requires one use of this ability per condition."

    \ action that requires the animist to touch the target. The possessing or dominating\
    \ creature must attempt a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman level\
    \ + her Wisdom modifier. Failure means that the controlling effect ends or the\
    \ entity is immediately cast out of the target, as appropriate. If the possessing\
    \ entity is exorcised, it cannot attempt to dominate or possess that target again\
    \ for 24 hours. The animist can exorcise the same entity out of different targets,\
    \ but once the entity successfully saves against the animist's exorcism, it cannot\
    \ be affected by this ability again for 24 hours."

    \ and communicate with his familiar telepathically. The familiar retains its autonomy\
