  description: "At 7th level, a mantis zealot can emulate the Mantis God's grace and\
    \ move with a supernatural fluidity. As long as he is wearing light or no armor,\
    \ as a swift action he can gain uncanny dodge as per the rogue class feature.\
    \ He can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to his warpriest\
    \ level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in\
    \ 1-minute increments. If he already has the uncanny dodge ability from another\
    \ source, he instead gains improved uncanny dodge while this ability is active.\
    \ At 10th level, when he uses this ability, he also gains evasion as per the monk\
    \ class feature (or improved evasion if he already has evasion from another source).\
    \ At 13th level, he gains improved uncanny dodge instead of uncanny dodge. At\
    \ 16th level, he can activate this ability as part of making an initiative check,\
    \ before rolling the die. At 19th level, he gains improved evasion instead of\
    \ evasion."
