  description: "At 4th level, a divine tracker forms a close bond with his deity's\
    \ ethos. He selects two warpriest domains from among the domains granted by his\
    \ deity, and gains the minor blessings of those domains. A divine tracker can\
    \ select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment\
    \ matches that domain. If a divine tracker isn't devoted to a particular deity,\
    \ he still selects two blessings to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities,\
    \ subject to GM approval. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.\
    \ A divine tracker uses his ranger level as his warpriest level to determine the\
    \ effect of the blessing. At 13th level, a divine tracker gains the major blessing\
    \ from both of his domains."
