  description: "An enlightened bloodrager's sophisticated outlook allows him to cast\
    \ an expanded array of spells. Instead of his normal spells per day and spells\
    \ known for his bloodrager level, an enlightened bloodrager uses the spells per\
    \ day from the medium class. This grants him the ability to learn a number of\
    \ 0-level spells, which are cast like any other spells, but don't consume spell\
    \ slots and can be used again.\nThe enlightened bloodrager adds all 0-level spells\
    \ from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to his bloodrager spell list. He also adds\
    \ all druid spells of 4th level and lower (including 0-level spells). If a spell\
    \ appears on both the bloodrager spell list and the druid spell list, the enlightened\
    \ bloodrager uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. The\
    \ bloodrager treats any druid spells he takes with this ability as bloodrager\
    \ spells for the purposes of other abilities (such as greater bloodrage).\nAt\
    \ 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the enlightened bloodrager can choose\
    \ to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, he loses the\
    \ old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same\
    \ as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower\
    \ than the highest-level spell the enlightened bloodrager can cast. The enlightened\
    \ bloodrager can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose\
    \ whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known\
    \ for the level."

  description: "At 4th level, while bloodraging an enlightened bloodrager takes no\
    \ penalties to his AC, and can still use Intelligence-, Dexterity-, and Charisma-based\
    \ skills. This ability alters bloodrage and replaces the bloodline power gained\
    \ at 1st level. This replaces the bloodline power gained at 4th level.\nBloodline\
    \ Feat: At 6th level, an enlightened bloodrager adds Expanded Arcana, Nameless\
    \ One, and all feats that list Nameless One as a prerequisite to the list of feats\
    \ he can select as a bloodline feat. This replaces the damage reduction the bloodrager\
    \ gains at 7th, 10th, 13th, 16th, and 19th levels."
