name: "Untouchable Rager"
description: "While most bloodragers are known for their inexplicable ability to focus\
  \ their bloodline into a horrifying mix of martial terror and spellcasting fury,\
  \ from time to time a bloodrager's bloodline acts differently. Instead of empowering\
  \ the bloodrager, it shields the bloodrager from magic of all types, often keeping\
  \ the bloodrager untouched within the midst of magical effects."

  description: "At 4th level, instead of gaining spells, a bloodrager becomes resistant\
    \ to spells. While bloodraging, he gains spell resistance equal to 8 + his bloodrager\
    \ level. Unlike normal spell resistance, the untouchable rager's spell resistance\
    \ cannot be voluntarily lowered. As long as the untouchable is bloodraging, the\
    \ spell resistance is persistent, and can only be lowered by ending the bloodrage.\
    \ At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels (when other bloodragers would gain bloodline\
    \ spells), an untouchable rager's spell resistance from raging resistance is increased\
    \ by 1."
