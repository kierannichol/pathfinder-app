  description: "At 1st level, a mongrel mage has an innate pool of magical energy,\
    \ known as her mongrel reservoir, that she can draw upon to activate her weakened\
    \ bloodline. Her mongrel reservoir can hold an amount of magical energy equal\
    \ to 3 + her sorcerer level. Each day when refreshing her spell slots, her mongrel\
    \ reservoir is restored to full. The mongrel reservoir can never hold more points\
    \ that the total mentioned above; points gained in excess of this maximum are\
    \ lost.\nEach day when she refreshes her spell slots, the mongrel mage selects\
    \ one sorcerer bloodline. She must select an ordinary bloodline with this ability,\
    \ not one altered by the wildblooded archetype or any other archetype. She gains\
    \ this bloodline's 1st-level bloodline power for that day, using it as if she\
    \ were only a 1st-level sorcerer. (If this ability is used to gain an arcane bond\
    \ and the bonded item is selected, she can use the item only to cast a 1st-level\
    \ spell known, as she counts as only a 1st-level sorcerer.) A mongrel mage can\
    \ have only one bloodline selected at a time.\nAs a swift action, she can expend\
    \ 1 point from her mongrel reservoir to activate that bloodline, allowing her\
    \ to use its 1st-level bloodline powers as well as its bloodline arcana at her\
    \ full sorcerer level, including using a bonded item from an arcane bond. This\
    \ lasts for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1).\nAt\
    \ 3rd level, when activating her selected bloodline, a mongrel mage can instead\
    \ spend 2 points from her mongrel reservoir to allow her to use the bloodline's\
    \ 1st- and 3rd-level powers as well as its bloodline arcana at her full sorcerer\
    \ level for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1).\nAt\
    \ 7th level, when a mongrel mage is activating her selected bloodline, the mongrel\
    \ mage can instead spend 3 points from her mongrel reservoir, allowing her to\
    \ use the bloodline's 1st-, 3rd-, and 7th-level powers as well as its bloodline\
    \ arcana at her full sorcerer level for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma\
    \ bonus.\nAt 20th level, when activating her selected bloodline, a mongrel mage\
    \ can instead spend 5 points from her mongrel reservoir, allowing her to use all\
    \ of the bloodline's powers as well as its bloodline arcana at her full sorcerer\
    \ level for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1)."
