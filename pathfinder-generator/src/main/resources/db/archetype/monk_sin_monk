    The next person he hits with a melee attack before the end of his next turn must\
    \ succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the sin monk's class level + his Wisdom\
    \ modifier) or suffer the burden of the sin monk's sins. The target is treated\
    \ as if she were carrying a load one step heavier (from a light load to a medium\
    \ load, and so on) and must succeed at a caster level check to use any form of\
    \ teleportation (DC = 10 + the monk's class level). This is a curse effect that\
    \ lasts a number of rounds equal to the sin monk's Wisdom modifier unless it is\

    \ his sins. He is forevermore treated as an aberration rather than a humanoid\
    \ (or whatever the monk's creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical\
    \ effects, and his mind is so consumed by sin that he gains immunity to mind-affecting\
    \ effects.\nHe does not change in appearance or gain other abilities; however,\
    \ should the sin monk be slain and brought back from the dead, he returns to life\
    \ as a sinspawn, retaining his class levels but otherwise replacing his creature\
    \ type and racial abilities with those of his new form and becoming an NPC under\
    \ the GM's control."
