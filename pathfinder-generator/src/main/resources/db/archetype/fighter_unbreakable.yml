description: "The unbreakable is a warrior of indomitable will, unstoppable and implacable\
  \ once he has set his mind upon a course of action. The unbreakable endures any\
  \ trial to do what must be done, and when his mind is set toward a goal, nothing\
  \ can stop him from achieving it, though many may try. He is a juggernaut and a\
  \ zealot, supremely confident in his own abilities."
