  description: "At 4th level, an opportunist can select an edge from those listed\
    \ below. Every 4 levels beyond 4th, he can select one additional edge, to a maximum\
    \ of five at level 20.\nThis ability replaces the bonus feats gained at 4th, 8th,\
    \ 12th, 16th, and 20th levels.\nAlchemical Admixture (Ex)\nAs a full-round action\
    \ that provokes an attack of opportunity, the opportunist can combine two alchemical\
    \ weapons into a single vial. When thrown as a splash weapon, the mixture has\
    \ the effects of both component substances and targets are affected as if hit\
    \ by both. The mixture becomes inert after 1 hour. Combining identical alchemical\
    \ weapons has no effect.\nThe opportunist can use this ability once per day for\
    \ every 4 fighter levels he has.\nAlchemical Refinement (Ex)\nThe opportunist\
    \ increases the save DC of any alchemical item he crafts by 1 for every 3 fighter\
    \ levels he has. Doing so increases the raw material cost to craft that item by\
    \ 10 gp for every +1 increase. This bonus applies only when the opportunist uses\
    \ the crafted alchemical item himself; it functions as a normal item of its type\
    \ for all other users.\nBombs (Ex)\nThe opportunist can make a number of bombs\
    \ per day equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). These bombs act as alchemist's\
    \ bombs and deal 1d6 points of fire damage, plus an additional 1d6 points for\
    \ every 3 fighter levels the opportunist has.\nClouded Shift (Ex)\nAs part of\
    \ the standard action to ignite a smokestick or smoke pellet, the opportunist\
    \ can take a 5-foot step, even if he has already moved this round. He can use\
    \ this ability only if he has not already taken a 5-foot step this round, and\
    \ only if the smoke from his alchemical tool conceals his starting location.\n\
    Poison Use (Ex)\nThe opportunist no longer risks poisoning himself when applying\
    \ poison to a weapon.\nRogue Talent (Ex)"
