description: "The myrmidarch is a skilled specialist, using magic to supplement
  and augment his martial mastery. Less inclined to mix the two than a typical
  magus, the myrmidarch seeks supremacy with blade, bow, and armor."

    name: "Ranged Spellstrike"
    description: "At 4th level, a myrmidarch can use spellstrike to cast a
      single-target touch attack ranged spell and deliver it through a ranged
      weapon attack. Even if the spell can normally affect multiple targets,
      only a single missile, ray, or effect accompanies the attack.

      At 11th level, a myrmidarch can spend a full-round action to cast a spell
      that includes multiple ranged touch attacks and deliver more than one
      using ranged attacks. The spell must have a casting time of 1 full-round
      action or less. This functions similarly to the base ability of ranged
      spellstrike, but the myrmidarch can deliver a number of missiles, rays, or
      effect up to the number of attacks he could make with a full attack.
      Attacks beyond the first take penalties as if the myrmidarch were making a
      full attack. Any effects not used in the round the spell is cast are lost,
      as are any additional ranged touch attacks the spell would allow beyond
      the myrmidarch's maximum number of attacks.

      This ability replaces spell recall and improved spell recall.\n"
