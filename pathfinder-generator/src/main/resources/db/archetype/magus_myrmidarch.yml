  description: "At 4th level, a myrmidarch can use spellstrike to cast a single-target\
    \ touch attack ranged spell and deliver it through a ranged weapon attack. Even\
    \ if the spell can normally affect multiple targets, only a single missile, ray,\
    \ or effect accompanies the attack.\nAt 11th level, a myrmidarch can spend a full-round\
    \ action to cast a spell that includes multiple ranged touch attacks and deliver\
    \ more than one using ranged attacks. The spell must have a casting time of 1\
    \ full-round action or less. This functions similarly to the base ability of ranged\
    \ spellstrike, but the myrmidarch can deliver a number of missiles, rays, or effect\
    \ up to the number of attacks he could make with a full attack. Attacks beyond\
    \ the first take penalties as if the myrmidarch were making a full attack. Any\
    \ effects not used in the round the spell is cast are lost, as are any additional\
    \ ranged touch attacks the spell would allow beyond the myrmidarch's maximum number\
    \ of attacks.\nThis ability replaces spell recall and improved spell recall.\n"
