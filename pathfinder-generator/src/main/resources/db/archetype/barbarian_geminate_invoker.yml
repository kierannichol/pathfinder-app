    description: "A geminate invoker adds Knowledge (history), Knowledge (religion),
      and Linguistics to his list of class skills. Unlike most barbarians, a
      geminate invoker can be lawful, but must maintain a neutral element to his
      alignment. A geminate invoker who ceases to be neutral-aligned cannot
      activate his trance ability."

    name: "Trance"
    description: "As a free action, a geminate invoker can enter a self-imposed
      trance, ignoring the physical limits of his body. This ability functions
      similarly to a barbarian's rage, except where noted below, and feats,
      spells, and abilities that affect a barbarian's rage (such as the Extra
      Rage feat) apply to an geminate invoker's trance. A geminate invoker gains
      rage powers as per a normal barbarian, but he can never gain totem rage
      powers via this ability.

      Instead of the normal rage bonuses and penalties, a geminate invoker in a
      trance gains a +4 morale bonus to his Constitution; gains a +2 morale
      bonus on Reflex and Will saving throws; takes no penalties to AC; can
      still use Dexterity-, Intelligence-, and Charisma-based skills; and gains
      Diehard as a bonus feat. The Constitution bonus increases to +6 and the
      save bonus increases to +3 when he gains greater rage, and they increase
      to a +8 Constitution bonus and a +4 bonus on saves when he gains mighty
      rage."

    description: "At 3rd level, a geminate invoker gains the power to sense and
      absorb lingering spiritual energy. This functions identically to the
      medium class ability of the same name, except the geminate invoker deals
      1d6 points of damage to haunts for every 3 barbarian levels he has."

    name: "Spirit Conduit"
    description: "At 4th level, a geminate invoker can invite a spirit into his body
      each time he enters a trance, gaining a lesser totem rage power for the
      duration of his trance. He can select a new totem each time he enters his
      trance, though the GM might rule that certain totem spirits are simply not
      available in certain locations (such as channeling a celestial totem in an
      evil god's temple). Invoking a totem counter to his alignment (such as a
      neutral good character invoking a fiend totem) requires the geminate
      invoker to succeed at a DC 12 Charisma check each round to dominate the
      spirit. Failure indicates the spirit escapes, immediately ending the
      trance.

      At 8th level, the geminate invoker gains a second totem rage power, though
      it must use the previously granted lesser totem rage power as a
      prerequisite. At 12th level, he also gains the greater totem rage power
      that uses the previously granted powers as prerequisites."
