    \ in effect, the vindictive bastard gains a deflection bonus equal to her Charisma\

    \ target of vindictive smite has rendered an ally of the vindictive bastard unconscious\
    \ or dead within the last 24 hours, the bonus on damage rolls on the first attack\
    \ that hits increases by 2 for every paladin level she has.\nThe vindictive smite\
