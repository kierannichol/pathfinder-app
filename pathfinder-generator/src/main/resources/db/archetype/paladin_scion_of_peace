    \ she can expend an additional use of smite evil to grant her eagle the bonuses\
    \ granted from smite evil as well. This ability functions like the druid animal\
    \ companion ability, using the scion's paladin level as her effective druid level."

    \ votes last, and in the case of a tie, her vote breaks the tie."
