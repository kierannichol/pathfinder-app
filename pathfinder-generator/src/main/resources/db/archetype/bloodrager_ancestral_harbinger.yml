  description: "At 2nd level, an ancestral harbinger can call upon her ancestors to\
    \ aid her in combat, summoning a weapon of force that functions as per spiritual\
    \ weapon. At 6th level, her ancestral spirit can take the form of a savage creature,\
    \ functioning as per summon nature's ally II (this can't be used to summon multiple\
    \ creatures from the summon nature's ally I list). At 12th level, her ancestor\
    \ can manifest physically as a ghostly figure, functioning as per spiritual ally.\
    \ At 18th level, her ancestral spirit can manifest either as a single powerful\
    \ creature or as multiple lesser ancestors, functioning as per summon nature's\
    \ ally VI. The harbinger chooses which spell this ability functions as at the\
    \ time of casting, and can use this ability while in a bloodrage. The ancestral\
    \ harbinger can use this ability once per day, plus an additional time per day\
    \ for every 4 bloodrager levels she possesses beyond 2nd."

  description: "At 5th level, an ancestral harbinger adds summon monster I to her\
    \ class spell list and gains it as a bonus spell known. She also gains summon\
    \ monster II at 8th level, summon monster III at 11th level, and summon monster\
    \ IV at 14th level. These spells can be used only to summon types of monsters\
    \ with strong ties to the ancestral harbinger's family history, ranging from clan\
    \ totems to monsters of the same type as those famously killed by her forebears.\
    \ For each of these spells, the ancestral harbinger selects a number of monsters\
    \ she can summon equal to her Charisma bonus (minimum 1) to represent these spirits.\
    \ These monsters are selected from the options on the summon monster creature\
    \ list or the Expanded Summon Monster list that are appropriate for the spell\
    \ level.\nAt 7th level and every 2 bloodrager levels thereafter, the ancestral\
    \ harbinger can swap one selected monster from one of these spells for a new monster\
    \ from the same level's summoning lists.\nThe ancestral harbinger has a mystic\
    \ tie to the spirit servants summoned with this ability. When the ancestral harbinger\
    \ is in a bloodrage, all of her spirit servants gain a +2 morale bonus to AC and\
    \ on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. The spirit servants also gain\
    \ 2 temporary hit points per Hit Die. At 11th level, the morale bonus increases\
    \ to +3 and the number of temporary hit points per Hit Die increases to 3. At\
    \ 20th level, the morale bonus increases to +4 and the number of temporary hit\
    \ points per Hit Die increases to 4. The morale bonus and temporary hit points\
    \ last until the bloodrage ends."
