    \ supplement her divine powers and greatly aid her when she heals the sick and\
    \ wounded. She gains a competence bonus on Profession (herbalist) checks equal\
    \ to 1/2 her oracle level (minimum 1), and uses her Charisma modifier in place\
    \ of her Wisdom modifier when attempting Profession (herbalist) checks. Additionally,\
    \ a divine herbalist can identify potions as if via detect magic using Profession\
    \ (herbalist) instead of Spellcraft, and she can attempt such a check after holding\
    \ a potion for 1 round."

  description: "A divine herbalist combines alchemy, acupuncture, and divine magic\
    \ to heal wounds by touch. She can use this ability a number of times per day\
    \ equal to 1 + her Charisma modifier. With one use of this ability, she uses positive\
    \ energy to heal the target of 1d6 hit points for every 2 oracle levels she has.\
    \ Using this ability is a standard action unless the oracle targets herself, in\
    \ which case it is a swift action. Using this ability requires only one free hand.\
    \ This ability counts as a paladin's lay on hands ability for the purposes of\
    \ feats, spells, and effects that work with that class feature when it is used\
    \ for healing purposes. Unlike lay on hands, this ability cannot be used to harm\
    \ undead."

  description: "At 7th level, whenever a divine herbalist heals a living creature\
    \ with her healer's way ability, as a free action she can attempt a Profession\
    \ (herbalist) check to remove a condition from the target, with each condition\
    \ having an accompanying Profession (herbalist) DC (see the list below). She cannot\
    \ take 10 or 20 on this check, nor can she receive aid from any creature except\
    \ another divine herbalist (though the practitioner need not be an oracle). Failure\
    \ by 5 or more causes the target to become sickened for 1 round (if the divine\
    \ herbalist is attempting to remove the sickened condition, this extends it by\
    \ 1 round). Similarly, failure by 10 or more instead causes the target to become\
    \ nauseated for 1 round or to have its existing nauseated condition extended by\
    \ 1 round. A creature that cannot be sickened or nauseated cannot have conditions\
    \ removed by this ability.\nMinor Conditions (DC 20): Fatigued, shaken, and sickened.\
    \ Major Conditions (DC 25): Dazed and staggered. Severe Conditions (DC 30): Confused,\
    \ exhausted, frightened, and nauseated. Dire Conditions (DC 35): Blinded, deafened,\
    \ paralyzed, and stunned.\nThis ability replaces the revelation gained at 7th\
    \ level."
