  description: "At 4th level, a drovier can imbue her allies (including herself )\
    \ with an aspect of a wild animal. As a standard action, she chooses an animal\
    \ totem and grants the abilities of that totem to every ally within 30 feet. This\
    \ otherwise functions like the spell animal aspect. She can use this ability for\
    \ 10 minutes per druid level each day. This duration does not need to be consecutive,\
    \ but it must be used in 10-minute increments. If she uses the ability to grant\
    \ a new aspect, any previous aspect immediately ends.\nAt 6th level, the drovier's\
    \ communal aspect ability grants the benefits of the spell greater animal aspect.\
    \ The drovier can still choose only one aspect to grant her allies.\nAt 8th level,\
    \ the drovier can choose to grant her allies the benefits of the spell aspect\
    \ of the falcon instead of an animal aspect.\nAt 10th level, the drovier can choose\
    \ to grant her allies the benefits of the spell aspect of the bear instead of\
    \ an animal aspect.\nAt 12th level, the drovier can choose to grant her allies\
    \ the benefits of the spell aspect of the stag instead of an animal aspect.\n\
    At 14th level, the drovier can choose to grant her allies the benefits of the\
    \ spell aspect of the wolf rather than an animal aspect.\nAt 20th level, the drovier\
    \ can use this ability at will."
