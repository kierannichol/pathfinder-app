  description: "A faithful wanderer doesn't have an aura of good like other paladins\
    \ do, as this would give her presence away to hostile denizens of the Abyssal\
    \ wastelands.\nHer other auras likewise don't reveal her presence. The benefits\
    \ of her aura of courage, aura of resolve, aura of faith, and aura of righteousness\
    \ affect only her. At 3rd level, her alignment aura emulates the alignment planar\
    \ traits of her current location (chaotic evil in the Abyss) for the purposes\
    \ of alignment-detection effects, though this doesn't change her actual alignment.\
    \ At 8th level, she takes no penalties from the mildly chaos-aligned and mildly\
    \ evil-aligned planar traits and treats all opposed strongly aligned planar traits\
    \ as if they were only mildly aligned. At 11th level, she takes no penalties even\
    \ in areas with strongly chaos- and evil-aligned planar traits. At 14th level,\
    \ she leaves no trail in areas with chaos- and evil-aligned planar traits, can't\
    \ be tracked in such terrain, and can use Stealth to hide in such terrain, even\
    \ if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment. At 17th level, she can use\
    \ Stealth to hide in areas with these planar traits even while being observed."

  description: "A faithful wanderer isn't interested in going out in a blaze of glory\
    \ after exhausting a limited ability to smite evil. Instead, she has developed\
    \ techniques to evade, stalk, and punish evil whenever necessary. She gains a\
    \ +2 bonus on Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, Stealth, and Survival checks\
    \ against evil outsiders, as well as a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls\
    \ against them. These bonuses don't stack with favored enemy bonuses. At 5th level\
    \ and every 5 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 2 (to a maximum of\
    \ +10 at 20th level). At 7th level, the faithful wanderer also gains these bonuses\
    \ against undead, and at 13th level, she also gains these bonuses against evil\
    \ dragons."

  description: "At 5th level, a faithful wanderer must choose the weapon option of\

    \ Additionally, if she rolls a natural 20 on an attack roll against an evil outsider\
    \ and confirms the critical hit, the outsider is also subject to banishment, using\
    \ the faithful wanderer's paladin level as the caster level (her weapon and holy\
    \ symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). Finally, whenever\
    \ she uses lay on hands to heal herself, she heals the maximum possible amount\
    \ of hit points."
