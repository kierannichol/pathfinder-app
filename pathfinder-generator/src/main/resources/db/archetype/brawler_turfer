  description: "At 3rd level, a turfer chooses a type of terrain from the ranger's\
    \ favored terrain list. When in that type of terrain, she gains a +2 bonus on\
    \ initiative checks and a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD.\nAt 7th\
    \ level and every 4 brawler levels thereafter, the turfer chooses an additional\
    \ terrain in which to gain these bonuses. Each time, in one selected terrain (including\
    \ the one just chosen), her bonus on initiative checks increases by 2, and her\
    \ bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD increases by 1."

  description: "At 4th level, a turfer gains the benefits of endure elements and a\
    \ +10-foot enhancement bonus to her base speed, but only in her favored terrains.\
    \ In addition, she can move through difficult terrain in her favored terrains\
    \ at her normal speed without taking damage or suffering any other impairment,\
    \ but she can't do so through difficult terrain that has been magically manipulated.\
    \ At 10th and 16th levels, her enhancement bonus to her base speed increases by\
    \ 10 feet within her favored terrains. The turfer loses this ability if she wears\
    \ medium or heavy armor or carries a medium or heavy load."
