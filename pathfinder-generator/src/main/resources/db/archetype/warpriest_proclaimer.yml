description: "A proclaimer is the polar opposite of a faithful wanderer (see above),\
  \ rushing into Abyss-twisted wastes with nothing but his weapon in his hand and\
  \ his faith in his heart, shouting his deity's name to the skies. Most proclaimers\
  \ don't survive their first day in a hostile environment, but those who do become\
  \ the stuff of legend, bolstering the spirits of crusaders near and far."

  description: "At 2nd level, a proclaimer can hold his weapon aloft and shout his\
    \ deity's name as a swift action, spending one use of fervor to deal 1d6 points\
    \ of damage to all evil outsiders within 5 feet. At 5th level and every 3 levels\
    \ thereafter, this damage increases by an additional 1d6. This damage has the\
    \ same alignment as the proclaimer's deity. At 7th level, the effect expands to\
    \ include an area within 10 feet of the proclaimer, and it expands by 5 feet every\
    \ 6 levels thereafter. A proclaimer can't use fervor to damage undead or to heal."

  description: "At 4th level, when a proclaimer uses fervor to damage evil outsiders\
    \ with his cleanser of evil ability, he can spend one additional use of fervor\
    \ as a move action to create a zone of sanctification in the same area for 1 round.\
    \ All evil outsiders in the zone when it becomes active must succeed at a Will\
    \ saving throw (DC 10 + half the proclaimer's level + his Wisdom modifier) or\
    \ be pushed back until they are out of the area.\nEvil outsiders that end their\
    \ turns in the area take damage as if affected by cleanser of evil."
