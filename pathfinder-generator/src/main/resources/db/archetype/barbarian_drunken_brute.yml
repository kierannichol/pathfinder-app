  description: "While raging, the drunken brute can drink a potion, or a tankard of\
    \ ale or similar quantity of alcohol, as a move action that does not provoke attacks\
    \ of opportunity. A potion has its normal effect, while an alcoholic drink allows\
    \ the barbarian to maintain her rage that round without expending a round of rage\
    \ for the day (instead of the alcohol's normal effects). For each alcoholic drink\
    \ consumed while raging, the barbarian is nauseated for 1 round when her rage\
    \ expires, in addition the normal fatigue that follows a rage. Tireless rage does\
    \ not negate this nauseated condition but the internal fortitude rage power does.\n\
    This ability replaces fast movement."
