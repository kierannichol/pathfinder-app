description: "Some rangers devote their lives to the woods, becoming hunters, protectors,\
  \ and wilderness guides among its diverse terrain types. The deep walker is instead\
  \ a master of the strange terrain of the deep earth, exploring its caverns and caves,\
  \ becoming a master of the dark corridors most surface dwellers fear to explore--and\
  \ perhaps the reason they fear to explore them."
