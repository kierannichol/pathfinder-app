  description: "At 1st level, a prowler at world's end gains the ability to channel\
    \ the spirits of creation, granting him the medium's spirit and spirit surge abilities.\
    \ A prowler channels the cheetah (which acts as the trickster), the leopard (which\
    \ acts as the guardian), the lion (which acts as the marshal), and the tiger (which\
    \ acts as the champion). The prowler does not have access to the archmage or hierophant\
    \ legends. The favored locations for these spirits are altars, churches, sacred\
    \ groves, and shrines, and their taboo requires the prowler to strongly revere\
    \ nature and attempt to either destroy or incapacitate evil wherever he encounters\
    \ it.\nA prowler at world's end gains his spirit's lesser power at 1st level,\
    \ its intermediate power at 8th level, and its greater power at 16th level. A\
    \ prowler's spirit surge bonus never advances beyond 1d6."

    \ he can apply the effects of beast shape IV to himself instead of using greater\

    \ himself. He must assume the form of a great cat of the same kind as a channeled\
    \ spirit (cheetah, leopard, lion, or tiger). This effect lasts for as long as\
    \ the prowler continues bloodraging, regardless of its normal duration, and using\
