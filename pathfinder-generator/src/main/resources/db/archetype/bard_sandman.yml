  description: "A sandman gains the following types of bardic performance:\nStealspell\
    \ (Su): A sandman can use performance to steal spells from his foes and add them\
    \ to his list of spells known. Once the performance is started, the bard can steal\
    \ a prepared spell or a spell known from another creature with a touch attack\
    \ as a standard action. The target receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's\
    \ level + the bard's Cha bonus) to negate the effect. The sandman may choose a\
    \ spell to steal, but if the target does not possess the spell, the bardic performance\
    \ immediately ends. Otherwise the spell stolen is random, but it is always of\
    \ the highest level that the bard can cast, if possible. The target loses the\
    \ prepared spell or spell known and the sandman adds it to his list of spells\
    \ known for as long as the performance continues, after which it reverts to the\
    \ original recipient. While stolen, the bard can cast the spell using his available\
    \ spell slots. This use does not consume the stolen spell. If the bard steals\
    \ another spell while a spell is stolen, the previous spell immediately reverts\
    \ to its original owner. This ability requires visual components.\nThis performance\
    \ replaces inspire courage.\nSlumber Song (Sp): At 6th level, a sandman can use\
    \ his performance to cause a creature he has already fascinated to fall asleep\
    \ (as deep slumber, but with no HD limit). Otherwise, this ability functions like\
    \ suggestion.\nThis performance replaces suggestion.\nDramatic Subtext (Su): At\
    \ 9th level, a sandman can use bardic performance to cast spells without obvious\
    \ visual or audible components while retaining the spell's normal effects. Observers\
    \ must succeed at a Perception check opposed by a sandman's Sleight of Hand check\
    \ to notice that the sandman is the source of the spellcasting (though spellcasting\
    \ still provokes attacks of opportunity). The bard must use this performance for\
    \ at least 2 rounds before casting a spell; otherwise he is automatically detected\
    \ and the performance ends.\nThis ability replaces inspire greatness.\nGreater\
    \ Stealspell (Su): A sandman's stealspell power improves at 15th level. When a\
    \ target fails a save against his stealspell performance, the sandman discovers\
    \ its spell resistance (if any) and all spells it has prepared or knows. He can\
    \ then choose which spell to steal. The sandman may forgo stealing a spell and\
    \ instead reduce the target's SR by an amount equal to half his bard level and\
    \ gain that amount of spell resistance for as long as he continues performing.\
    \ If he steals additional spell resistance, it stacks with previously stolen SR.\
    \ If he steals a spell or ceases performing, the spell resistance immediately\
    \ reverts back to its owner.\nThis performance replaces inspire heroics.\nMass\
    \ Slumber Song (Sp): At 18th level, a sandman can use slumber song to affect any\
    \ number of fascinated creatures within 30 feet. Otherwise, this ability functions\
    \ like mass suggestion.\nThis performance replaces mass suggestion.\nSpell Catching\
    \ (Su): At 20th level, a sandman who saves against a spell or spell-like ability\
    \ that targets only him (not including area spells) may use bardic performance\
    \ as an immediate action. He must attempt a caster level check (DC 10 + the spell's\
    \ original caster level). If it succeeds, the sandman can absorb the spell effect\
    \ without harm and immediately recast that spell (using the original caster's\
    \ level and save DC) or any spell he knows of that level or lower. Using this\
    \ ability consumes a number of rounds of bardic performance equal to the spell's\
    \ level, even if the check fails."
