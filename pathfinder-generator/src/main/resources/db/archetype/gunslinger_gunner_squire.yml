  description: "At 1st level, as a standard action, a gunner squire can spend 1 grit\
    \ point to pinpoint a target within her line of sight and inform her knightly\
    \ liege of the target's exact location. During the knight's next turn, if he makes\
    \ a ranged attack against the pinpointed target and would take a penalty on his\
    \ attack roll due to range, he may reduce this penalty by an amount equal to his\
    \ gunner squire's Wisdom modifier (to a minimum penalty of 0). The gunner squire\
    \ must be adjacent to her liege and able to communicate to use this deed, though\
    \ a knight may move away from the gunner squire during his turn and still gain\
    \ the benefits of this deed."

  description: "At 3rd level, as a full-round action, a gunner squire can spend 1\
    \ grit point to reload a one-handed or two-handed firearm she is holding. If the\
    \ firearm has multiple barrels, she can reload a number of barrels per round equal\
    \ to her Dexterity modifier (minimum 1). A gunner squire equipped with alchemical\
    \ cartridges (see Ultimate Equipment) can use this deed to reload multiple firearms\
    \ at once, dividing the number of barrels she's able to reload among the firearms\
    \ she is carrying however she wishes, even if this would mean stowing and retrieving\
    \ multiple firearms from her equipment with one action. Abilities, deeds, and\
    \ feats that decrease reloading time (such as Rapid Reload) do not improve this\
    \ deed."
