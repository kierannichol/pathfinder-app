  description: "A strong-side boxer can use her off hand as if it were a buckler,\
    \ gaining a +1 natural armor bonus to her AC as long as she does not use her off\
    \ hand to make attacks. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, this bonus\
    \ increases by 1, to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.\nWhile using her off hand\
    \ in this manner, the strong-side boxer treats that hand as a buckler for the\
    \ purposes of other feats and abilities (though she is also considered to have\
    \ a free hand)."

  description: "A strong-side boxer can spend 1 minute to wrap one of her hands in\
    \ rope or cord. The strong-side boxer can carry items or wield weapons in a wrapped\
    \ hand, but she takes a â€“2 penalty on Dexterity-based skill checks that requires\
    \ the use of that hand (such as Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks). Unwrapping\
    \ a hand is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.\nAt 3rd level,\
    \ as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a strong-side boxer\
    \ can dip her wrapped hand in resin and then crushed glass or small metal spikes,\
    \ which remain on her wrapped hand for 1 hour. If she chooses crushed glass, she\
    \ can deal slashing damage with her unarmed strikes; if she chooses spikes, she\
    \ can deal piercing damage with her unarmed strikes for the duration. Whether\
    \ she chooses crushed glass or metal spikes, she deals an additional 1 point of\
    \ bleed damage with her unarmed strikes. At 7th level, the bleed damage increases\
    \ to 1d4. At 11th level, the bleed damage increases to 1d6. At 15th level, the\
    \ bleed damage increases to 2d4. At 19th level, the bleed damage is multiplied\
    \ on a critical hit. Bleed damage from this ability does not stack with bleed\
    \ damage from other sources."

  description: "At 5th level, a strong-side boxer can spend 1 minute to wrap one of\
    \ her legs in a chain, and can thereafter use the chain-wrapped leg both defensively\
    \ and offensively. While her leg is wrapped, she is considered to be wearing a\
    \ chain shirt, gaining all the appropriate bonuses and penalties. The chain can\
    \ be enchanted as armor and is treated as masterwork. Once per round while wearing\
    \ the chain, she can apply a +4 circumstance bonus to a trip attempt as an immediate\
    \ action."
