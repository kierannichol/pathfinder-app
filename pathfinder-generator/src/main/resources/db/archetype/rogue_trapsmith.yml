description: "Some rogues are not content with just disabling traps--they love to\
  \ build them, finding a captivating beauty in the turning of gears and the slither\
  \ of ropes over pulleys. The trapsmith may have started out putting together traps\
  \ in order to better understand how to disable them, but for most, it's long since\
  \ gone beyond that--they now relish the challenge of creating the perfect combat\
  \ machine."

  description: "At 8th level, whenever a trapsmith disarms a trap using Disable Device,\
    \ she can bypass it even if her check did not exceed the DC by 10 or more. If\
    \ it is a magic trap that allows specific creatures to pass it without danger,\
    \ she can modify which creatures it allows to pass, adding her allies and restricting\
    \ enemies if she desires.\nThis ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.\nRogue\
    \ Talents: The following rogue talents complement the trapsmith archetype: befuddling\
    \ strike, cunning trigger, quick disable, and quick trapsmith."
