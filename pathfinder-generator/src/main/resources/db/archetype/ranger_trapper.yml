  description: "At 5th level, a trapper learns how to create a snare trap and one\
    \ other ranger trap of her choice.\nAt 7th level and every two levels thereafter,\
    \ she learns another trap. The trapper can use these traps a total number of times\
    \ per day equal to 1/2 her ranger level + her Wisdom modifier. Once a trap is\
    \ learned, it can't be unlearned and replaced with a different type of trap. The\
    \ trapper cannot select an individual trap more than once."
