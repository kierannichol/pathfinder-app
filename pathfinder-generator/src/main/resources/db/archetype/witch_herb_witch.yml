  description: "Herb witches are masters of herbalism, and they can use what they\
    \ gather from garden or grove to duplicate many of the effects of alchemy. An\
    \ herb witch can attempt Profession (herbalist) checks in place of Craft (alchemy)\
    \ checks, and she gains a bonus on Profession (herbalist) checks equal to half\
    \ her class level.\nHerb witches are adept at brewing thick herbal cure-alls called\
    \ remedies. An herb witch prepares these remedies while communing with her familiar,\
    \ during which she can prepare a number of remedies equal to 3 + her Intelligence\
    \ modifier (minimum 1 remedy). A remedy becomes inert if it leaves the herb witch's\
    \ possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to her keeping. A witch can never\
    \ have more remedies than 3 + her Intelligence modifier.\nAs a standard action,\
    \ the herb witch can administer a remedy to herself or a creature within reach\
    \ which consumes the remedy. The herb witch attempts a Profession (herbalist)\
    \ check against the save DC of any one disease or poison currently afflicting\
    \ the consumer. If she is successful, the affliction is suppressed for 1 minute.\
    \ At 10th level, if she exceeds the DC of the check by 10 or more, the affliction\
    \ immediately ends. If the disease or poison doesn't allow saving throws, the\
    \ remedy is ineffective.\nAn herb witch can also use a remedy to attempt to remove\
    \ the blinded, deafened, fatigued, nauseated, sickened, and staggered conditions.\
    \ This requires a Profession (herbalist) check with a DC equal to the spell or\
    \ effect that caused the condition, or a DC 25 check if the condition was caused\
    \ by an effect that doesn't allow a saving throw. If the herb witch succeeds,\
    \ the condition is removed unless the condition is permanent; at 10th level, if\
    \ the herb witch succeeds by 10 or more, her remedy can remove a permanent condition.\n\
    Only a single condition, disease, or poison can be removed with each application\
    \ of a remedy, and a creature can only benefit from one herbal remedy each day,\
    \ whether or not the herb witch succeeds at her skill check."
