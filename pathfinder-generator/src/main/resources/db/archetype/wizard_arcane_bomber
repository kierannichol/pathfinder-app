  description: "At 1st level, the arcane bomber gains an ability nearly identical\
    \ to the alchemist's bomb ability. Unlike the alchemist, at 1st level, the arcane\
    \ bomber chooses one type of energy from the following list: acid, cold, fire,\
    \ and electricity. He can throw bombs of that type, but cannot modify them with\
    \ discoveries. This ability stacks with the alchemist bomb ability to determine\
    \ the level of bomb damage, but an arcane bomber that becomes an alchemist does\
    \ not gain that class's bomb ability, nor does an alchemist that becomes an arcane\
    \ bomber gain this bomb ability."

  description: "At 1st level, as a swift action, an arcane bomber can sacrifice one\
    \ of his spells to empower the next bomb he throws during his turn. When he does,\
    \ he gains a bonus to hit with the next bomb he throws before the end of his turn\
    \ equal to the level of the spell he sacrificed, and a bonus to damage equal to\
    \ twice the level of the spell.\nThis ability replaces cantrips, but the arcana\
    \ bomber gains the detect magic and read magic cantrips and places them in his\
    \ spellbook. He can cast either of these as 1st-level spells."

  description: "The creation and use of bombs is often so engrossing or intellectually\
    \ taxing that an arcane bomber forsakes four schools of magic. These opposition\
    \ schools are chosen at 1st level and cannot be changed later. An arcane bomber\
    \ who prepares spells from his opposition school must use two spell slots of that\
    \ level to prepare the spell. In addition, the arcane bomber takes a â€“4 penalty\
    \ on any skill checks made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one\
    \ of his opposition schools."
