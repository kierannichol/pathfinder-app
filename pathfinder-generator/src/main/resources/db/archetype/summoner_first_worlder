name: "First Worlder"
description: "Most summoners have a close connection to creatures from the farthest\
  \ reaches of the planes. A few have a primal connection to nature, and their power\
  \ is tied to primal magic. It is not unusual for these summoners to associate with\
  \ druids, for like druids, first worlders have a powerful tie to the natural world.\
  \ Some first worlders are driven half-mad by the strange energies and intelligences\
  \ that seep into their minds and bodies, though, and these poor souls are prone\
  \ to lash out at loggers, druids, or innocent passersby without considering whether\
  \ or not they are threats. A first worlder's eidolon usually resembles a fey creature\
  \ or a plant monster, though some are fantastic otherworldly animals with exaggerated\
  \ features."
