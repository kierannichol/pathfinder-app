  description: "At 3rd-level, a spellspy cannot use her familiar to deliver touch\
    \ spells for her. Instead, the spellspy can cast divination spells through her\
    \ familiar. When the spellspy does this, she casts the spell as normal, but she\
    \ treats her familiar's location as hers for purpose of determining the spell's\
    \ area of effect or range. The spellspy receives the spell's results as normal.\
    \ This ability does not allow her to see through her familiar's eyes; for example,\
    \ the spellspy would know about a powerful magic item detected through her familiar,\
    \ but she would not know its exact location or exactly what the item looked like.\
    \ Whenever a familiar would be able to deliver a hex, the spellspy can use the\
    \ familiar as a vessel for her divinations in this way."

  description: "At 4th level, a spellspy's familiar can store the results of divinations\
    \ for the purposes of providing false results to a rival diviner who has targeted\
    \ the spellspy. As a standard action, the spellspy can store the results of one\
    \ or more divinations she has cast within the past 24 hours. She can store results\
    \ from any number of spells with a total spell level equal to the highest spell\
    \ she can cast.\nThe next time a rival spellcaster would receive results from\
    \ any of the specific divinations whose results are stored in her familiar in\
    \ this manner, the stored results are transmitted to the rival caster (and are\
    \ removed from the familiar) in place of any real results.\nThe rival spellcaster\
    \ receives a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the spellspy's witch level + her\
    \ Intelligence modifier) to recognize that the results are falsified.\nDepending\
    \ on the spell, the stored results from the familiar might make this falsification\
    \ obvious (and thus no Will saving throw is necessary to determine the falsification).\n\
    This ability replaces the witch's 4th-level hex.\nHexes: The following witch hexes\
    \ complement the spellspy archetype: beast of ill-omen, evil eye, and tongues.\n\
    Major Hexes: The following major hexes complement the spellspy witch archetype:\
    \ Beast Eye, hag's eye, and vision."
