  description: "When adjacent to or in the space of a corporeal creature at least\
    \ one size category larger than herself, a vexing dodger can climb that creature's\
    \ body with a successful Climb check against a DC equal to the target creature's\
    \ CMD. Although the vexing dodger is holding on to the creature, this action isn't\
    \ a grapple; it doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity from the creature, and\
    \ neither the vexing dodger nor the creature she climbs gains the grappled condition.\
    \ While the vexing dodger is on the climbed creature, the creature takes a penalty\
    \ on attack rolls against the vexing dodger equal to the number of sneak attack\
    \ dice the dodger possesses."
