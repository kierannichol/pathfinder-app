    \ wounds with a touch. As a full-round action, the monk can spend 2 ki points\
    \ to heal a number of hit points equal to the monk's level. He needs at least\
    \ one hand free to use this ability, and cannot heal himself. If the action is\
    \ interrupted, the subject heals no hit points, and the ki points are lost."

  description: "At 11th level, a monk of the healing hand can use his entire ki pool\
    \ to bring a person back to life. It takes 1 hour to perform this ritual. At the\
    \ end of the ritual, the monk sacrifices all of his ki in order to cast raise\
    \ dead (as the spell) with a caster level equal to his monk level. The ritual\
    \ uses all of the ki in the monk's ki pool; the monk must have at least 6 points\
    \ of ki in his ki pool to use this ability. At 15th level, the monk may sacrifice\
    \ his ki to cast resurrection. The monk must have at least 8 points of ki in his\
    \ ki pool to use this ability. These rituals do not require material components.\
    \ When this ability is used, the monk's ki pool is not replenished until 24 hours\
    \ have passed.\nThis ability replaces both diamond body and quivering palm."

  description: "At 20th level, in a final selfless act, a monk of the healing hand\
    \ can draw in his entire ki, which then explodes outward in a 50-foot-radius emanation.\
    \ All dead allies within the emanation are brought back to life, as if they were\
    \ the subject of a true resurrection spell with a caster level equal to the monk's\
    \ level. When the monk does this, he is truly and utterly destroyed. A monk destroyed\
    \ in this way can never come back to life, not even by way of a wish or miracle\
    \ spell or by the power of a deity. Furthermore, the monk's name can never be\
    \ spoken or written down again. All written mentions of his name become nothing\
    \ more than a blank space."
