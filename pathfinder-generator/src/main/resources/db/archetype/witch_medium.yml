  description: "At 2nd level, the medium can sling spells at ghosts and spirits as\
    \ surely as at corporeal foes. She gains the Ectoplasmic Spell metamagic feat\
    \ as a bonus feat. In addition, as an immediate action a number of times per day\
    \ equal to her Intelligence modifier, the medium can apply the Ectoplasmic Spell\
    \ feat to any spell she is casting without increasing its spell level."
