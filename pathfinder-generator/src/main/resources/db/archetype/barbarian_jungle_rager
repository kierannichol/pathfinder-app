    \ ranger list of favored terrains. When in this terrain, she increases her bonus\
    \ to AC and on Reflex saving throws gained from cover, partial cover, and improved\
    \ cover (but not soft cover) by 1. In this terrain, she also increases the miss\
    \ chance caused by concealment for attacks against her by 5%."
