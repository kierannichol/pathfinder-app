  description: "Beginning at 2nd level, a card caster can invest a single thrown weapon\
    \ with a single touch or ranged spell as part of the spell's normal casting time.\
    \ The spell must target a single creature, and the spell's range changes to match\
    \ the thrown weapon's range increment. This ability otherwise functions identically\
    \ to spellstrike, except it can only be applied to thrown ranged weapons instead\
    \ of melee attacks."

    \ throws a harrow card matching one axis of his alignment, the card's critical\
    \ threat range increases to 19â€“20. If the card caster draws and throws a harrow\
    \ card matching his alignment exactly, the attack's critical multiplier also increases\
    \ to x3 and the magus gains a +4 bonus on his confirmation roll."
