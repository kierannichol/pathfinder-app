  description: "At 3rd level, the urban ranger forms a bond with a community. While\
    \ inside the limits of this community, he gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks\
    \ and Knowledge (local), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks. An urban\
    \ ranger traveling through his favored community leaves no trail and cannot be\
    \ tracked (although he may leave a trail if he so desires).\nAt 8th level, and\
    \ every five levels thereafter, an urban ranger may select an additional favored\
    \ community. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative\
    \ bonus in any one favored community (including the one just selected, if so desired)\
    \ increases by +2. For the purposes of this ability, a community is any settlement\
    \ consisting of 100 or more individuals. The community may be larger than this\
    \ minimum. Outlying farms, fields, and houses are not considered part of a community.\n\
    This ability replaces favored terrain."

    \ on harming the ranger. Areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to\
    \ impede motion, however, still affect him.\nThis ability replaces woodland stride."

    \ in place of a Disguise skill check in any of his favored communities. This disguise\
    \ does not take an action to don. He must make a check whenever someone attempts\
    \ to pick him out from the local citizens. If his check is successful, he blends\
    \ into the crowd. While not invisible, enemies do not notice his presence and\
    \ take no actions against him unless they are taking actions against the local\
