    \ for a brief period. Once per day as a standard action, the veiled adept can\
    \ touch an animal to grant it the ability to speak any language the druid knows\
    \ for 1 minute per druid level. This does not increase the animal's Intelligence\
    \ or improve its attitude, and the animal behaves as though communicating with\
    \ someone under the effects of a speak with animals spell, save that it can speak\
    \ with anyone who understands the language the veiled adept grants it. The veiled\
    \ adept gains one additional use of this ability at 4th level and every 4 levels\
    \ thereafter."
