  description: "At 1st level, a mutagenic mauler discovers how to create a mutagen\
    \ that she can imbibe in order to heighten her physical prowess, though at the\
    \ cost of her personality. This functions as an alchemist's mutagen and uses the\
    \ brawler's class level as her alchemist level for this ability (alchemist levels\
    \ stack with brawler levels for determining the effect of this ability). A mutagenic\
    \ mauler counts as an alchemist for the purpose of imbibing a mutagen prepared\
    \ by someone else.\nAt 6th level, a mutagenic mauler gains a +2 bonus on damage\
    \ rolls when she attacks in melee while in her mutagenic form. This bonus increases\
    \ to +3 at 11th level, and to +4 at 16th level. At 10th level, a mutagenic mauler\
    \ learns one of the following alchemist discoveries: feral mutagen or infuse mutagen,\
    \ preserve organs, spontaneous healing. At 12th level, the mutagenic mauler learns\
    \ the greater mutagen discovery."
