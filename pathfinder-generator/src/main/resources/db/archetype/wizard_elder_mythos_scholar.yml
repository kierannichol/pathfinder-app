  description: "An Elder Mythos scholar gains two fewer daily uses of his 1st-level\
    \ arcane school ability, which is normally used a number of times per day equal\
    \ to 3 + his Intelligence modifier. If he has no such ability, he can't take this\
    \ archetype.\nWhen an Elder Mythos scholar attempts a Will save against confusion,\
    \ fear, insanity, or madness, whether magical or mundane, he can spend 2 daily\
    \ uses of that arcane school ability to apply his Intelligence modifier instead\
    \ of his Wisdom modifier to the save. However, whenever he uses this ability,\
    \ he is affected by a nightmare the next time he sleeps, with no saving throw.\
    \ Until he sleeps and experiences the nightmare, he can't recover the spent uses\
    \ of the arcane school ability by any means."

    \ denizen of Leng, elder thing, flying polyp, gug, hound of Tindalos, Leng ghoul,\
    \ Leng spider, mi-go, nightgaunt, ratling, shantak, shoggoth, spawn of Yog-Sothoth,\
    \ star-spawn of Cthulhu, voonith, wendigo, and yithian.\nHe gains a +2 circumstance\
    \ bonus on Knowledge checks to identify such creatures and Spellcraft checks to\
    \ identify effects they create.\nAt 5th level, an Elder Mythos scholar adds invisibility\
    \ purge and see invisibility to his spellbook and can spontaneously cast either\
    \ spell by sacrificing a prepared spell of the same or higher level while wearing\
    \ or wielding his bonded item.\nAt 10th level, he adds banish seeming and true\
    \ seeing to his spellbook as 5th-level spells and can spontaneously cast them\
    \ in the same fashion."

  description: "At 8th level, once each day while preparing spells, an Elder Mythos\
    \ scholar can spend 1 extra hour to brew a tincture of hallucinogens and alien\
    \ trace minerals. Though it has no effect for others, if he drinks it, the elixir\
    \ expands his mind and perceptions into transitive dimensions, granting him a\
    \ +4 alchemical bonus to his Intelligence score and reducing his Wisdom and Constitution\
    \ scores by 2 for 10 minutes per wizard level he has. While under the effects\
    \ of this elixir, he adds 1/2 his class level to his Perception checks against\
    \ aberrations and creatures listed in talisman of revealing, but subtracts the\
    \ same amount from all other Perception checks. His spells have a 20% failure\
    \ chance, unless they summon, call, or contact a creature listed in talisman of\
    \ revealing or otherwise affect only such creatures (for instance, a fireball\
    \ aimed at 3 gugs but not a fireball aimed at 3 gugs and a gnome)."
