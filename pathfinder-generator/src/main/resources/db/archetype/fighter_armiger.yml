  description: "Armigers are difficult to sway from their beliefs. At 2nd level, an\
    \ armiger gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against charm effects. This bonus increases\
    \ by 1 for every 4 fighter levels beyond 2nd. Once per day, if an armiger is forced\
    \ to take an action that is diametrically opposed to her order's beliefs and values\
    \ while under the influence of a charm or compulsion effect, she can immediately\
    \ attempt a Will save against the effect's DC to resist acting out that order.\
    \ Success does not remove the existing charm or compulsion effect, but does allow\
    \ the armiger to resist betraying her beliefs."
