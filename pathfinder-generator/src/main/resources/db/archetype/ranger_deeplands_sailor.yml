  description: "At 3rd level, a Deeplands sailor learns how to use sound to compensate\
    \ for poor visibility when facing threats above and below the water. He gains\
    \ the uncanny dodge rogue ability when underground and either swimming or aboard\
    \ a boat.\nAt 8th level, he gains improved uncanny dodge under these conditions,\
    \ treating his Deeplands sailor level as his effective rogue level for the purpose\
    \ of denying an enemy's sneak attacks.\nAt 13th level, he gains blindsense with\
    \ a range of 30 feet against creatures touching water.\nAt 18th level, his blindsense\
    \ range increases to 60 feet or equal to the range of his darkvision, whichever\
    \ is greater. If the Deeplands sailor becomes deafened, he loses all benefits\
    \ of this ability until his hearing is restored."
