  description: "At 2nd level, a pirate incorporates a ship's masts, rigging, ropes,\
    \ sails, and other such structures into her combat style. Provided she is wearing\
    \ light armor or no armor, when fighting in an environment where such structures\
    \ exist, the rogue incorporates them into her movement, and does not have to move\
    \ in a straight line when making either a charge attack or bull rush combat maneuver.\
    \ Once she completes her attack or maneuver, she can reposition herself. Immediately\
    \ after making the charge or bull rush, she can move 5 feet as a free action,\
    \ even if the charge ends her turn. This movement does not provoke attacks of\
    \ opportunity.\nThis ability replaces the 2nd-level rogue talent."
