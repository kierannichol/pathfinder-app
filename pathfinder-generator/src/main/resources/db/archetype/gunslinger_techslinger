  description: "Techslingers have access to all gunslinger deeds, except as noted\
    \ below for new deeds that replace standard gunslinger deeds.\nCovet Charge (Ex)\
    \ At 1st level, a techslinger can spend 1 grit point to use 1 charge fewer than\
    \ normal when firing a technological weapon (minimum 0), as long as the weapon\
    \ has enough charges remaining to be fired at least once. This deed replaces deadeye.\
    \ Reliable (Ex) At 1st level, a techslinger can spend 1 grit point as a free action\
    \ to prevent a timeworn firearm from glitching. This deed replaces quick clear.\
    \ Charge Recycling (Ex) At 11th level, by spending 1 grit point, a techslinger\
    \ can grant 1 temporary charge to a technological firearm, even if the firearm\
    \ normally can no longer be recharged. This charge must be used within 1 hour\
    \ or it fades. The techslinger can grant temporary charges to multiple firearms\
    \ as long as she has enough grit, but temporary charges do not stack with themselves\
    \ in the same firearm. At 15th level, the techslinger can grant 2 temporary charges\
    \ when she uses this deed, and at 19th level, she can grant 3 temporary charges.\
    \ This deed replaces expert loading. Heavy Weaponry Deeds (Ex) At 11th level,\
    \ as long as the techslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can treat a heavy\
    \ weapon as a firearm for the purpose of using deeds."

  description: "Starting at 5th level, a techslinger can select one specific type\
    \ of advanced technology firearm (such as a laser pistol, mindrender, stun gun,\
    \ or zero rifle). Thereafter, she gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier\
    \ on damage rolls when using that firearm. Furthermore, she treats all detrimental\
    \ glitches of timeworn versions of her selected firearm as a result of no glitch.\
    \ (She can retain the effects of beneficial glitches if she wishes.)\nEvery 4\
    \ levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the techslinger selects another type\
    \ of advanced technology firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well."
