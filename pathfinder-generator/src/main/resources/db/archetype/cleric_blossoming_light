  description: "A blossoming light forsakes her deity's deeper mysteries to focus\
    \ on benevolence, healing, and bringing light to darkness. A blossoming light\
    \ still selects domains and retains access to domain powers, but does not gain\
    \ domain spell slots.\nBlossoming lights are beacons of goodness, guiding others\
    \ to follow their own best natures. A blossoming light adds half her level on\
    \ Diplomacy checks against good creatures or to convince an evil creature to take\
    \ an action against its evil nature.\nA blossoming light's channel energy is usable\
    \ a number of times per day equal to 5 + her Charisma modifier. At 2nd level and\
    \ every 2 levels thereafter, the blossoming light gains an additional use per\
    \ day of channel energy.\nAt 3rd level, when a blossoming light channels energy\
    \ to harm undead, her channeled energy also harms chaotic evil outsiders, worshipers\
    \ of chaotic evil deities, and evil creatures with light sensitivity or light\
    \ blindness as if they were undead.\nAt 7th level, when a blossoming light channels\
    \ energy, she can expend an additional use to fill the affected area with bright\
    \ light (as per daylight) for a number of rounds equal to her cleric level.\n\
    At 10th level, a blossoming light can use atonement once per day as a spell-like\
    \ ability, but only to offer redemption to others (as per the spell). Using the\
    \ spell in this way does not require a focus or material component."
