  description: "At 2nd level, whenever a concocter brews a potion, he can mix in some\
    \ of the chemicals he uses to create his mutagen, adding some of his mutagen's\
    \ effects to this concoction.\nWhen he drinks this concoction, he gains the benefit\
    \ of the potion as normal. Additionally, he gains a +2 natural armor bonus and\
    \ a +4 alchemical bonus to one of his physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity,\
    \ or Constitution), while suffering a â€“2 penalty to the corresponding mental ability\
    \ score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma), just as though the concoction were\
    \ a mutagen. The ability score that receives the bonus must be chosen when the\
    \ concoction is made. These benefits and penalties last for the duration of the\
    \ effects of the potion on which the concoction is based or for 1 minute per the\
    \ concocter's alchemist level, whichever is shorter.\nThe effects of this concoction\
    \ do not stack with another such concoction or a mutagen. If the concocter drinks\
    \ another concoction or a mutagen while under the effects of this concoction,\
    \ the effects of any previous concoction or mutagen immediately end. A concoction\
    \ that is not in the concocter's possession becomes inert until the concocter\
    \ picks it up again (even if the concocter has the infuse mutagen discovery).\
    \ The process used to combine the mutagen with a potion make it particularly volatile,\
    \ so anyone else who drinks the concoction (including other alchemists) does not\
    \ gain its benefits and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated\
    \ for 1 minute. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + the concocter's alchemist\
    \ level + the concocter's Intelligence modifier.\nAdditional reagents and materials\
    \ are required to brew a concoction in this way, doubling the cost in raw materials\
    \ to create the potion on which the concoction is based.\nA mutagen brewed into\
    \ a concoction in this way does not count against the number of mutagens the concocter\
    \ can have active at a given time.\nA concocter can make one such concoction per\
    \ day at 2nd level and a second per day at 4th level. A concoction becomes inert\
    \ 24 hours after it is created."
