  description: "At 1st level, a metamorph gains the ability to transform herself into\
    \ another form. This ability functions like alter self, except as noted here.\
    \ The effect lasts for 1 hour per metamorph's alchemist level, or until she changes\
    \ back. Changing form (to another form or back) is a standard action that doesn't\
    \ provoke attacks of opportunity. The metamorph is fatigued for 1 round each time\
    \ she changes shape.\nA metamorph can use this ability once per day at 1st level,\
    \ and an additional time per day at 4th level, and every 2 alchemist levels thereafter,\
    \ for a total of nine times at 18th level. At 20th level, a metamorph can use\
    \ shapechanger as a free action once per round, either before or after all her\
    \ other actions, with no daily limit.\nThis ability can also function as monstrous\
    \ physique I at 5th level, as monstrous physique II at 9th level, as monstrous\
    \ physique III at 11th level, as monstrous physique IV or giant form I at 13th\
    \ level, and as giant form II at 15th level."
