  description: "Antiquarians explore and record the remnants of lost civilizations.\
    \ Rather than using extracts, an antiquarian carries a collection of holy and\
    \ unholy symbols, charms, and trinkets. Though an antiquarian may never know who\
    \ or what grants him his power, he can produce magical effects all the same. Relic\
    \ magic functions as the alchemy class feature, except as noted below.\nAn antiquarian\
    \ begins play with a collection of religious trinkets that functions as his formula\
    \ book and weighs 2 pounds total, with each trinket functioning as a formula.\
    \ Adding new trinkets has the same cost and time requirement as adding formulae\
    \ to a formula book. An antiquarian can study a wizard's spellbook or alchemist's\
    \ formula book to learn formulae, but an antiquarian's trinket collection is too\
    \ esoteric for anyone except another antiquarian to learn spells from. An antiquarian\
    \ prepares spells by meditating and charging relics with supernatural power, which\
    \ has the same requirements and limitations as preparing extracts. However, instead\
    \ of creating extracts, an antiquarian casts spells as though he were an arcane\
    \ spellcaster, which means he can affect other creatures with his spells. An antiquarian\
    \ does not suffer from arcane spell failure.\nAn antiquarian doesn't gain a competence\
    \ bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks to create alchemical items, and he cannot identify\
    \ potions with that skill. Furthermore, he cannot select alchemist discoveries\
    \ as investigator talents."

    \ for 1 round. Once he identifies a magic item in this way, he can use Spellcraft\
