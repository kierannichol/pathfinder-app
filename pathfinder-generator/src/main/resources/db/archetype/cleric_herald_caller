  description: "A herald caller depends on summoned allies to overcome her foes, which\
    \ affords her little experience with the martial pursuits typical of other clerics\
    \ and a narrower spiritual focus. A herald caller can choose only one domain from\
    \ her deity's list of domains, rather than the normal two domains, and she doesn't\
    \ gain proficiency with medium armor or shields."
