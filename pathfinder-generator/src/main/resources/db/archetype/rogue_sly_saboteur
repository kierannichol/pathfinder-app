description: "Sly saboteurs are irregular soldiers who specialize in sabotage and\
  \ surprise attacks. Though they often face enemies with greater numbers or resources\
  \ (or both), sly saboteurs have the advantage of knowing the local people and terrain.\
  \ They might be rebels fighting against a corrupt government, or they might be members\
  \ of a militia opposing an invading force. Some are environmentalists who sabotage\
  \ the tools of industry in order to protect unspoiled nature."

  description: "At 3rd level, a sly saboteur can move through 5 feet of difficult\
    \ terrain each round as if it were normal terrain. At 6th level and every 3 levels\
    \ thereafter, this distance increases by 5 feet (to a maximum of 30 feet at 18th\
    \ level). This ability allows the sly saboteur to take a 5-foot step into difficult\
    \ terrain. This ability applies only when she is wearing light armor or no armor\
    \ and carrying no more than a light load, and it stacks with the Acrobatic Steps\
    \ and Nimble Moves feats."

  description: "At 4th level, when a sly saboteur uses Disable Device to rig a device\
    \ to fail, she can increase the DC of the check by 5. If she does so and succeeds\
    \ at the check, when the device fails, users take damage equal to the sly saboteur's\
    \ sneak attack, or they take half that amount with a successful Reflex save (DC\
    \ = 10 + half the sly saboteur's level + her Dexterity modifier). The type of\
    \ damage depends on the nature of the device but is typically bludgeoning, fire,\
    \ piercing, or slashing."

  description: "At 8th level, a sly saboteur can use Disable Device to rig a magic\
    \ item to fail as if it were an extremely complex device. If the item's effect\
    \ is instantaneous, the effect is countered the next time the item is activated,\
    \ but the activation still consumes a charge or use. If the item's effect is continuous\
    \ or has a duration, the effect fails after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use (sly\
    \ saboteur's choice). This ends the duration or suppresses a continuous effect\
    \ for 1d4 rounds (as the spell dispel magic). This ability cannot be used on artifacts.\n\
    If this ability is combined with the catastrophic failure ability, the resulting\
    \ damage is untyped magic and is not reduced by damage reduction or energy resistance.\n\
    This replaces improved uncanny dodge.\nRogue Talents: The following rogue talents\
    \ complement the sly saboteur archetype: cunning trigger, fast stealth, getaway\
    \ artist, quick disable, quick trapsmith, rogue crawl, trap spotter, wall scramble."
