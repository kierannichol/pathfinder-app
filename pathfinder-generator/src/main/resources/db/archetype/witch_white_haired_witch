  description: "At 1st level, a white-haired witch gains the ability to use her hair\
    \ as a weapon. This functions as a primary natural attack with a reach of 5 feet.\
    \ The hair deals 1d4 points of damage (1d3 for a Small witch) plus the witch's\
    \ Intelligence modifier. In addition, whenever the hair strikes a foe, the witch\
    \ can attempt to grapple that foe with her hair as a free action* without provoking\
    \ an attack of opportunity, using her Intelligence modifier in place of her Strength\
    \ modifier when making the combat maneuver check. When a white-haired witch grapples\
    \ a foe in this way, she does not gain the grappled condition.\nAt 4th level and\
    \ every four levels thereafter, a white-haired witch's hair adds 5 feet to its\
    \ reach, to a maximum of 30 feet at 20th level.\nThe hair cannot be sundered or\
    \ attacked as a separate creature.\nIn addition, a white-haired witch further\
    \ improves her ability to control her hair as she progresses in level, gaining\
    \ the following abilities:\nConstrict (Ex): At 2nd level, when the white-haired\
    \ witch's hair successfully grapples an opponent, it can begin constricting her\
    \ victim as a swift action*, dealing damage equal to that of its attack. Trip\
    \ (Ex): At 4th level, a white-haired witch who successfully strikes a foe with\
    \ her hair can attempt a combat maneuver check to trip the creature as a swift\
    \ action*. Pull (Ex): At 6th level, a white-haired witch who successfully strikes\
    \ a foe with her hair can attempt a combat maneuver check to pull the creature\
    \ 5 feet closer to her as a swift action*. Strangle (Ex): At 8th level, when the\
    \ white-haired witch's hair is grappling with an opponent, that creature is considered\
    \ strangled, and cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components."

    \ white-haired witch level in place of her rogue level.\nAt 12th level and for\
    \ every two levels thereafter, she gains an additional rogue talent. A white-haired\
    \ witch cannot select an individual rogue talent more than once, and can select\
    \ from among the following: assault leader, combat trick, finesse rogue, major\
    \ magic, minor magic, positioning attack, resiliency, surprise attack, and weapon\
    \ training.\nAt 18th level and 20th level, a white-haired witch can choose from\
    \ among the following advanced rogue talents: another day, defensive roll, improved\
    \ evasion, opportunist, redirect attack, slippery mind, and thoughtful reexamining."
