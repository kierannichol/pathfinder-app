  description: "A divine strategist can always act in a surprise round even if she\
    \ fails to make a Perception check to notice enemies, though she is considered\
    \ flat-footed until she acts. In addition, the divine strategist gains a bonus\
    \ on initiative checks equal to 1/2 her cleric level. At 20th level, a divine\
    \ strategist's initiative roll is automatically a natural 20. Allies able to see\
    \ and hear the divine strategist gain a bonus on initiative checks equal to 1/4\
    \ the divine strategist's level. This is a language-dependent ability.\nThis ability\
    \ replaces channel energy."
