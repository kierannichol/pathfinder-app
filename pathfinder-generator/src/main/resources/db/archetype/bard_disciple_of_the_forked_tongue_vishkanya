description: "Studied in venomous words as well as venomous blood, a disciple of the\
  \ forked tongue knows just the right phrase to slowly poison the soul. His voice\
  \ can sink deep into his victims' hearts, destroying friendships and devouring the\
  \ mind. The disciple of the forked tongue is an archetype of the bard class available\
  \ to vishkanya characters."

  description: "At 9th level, a disciple of the forked tongue can use his performance\
    \ to sow distrust into the mind of an enemy within 30 feet. An affected creature\
    \ treats its allies as hostile for the purposes of their spells and abilities--it\
    \ is never considered a willing target of spells and must attempt saving throws\
    \ against them when possible, and it gains no benefit from allied bardic performances\
    \ and other abilities that specifically target allies. For every 3 levels a disciple\
    \ of the forked tongue has beyond 9th, he can target one additional enemy while\
    \ using this performance (up to a maximum of four at 18th level)."
