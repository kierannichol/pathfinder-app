  description: "A progenitor infuses herself with fey magic so that she is treated\
    \ as either her original creature type or the fey type for the purposes of spells\
    \ or effects that target a creature by type, whichever is more beneficial to her.\
    \ Additionally, the progenitor chooses one of two forms through which this bond\
    \ expresses itself: magic or nature.\nA progenitor who chooses magic as her primal\
    \ bond can draw upon wild magic as a swift action to attempt to cast a prepared\
    \ spell without losing that spell from its spell slot.\nTo use this ability, she\
    \ casts the spell as she would normally, but as the spell's effects take place,\
    \ she must attempt a concentration check (DC = 20 + twice the spell's level).\
    \ If she fails, she expends the spell normally as if she had cast it, but its\
    \ effects are replaced by a wild magic effect with a CR equal to her caster level\
    \ and she is staggered until the end of her next turn. If she succeeds, she casts\
    \ the spell normally and it is not expended from her prepared spell slot, allowing\
    \ her to cast that spell again at a later point. A progenitor can use wild magic\
    \ in this manner once per day plus one additional time per day at 5th level and\
    \ every 5 levels thereafter.\nA progenitor who chooses nature as her primal bond\
    \ can create plants as a full-round action. She can do so once per day plus one\
    \ additional time per day per 5 levels. At the start of her next turn, so long\
    \ as she is touching a solid surface underfoot, a 5-foot radius of mobile undergrowth\
    \ springs to life around the progenitor for a number of rounds equal to 3 plus\
    \ the progenitor's Wisdom bonus. Upon activating this ability, the progenitor\
    \ chooses whether the undergrowth provides cover or difficult terrain. If the\
    \ progenitor chooses cover, her undergrowth provides a cover bonus to AC to the\
    \ progenitor and allies within the radius. If she chooses difficult terrain, enemies\
    \ who enter the radius of undergrowth treat it as difficult terrain. A progenitor's\
    \ undergrowth is treated as forest terrain if it provides cover and plains terrain\
    \ if it provides difficult terrain. This radius increases by 5 feet at 5th level\
    \ and every 5 levels thereafter."

    \ into a Small or Medium fey. When doing so, her wild shape functions as fey form\
    \ I.\nAt 8th level, a progenitor can use wild shape to change into a Tiny or Large\
    \ fey. When she does so, her wild shape functions as fey form II.\nAt 10th level,\
    \ a progenitor can use wild shape to change into a Diminutive or Huge fey. When\
    \ she does so, her wild shape functions as fey form III.\nAt 14th level, when\
    \ a progenitor uses wild shape to assume a fey form, her wild shape functions\
