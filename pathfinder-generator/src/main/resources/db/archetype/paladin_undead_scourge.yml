  description: "At 11th level, an undead scourge can expend one use of her smite evil\
    \ ability as a standard action and make a single melee attack against an undead\
    \ creature. If this attack hits, the undead creature must make a Will save or\
    \ be destroyed. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the undead scourge's level +\
    \ the undead scourge's Charisma modifier. Undead with twice as many Hit Dice as\
    \ the undead scourge are unaffected by this ability. If the attack misses, the\
    \ smite evil is wasted without effect."
