  description: "A magician gains the following types of bardic performance:\nDweomercraft\
    \ (Su): A magician can use performance to manipulate magical energies. Allies\
    \ of the magician gain a +1 bonus on caster level checks, concentration checks,\
    \ and attack rolls with spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases\
    \ by +1 at 5th level and every six levels thereafter. This ability relies on visual\
    \ and audible components.\nThis ability replaces inspire courage.\nSpell Suppression\
    \ (Su): A 8th level, a magician can use performance to counter the spells of his\
    \ foes. Once the bard begins using this performance, he tracks the number of rounds\
    \ it has been in use. While performing, as an immediate action, he can attempt\
    \ to counter any spell that he can identify using Spellcraft, so long as that\
    \ spell's level is equal or less than the total number of rounds he has been performing\
    \ spell suppression. The attempt to counter the spell is made as if using dispel\
    \ magic, using the bard's level as the caster level. If successful, the bardic\
    \ performance immediately ends. This ability requires audible components.\nThis\
    \ performance replaces dirge of doom.\nMetamagic Mastery (Ex): At 14th level,\
    \ a magician can use performance to apply a metamagic feat to a spell he is about\
    \ to cast without increasing the casting time. The bard must still expend a higher-level\
    \ slot to cast this spell. This causes the performance to immediately end. This\
    \ ability requires audible components."
