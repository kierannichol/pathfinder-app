  description: "A wyrm sniper swaps a trio of deeds for the following deeds.\nMunitions\
    \ Master: At 7th level, a wyrm sniper can spend 1 grit point to reduce the number\
    \ of full-round actions (or move actions, if the sniper has the Master Siege Engineer\
    \ feat) required to load a light siege engine by 1. This deed replaces the gunslinger's\
    \ startling shot deed.\nSkeleton Crew: At 11th level, as long as a wyrm sniper\
    \ has at least 1 grit point, she treats all light siege engines as requiring a\
    \ crew of one fewer than normal to operate (minimum 1). This deed replaces the\
    \ gunslinger's lightning reload deed.\nAnti-Air Targeting: At 15th level, whenever\
    \ a wyrm sniper targets a creature's wings with the targeting deed, the wyrm sniper\
    \ completely disables one of the creature's wings on a successful hit. If the\
    \ wyrm sniper hits her target, the creature falls to the ground, regardless of\
    \ its altitude, taking the appropriate amount of falling damage as a result. As\
    \ long as the target has at least one functioning wing, it may attempt a DC 20\
    \ Fly check to gain the benefits of feather fall instead of plummeting to the\
    \ ground. In either case, it must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the wyrm\
    \ sniper's level + the wyrm sniper's Wisdom modifier) or fall prone when reaching\
    \ the ground."
