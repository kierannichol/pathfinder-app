  description: "A cardinal adds Bluff, Intimidate, Knowledge (geography), and Knowledge\
    \ (local) to her list of class skills. She gains a number of skill ranks equal\
    \ to 6 + her Intelligence modifier at each level, instead of the normal 2 + her\
    \ Intelligence modifier. However, she gains only one domain, and her base attack\
    \ bonus from cleric levels is equal to half her class level (which is the same\
    \ as for a sorcerer or wizard)."
