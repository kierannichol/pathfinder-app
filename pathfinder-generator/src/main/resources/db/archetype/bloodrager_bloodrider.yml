description: "In the world's wild lands, a mount is an advantage in both everyday\
  \ life and the dealing of death. In many barbarian tribes, the true stature of a\
  \ warrior is determined by his skill and ferocity on horseback. Other tribes measure\
  \ it in skill atop whatever terrible mounts their people employ. A number of bloodragers\
  \ are not only skilled in the art of mounted combat, but have learned to channel\
  \ their arcane energies directly into their mount."

  description: "At 5th level, the bloodrider gains the service of a feral mount. This\
    \ ability functions as the druid's animal companion, using the bloodrager's level\
    \ â€“ 4 as his effective druid level. This companion must be one he is capable of\
    \ riding and suitable as a mount. A Medium bloodrider can select a camel or a\
    \ horse. A Small bloodrider can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar\
    \ or riding dog if he is at least 8th level. Whenever a bloodrider is bloodraging,\
    \ this feral mount gains a +2 morale bonus to its Strength."

    \ the bloodrider is bloodraging and on his feral mount, he grants the mount all\
    \ the immunities and resistances he gains from bloodline powers. Furthermore,\
    \ whenever the bloodrager is affected by a spell or spell-like ability with the\
    \ range of personal while on the feral mount, the feral mount also gains the benefit\
    \ of that spell."
