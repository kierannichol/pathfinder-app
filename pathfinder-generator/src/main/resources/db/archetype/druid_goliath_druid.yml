  description: "Druids' ability to wild shape into a creature of the animal type allows\

    \ gain the ability to become an elemental or plant.\nAt 6th level, the goliath\
    \ druid can use wild shape to become a Large humanoid of the giant subtype. This\
    \ functions as the alter self spell, except the goliath druid gains a +4 size\
    \ bonus to Strength, a â€“2 penalty to Dexterity, and a +1 natural armor bonus.\
    \ If the Large humanoid form she takes has rock throwing, she gains rock throwing\
    \ (range 40 feet, 1d8 damage). If the form has the aquatic subtype, she gains\
    \ the aquatic and amphibious subtypes.\nAt 12th level, when taking the form of\
    \ a giant, the goliath druid's wild shape functions as giant form I.\nAt 14th\
    \ level, the goliath druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge giant.\
    \ When taking the form of a giant, the goliath druid's wild shape functions as\
    \ giant form II."
