  \ master duelist, their combination of swordplay and arcane power makes them quite\
  \ deadly."

  description: "At 1st level, a blade adept develops a bond with a blade and infuses\
    \ it with arcane power. This ability works like a wizard's arcane bond ability\
    \ save that the blade adept must bond to a one-handed piercing or slashing melee\
    \ weapon. Additionally, the blade adept gains proficiency with the weapon if it\
    \ is a simple or martial weapon."

  description: "At 3rd level, the blade adept's bonded sword becomes a powerful, sentient\
    \ black blade. The blade advances as a black blade using the blade adept's class\
    \ level in place of the magus's class level and points from her arcane reservoir\
    \ in place of the magus's arcane pool. A blade adept with this class feature cannot\
    \ have a familiar of any kind, even from another class.\nThis ability replaces\
    \ the arcanist exploit gained at 3rd level."
