  description: "An eldritch poisoner can blend volatile chemicals and her own personal\
    \ magic to create deadly poisons known as arcanotoxins. She can use this ability\
    \ a number of times each day equal to her alchemist level + her Intelligence modifier.\
    \ An arcanotoxin functions only when used by the eldritch poisoner and becomes\
    \ inert if not used within 1 minute. Creating an arcanotoxin is a standard action,\
    \ and it can be applied to a weapon as a move action.\nAt 1st level, an eldritch\
    \ poisoner must choose whether her arcanotoxin deals Strength or Dexterity damage.\
    \ At 3rd level and every 2 alchemist levels thereafter, she can enhance her arcanotoxin\
    \ in one of the following ways. She can't select the same improvement twice in\
    \ a row.\nSelect one additional form of ability damage: Charisma, Dexterity, Intelligence,\
    \ Strength, or Wisdom. Grant an onset time of 1 round, or increase an existing\
    \ onset time by 2 rounds (maximum 11 rounds). Increase the ability damage die\
    \ by one step (maximum 1d6). Increase the number of consecutive saves required\
    \ to cure the poison by 1 (maximum 3). Increase the frequency by 2 rounds (maximum\
    \ 10 rounds).\nIf an eldritch poisoner can deal different kinds of ability damage,\
    \ she selects which ability to affect each time she creates a dose of arcanotoxin,\
    \ and can willingly reduce enhanced aspects of her arcanotoxin, such as the save\
    \ DC or onset time. Some discoveries apply secondary effects; a dose of arcanotoxin\
    \ can cause only one secondary effect.\nAlchemist discoveries that affect mundane\
    \ poisons do not apply to an arcanotoxin.\nThis ability replaces bomb."
