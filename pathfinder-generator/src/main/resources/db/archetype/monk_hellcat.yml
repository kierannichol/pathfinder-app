  description: "At 4th level, a hellcat gains a pool of ki points that he can use\
    \ as per the monk class feature but with the following changes. In addition to\
    \ spending ki to gain an additional attack, increased speed, or improved AC, a\
    \ hellcat can spend 1 ki point as a swift action to enhance his sight (gaining\
    \ 60-foot darkvision) or his sense of smell (gaining the scent ability) for 1\
    \ minute per level.\nAt 7th level, a hellcat can spend 1 point of ki as a swift\
    \ action to gain fire resistance 5 for 1 round per level. At 10th level, this\
    \ fire resistance increases to 10, and at 14th level, it increases to 15.\nAt\
    \ 11th level, a hellcat can spend 1 point of ki as a swift action to become silhouetted\
    \ with a ghostly flame, which makes him harder to see in light but easier to see\
    \ in darkness for 1 round per level. He becomes invisible in bright light, gains\
    \ concealment (20% miss chance) in normal light, gains no benefit in dim light,\
    \ and gives off light like a candle in darkness, allowing other creatures to see\
    \ him even without darkvision. If he takes any action that would break invisibility\
    \ while in bright light, his invisibility is reduced to concealment until the\
    \ end of his next turn."
