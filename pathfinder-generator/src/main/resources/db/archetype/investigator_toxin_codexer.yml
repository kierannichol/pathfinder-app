  description: "When a toxin codexer prepares his extracts, he can use his slots to\
    \ prepare short-lived poisons instead of extracts. The following poisons can be\
    \ prepared into extract slots: 1st--arsenic, giant wasp poison, medium spider\
    \ venom; 2nd--black adder venom, id moss, striped toadstool; 3rd-- blue whinnis,\
    \ lich dust, sassone leaf residue; 4th--dark reaver powder, purple worm poison,\
    \ third eye; 5th--deathblade, hemlock, witch-hunter's sword; 6th--black lotus\
    \ extract, dragon bile, king's sleep.\nAdditional poison selections can be added\
    \ to this list with GM approval.\nThe Fortitude save DC of these poisons is 10\
    \ + the toxin codexer's Intelligence modifier + the extract level of the poison.\
    \ Poisons created in this way are unstable and become inert after 1 day if not\
    \ used. Once the poison is administered to a target, the duration is as normal\
    \ for that poison's type, even if longer than 1 day. These poisons can be applied\
    \ to weapons (if applicable) only by the toxin codexer, unless he has the infusion\
    \ alchemist discovery."

  description: "At 3rd level, a toxin codexer learns to unlock both the beneficial\
    \ and detrimental side effects of his poisons. These effects apply even if the\
    \ target succeeds at her save against the poison, but they still count as poison\
    \ effects. A modified toxin becomes inert if not used within 1 hour.\nAs a move\
    \ action, the toxin codexer can expend one use of inspiration to apply one of\
    \ the following effects to a poison in his possession, choosing either the benefit\
    \ or the detriment when an effect has both options. These effects last for a number\
    \ of rounds equal to the investigator's Intelligence modifier unless otherwise\
    \ stated.\nGrant a +2 alchemical bonus or impose a –2 alchemical penalty on saving\
    \ throws against exhaustion, fatigue, and sleep effects. Grant a +4 alchemical\
    \ bonus or impose a –4 alchemical penalty on saving throws against effects with\
    \ the pain descriptor.\nAt 6th level, the toxin codexer can also choose from the\
    \ following effects:\nAffect a target so the first time she takes damage each\
    \ round, she takes an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. This is a pain\
    \ effect. Inflict or remove the fatigued condition.\nAt 9th level, the toxin codexer\
    \ can also choose from the following effects:\nDeal 1 point of bleed damage or\
    \ cure any ongoing bleed effects. Cure one disease or poison whose save DC does\
    \ not exceed that of the modified poison. This has no effect on magical curses,\
    \ diseases, or poisons.\nAt 12th level, the toxin codexer can also choose from\
    \ the following effects:\nCure one magical disease or poison whose save DC does\
    \ not exceed that of the modified poison. Bestow a 30% spell failure chance on\
    \ a target."
