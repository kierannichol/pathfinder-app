    \ Forgefather seeker learns the locations and power of all auras of all constructs,\

  description: "This ability functions as the paladin's smite evil ability, but it\
    \ functions only against constructs. Smiting a construct automatically bypasses\
    \ any DR or hardness a construct might have. A Forgefather seeker can still smite\
    \ evil, but she adds only half her Charisma bonus on attack rolls, adds only half\
    \ of her level on damage rolls, and doesn't increase her bonus damage against\
    \ outsiders with the evil subtype, evil-aligned dragons, or undead. This otherwise\
    \ functions as smite evil for the purposes of feats, prerequisites, and other\
    \ effects."

    \ dismantling constructs. Her DR increases to 10/evil.\nWhenever she uses smite\
    \ construct and hits a construct, she can immediately attempt to destroy the construct.\
    \ The construct is reduced to 0 hit points and destroyed unless it succeeds at\
    \ a Will save (DC = 10 + half the Forgefather seeker's level + the Forgefather\
    \ seeker's Charisma modifier). After this destruction effect and the damage from\
    \ the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends.\nIn addition, whenever a\
    \ Forgefather seeker channels positive energy or uses lay on hands to heal a creature,\
    \ she heals the maximum possible amount."
