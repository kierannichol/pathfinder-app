  description: "At 2nd level, a chaos knight can employ the forces of entropy with\
    \ a touch to shatter a mind-affecting spell or effect currently affecting an ally.\
    \ As a standard action, he can touch a creature to grant that creature a new saving\
    \ throw against one mind-affecting effect, with a bonus on the save equal to one-third\
    \ the chaos knight's level (minimum +0). If the chaos knight targets himself,\
    \ he can use this ability as a swift action. A chaos knight can use this ability\
    \ a number of times per day equal to half his paladin level + his Charisma modifier."

  description: "At 3rd level, a chaos knight can harness the unpredictable essence\
    \ of the Maelstrom to bless a creature. When he uses his entropic touch ability,\
    \ the chaos knight can grant the touched creature a blessing from the table below\
    \ that lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1 + the chaos knight's Charisma modifier\
    \ (minimum 1 round). Only one creature can have this blessing at a time. If another\
    \ creature gains the blessing, the previous blessing ends. The creature rolls\
    \ 1d4 and compares the result to the table below to determine the blessing. If\
    \ the chaos knight targets himself with the blessing, he can roll twice and choose\
    \ his preferred result.\nAt 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the chaos\
    \ knight can grant a blessing to one additional creature at a time."
