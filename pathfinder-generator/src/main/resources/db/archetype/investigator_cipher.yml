  description: "A cipher relies on subtlety, rather than skills that would draw attention\
    \ to him. A cipher removes Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Perform from his\
    \ list of class skills, and he can never use them with inspiration, regardless\
    \ of any talents or other abilities he might have. A cipher can use his inspiration\
    \ on any Disguise, Escape Artist, Knowledge (local), Sleight of Hand, and Stealth\
    \ check without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the\
    \ skill, instead of the normal investigator ability to use inspiration on any\
    \ Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft check without expending a use of inspiration."

  description: "At 1st level, a cipher can blind nearby creatures to his presence.\
    \ A creature who would become aware of a cipher's presence when the cipher is\
    \ within 10 feet per cipher level must succeed at a Perception check against a\
    \ DC equal to 10 + the cipher's investigator level + his Intelligence modifier\
    \ or the creature ignores the investigator as though it had not become aware of\
    \ his presence. The cipher can spend a use of inspiration to raise the DC by 1d6.\
    \ The affected creature continues to ignore the cipher until he attacks, moves\
    \ out of range, directly interacts with the creature, interacts with another creature\
    \ or object in a way the affected creature notices, or otherwise specifically\
    \ draws attention to himself. If the cipher does none of these things, the affected\
    \ creature can attempt another Perception check at the same DC for each minute\
    \ the cipher remains in range.\nA creature that was aware of the cipher's presence\
    \ prior to being in range of his inattention blinding ability is unaffected. This\
    \ is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.\nA cipher can affect only one creature\
    \ with inattention blindness at any given time, plus one additional creature at\
    \ 5th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter, to a maximum of seven\
    \ creatures at 19th level. Once a cipher reaches that maximum, he can't affect\
    \ an additional creature until he ends the effect for an already affected creature.\
    \ If multiple creatures enter the range of inattention blindness simultaneously,\
    \ they all must attempt Perception checks; the inattention blindness effect affects\
    \ the creatures with the lowest Perception check results, in order, until it reaches\
    \ the maximum number of creatures it can affect.\nThe cipher can suppress or activate\
    \ inattention blindness as a free action, and dismiss its effects on any affected\
    \ creature within range as a move action."

  description: "At 4th level, a cipher becomes much harder to notice with divinations.\
    \ He gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against divination spells, spell-like abilities,\
    \ and effects.\nAttempts to locate the cipher with scrying and other spells that\
    \ share the knowledge and connection rules with scrying function only if the caster\
    \ has firsthand or familiar knowledge of the cipher, or has one of his body parts\
    \ (not from secondhand knowledge, possession, or a likeness of the cipher).\n\
    If the caster does not meet these conditions, or if the cipher succeeds at a saving\
    \ throw to negate such an effect, the spell or effect reveals nothing but darkness\
    \ as if the target was invalid or did not exist; unlike normal, even if she is\
    \ using a spell with a single target, the caster of the divination effect does\
    \ not discover that her target succeeded at a saving throw.\nAt 9th level, a cipher\
    \ benefits from constant nondetection, requiring those who wish to use divinations\
    \ on him to succeed at a caster level check (DC = 15 + his investigator level)."
