  description: "At 2nd level, whenever a fermenter consumes a drug, she gains a +2\
    \ bonus on her saving throw to resist becoming addicted. Whenever she consumes\
    \ a tincture, she gains its usual benefits, but all penalties imposed are reduced\
    \ by 1. (If the tincture's penalties instead impose a condition or another penalty\
    \ that is not numerical, such as the penalties imposed by starlight juice, this\
    \ ability has no effect at 2nd level.) Additionally, the fermenter can consume\
    \ a number of alcoholic beverages equal to one plus three times her Constitution\
    \ modifier before becoming sickened for 1 hour per drink above this maximum.\n\
    The bonus on saving throws to resist addiction increases to +3 at 8th level and\
    \ to +4 at 10th level. At 10th level, the fermenter suffers no penalties at all\
    \ from drinking tinctures, including conditions and other nonnumerical penalties\
    \ (starlight juice would not make her dazzled, for example). Additionally, at\
    \ 10th level she can consume a number of alcoholic beverages equal to one plus\
    \ four times her Constitution modifier before becoming sickened."

  description: "At 2nd level, a fermenter under the influence can make her bombs more\
    \ potent, but they also become unstable and more difficult to aim. As long as\
    \ the fermenter is under the effects of a drug or tincture, or has imbibed an\
    \ alcoholic drink in the past 10 minutes, her bombs deal 1 additional point of\
    \ damage per damage die. While this ability is in effect, she also takes a –2\
    \ penalty on attack rolls made with her bombs. At 7th level and every 6 levels\
    \ thereafter, this penalty increases by 1 (to a maximum penalty of –5 at 19th\
    \ level)."

  description: "At 6th level, a fermenter learns how to brew tinctures in larger batches.\
    \ Whenever she creates a tincture using Craft (alchemy), she can simultaneously\
    \ create a number of additional tinctures equal to her Intelligence modifier.\
    \ She expends resources for each tincture separately, but she attempts a single\
    \ Craft check and applies the result to each tincture being brewed."
