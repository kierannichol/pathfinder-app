    At 5th level, when attempting to damage objects and structures, he ignores the\
    \ first 5 points of hardness.\nAt 8th level, the demolitionist gains a +2 insight\
    \ bonus on attack rolls when attempting to sunder an item.\nAt 11th level, he\
    \ can attempt a sunder combat maneuver check against a wall no more than 5 feet\
    \ thick. If the damage from the sunder combat maneuver exceeds the wall's hardness,\
    \ the demolitionist creates a 5-foot opening in the wall, through which a Medium\

  description: "At 3rd level as a standard action, the demolitionist can attack an\
    \ adjacent wall or object with a melee weapon. On a hit, he creates a 15-foot-cone\
    \ of rock shards or splinters that deals 2d6 points of damage to targets in the\
    \ area of effect. A target can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the demolitionist's\
    \ level + his Intelligence modifier) to reduce this damage by half. At 9th level,\
    \ the damage increases to 4d6, and the investigator can create this effect with\
    \ a ranged weapon by targeting a wall or object within 30 feet."
