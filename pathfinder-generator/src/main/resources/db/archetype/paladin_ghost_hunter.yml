  description: "A ghost hunter's smite evil ability does not automatically bypass\
    \ DR (other than DR/good).\nHowever, she treats her weapon as a ghost touch weapon\
    \ against the target of her smite. She does not deal extra damage on the first\
    \ attack against evil outsiders and evil dragons, but she deals 3 points of damage\
    \ per paladin level she possesses to undead creatures on the first attack (instead\
    \ of 2 points)."

  description: "At 6th level, a ghost hunter can try to end any possession spells\
    \ or effects, or effects that directly exercise mental control over a creature.\n\
    She must touch the affected creature (this requires a melee touch attack if the\
    \ target is neither willing nor helpless) and expend a use of her lay on hands\
    \ ability.\nThe target can immediately attempt a Will save against the original\
    \ save DC of the controlling effect. If the save is successful, the effect immediately\
    \ ends, as if the target had succeeded at its original saving throw."

  description: "At 9th level, a ghost hunter can commune with the spirits of the restless\
    \ dead once per day. By holding a seance for 10 minutes, she can ask questions\
    \ of a destroyed undead or a neutralized or destroyed haunt. To use this ability\
    \ on a corporeal undead, the ghost hunter must have the creature's head in her\
    \ possession. For a haunt or incorporeal undead, this seance must be held in the\
    \ haunt's location or where the incorporeal undead was destroyed. Treat this ability\
    \ as speak with haunt or as speak with dead (but affecting only undead rather\
    \ than only corpses), using the ghost hunter's class level as the caster level."
