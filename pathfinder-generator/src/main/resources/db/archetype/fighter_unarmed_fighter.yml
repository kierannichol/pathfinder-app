description: "Not all fighters need weapons to make their mark on the world. The unarmed\
  \ fighter picks up a weapon only rarely, and when he does, he prefers the weapons\
  \ of the monk. There are even those who mistake them for monks, but these fighters\
  \ enter the fight without ki, and instead have a tough perseverance that few can\
  \ rival."
