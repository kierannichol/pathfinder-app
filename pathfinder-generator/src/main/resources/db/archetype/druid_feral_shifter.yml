  description: "At 1st level, as a swift action, a feral shifter can take on the aspect\
    \ of an animal, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal\
    \ emulated. This functions as the hunter's animal focus class feature. The feral\
    \ shifter can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her druid\
    \ level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in\
    \ 1-minute increments. She can emulate only one animal at a time."
