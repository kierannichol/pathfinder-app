  description: "At 12th level, a monk of the four winds can use his ki to slow time\
    \ or quicken his movements, depending on the observer. As a swift action, the\
    \ monk can expend 6 ki points to gain three standard actions during his turn instead\
    \ of just one. The monk can use these actions to do the following: take a melee\
    \ attack action, use a skill, use an extraordinary ability, or take a move action.\
    \ The monk cannot use these actions to cast spells or use spell-like abilities,\
    \ and cannot combine them to take full-attack actions. Any move actions the monk\
    \ makes this turn do not provoke attacks of opportunity.\nThis ability replaces\
    \ abundant step."

  description: "At 17th level, a monk of the four winds must choose an aspect of one\
    \ of the great spirits of the world. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.\
    \ This spirit grants the monk a new appearance and new abilities, as well as changing\
    \ or augmenting the monk's personality in some way. Once this choice is made,\
    \ it cannot be changed. The monk must abide by the alignment restrictions of the\
    \ aspect. If the monk ever changes his alignment to something outside the aspect's\
    \ alignment restrictions, he loses this ability and cannot regain it unless his\
    \ alignment later changes again to match that of the aspect.\nAspect of the Carp:\
    \ The monk's skin becomes a coat of golden, iridescent fish scales, his neck grows\
    \ gills, and his fingers become webbed. He can breathe water and gains a swim\
    \ speed equal to his land speed. The carp is heroic and adventurous--a monk must\
    \ be nonevil to take on the aspect of the carp.\nAspect of the Ki-Rin: The monk's\
    \ skin takes on a golden luminescence, and a silvery mane that cannot be bound\
    \ grows atop his head. He gains a fly speed equal to his land speed, but he must\
    \ end each turn on the ground. If the monk does not land by the end of his turn,\
    \ he falls from whatever height he has attained. The ki-rin is honorable, honest,\
    \ and self-sacrificing--a monk must be lawful good to take on the aspect of the\
    \ ki-rin.\nAspect of the Monkey: The monk's face becomes that of a monkey, and\
    \ he grows a prehensile tail. The monk can pick up objects and make unarmed attacks\
    \ with his tail (though the tail does not grant additional unarmed attacks or\
    \ natural attacks). In addition, the monk gains a climb speed equal to his land\
    \ speed. The monkey is a creature of whimsy and a lover of pranks--a monk of any\
    \ alignment can take on the aspect of the monkey.\nAspect of the Oni: The monk's\
    \ skin becomes pitch black, and his hair turns white, black, red, or violet. He\
    \ can assume gaseous form (as the spell) as a standard action for 1 minute per\
    \ day per monk level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must\
    \ be spent in 1-minute increments. The oni is treacherous and deceitful, and it\
    \ hungers for the pain and death of living creatures--a monk must be evil to take\
    \ on the aspect of the oni.\nAspect of the Owl: The monk grows feathers, and his\
    \ head becomes avian, with wide, unblinking eyes. He gains a fly speed of 30 feet.\
    \ The owl is a sage creature, deeply serious, and driven toward a single goal--a\
    \ monk of any alignment can take on the aspect of the owl.\nAspect of the Tiger:\
    \ Dark stripes appear on the monk's skin, and his face becomes more feline. His\
    \ eyes become catlike, with vertical pupils, and his canines enlarge. Once per\
    \ hour, the monk can move at 10 times his normal land speed when he makes a charge\
    \ and is treated as if he had the pounce ability. The tiger is swift, fierce,\
    \ and deadly--a monk of any alignment can take on the aspect of the tiger."

    \ choosing within 20 miles of the place he died. The monk must have visited the\
    \ place in which he returns back to life at least once."
