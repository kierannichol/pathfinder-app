  description: "At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a tempered champion gains\
    \ a bonus feat from the following list:\nDisruptive, Divine Fighting Technique,\
    \ Greater Penetrating Strike, Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization,\
    \ Penetrating Strike, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, and Weapon Trick.\n\
    If a feat requires choosing a weapon or weapon group, the tempered champion must\
    \ choose her deity's favored weapon, or its group. The tempered champion must\
    \ meet the feat's prerequisites, but treats her tempered champion levels as fighter\
    \ levels for this purpose.\nIn addition, the 4th-level tempered champion gains\
    \ the increased base weapon damage of the warpriest's sacred weapon ability at\
    \ her tempered champion level."
