  description: "At 3rd level, an exemplar gains the ability to use certain bardic\
    \ performances. She can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal\
    \ to 3 + her Charisma modifier; this increases by 1 round per brawler level thereafter.\
    \ The exemplar's effective bard level for this ability is equal to her brawler\
    \ level â€“ 2. At 3rd level, the exemplar can use inspire courage. At 11th level,\
    \ the exemplar can use inspire greatness. At 15th level, the exemplar can use\
    \ inspire heroics. Instead of the Perform skill, she activates this ability with\
    \ impressive flourishes and displays of martial talent (this uses visual components).\n\
    This ability otherwise functions as bardic performance; feats and other effects\

  description: "At 5th level, as a standard action an exemplar can grant a teamwork\
    \ feat to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear her. This teamwork feat\
    \ must be one the exemplar knows or has gained with the martial flexibility ability.\
    \ Allies retain the use of this teamwork feat for 3 rounds + 1 round for every\
    \ 2 brawler levels. If the granted teamwork feat is one gained from martial flexibility,\
    \ this duration ends immediately if the exemplar loses access to that feat. Allies\
    \ don't need to meet the prerequisites of this teamwork feat. The exemplar can\
    \ use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus one additional time per day\
    \ at 9th, 12th, and 17th level.\nThis ability otherwise counts as the cavalier's\
    \ tactician class feature; feats and other effects which affect tactician (such\
    \ as Practiced Tactician) apply to it."
