  description: "An oozemaster can extract deadly toxins from the bodies of slain oozes\
    \ and use them against his foes, making him a deadly opponent with unpredictable\
    \ stratagems. As a full-round action while adjacent to an ooze that died within\
    \ the past 10 minutes, an oozemaster can attempt a Craft (alchemy) check with\
    \ a DC equal to 10 + the ooze's Challenge Rating to create a toxin. If successful,\
    \ the oozemaster can extract a number of doses of toxin from an ooze equal to\
    \ half its Constitution modifier (minimum 1). These toxins remain potent for 1\
    \ hour before becoming inert.\nThe oozemaster can throw an ooze toxin as a ranged\
    \ touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet, or he can apply the toxin to\
    \ a weapon as if it were an injury poison. The toxin deals 1d6 points of acid\
    \ damage plus an additional 1d6 points of acid damage per 3 Hit Dice the ooze\
    \ had. If the ooze had any additional effects conveyed by its slam attack other\
    \ than grab (such as a gelatinous cube's paralysis ability), the oozemaster can\
    \ also apply these qualities to this attack. The save DC for additional abilities\
    \ produced by this attack is 10 + half the alchemist's level + the alchemist's\
    \ Intelligence modifier."

  description: "At 2nd level, an oozemaster becomes especially resistant to the abilities\
    \ of his chosen foes. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against the extraordinary\
    \ and supernatural abilities of oozes. This bonus increases by +1 at 5th level\
    \ and every 3 levels thereafter, to a maximum of +8 at 20th level.\nThis replaces\
    \ poison resistance and poison immunity."
