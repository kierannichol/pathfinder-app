  description: "At 1st level, a toxicant has learned to mimic creatures with the ability\
    \ to secrete harmful toxins through the skin. Once per day, in a process that\
    \ takes 10 minutes, the toxicant can create and imbibe a tincture that causes\
    \ her skin to secrete a mild toxin. The toxicant is immune to this secretion,\
    \ but any creature that hits her with a natural attack or unarmed strike must\
    \ succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the toxicant's alchemist level +\
    \ the toxicant's Intelligence modifier). On a failed save, the target takes an\
    \ amount of damage equal to the toxicant's Intelligence modifier. At 4th level,\
    \ a target that fails its save must succeed at a second save 1 round later or\
    \ take the same amount of damage again. This effect repeats as long as the target\
    \ continues to fail its saving throws, to a maximum number of rounds equal to\
    \ 1 + 1 for every 4 alchemist levels the toxicant possesses (to a maximum of 6\
    \ rounds at 20th level).\nThis is a poison effect. The toxicant can suppress this\
    \ secretion as a standard action, in which case it remains suppressed for 1 hour\
    \ or until the toxicant reactivates it as a standard action.\nAt 3rd level and\
    \ every 3 levels thereafter, the toxicant can choose a condition to have her toxin\
    \ impose.\nOnce this choice is made, it can't be changed. A creature that fails\
    \ its save against the toxic secretion also gains these conditions until it succeeds\
    \ at a save against the secretion, or until the toxin's duration ends.\nAt higher\
    \ alchemist levels, the toxicant gains access to stronger conditions; some replace\
    \ lower-level conditions, which must be selected first. The following conditions\
    \ are available at the given alchemist levels: 3rd--bleed (1d6), dazzled, fatigued,\
    \ or sickened; 6th--dazed or shaken; 9th--blinded (replaces dazzled) or staggered\
    \ (replaces dazed); 12th--exhausted (replaces fatigued); 18th--stunned (replaces\
    \ exhausted and staggered).\nAs a swift action, the toxicant can collect and concentrate\
    \ this secretion into a poison she can deliver as a touch attack or apply to a\
    \ weapon. Targets of such attacks must attempt saving throws as if they had touched\
    \ the toxicant's toxic secretion. The toxicant can do this a number of times per\
    \ day equal to her alchemist level + her Intelligence modifier."

  description: "At 14th level, a toxicant can drink a poison as a standard action\
    \ and suspend it within her own body. She is not affected by the poison, and doesn't\
    \ need to attempt saving throws against it. When the toxicant next uses her toxic\
    \ secretion on a creature that attacks her with a natural or unarmed attack, she\
    \ can expose the attacker to the digested poison (with that poison‘s normal duration,\
    \ effects, and save DC) rather than her normal toxic secretion, even if the digested\
    \ poison isn't normally a contact poison. The alchemist can maintain only a single\
    \ digested poison at a time. If she digests a new poison, any older digested poison\
    \ is lost."
