    \ level or lower, counting the spell as a necromancy spell rather than a conjuration\
    \ spell. This cure spell harms only undead; it doesn't heal the living. If the\
    \ spell requires an attack roll, it as has a critical threat range of 19–20. A\
    \ number of times per day equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier, when she spontaneously\
    \ casts a cure spell, she can either turn the effect into a ray and increase the\
    \ range to close or remove the Will save for half damage[faq]."
