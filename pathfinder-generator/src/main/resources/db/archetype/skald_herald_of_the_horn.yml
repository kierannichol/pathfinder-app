  description: "At 1st level, a herald of the horn forms a powerful bond with a horn\
    \ (musical instrument). This functions like an arcane bloodline sorcerer's arcane\
    \ bond with an object. Like a weapon, wand, or staff, the horn must be held in\
    \ one hand when the herald of the horn casts skald spells."

    \ from enchantment effects and fear. When beginning a raging song, he can expend\
    \ 4 rounds of that ability to grant all allies within 60 feet a new saving throw\
    \ against an ongoing enchantment or fear effect. The allies gain a +2 bonus on\
    \ this new saving throw."

  description: "At 7th level, a herald's horn enhances his sonic spells. If a skald\
    \ spell with the sonic descriptor is cast using the horn, its DC increases by\
    \ 1. These DCs increase by an additional 1 at 13th and 19th levels."

  description: "At 11th level, a herald of the horn can use his horn to create a devastating\
    \ shock wave of energy. Once per day, he can sound a note on the horn that functions\
    \ like a horn of blasting (DC = 10 + 1/2 the herald of the horn's level + his\
    \ Charisma bonus). At 17th level, the herald of the horn can use this ability\
    \ twice per day and it functions like a greater horn of blasting. Unlike an actual\
    \ horn of blasting, this ability does not carry the risk of destroying the horn.\n\
    This ability replaces the second and third daily uses of spell kenning gained\
    \ at 11th and 17th levels."
