    A mnemostiller uses his Charisma score in place of his Intelligence score for\
    \ the purpose of extracts and bonus extracts. A mnemostiller still uses his Intelligence\

  description: "A mnemostiller learns to brew a unique type of mutagen, called a rasugen,\
    \ that suppresses his mind to enter a state of sublime purity. In this state,\
    \ a mnemostiller becomes incredibly resilient, but cannot perform complex skills.\
    \ Once imbibed, a rasugen grants a +2 alchemical bonus on all saving throws and\
    \ 2 temporary hit points per alchemist level for 10 minutes per alchemist level.\
    \ In addition, while the rasugen is in effect, a mnemostiller takes a â€“2 penalty\
    \ to his Intelligence score and can't attempt checks using Appraise, Craft, Disable\
    \ Device, Heal, Knowledge (any), Profession, Sleight of Hand, or Spellcraft. This\
    \ acts in all other ways like a mutagen."

  description: "A mnemostiller crafts his bombs from mnemos of pain and discomfort,\

    \ it deals nonlethal damage, it deals no damage to inanimate objects and creatures\
    \ immune to mental effects, and creatures caught in the anguish bomb's splash\
    \ can attempt a Will save for half damage. A mnemostiller uses his Charisma score\
    \ in place of his Intelligence score to determine the bonus damage of his anguish\
    \ bomb and the save DC of the anguish bomb's splash damage. He still uses his\
    \ Intelligence score to determine his number of bombs per day. If the mnemostiller\
    \ has taken any hit point damage in the past 24 hours, his anguish bombs inflict\
    \ 1 additional point of nonlethal damage for every 2 alchemist levels he has."

    \ adds aura alteration, detect mindscape, and mindscape door to his formula book\
