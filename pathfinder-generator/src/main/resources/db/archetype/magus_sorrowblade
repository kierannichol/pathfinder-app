    \ 1 point from her arcane pool as a swift action, she can imbue the weapon she\

    \ within the next minute must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the\
    \ sorrowblade's magus level + her intelligence modifier) or become shaken for\
    \ 1 minute. Multiple despairing strikes can't make a creature frightened."

  description: "At 12th level, the sorrowblade can cause foes to lose all hope. By\
    \ spending 1 point from her arcane pool as a swift action, she can imbue the weapon\
    \ she is wielding with the power of unbridled pessimism. The first creature she\
    \ strikes with this weapon within the next minute must succeed at a Will saving\
    \ throw (DC = to + 1/2 the sorrowblade's magus level + her intelligence modifier)\
    \ or take a -2 penalty an attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks,\
    \ and weapon damage rolls for 1 hour. Additionally, during this time, the creature\
    \ can't gain morale bonuses of any kind, and whenever the creature rolls a natural\
    \ 1 on an attack roll or saving throw, fails an ability or skill check by more\
    \ than 5, or takes additional damage as a result of a foe's confirmed critical\
    \ hit, the penalty on rolls imposed by the wretched strike becomes -3 for 1 round.\
    \ This increased penalty doesn't stack, even if multiple catastrophes occur on\
    \ the same round."
