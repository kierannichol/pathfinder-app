    \ or higher asphyxiates or drowns within 30 feet of him, the flood walker gains\
    \ the benefit of a death knell spell for 1 hour. If a flood walker drowns such\
    \ a victim himself (such as by holding a grappled or helpless creature under water\
    \ until it dies or by killing it with a suffocation spell), the duration is doubled,\
    \ and the flood walker gains 4d8 temporary hit points and a +6 enhancement bonus\
    \ to Strength instead of the usual temporary hit points and enhancement bonus\
    \ to Strength from death knell . Like death knell itself, this is an evil act."
