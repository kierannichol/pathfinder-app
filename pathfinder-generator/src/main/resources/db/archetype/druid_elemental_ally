  description: "At 1st level, an elemental ally has four elemental eidolons she can\
    \ summon, one each for the elements of air, earth, fire, and water. Their abilities\
    \ and statistics are determined using the rules for elemental eidolons for the\
    \ Unchained Summoner class, as if the elemental ally were a summoner of her druid\
    \ level, except they gain no additional evolution pool (just those evolutions\
    \ from their base form and base evolutions from their subtype).\nEach of the four\
    \ elementals has its own base form, skills, and feats. The elemental ally can\
    \ summon one of these elementals with the same 1-minute ritual a summoner normally\
    \ uses to do so. The elemental ally can't summon an eidolon or cast summon nature's\
    \ ally if she currently has an eidolon summoned. She also can't summon an eidolon\
    \ if she currently has a creature summoned through other means. If one of the\
    \ elemental ally's eidolons is killed, she cannot summon any eidolons for 24 hours.\
    \ The elemental ally can dismiss her eidolon as a standard action.\nAs the elemental\
    \ ally gains levels, her elemental eidolons' base statistics and base evolutions\
    \ increase as if her druid level were her summoner level. The eidolons gain the\
    \ darkvision, link, share spells, evasion, ability score increase, devotion, multiattack,\
    \ and improved evasion abilities at the appropriate levels, but never gain an\
    \ evolution pool. Abilities and spells that grant additional evolution points\
    \ to eidolons do not function for elemental eidolons, though any ability that\
    \ would grant evolution points to an animal companion does work. The elemental\
    \ ally does not gain life link or any other class features a summoner gains in\
    \ relation to her eidolon."

  description: "An elemental ally can improve the attitude of a creature of the elemental\
    \ subtype. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude\
    \ of a person. The elemental ally rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her\
    \ Charisma modifier to determine the elemental empathy check result.\nTo use elemental\
    \ empathy, the elemental ally and the elemental must be able to study each other,\
    \ which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions.\
    \ Generally, influencing an elemental in this way takes 1 minute, but as with\
    \ influencing people, it might take more or less time.\nAn elemental ally can\
    \ also use this ability to influence a non-elemental outsider with the air, earth,\
    \ fire, or water subtype, but she takes a â€“4 penalty on the check."
