description: "A buccaneer is a pirate who specializes in raiding ships and port towns,\
  \ but who leaves his victims alive whenever possible. Buccaneers are flashy, debonair\
  \ pirates who enjoy the excitement and rewards of piracy, but prefer not to kill;\
  \ they are welcome on ships whose captains prefer to avoid the punishments that\
  \ murder would bring or who lack the heart to strike down civilians in cold blood.\
  \ Buccaneers are also popular in privateer crews--and among slave traders."

  label: null
  type: null
  description: "A buccaneer of 4th level or higher can use his performance to encourage\
    \ an enemy to surrender. To be affected, an enemy must be within 30 feet and be\
    \ able to see and hear the buccaneer's performance. An affected enemy feels the\
    \ irresistible urge to drop any held weapons and fall prone. This effect lasts\
    \ for 1 round--essentially, the affected enemy takes no actions on its next turn\
    \ other than to lie prone, although it is not considered flat-footed or helpless.\
    \ A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the buccaneer's level + the buccaneer's Charisma\
    \ modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature. Song\
    \ of surrender is an enchantment(compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent\
    \ ability and relies on audible components."

  type: null
  description: "At 5th level, a buccaneer may focus his blows in an attempt to knock\
    \ out an opponent. Once per day as a swift action, the buccaneer can choose one\
    \ target to attempt to knock out. The buccaneer adds his Charisma bonus (if any)\
    \ on his attack roll and adds his buccaneer level on any nonlethal damage rolls\
    \ made against the target. The bonus lasts until the buccaneer deals nonlethal\
    \ damage to his target or until the buccaneer chooses a new target to attempt\
    \ to knock out. He can use this ability one additional time per day for every\
    \ six levels he possesses beyond 5th, to a maximum of three times per day at 17th\
    \ level."

  description: "This ability functions just like song of surrender but allows a buccaneer\
    \ of 16th level or higher to affect all enemies within 30 feet. Enemies within\

    \ an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability that\
