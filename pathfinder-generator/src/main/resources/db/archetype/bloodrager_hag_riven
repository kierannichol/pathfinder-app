description: "All changelings have the potential to transform into hags, but the process\
  \ is a slow one, requiring several nights to complete. When left incomplete--by\
  \ virtue of a wily changeling's escape or her mother's death--the creature is scarred\
  \ and saturated in arcane power. Though she remains in possession of her own faculties,\
  \ the seeds of hag hatred sprout within her. These hag-riven wield powerful magic\
  \ interlaced with more powerful emotions."
