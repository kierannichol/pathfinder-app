  description: "At 4th level, a planar sneak treats creatures with the elemental subtype\
    \ as though they were vulnerable to her sneak attack, but she deals only half\
    \ as much sneak attack damage as she normally would. She can confirm critical\
    \ hits against such creatures, though 50% of the time, the critical hit is automatically\
    \ negated and damage is instead rolled normally. At 8th level, this ability also\
    \ applies to all outsiders otherwise immune to critical hits and sneak attack\
    \ damage."
