    \ this ability, the wild child can use a different hunter trick. He cannot choose\
    \ any tricks that rely on ranged attacks. Activating this ability is not an action,\
    \ but using the trick might require the wild child to use an action of a different\

    \ example, if the wild child chooses maneuver training (dirty trick), his animal\
    \ companion also learns a trick that allows it to use the dirty trick combat maneuver.\
    \ He cannot choose any tricks that rely on ranged attacks. This bonus trick doesn't\
    \ count against the animal companion's total tricks known and does not take any\
    \ time or checks to train. Should the wild child gain a new animal companion (such\
    \ as if the previous one dies), this new animal companion begins with the same\
    \ number of bonus tricks."
