  description: "A spell warrior gains the following raging song, allowing him to grant\
    \ his ally's weapons enhancement bonuses and special powers.\nEnhance Weapons\
    \ (Su) At 1st level, the spell warrior can grant a +1 enhancement bonus to the\
    \ weapons (including ammunition) of allies within 60 feet. At 5th level and every\
    \ 5 levels thereafter, this enhancement bonus increases by 1. The maximum bonus\
    \ gained is based upon the number of weapons affected: +5 to one weapon, +4 to\
    \ two weapons, +3 to three weapons, or +2 to four or more weapons. Fifty pieces\
    \ of ammunition count as one weapon for this purpose. The wielder of a weapon\
    \ enhanced by this raging song counts as if he were under the effect of an inspired\
    \ rage raging song for all purposes involving the skald's rage powers. These bonuses\
    \ can also be used to add any of the following weapon special abilities to the\
    \ weapons enhanced by this ability: dancing, defending, distance, flaming, frost,\
    \ ghost touch, keen, mighty cleaving, returning, shock, seeking, or speed. Adding\
    \ these weapon special abilities consumes an amount of bonus equal to the special\
    \ ability's cost (see Table: Melee Weapon Special Abilities). These enhancement\
    \ bonuses and special abilities overlap with any enhancements or special abilities\
    \ the weapon already has, though duplicate special abilities do not stack. If\
    \ an affected weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added\
    \ before any other special abilities can be. The bonus and special abilities granted\
    \ by this raging song are determined when the song begins, and cannot be changed\
    \ until the raging song ends and another is begun. These bonuses apply to only\
    \ one end of a double weapon."

    \ an immediate action without interrupting his raging song. However, in addition\
    \ to expending a spell slot (or spell slots) to attempt to counter the opponent's\
    \ spell, the skald must expend 1 round of raging song per spell level of the opponent's\
    \ spell (for example, if attempting to counterspell a 3rd-level spell, the skald\
    \ must expend one of his own 3rd-level spell slots and 3 rounds of raging song)."
