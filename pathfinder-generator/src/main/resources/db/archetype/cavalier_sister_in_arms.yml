    \ and conditional skill bonuses, additional challenge benefits, and order abilities)\
    \ at the appropriate levels. At 1st level, a sister-in-arms chooses which order's\
    \ edicts she must follow; generally, those of the fanged crown choose the order\
    \ of the lion's edicts, while those of the scarlet rose choose the order of the\
    \ dragon's edicts."
