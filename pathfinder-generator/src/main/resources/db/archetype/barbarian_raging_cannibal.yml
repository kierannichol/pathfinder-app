description: "While savagery is not inherently evil, some barbaric cultures thrive\
  \ on depravity and welcome the act of feeding on their own kind. The raging cannibal\
  \ is a barbarian who feasts upon her fallen opponents not out of hunger, or even\
  \ a taste for flesh, but rather because she believes consuming her foes and defiling\
  \ their lost lives demonstrates her strength. This penchant for feasting on the\
  \ flesh of her kin makes the raging cannibal an awkward companion to travel with\
  \ for many groups, with rumors revolving around the raging cannibal's culinary exploits\
  \ often causing tense situations that other party members might be called upon to\
  \ resolve via diplomacy before the raging cannibal grows frustrated and decides\
  \ to take matters into her own hands!"
