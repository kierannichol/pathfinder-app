  description: "At 4th level, a devolutionist can spend 1 minute with a willing or\
    \ restrained domesticated animal to undo the effects of domestication, transforming\
    \ it into a wild animal and causing it to lose any tricks it knew. The animal\
    \ no longer recognizes any humanoids as friends or allies and gladly tears former\
    \ playmates apart for food. Handle Animal checks don't work on an undomesticated\
    \ creature, though wild empathy does. This ability doesn't function on animal\
    \ companions, special mounts, or the like, and other exceptional domesticated\
    \ animals can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the devolutionist's druid level\
    \ + her Wisdom modifier) to negate the effect and become immune to it for 24 hours.\
    \ Though this ability is instantaneous, break enchantment, limited wish, miracle,\
    \ or wish can reverse the effects."

  description: "At 9th level, a devolutionist can perform a 24-hour ritual to irrevocably\
    \ transform a humanoid or animal into a devolved feral state. There is no saving\
    \ throw, but the target must be present and stay relatively still for the entire\
    \ ritual, which typically requires a willing or restrained target.\nAn affected\
    \ humanoid's Intelligence score is instantly reduced to 2; its type changes to\
    \ animal; it loses all spellcasting and abilities that require intelligence; it\
    \ can't wield manufactured weapons; it gains two claw attacks and a bite attack\
    \ (all dealing 1d4 points of damage for a Medium humanoid or 1d3 for Small humanoids);\
    \ and it can't use skills other than Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Intimidate,\
    \ Perception, Stealth, Survival, and Swim.\nAn affected animal is undomesticated\
    \ (see above) if applicable and then either gains the advanced template, except\
    \ without any increases to mental ability scores, or becomes a dire version of\
    \ the animal (if a dire version exists and at the GM's discretion). The devolved\
    \ creature starts out friendly toward the devolutionist, though it typically tries\
    \ to kill and devour other sentient humanoids. The devolutionist has no special\
    \ empathy or connection with a creature she devolves, and if it was her animal\
    \ companion before, it ceases to be so.\nThe druid can communicate her desires\
    \ to a devolved creature using wild empathy. This ability counters and dispels\
    \ awaken, and only awaken, miracle, or wish can reverse it."
