  description: "At 8th level, a paladin's aura hampers extra-dimensional travel by\
    \ evil outsiders. The aura extends 20 feet from the paladin. Evil outsiders attempting\
    \ to use abilities such as dimension door, plane shift, or teleport to leave or\
    \ enter the aura must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the paladin's level\
    \ + the paladin's Charisma modifier); failure means the ability does not function,\
    \ as if the outsider were affected by dimensional anchor. The aura functions only\
    \ while the paladin is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead.\nAlternatively,\
    \ as an immediate action, the paladin can expend one use of her smite evil ability\
    \ to target an evil outsider within 30 feet with dimensional anchor. A targeted\
    \ dimensional anchor persists even if the paladin is unconscious or dead."

  description: "At 9th level, a paladin whose divine bond is with a weapon can also\
    \ use her divine bond to augment her armor or shield with enhancement bonuses,\
    \ or add any of the following armor or shield properties: bashing, fortification,\
    \ and spell resistance. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal\
    \ to the property's cost (see Tables 15–4 and 15–5 in the Core Rulebook). She\
    \ can divide her bonuses from the divine bond ability among her weapon, armor,\
    \ and shield as she sees fit. This ability has no effect for a paladin whose divine\
    \ bond is with a mount.\nThis ability replaces the mercy gained at 9th level."
