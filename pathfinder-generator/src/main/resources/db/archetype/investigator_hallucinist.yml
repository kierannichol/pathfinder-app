  description: "In addition to magical extracts, a hallucinist learns to swiftly mix\
    \ various psychoactive substances, using a fraction of his own power to create\
    \ a magical hallucinogen that he can imbibe to grant himself powers of psychedelic\
    \ perception. A hallucinogen follows all the normal rules and restrictions for\
    \ an alchemist's mutagen as if they were the same substance, just as a cognatogen\
    \ does.\nAt 1st level, the effects of a hallucinogen last for 1 minute per investigator\
    \ level, and the hallucinogen grants low-light vision and a +2 insight bonus on\
    \ Perception checks, but imposes a â€“2 penalty to his Dexterity. At 3rd level,\
    \ the duration increases to 10 minutes per the hallucinist's investigator level\
    \ and the insight bonus on Perception checks increases to +4. At 7th level, the\
    \ hallucinogen also grants see invisibility and darkvision 60 feet (or if the\
    \ hallucinist drinking it already has darkvision, it increases the range of the\
    \ darkvision by 30 feet) and the Perception bonus increases to +6. At 11th level,\
    \ the hallucinogen also grants aura sight and the Perception bonus increases to\
    \ +8. At 15th level, the hallucinogen also grants blindsense 60 feet and the Perception\
    \ bonus increases to +10."

    \ can attempt a Knowledge (nature) check to identify any natural drug or a Knowledge\
    \ (arcana) check to identify any magical drug (DC = the drug's addiction saving\
    \ throw DC). Once he identifies a drug, he can spend 1 minute and attempt a Craft\
    \ (alchemy) check (DC = the drug's addiction saving throw DC) to neutralize 1\
    \ dose of the drug. Success renders the dose harmless. The hallucinist has no\
    \ chance of accidentally drugging herself when examining or attempting to neutralize\

  description: "At 3rd level, a hallucinist under the effects of his hallucinogen\
    \ can share and manipulate his hallucinatory revelations. By expending 10 minutes\
    \ of the duration of his hallucinogen or one use of inspiration, he can create\
    \ an effect similar to minor image or oneiric horror. At 5th level, he can create\
    \ an effect similar to synesthesia.\nAny of the effects remain only while the\
    \ hallucinist concentrates upon it, for up to 1 round per hallucinist's investigator\
    \ level, but otherwise function as the spell.\nThe DC of saving throws against\
    \ these effects is equal to 10 + 1/2 the hallucinist's investigator level + his\
    \ modifier.\nAt 9th level, a hallucinist can expend 10 minutes of the duration\
    \ of the hallucinogen or one use of inspiration to use aura alteration on one\
    \ creature or object (unlike the other three abilities, this does not require\
    \ concentration)."

  description: "At 6th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter, the expanded\
    \ mind of a hallucinist is able to maintain his studied combat bonuses against\
    \ an additional target at the same time. In order to do so, the hallucinist must\
    \ be using his psychedelic perception ability and must expend one use of inspiration\
    \ in order to designate each target beyond the first target (this cost stacks\
    \ with the use of inspiration required to designate a target more than once per\
    \ 24 hours). He still needs to take a move action for each target, designating\
    \ them one at a time. The hallucinist can discard this connection to a target\
    \ of studied combat as a free action, allowing him to study another target in\
    \ its place."
