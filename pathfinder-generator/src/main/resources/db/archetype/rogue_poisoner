description: "Some consider poisoning an evil act. The poisoner knows poison is just\
  \ a tool toward an end, and is no different than any other weapon. Some poisoners\
  \ see themselves as great equalizers, as they are able to craft weapons that the\
  \ weakest of creatures can wield to devastating effect, but most have no lofty delusions\
  \ about their work."

  description: "At 3rd level, a poisoner can use Craft (alchemy) to change the type\
    \ of a poison. This requires 1 hour of work with an alchemist's lab and a Craft\
    \ (alchemy) skill check with a DC equal to the poison's DC. If successful, the\
    \ poison's type changes to contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury. If the check\
    \ fails, the poison is ruined. The poisoner also receives a bonus on Craft (alchemy)\
    \ skill checks when working with poison equal to 1/2 her rogue level.\nThis ability\
    \ replaces trap sense.\nRogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement\
    \ the poisoner archetype: distracting attack, lasting poison, surprise attack*,\
    \ swift poison, and weapon training*."
