  description: "A carnivalist gains use of several bardic performances, making Handle\
    \ Animal checks in place of any Perform checks.\nAt 2nd level, she gains the distraction\
    \ bardic performance.\nAt 4th level, she gains the fascinate bardic performance.\n\
    At 6th level, she also gains use of the following performance.\nTrained Legerdemain\
    \ (Ex): At 6th level, a carnivalist can command a familiar or pet within 30 feet\
    \ to make a Disable Device or Sleight of Hand check as if trained in the skill,\
    \ using its own skill ranks (if any), Dexterity modifier, and equipment, with\
    \ a competence bonus equal to 1/2 her rogue level. The check requires the normal\
    \ amount of time to complete and the DC increases by 5. The carnivalist must maintain\
    \ this pet performance each round her familiar or pet attempts a Disable Device\
    \ or Sleight of Hand check.\nThe pet performance ability otherwise functions identically\
    \ to bardic performance. Levels in a class with the distraction or fascinate bardic\
    \ performances stack with carnivalist levels for the purpose of determining bonuses\
    \ granted by these performances."

    \ her rogue level whenever she uses Handle Animal on a Tiny or Small animal. In\
    \ addition, she can increase the DC by 5 to reduce the time needed to teach an\
    \ animal a new trick or train an animal for a general purpose to 1 day for every\
    \ week normally required. She can also train more than one animal at once, although\
    \ each animal after the first adds 2 to the DC."
