  description: "At 4th level, a road keeper can discourage creatures from entering\
    \ or exiting the wild. Once per day as a standard action, she can target a creature\
    \ within 30 feet and curse it with clumsiness and disorientation. The road keeper\
    \ chooses whether to punish her target for entering the wild from a road or building,\
    \ or vice versa. If her target is entering the wild, it treats every square of\
    \ wilderness not on a road or in a building as difficult terrain. If her target\
    \ is exiting the wild, it treats every square on a road or inside a building as\
    \ difficult terrain. In either case, the ground feels uneven and the target suffers\
    \ extreme vertigo during movement. The victim of this curse can attempt a Will\
    \ saving throw (DC = 10 + half the road keeper's level + her Wisdom modifier)\
    \ at the beginning of its turn each round to end the effect. The effect lasts\
    \ until the target successfully saves or for a number of minutes equal to the\
    \ road keeper's level. A creature's movement isn't affected if it is burrowing,\
    \ climbing, earth gliding, flying, or swimming. This is a mind-affecting curse\
    \ effect.\nAt 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the road keeper can target\
    \ an additional creature per day with this ability (to a maximum number of nine\
    \ targets per day at 20th level). She can target more than one creature with a\
    \ single use of this ability or the same target more than once in the same day\
    \ (though its effects do not stack), but her total number of targets per day cannot\
    \ exceed this daily maximum. If she targets more than one creature at one time,\
    \ each target must be within 30 feet of the road keeper."
