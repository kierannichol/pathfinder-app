    \ designates a new focus, whichever occurs first. The Ranger gains a +2 bonus\

    \ grants all allies within line of sight and that can hear him a +2 bonus on initiative\
    \ checks and Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks. Also, as long as\
    \ they travel with him, the Ranger's allies leave no trail and can't be tracked.\
    \ The Ranger can choose for the group to leave a trail, or even specific members\
    \ of the group to leave a trail if he so desires.\nThis ability replaces hunter's\
