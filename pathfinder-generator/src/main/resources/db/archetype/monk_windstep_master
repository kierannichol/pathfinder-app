  description: "At 1st level, a windstep master gains Hurricane Punch as a bonus feat,\
    \ even if he does not meet the prerequisites. While using this feat, he doesn't\
    \ provoke an attack of opportunity, even if he doesn't have the Improved Bull\
    \ Rush feat.\nAt 4th level, while using the Hurricane Punch feat, the windstep\
    \ master can bull rush a target up to two size categories larger. At 12th level,\
    \ the windstep master's target can be up to three size categories larger. At 20th\
    \ level, the target can be of any size category.\nAt 8th level, when the windstep\
    \ master uses the Hurricane Punch feat to successfully bull rush a creature, he\
    \ can push the creature back an additional 5 feet. At 16th level, he can push\
    \ the creature back an additional 10 feet."
