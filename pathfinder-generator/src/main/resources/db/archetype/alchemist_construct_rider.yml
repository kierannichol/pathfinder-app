  description: "A construct rider assembles a construct mount shaped like a riding\
    \ animal. A Medium alchemist can select a camel or a horse. A Small alchemist\
    \ can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if he's at least\
    \ 4th level.\nThe GM may approve other animals as mounts.\nThis construct mount\
    \ acts in most ways as a druid animal companion, using the character's alchemist\
    \ level as his effective druid level. A construct mount is a construct, but uses\
    \ the appropriate animal companion's statistics, gaining Hit Dice, skills, feats,\
    \ and Strength and Dexterity adjustments as the alchemist advances in level. A\
    \ construct mount has no Constitution score, and instead gains bonus hit points\
    \ appropriate for a construct of its size. It has an Intelligence score (and skill\
    \ points), a lower base attack bonus, and better saving throws than a normal construct\
    \ of its Hit Dice. The mount has all the immunities of a construct (except immunity\
    \ to mind-affecting effects, since it has a mind). A construct rider can use Craft\
    \ (alchemy) instead of Handle Animal for all purposes involving his construct\
    \ mount, though the check still takes a â€“5 penalty due to the construct mount's\
    \ unusual nature.\nTo create a construct with a mind and body that are constantly\
    \ changing and improving, the construct rider must manufacture vast quantities\
    \ of clockwork or animating reagents. As such, the construct rider can never gain\
    \ the mutagen or cognatogen ability, even from a discovery or another class.\n\
    At first, his mount is a singular masterpiece created during a momentary stroke\
    \ of brilliance. At 4th level, the construct rider gains Craft Construct as a\
    \ bonus feat and can use his extracts instead of spells to meet spell prerequisites\
    \ when crafting other constructs.\nThis ability replaces Brew Potion, mutagen,\
    \ and the discovery gained at 4th level."
