  description: "Once per day, a hunting paladin can designate a single evil creature\
    \ within her sight or one that she has determined to be evil by declaring it the\
    \ target of her hunt and following its tracks; this allows her to add her Charisma\
    \ modifier as a bonus on Survival checks to follow that creature's tracks and\
    \ on Perception and Stealth checks opposed by the target of her hunt. She can\
    \ sense her target's presence and location, which lets her pinpoint her target's\
    \ location when within 10 feet; if the target has concealment, she can roll twice\
    \ and use the better result on rolls to determine whether she misses due to the\
    \ concealment. She gains uncanny dodge as per the barbarian class feature against\
    \ her target.\nIf the hunting paladin targets a nonevil creature with hunt evil,\
    \ the ability fails and it is wasted. This ability ends after 24 hours (unless\
    \ she spends the next day's use of this ability to continue hunting the same target),\
    \ after the hunting paladin or the target is killed or when she designates a new\
    \ target for her hunt."
