  description: "At 14th level, a liberator can control her movement, breathing, body\
    \ temperature, and other physiological signs to confuse the artificial visions\
    \ of constructs. At will, the barbarian can make herself undetectable to constructs\
    \ as if she were affected by a hide from undead spell that instead hides the subject\
    \ from constructs. Intelligent constructs receive a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the\
    \ barbarian's level + the barbarian's Constitution modifier) to see through this\
    \ effect. The barbarian must expend 1 round of rage for each round she uses this\
    \ ability.\nThis ability replaces indomitable will."
