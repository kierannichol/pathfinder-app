name: "Brutish Swamper"
description: "The hardy and insular denizens of the swamp produce warriors of narrow\
  \ focus and great strength. The prejudice and misunderstanding with which civilized\
  \ folk often regard barbarians is often even more pronounced in the case of these\
  \ belligerent outcasts from society, in large part due to the fact that brutish\
  \ swampers deliberately mock and antagonize the so-called “city folk.\"To a brutish\
  \ swamper, an urban lifestyle is one that breeds weakness and lassitude in the body.\
  \ The brutish swamper has little interest or patience in maintaining alliances or\
  \ friendship with those who live such soft lifestyles, and this aggression only\
  \ further encourages feelings of prejudice on both sides of the cultural divide.\
  \ When a brutish swamper joins an adventuring party, they usually come to value\
  \ the skills and talents of their more urbanized companions, but never fully understand\
  \ the desire to live lives surrounded by creature comforts."
