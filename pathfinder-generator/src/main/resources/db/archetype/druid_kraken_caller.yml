  description: "A kraken caller's options for wild shape are limited to animals with\
    \ the aquatic or water subtype or that have the amphibious special quality.\n\
    The kraken caller can alternatively expend a daily use of wild shape to grow tentacles\
    \ out of her body while otherwise retaining her own form. This effect lasts for\
    \ 10 minutes per level, or until the kraken caller changes back.\nAt 4th level,\
    \ the kraken caller grows two tentacles while in this form. The tentacles have\
    \ a reach of 5 feet regardless of the kraken caller's size, and the kraken caller\
    \ can use them as secondary natural attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage (1d3\
    \ for a Small kraken caller). She also gains a racial bonus on Climb, Swim, and\
    \ dirty trick combat maneuver checks equal to the number of tentacles grown.\n\
    At each of 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th levels, a kraken caller can grow an additional\
    \ tentacle. As a move action, she can retract or regrow any number of the additional\
    \ tentacles, redistributing the mass of any retracted tentacles. For every 2 retracted\
    \ tentacles, she can increase the reach of the remaining tentacles by 5 feet (to\
    \ a maximum of 15 feet), or increase the damage dealt by her tentacles as if she\
    \ were one size category larger.\nWhile in this form, a kraken caller can expel\
    \ a 10-foot-radius cloud of ink once per minute as a standard action.\nThis cloud\
    \ provides total concealment in water and persists for 1 round per level. The\
    \ ink has no effect out of water."
