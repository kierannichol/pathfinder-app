  description: "A transporter constantly works to obscure his trail. He increases\

    \ equal to half his ranger level (minimum 1). This does not stack with similar\
    \ abilities, such as a traceless operative's trackless ability."

  label: null

  description: "At 3rd level, a transporter can spend 1d4 hours and attempt a DC 15\
    \ Knowledge (geography) check to plot a subtle course of travel between his current\
    \ location and another destination. The transporter's course of travel is almost\
    \ never direct, as it is optimized for smuggling. Thereafter, the transporter\
    \ gains a +2 bonus on initiative, Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth,\
    \ and Survival checks involving traveling along his plotted course.\nAt 8th level,\
    \ if the transporter's Knowledge (geography) check exceeds the DC by 10, the bonuses\
    \ increase to +4. At 13th level, if his Knowledge (geography) check exceeds the\
    \ DC by 20, the bonuses increase to +6, and at 18th level, if the transporter's\
    \ check exceeds the DC by 30, the bonuses increase to +8.\nA transporter can gain\
    \ the benefits of only a single plotted course at any given time. If the transporter\
    \ ever strays from the course or attempts to plot a new course for any reason,\
    \ he loses the benefits of his current course immediately. A transporter can retry\
    \ his Knowledge (geography) check to plot a course as long as he spends 1d4 hours\
    \ each time."

  description: "At 4th level, a transporter must choose his allies as his hunter's\

    \ bonus to his allies constantly."

  name: "Hideaway"
  label: null
  type: null
  description: "A transporter can spend 1 hour and attempt a DC 20 Survival check\
    \ to create a hidden shelter, useful for staying unseen by patrols of enemy creatures.\n\
    The transporter's shelter can hold the transporter and one additional creature\
    \ for every 2 by which the transporter exceeds the DC. The created shelter incorporates\
    \ scents from the local area, preventing creatures on the inside from being detected\
    \ by the scent ability of creatures outside of the shelter, and vice versa. Additionally,\
    \ its floor is either elevated or constructed of a different substance than the\
    \ nearby ground, preventing creatures outside of the shelter from using tremorsense\
    \ to detect creatures inside, and vice versa. Finally, the clever structure of\
    \ the hideaway causes creatures outside of the shelter to take a –10 penalty on\
    \ Perception checks to notice creatures inside, as if through a 1-foot-thick wall,\
    \ while only causing creatures inside to take a –2 penalty on Perception checks\
    \ to notice creatures outside.\nThese bonuses do not apply if the enemy creatures\
    \ are intimately familiar with the area in which the hideaway was built (such\
    \ as an area right near their home)."
