  description: "At 3rd level as a standard action, a swamp poisoner can smear the\
    \ poison generated through the use of his toxic skin alternate racial trait onto\
    \ the ground in a 5-foot area, instead of onto a weapon or his own body. The first\
    \ creature other than the swamp poisoner to enter the area is exposed to the poison.\n\
    The poison loses its potency after 1 hour. This area is considered a trap, and\
    \ the DCs of Perception checks to notice it and Disable Device checks to disable\
    \ it are equal to 10 + half the swamp poisoner's level + the swamp poisoner's\
    \ Constitution modifier.\nThe swamp poisoner also gains an extra use per day of\
    \ his toxic skin alternate racial trait, plus one additional use per day for every\
    \ 3 levels beyond 3rd."
