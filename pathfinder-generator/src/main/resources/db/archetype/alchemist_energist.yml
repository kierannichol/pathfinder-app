  description: "An energist's bombs deal damage based on the energy he chose at 1st\
    \ level. If he chose positive energy, his bombs damage undead creatures, dealing\
    \ an amount of positive energy damage equal to his normal bomb damage.\nIf he\
    \ chose negative energy, his bombs damage the living, dealing 1d4 points of negative\
    \ energy damage plus 1d4 additional points at every odd-numbered alchemist level\
    \ beyond 1st (instead of 1d6). He can't apply discoveries with an asterisk (*)\
    \ to his bombs. When an energist reaches 10th level, undead damaged by his positive\
    \ energy bombs must succeed at a Will save or flee for 1 round as if affected\
    \ by the Turn Undead feat, while living creatures damaged by an energist's negative\
    \ energy bombs must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round. An\
    \ energist's bombs don't heal creatures normally healed by the energist's chosen\
    \ energy type."

  description: "At 2nd level, as a standard action, an energist can create and throw\
    \ a healing ampoule of the same energy type as his bombs up to 30 feet, using\
    \ two of his daily uses of bombs. A living creature subject to a direct hit by\
    \ a healing ampoule of positive energy regains 1d4 hit points plus an additional\
    \ 1d4 hit points for every even-numbered alchemist level an energist has beyond\
    \ 2nd, while a direct hit by a negative energy healing ampoule instead restores\
    \ an equivalent number of hit points to an undead target.\nIn either case, the\
    \ energist adds his Intelligence modifier to the number of hit points healed,\
    \ as if the ampoule were a splash weapon benefiting from his throw anything ability.\
    \ A healing ampoule has no splash effect on adjacent targets unless it misses\
    \ the target; if it misses, determine where it lands as if it were a splash weapon.\
    \ Healing ampoules don't damage creatures normally damaged by the energist's chosen\
    \ energy type."

  description: "At 2nd level, an energist gains energy resistance equal to his alchemist\
    \ level to positive or negative energy, whichever would naturally harm him. When\
    \ on a positive-dominant plane such as the Positive Energy Plane, he can apply\
