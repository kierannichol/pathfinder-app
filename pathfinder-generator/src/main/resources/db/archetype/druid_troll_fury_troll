    \ chant over another troll within 30 feet, bolstering it against fear and improving\
    \ its combat abilities. This works like the inspire courage bard ability, but\
    \ affects only one troll and lasts 1 minute. The troll fury uses her druid level\
    \ as her bard level to determine the effects of this ability."

  description: "At 4th level, a troll fury can select one creature type from the ranger's\
    \ favored enemy list and gains a favored enemy bonus against that creature type\
    \ with an effective ranger level equal to her druid level. This ability never\
    \ grants the troll fury favored enemy bonuses against a second favored enemy creature\
    \ type. A troll fury can change her favored enemy type once per week by performing\
    \ a ritual that takes 1 hour to perform. If a troll fury already has a favored\
    \ enemy from another class, the levels from the classes that grant favored enemies\
    \ stack with this one to determine the favored enemy bonuses, and in this case\
    \ she can gain other favored enemy creature types."

    \ does not stack with itself. Each time the troll fury or her animal companion\
    \ hits the target, this ability lasts for the next 24 hours."
