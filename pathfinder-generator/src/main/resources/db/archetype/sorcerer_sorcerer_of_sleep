  description: "As a standard action, a sorcerer of sleep can make a melee touch attack\
    \ against a living creature to cause one of the following effects (sorcerer's\
    \ choice): the target gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength, the target is\
    \ fatigued, or the target takes a â€“2 penalty on saving throws against illusion\
    \ and mind-affecting effects. The effects of keif touch last a number of rounds\
    \ equal to 1/2 the sorcerer of sleep's sorcerer level. The effects of keif touch\
    \ are not cumulative, and cannot make the target exhausted. A sorcerer of sleep\
    \ can use keif touch a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier."
