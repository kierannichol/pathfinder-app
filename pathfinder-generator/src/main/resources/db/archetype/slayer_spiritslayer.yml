  description: "At 2nd level, a spiritslayer manifests an uncanny sixth sense regarding\
    \ the presence of invisible creatures. He gains Blind-Fight as a bonus feat and\
    \ ignores the usual +20 bonus to the DC of any Perception check to pinpoint the\
    \ location of an invisible creature. If the spiritslayer manages to pinpoint an\
    \ invisible creature's location using a Perception check, he can study that creature\
    \ with his studied target ability as a swift action.\nIn addition, whenever the\
    \ spiritslayer studies a possessed creature, he can automatically switch his studied\
    \ target from the possessed creature to the possessing entity should that entity\
    \ be expelled from his studied target. A spiritslayer adds his studied target\
    \ bonus on attack rolls to all saving throws he attempts against possession effects\
    \ used by his studied targets."

  description: "A spiritslayer can select the following slayer talents, in addition\
    \ to general slayer talents.\nDisrupt Possession (Ex): Whenever a spiritslayer\
    \ with this talent deals sneak attack damage to a creature that is being possessed,\
    \ he also deals his sneak attack damage to the possessing entity. Once per round,\
    \ a possessed creature that is damaged by disrupt possession can attempt a new\
    \ Will saving throw to end the possession, gaining a +1 bonus on its save for\
    \ each sneak attack damage die the spiritslayer rolled. This talent alters the\
    \ spiritslayer's sneak attack, and doesn't stack with other talents that alter\
    \ sneak attack. A spiritslayer must be at least 8th level before selecting this\
    \ talent.\nGreater Spirit Sense: A spiritslayer who selects this talent gains\
    \ Greater Blind-Fight as a bonus feat, ignoring its prerequisites. In addition,\
    \ he adds 1/2 his slayer level to his Perception checks to pinpoint the location\
    \ of ethereal creatures, and once per round he can attempt a Perception check\
    \ to pinpoint the locations of all invisible creatures within 30 feet of him without\
    \ needing to take an action. A spiritslayer must be at least 10th level and have\
    \ the improved spirit sense spiritslayer talent before selecting this talent."

  description: "At 7th level, whenever a spiritslayer makes an outsider or undead\
    \ creature with the incorporeal subtype his studied target, his attacks count\
    \ as magic for the purpose of striking that creature (though this doesn't give\
    \ his attacks an enhancement bonus) and he can deal precision-based damage to\
    \ such creatures (though his precision damage is reduced by 50% unless he has\
    \ a means to bypass the creature's reduction in damage from corporeal sources,\
    \ such as a ghost touch weapon). At 14th level, the spiritslayer's attacks against\
    \ outsiders or undead creatures with the incorporeal subtype ignore the 50% reduction\
    \ in damage from magical corporeal sources that such creatures have and can deal\
    \ precision-based damage to incorporeal creatures."
