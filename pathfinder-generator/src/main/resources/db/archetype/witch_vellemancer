  description: "At 2nd level, a vellemancer learns to invest magical aid into a willing\
    \ creature. Each day, she can implant a number of hexes equal to half her witch\
    \ level (minimum 1) plus her Intelligence bonus (if any). Any given creature can\
    \ have only one hex implanted at a given time, and implanting a new hex ends the\
    \ previous one (the witch still loses the use of this ability she spent on the\
    \ previous hex).\nOnly beneficial hexes capable of affecting another creature\
    \ can be implanted with invested hex, and this counts against the uses per day\
    \ of hexes with limited uses per day or per creature.\nTo implant a hex, the vellemancer\
    \ must take a standard action and touch a willing creature. The vellemancer can\
    \ activate the hex as a free action, or the hex can activate automatically when\
    \ a single predetermined condition is met (decided when the hex is implanted).\n\
    The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the\
    \ witch to trigger the hex, but a predetermined condition can activate the hex\
    \ regardless of range. An implanted hex lasts until the next time the witch regains\
    \ her spells.\nOnce triggered, a hex is no longer implanted and can't be triggered\
    \ again."

  description: "Beginning at 6th level, a vellemancer can borrow mental strength from\
    \ others' hopes and dreams to empower her own spellcasting. A creature can make\
    \ a wish as a free action at any time, even during the vellemancer's turn. The\
    \ vellemancer must be able to hear and understand a wish in order to use it as\
    \ a spell component. A spell that doesn't normally have a verbal component gains\
    \ one when cast using this ability. A wish doesn't need to mention the name of\
    \ a specific spell, but it must describe an outcome that can be accomplished by\
    \ casting a spell the vellemancer knows (for example, wishing to be more likable\
    \ could supply the verbal component for alter self, eagle's splendor, or even\
    \ baleful polymorph, depending on the results). A vellemancer gains a +1 bonus\
    \ to her caster level when using a creature's wish as a verbal component in this\
    \ manner, but she cannot include herself as a target of such spells. She can be\
    \ affected by such a spell if it affects an area rather than one or more targets.\
    \ A vellemancer is under no compulsion to grant a creature's wish. Once the vellemancer\
    \ grants a creature's wish using this ability, she cannot use this ability to\
    \ grant that creature any further wishes for 24 hours."
