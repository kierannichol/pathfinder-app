  description: "At 1st level, an appeaser gains no domain or domain bonus spells.\
    \ Once per day as a standard action, he can sacrifice his own force of will to\
    \ gain divine providence. Doing so deals 1d3 points of Charisma damage to the\
    \ appeaser, and allows him to select a single domain offered by his deity (except\
    \ the Evil domain or its subdomains). The appeaser gains access to any granted\
    \ powers offered by the domain he would otherwise qualify for, and can sacrifice\
    \ a prepared spell to cast a domain spell from that domain just as if he were\
    \ spontaneously casting a cure or inflict spell. He retains access to this domain\
    \ for a number of minutes equal to 1/2 the appeaser's cleric level + plus his\
    \ Wisdom modifier. Any domain abilities that can be used a limited number of times\
    \ per day can be used only once each time that particular domain is invoked.\n\
    An appeaser can gain a mollified domain one additional time per day (taking Charisma\
    \ damage each time) at 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, to a maximum of\
    \ seven times per day at 19th level. An appeaser can invoke only a single mollified\
    \ domain at a time."
