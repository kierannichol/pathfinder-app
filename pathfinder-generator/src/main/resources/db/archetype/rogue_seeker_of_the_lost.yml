  description: "Typically, only magical traps survive for long periods underwater,\
    \ so a seeker of the lost specializes in noticing and disarming such traps. At\
    \ 3rd level, a seeker of the lost gains a +1 competence bonus on Perception checks\
    \ to notice magical traps and on Disable Device checks to disarm magical traps.\
    \ This bonus increases by an additional +1 every 3 levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum\
    \ of +6 at 18th level)."

  description: "At 4th level, a seeker of the lost gains the ability to strike precisely\
    \ underwater.\nWhen a seeker of the lost makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon,\
    \ the damage is not halved for being made underwater, as is usually the case for\
    \ attacks that deal slashing or bludgeoning damage or, if the rogue is off-balance,\
    \ attacks that deal piercing damage (see off-balance). In addition, when a seeker\
    \ of the lost makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon against a construct, she\
    \ ignores any hardness the construct has."

    \ using Disable Device, she does not spring the trap unless she fails by an amount\
    \ equal to her rogue level or more. If she does set off a trap she was attempting\
    \ to disarm, she doubles her trap sense bonus to avoid the trap."
