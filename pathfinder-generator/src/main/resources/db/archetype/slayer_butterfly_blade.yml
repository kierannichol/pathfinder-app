    \ than at 7th level. The butterfly blade doesn't add his studied target bonus\
    \ on Knowledge or Survival checks.\nThis ability alters studied target and replaces\
    \ track.\nBonus Feats: Whenever a butterfly blade would gain a slayer talent,\
    \ he can instead select a feat from the following list: Cutting Humiliation, Enforcer,\
    \ Intimidating Prowess, Nerve-Racking Negotiator, or Threatening Negotiator. The\
    \ butterfly blade does not need to meet the feat's prerequisites."

  description: "Butterfly blades train to inflict painful cuts rather than lethal\
    \ ones. A butterfly blade can deal nonlethal damage with butterfly swords without\
    \ taking a penalty on attack rolls. At 3rd level, a butterfly blade gets a +1\
    \ bonus on attack rolls with butterfly swords, and the damage die of any butterfly\
    \ sword he wields increases by one step; at 9th level and again at 15th level,\
    \ the attack bonus increases by 1 and the damage die increases by an additional\
    \ step.\nAt 6th level, the butterfly blade gains the knockout class feature, as\
    \ per a brawler of his class level â€“ 2."

    \ and at 14th level, it becomes a constant spell-like ability that he can activate\
    \ or deactivate as a free action. The ability's caster level is equal to his slayer\
    \ class level, and the DC is equal to 10 + the number of ranks the butterfly blade\
    \ has in either Bluff or Intimidate, whichever is higher."

    \ When he strikes a foe with a butterfly sword, he automatically confirms critical\
    \ threats. In addition, any butterfly sword he wields is treated as if it has\
    \ the speed weapon special ability. If the weapon already has the speed weapon\
