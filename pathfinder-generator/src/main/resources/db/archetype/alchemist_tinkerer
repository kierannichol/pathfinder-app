  description: "At 1st level, a tinkerer forms a bond with one of her creations, and\
    \ begins play with it at no cost. This functions as the familiar option of the\
    \ wizard's arcane bond class feature, with the tinkerer's effective wizard level\
    \ equal to her alchemist level. If a tinkerer would gain a familiar through another\
    \ class, those levels stack for purposes of determining the familiar's abilities.\n\
    A tinkerer's familiar can take any shape the tinkerer wishes, but its statistics\
    \ and abilities are identical to a clockwork spy with the normal adjustments and\
    \ abilities for a familiar applied, and it is a construct with the clockwork subtype.\
    \ At 3rd level, if the tinkerer has the infusion discovery, a clockwork spy familiar\
    \ can deliver the tinkerer's extracts with a range of touch for her. At 7th level,\
    \ a clockwork spy can communicate with constructs with the clockwork subtype.\
    \ Unlike most familiars, a clockwork spy does not grant special abilities to its\
    \ master.\nWith 1 minute of work and a successful DC 15 Heal check, a tinkerer\
    \ can restore 1d4 hit points to her clockwork spy familiar. At 4th level, a tinkerer\
    \ can restore 1d6 hit points to her familiar in this same way. This amount increases\
    \ to an additional 1d6 hit points every 4 levels thereafter (2d6 at 8th level,\
    \ 3d6 at 12th level, 4d6 at 16th level, and 5d6 at 20th level)."

  description: "At 14th level, a tinkerer can use her mechanical mastery to create\

    \ number of hours per day equal to her alchemist level. When creating such a clockwork\
    \ item, the tinkerer must use materials worth an amount equal to the wondrous\
    \ item's construction cost. She need not meet any of the item's other creation\
    \ requirements. A tinkerer cannot create a mimicry of a consumable wondrous item\
    \ or a wondrous item with finite charges, and she can have only one mimicry at\
    \ a time. The clockwork item never functions as a wondrous item for any other\
    \ creature.\nThe tinkerer can spend 1 hour disassembling a clockwork mimicry and\
    \ reassembling it into a mimicry of a different wondrous item. When she disassembles\
    \ a clockwork mimicry, she can salvage parts worth half of the mimicry's creation\
    \ cost. She still must pay the full creation cost for the new mimicry. This resets\
    \ the duration the mimicry functions per day.\nThis replaces persistent mutagen."
