  description: "A divine paragon is intensely devoted to a single deity, and her alignment\
    \ must be identical to her deity's alignment. She gains Deific Obedience as a\
    \ bonus feat, even if she doesn't meet the feat's prerequisites. She gains access\
    \ to her boons at an accelerated rate (see below) rather than the standard HD-based\
    \ rate granted by Deific Obedience (and as such cannot benefit from the accelerated\
    \ rate granted by the Deific Obedience feat).\nWhen the divine paragon selects\
    \ her domains, she must designate one of the two domains she gains as her devoted\
    \ domain. She gains all of this domain's granted powers and domain spells normally.\
    \ For her other domain, she gains only its domain spells--she does not gain any\
    \ of the granted powers of that domain. Instead, she must choose from the evangelist,\
    \ exalted, or sentinel boons granted by her deity. At 5th level, she gains access\
    \ to the first boon granted by her deity.\nAt 11th level, she gains access to\
    \ the second boon. At 14th level, she gains access to the third boon.\nIn order\
    \ to retain access to her domain spells, the domain powers of her devoted domain,\
    \ and the boons granted by Deific Obedience, the divine paragon must perform her\
    \ obedience daily. If she fails to do so, she loses access to these abilities\
    \ until she next performs her obedience (but she can still cast spells, channel\
    \ energy, and perform other abilities granted by her cleric levels)."

  description: "At 1st level, a mark appears somewhere on the divine paragon's body.\
    \ The mark's location varies by individual and faith, but takes the form of the\
    \ deity's holy symbol and generally appears in a location easy to display, such\
    \ as on the hand, forearm, chest, or face. An uncovered divine brand functions\
    \ as a holy (or unholy) symbol and as a divine focus for spellcasting. The divine\
    \ paragon's aura is even more powerful than a typical cleric's as a result of\
    \ her devotion, and her cleric level is treated as 1 higher for the purpose of\
    \ determining the strength of her aura when it is viewed by spells like detect\
    \ good."
