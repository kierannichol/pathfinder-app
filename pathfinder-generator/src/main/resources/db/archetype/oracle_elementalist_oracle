description: "An elementalist oracle shares an affinity with the elements and elemental\
  \ creatures. She can communicate with elemental creatures and can eventually become\
  \ an elemental herself. She sees perfection in manifestations of elemental fury\
  \ in the natural world, be they the thunderous wrath of the storm, the churning\
  \ waters of the ocean's tides or a flooding river, the terrain-shaping power of\
  \ a landslide or earthquake, or the apocalyptic fury of a volcanic eruption."

  description: "At 20th level, you fully harness the power of the elements. You can\
    \ apply the Elemental Spell metamagic feat to spells you cast without increasing\
    \ the level or casting time. You can choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire each\
    \ time you use this ability. Whenever you score a critical hit with an attack\
    \ that deals energy damage, you ignore the target's energy resistance (if any).\
    \ If you score such a critical hit against a creature that has immunity to the\
    \ energy type you are attacking with, the creature takes half damage from the\
    \ attack."
