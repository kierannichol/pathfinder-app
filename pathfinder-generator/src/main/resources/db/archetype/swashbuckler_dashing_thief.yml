  description: "A dashing thief takes foes aback with her forwardness, shocking them\
    \ into submission long enough to rush past or stage a getaway. At 3rd level, as\
    \ a free action when she successfully feints against a foe, she can spend 1 panache\
    \ point to pull the enemy into a quick kiss (or similar gesture).\nThe target\
    \ is dazed for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the dashing\
    \ thief's class level + her Charisma modifier). A creature dazed this way is immune\
    \ to that dashing thief's dazing charm deed for 24 hours. Whether or not a creature\
    \ could potentially be affected by a dazing charm deed is ultimately subject to\
    \ GM adjudication. As a general rule, however, it works on creatures of the dashing\
    \ thief's creature type, or on those of a different type but who share significant\
    \ thematic similarities (for example, a human dashing thief could use her dazing\
    \ charm deed on any humanoid, but also potentially on creatures as diverse as\
    \ dryads, tieflings, or even centaurs or sphinxes)."
