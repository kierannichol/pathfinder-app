  description: "The arcane physician treats all spells of the healing subschool on\
    \ the alchemist extract list as if they were on the wizard spell list for the\
    \ purpose of activating magic items.\nAdditionally, he can expend a spell slot\
    \ of the appropriate level to meet the spell requirements for magic item construction\
    \ (including potions) as if the expended spell slot contained any alchemist spell\
    \ that belongs to the healing subschool. If the spell is on both the wizard and\
    \ alchemist lists, the arcane physician may expend a slot equal to the spell's\
    \ alchemist level instead of the spell's wizard level. At 8th level, the arcane\
    \ physician can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher as a standard action\
    \ to alter a potion or alchemical remedy held in hand. An alchemical remedy can\
    \ become any other alchemical remedy of the same or lower price of the arcane\
    \ physician's choice. A potion can change to contain any alchemist extract of\
    \ the arcane physician's choice that belongs to the healing subschool and is of\
    \ the same level as or lower than the expended spell slot. The extract must have\
    \ no material component costing more than 1 gp, and it must be one that it is\
    \ possible to make into a potion."
