  description: "A gun chemist is adept at using his know-how to infuse his ammunition\
    \ with volatile chemicals and his own magical reserves. When loading a firearm,\
    \ he can infuse the ammunition as a free action. The compounds are unstable, and\
    \ if not fired within a number of rounds equal to the gun chemist's Intelligence\
    \ modifier (though no sooner than the end of his next turn), the alchemical ordnance\
    \ becomes inert and loses its additional effects; he can still fire the firearm\
    \ as normal. Each day, the gun chemist can infuse a number of pieces of alchemical\
    \ ordnance equal to his class level + his Intelligence modifier, and he can fire\
    \ no more than one piece per round.\nAlchemical ordnance deals damage as normal,\
    \ plus an amount of fire damage equal to 1d6 + the gun chemist's Intelligence\
    \ modifier. The damage of the gun chemist's alchemical ordnance increases by 1d6\
    \ points at every odd-numbered class level (this bonus damage is not multiplied\
    \ on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike). The explosive nature\
    \ of alchemical ordnance causes the attack-- both the firearm's base damage and\
    \ the alchemical ordnance's additional damage--to deal full damage to swarms of\
    \ any size. If the gun chemist uses alchemical ordnance to make a scattering shot\
    \ with a weapon with the scatter quality, each creature in the area instead takes\
    \ additional fire damage equal to the alchemical ordnance's minimum damage (so\
    \ if the alchemical ordnance would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage normally,\
    \ it deals only 6 points of fire damage with a scattering shot).\nThe gun chemist's\
    \ alchemical ordnance functions safely only in weapons he wields. If anyone but\
    \ a gun chemist attempts to fire a firearm loaded with alchemical ordnance that\
    \ is not yet inert, the firearm's misfire value increases by 4.\nIf the firearm\
    \ would explode as the result of such a misfire, the explosion deals additional\
    \ fire damage equal to that of the alchemical ordnance.\nAlchemical ordnance is\
    \ treated like an alchemist's bomb for the purpose of discoveries, though such\
    \ discoveries ignore any effects associated with a bomb's splash damage or radius\
    \ unless the gun chemist also applies the exploding bullet discovery (see below).\
    \ A scattering shot modified by a discovery applies additional effects as though\
    \ affected creatures were caught in the splash damage of a bomb rather than subject\
    \ to a direct hit. The DCs of saving throws associated with alchemical ordnance\
    \ are equal to 10 + half the gun chemist's alchemist level + the gun chemist's\
    \ Intelligence modifier."

    \ such an alchemical cartridge and it allows a saving throw to negate or reduce\
    \ the cartridge's effect, the saving throw's DC increases by 1 (to a maximum DC\
    \ of 22). The DC increases by an additional 1 at 5th level and every 3 levels\
    \ thereafter (to a maximum of 7 higher at 20th level). When a gun chemist fires\
    \ an alchemical cartridge that deals a type of damage in place of a firearm's\
    \ normal damage (such as a dragon's breath cartridge), he can increase the damage\
