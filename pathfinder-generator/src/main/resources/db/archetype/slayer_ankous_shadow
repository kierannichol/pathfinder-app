  description: "An ankou's shadow can take a full-round action to create a single,\
    \ quasi-real, shadowy duplicate. This shadow double remains in his square, mimicking\
    \ his movements as a single mirror image, except that it lasts until it is destroyed\
    \ or he chooses to dismiss it as a swift action. This ability does not stack with\
    \ the mirror image spell or with similar abilities, such as the copycat ability\
    \ of the Trickery domain.\nAt 5th level, an ankou's shadow gains a second shadow\
    \ double. In addition to using these shadow doubles as mirror images in his square,\
    \ he can move his doubles as part of his own move action, dividing his movement\
    \ between himself and his doubles. When outside his square, shadow doubles do\
    \ not protect the ankou's shadow as mirror image and are limited in the actions\
    \ they can take. Shadow doubles provide flanking for the ankou's shadow and his\
    \ allies, but they do not possess teamwork feats or special abilities that alter\
    \ the effects of flanking or aiding another. As a swift action, the ankou's shadow\
    \ can direct his shadow doubles to use the aid another action, using his own base\
    \ attack bonus plus his Intelligence modifier for the roll. Although a shadow\
    \ double appears to duplicate the ankou's shadow's gear, this gear is part of\
    \ its form; a shadow double's gear cannot be destroyed, dropped, or stolen. A\
    \ shadow double disappears if it ventures more than 50 feet from the ankou's shadow\
    \ or if it leaves his line of sight or effect. A shadow double that is hit by\
    \ an attack roll or takes any damage is destroyed. The AC of a shadow double is\
    \ equal to the ankou's shadow's touch AC, and it has the same CMD and saving throw\
    \ bonuses as the ankou's shadow. Shadow doubles possess evasion if the ankou's\
    \ shadow does. Mind-affecting effects targeting a shadow double affect the ankou's\
    \ shadow instead, though he isn't affected twice by effects that target both him\
    \ and a shadow double.\nAt 10th level, an ankou's shadow gains a third shadow\
    \ double. He can divide his actions between his actual body and his shadow doubles,\
    \ using them as the origin point for attacks or abilities. For example, an ankou's\
    \ shadow making three attacks as a part of a full attack could make his primary\
    \ attack from his own body and his other two attacks from two of his shadow doubles.\n\
    At 15th level, an ankou's shadow gains a fourth shadow double. In addition to\
    \ the abilities above, an ankou's shadow can assign the doubles to perform simple\
    \ tasks on their own, as the unseen servant spell, except that the shadow doubles\
    \ have an effective Strength score of 10."
