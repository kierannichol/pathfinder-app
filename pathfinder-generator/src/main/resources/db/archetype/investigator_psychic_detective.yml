  description: "A psychic detective casts psychic spells drawn from the psychic class\
    \ spell list and augmented by a select set of additional spells (see Psychic Detective\
    \ Spells). Only spells from the psychic class spell list of 6th level or lower\
    \ and psychic detective spells are considered to be part of the psychic detective's\
    \ spell list. If a spell appears on both the psychic detective and psychic class\
    \ spell lists, the psychic detective uses the spell level from the psychic detective\
    \ spell list. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time.\
    \ To learn or cast a spell, a psychic detective must have an Intelligence score\
    \ equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The saving throw DC against a psychic\
    \ detective's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the psychic detective's Intelligence\
    \ modifier.\nLike other spellcasters, a psychic detective can cast only a certain\
    \ number of spells of each spell level per day. She knows the same number of spells\
    \ and receives the same number of spells slots per day as a bard of her investigator\
    \ level, and knows and uses 0-level knacks as a bard uses cantrips. In addition,\
    \ she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score.\nAt\
    \ 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a psychic detective can choose to learn\
    \ a new spell in place of one she already knows, using the same rules as a bard.\n\
    In effect, the psychic detective loses the old spell in exchange for the new one.\
    \ The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged,\
    \ and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the psychic\
    \ detective can cast.\nA psychic detective need not prepare her spells in advance.\
    \ She can cast any psychic detective spell she knows at any time, assuming she\
    \ has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.\n\
    Psychic Detective Spells: A psychic detective has the following spells on her\
    \ spell list, in addition to psychic spells of 6th level or lower.\n1st--Detect\
    \ chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, find traps. 3rd--Calm spirit*,\
    \ daylight. 4th--Modify memory. 6th--Banishment, moment of prescience, scrying\
    \ (greater)."
