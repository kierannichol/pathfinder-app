    \ can choose to increase the save DC of any spell with the fear descriptor she\

  description: "At 8th level, a Dark Sister can violently dismiss her curses to counter\
    \ magical boons and impose her own capricious whims. Once per day, after the Dark\
    \ Sister has successfully affected a creature within 30 feet with a mind-affecting\
    \ spell, spell-like ability, or hex with a duration of longer than 1 round, she\
    \ can choose to dismiss the mind-affecting effect as an immediate action. If she\
    \ dismisses this effect in response to another creature targeting her victim with\
    \ a beneficial spell or ability, the witch's effect is dismissed and the caster\
    \ of the beneficial spell or ability must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2\
    \ the witch's level + her Intelligence modifier) or the spell or ability is wasted\
    \ to no effect and the targeted victim takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. At 14th\
    \ and 20th levels, a Dark Sister can use this ability an additional time per day."

    \ summon the night hag from the Shadow Plane.\nThe night hag serves the Dark Sister\
    \ to the best of its ability as long as the witch's commands are consistent with\
    \ the night hag's alignment and goals, but flees back to its native plane after\
    \ a number of rounds equal to the witch's level or upon losing half or more of\
    \ its hit points. The night hag may provide the Dark Sister with other favors\
    \ or gifts at the GM's discretion.\nAt 15th and 18th levels, a Dark Sister can\
    \ call upon her hag crony an additional time per week."
