description: "Some witches find their patrons while in the throes of despair and grief\
  \ when all they desire is to see the veneer of civilization peel back to reveal\
  \ the filth and rot that underlies all things. The arcane power they inherit is\
  \ bleak and tainted, eating them from the inside out and transforming them into\
  \ living avatars of entropy."

  description: "A putrefactor's body hosts various pests--insects, rats, or other\
    \ scavengers--as part of her connection with her patron. She treats the infestation\
    \ as her familiar, and she communes with the infestation to prepare spells. She\
    \ still selects a familiar, which must be a house centipede, rat, scarlet spider,\
    \ or toad; the familiar crawls within her among the other vermin. A putrefactor\
    \ must be of chaotic alignment and must choose one of the following patrons: Animals,\
    \ Death, Plague, or Rot."

    \ a melee attack, the creatures spill out and bite the attacker, dealing 1d6 points\
    \ of damage, which count as damage from a Diminutive swarm. A creature can take\
    \ damage from this ability only once per round. This damage increases by 1d6 at\
    \ 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter."

  description: "At 4th level, the infestation begins assuming various functions of\
    \ the witch's organs. She gains a 25% chance to negate the extra damage from critical\
    \ hits and sneak attacks, as per the light fortification magic armor ability.\
    \ At 10th level, this increases to a 50% chance (as per moderate fortification),\
    \ and at 16th level it increases to a 75% chance (as per heavy fortification).\
    \ Whenever the putrefactor negates additional damage from a melee attack in this\
    \ way, the attacker takes damage as if exposed to her verminous blood, even if\
    \ it has already been targeted by this ability this round."

  description: "At 6th level, while her familiar is inside her, the putrefactor can\
    \ disgorge all the crawling creatures within her at once as a standard action,\
    \ retaining only her familiar. When she does, she loses 2 hit points per class\
    \ level and forms a spider swarm as per the spell vomit swarm. The swarm gains\
    \ the Armor Class and saving throw bonuses of her familiar. The swarm deals her\
    \ verminous blood damage instead of its normal damage; while the swarm lasts,\
    \ the putrefactor loses access to her verminous blood ability. The witch can target\
    \ creatures with her hexes as if she occupied both the swarm's space and her own.\
    \ When the duration ends, the swarm tries its best to return to her and crawl\
    \ back into her body, restoring hit points equal to its current hit points, up\
    \ to her maximum hit points. If the swarm dies or cannot return to her once the\
    \ spell's duration ends, the witch does not regain any of her spent hit points.\n\
    Once she reabsorbs the swarm, she can't disgorge it again for 1 hour."
