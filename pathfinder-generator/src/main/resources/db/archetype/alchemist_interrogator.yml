  description: "At 1st level, an interrogator uses his skill with alchemy to create\
    \ injections. Each day, an interrogator can create a number of injections equal\
    \ to his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier. It takes 1 hour to create\
    \ the injections. An injection is inert until the interrogator attempts to use\
    \ it.\nUsing an injection is a standard action that requires a melee touch attack.\
    \ If the attack hits, the target of an injection takes a â€“2 penalty on its Will\
    \ saving throws for a number of minutes equal to half the interrogator's class\
    \ level (minimum 1). If the interrogator is also using a serum with this injection,\
    \ the penalty on Will saves applies to any save against the serum.\nIf the melee\
    \ touch attack fails, the injection isn't delivered but can still be used again--once\
    \ activated, it remains potent for 1 day. An injection that hasn't been administered\
    \ becomes inert if it leaves the interrogator's possession, reactivating as soon\
    \ as it returns to his possession. The penalties from multiple injections don't\
    \ stack, nor do the penalties from injections stack with penalties from a mesmerist's\
    \ stare or a witch's evil eye hex.\nInjections are mind-affecting poison effects."

  description: "At 1st level, an interrogator augments his ability to influence others\
    \ through supplemental serums.\nAn interrogator prepares his serums at the same\
    \ time as his injections and he can apply them to any injection as a swift action\
    \ before he makes the attack roll for the injection.\nAn interrogator knows one\
    \ serum at 1st level and can learn another serum in place of a discovery. The\
    \ save DCs of serums are equal to 10 + 1/2 the interrogator's alchemist level\
    \ + his Intelligence modifier. A creature can be under the effect of only a single\
    \ serum at a time--with the exception of memory modification serum--with any further\
    \ serums on the same creature replacing the old serum. Unless otherwise noted,\
    \ a creature that succeeds on its saving throw against a serum is immune to that\
    \ serum's effects for 24 hours.\nAn interrogator can never gain any sort of mutagen\
    \ or cognatogen, even from a discovery or another class.\nThis ability replaces\
    \ mutagen and persistent mutagen."
