  description: "At 1st level, an alchemical sapper can create a demolition bomb. This\

    \ damage, the other half of which is fire damage.\nThis bomb ignores a number\
    \ of points of hardness up to 1/2 the alchemical sapper's level (minimum 1). This\
    \ counts as an ability that modifies the alchemical sapper's bomb, so it doesn't\
    \ stack with other discoveries that modify bombs. The alchemical sapper can't\
    \ use his demolition bomb with the fast bombs discovery. An alchemical sapper\
    \ can only expend one use of his bomb class feature to create a demolition bomb\
    \ once per day. He can create one additional demolition bomb per day at 5th level\
    \ and every 4 alchemist levels thereafter."

  label: null
  type: null
  description: "At 6th level, an alchemical sapper can expend two uses of his bomb\
    \ class feature to prepare a special kind of trap called a trip mine. This special\
    \ bomb remains inert until 1 round after it leaves the alchemical sapper's possession,\
    \ after which time it becomes armed. When a creature enters a square containing\
    \ an armed trip mine, it explodes, dealing normal bomb damage to all creatures\
    \ in its square (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemical sapper's alchemist level + his Intelligence\
    \ modifier; Reflex half ) and splash damage to every creature adjacent to that\
    \ square. A trip mine can be disarmed with a successful Disable Device check (with\
    \ a DC equal to the trip mine's save DC); otherwise, it lasts until the next time\
    \ the alchemical sapper refreshes his daily bombs.\nIf the alchemical sapper expends\
    \ four uses of his bomb class feature, his trip mine deals damage as per a demolition\
    \ bomb; this does not count against his daily uses of the demolition bomb ability.\
    \ Other than demolition bomb, discoveries that modify bombs cannot apply to trip\
    \ mine."
