  description: "At 4th level, rather than forge a bond with an animal or his allies,\
    \ a planar scout forms a bond with a specific plane. The planar scout becomes\
    \ infused with the essence of his plane of choice, taking on physical characteristics\
    \ of denizens native to his chosen plane as well as the abilities listed below.\n\
    Aligned Plane: If the planar scout selects a plane with an alignment trait, he\
    \ gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against outsiders and creatures\
    \ with the extraplanar subtype whose alignments oppose this alignment trait. This\
    \ bonus increases by 1 at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter.\nAstral Plane:\
    \ Each day, the planar scout can teleport up to 5 feet per ranger level as a move\
    \ action. This must be used in 5-foot increments. At 10th level, he can do so\
    \ as a swift action.\nEthereal Plane: The planar scout can damage incorporeal\
    \ creatures with mundane weapons as if they were ghost touch weapons, and at 10th\
    \ level, he can inflict critical hits and deal precision damage to incorporeal\
    \ creatures.\nFey World: As a swift action a number of times per day equal to\
    \ his Wisdom modifier, a planar scout can gain fast healing 2 for a number of\
    \ rounds equal to his ranger level.\nPlane of Air: As a swift action, the planar\
    \ scout can gain a fly speed (average) equal to his base speed for a number of\
    \ minutes equal to his ranger level (minimum 1 minute). This duration need not\
    \ be used consecutively.\nPlane of Earth: The planar scout gains a +1 bonus to\
    \ his natural armor. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels he gains beyond\
    \ 4th level.\nPlane of Fire: As a swift action, the planar scout can wreathe his\
    \ body in flames. This grants the planar scout fire resistance 5 and causes his\
    \ melee attacks to each deal 1d4 additional points of fire damage. The scout's\
    \ fire resistance increases to 10 at 9th level, and 15 at 14th level. He can use\
    \ this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his level. These rounds\
    \ need not be used consecutively.\nPlane of Shadow: The planar scout gains darkvision\
    \ 60 feet and a +4 bonus on Stealth checks. The bonus on Stealth checks increases\
    \ by 2 at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter.\nPlane of Water: The planar\
    \ scout gains the amphibious subtype and a swim speed equal to base speed."
