  description: "At 5th level, a bonded wizard wearing or wielding her bonded object\
    \ can channel magical energies through it to create tools, armor, and weapons\
    \ from pure force. She gains a pool of force points equal to half his wizard level.\
    \ She can expend 1 point from his force pool as a standard action to create an\
    \ effect that acts as mage armor (lasting 1 hour), shield (lasting 1 minute),\
    \ or spiritual weapon (any simple or martial weapon, using her Intelligence modifier\
    \ to determine its attack bonus rather than Wisdom and lasting 1 round per wizard\
    \ level). These effects are visible; they take the appearance of armor, shields,\
    \ or weapons as appropriate, and they always have some visual detail reminiscent\
    \ of the wizard's bonded item (such as the pattern of a bonded ring appearing\
    \ as decoration on a mage armor or shield effect).\nAt 9th level, when the bonded\
    \ wizard uses bonded force for mage armor, the armor bonus increases by 1; when\
    \ she uses bonded force for shield, the shield bonus increases by 1; and she gains\
    \ a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls when using bonded force for\
    \ spiritual weapon. The increases for mage armor and shield and the enhancement\
    \ bonus for spiritual weapon improve by an additional 1 at 13th level and again\
    \ at 17th level. When she uses bonded force for spiritual weapon, the bonded wizard\
    \ can choose to reduce this enhancement bonus by 1 to double the spiritual weapon's\
    \ critical threat range as the keen weapon property, and for mage armor or shield,\
    \ she can choose to reduce the armor or shield bonus by 1 to protect herself from\
    \ critical hits and sneak attacks as the light fortification armor property.\n\
    Alternatively, the bonded wizard can expend a point from her force pool to create\
    \ a tool of force, which functions as a masterwork version of a simple tool of\
    \ her choice that could be reproduced by a traveler's any-tool. The tool has the\
    \ same AC and durability as a spiritual weapon and lasts for 10 minutes. The circumstance\
    \ bonus the tool of force grants to appropriate skill checks starts at +2 (as\
    \ masterwork tools) and increases to +3 at 9th level, and by an additional +1\
    \ every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of +5 at 17th level.\nA bonded wizard\
    \ can only have one instance of bonded force active at a time. If she uses this\
    \ ability again, any previously created force construct immediately ends."

  description: "At 10th level, a bonded wizard can repair her bonded item or turn\
    \ it into another object once per day as a full-round action. Transforming it\
    \ functions as polymorph any object, but does not alter the item's magical properties\
    \ (including its item slot), while repairing it functions as make whole. The wizard\
    \ may also sacrifice a prepared spell in order to repair an additional 1d6 points\
    \ of damage per level of the sacrificed spell."
