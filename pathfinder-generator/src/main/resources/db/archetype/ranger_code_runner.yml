  description: "A code runner learns to memorize and accurately recall information,\
    \ even if he does not speak or understand the language in which the information\
    \ was presented. The code runner can spend 1 hour and attempt a DC 15 Linguistics\
    \ check to memorize a single passage of up to 150 words of information in a language\
    \ he speaks.\nFor every 5 by which he exceeds the DC, he can memorize 150 additional\
    \ words. The DC is increased by 10 if the message is encoded or in a language\
    \ he doesn't understand. A code runner can memorize one such message at any given\
    \ time. If he fails to memorize a message, he can retry as many times as he wants,\
    \ as long as he spends 1 hour each time. Once a message has been memorized, he\
    \ can recall it with perfect accuracy until he memorizes a different message."
