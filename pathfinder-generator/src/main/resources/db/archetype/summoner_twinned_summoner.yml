  description: "At 6th level, as a standard action, a twinned summoner can swap locations\
    \ with his eidolon as if each were using dimension door, using the twinned summoner's\
    \ caster level. If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. If either\
    \ the twinned summoner or his eidolon occupies more squares than the other, each\
    \ must occupy one or more squares that were occupied by the other if possible,\
    \ or as close as possible if not. The twinned summoner can use this ability once\
    \ per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond\
    \ 6th. At 8th level, he can use this ability as a swift action."

  description: "At 16th level, a twinned summoner can touch his eidolon as a standard\
    \ action, enhancing its similarity to the summoner. The eidolon loses any natural\
    \ weapons or size increases gained from evolutions, and its Intelligence, Wisdom,\
    \ and Charisma scores change to match the base scores of the summoner. The eidolon\
    \ can cast any of the summoner's spells known using the summoner's caster level\
    \ and spell slots. It doesn't gain the benefit of any of the summoner's items,\
    \ feats, or other effects that affect spellcasting. The eidolon can keep this\
    \ form for a number of minutes per day equal to the summoner's class level. This\
    \ duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.\
    \ The summoner can end this effect as a free action."
