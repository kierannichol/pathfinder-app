  description: "Rather than develop mutagens that increase their natural armor and\
    \ physical abilities at the expense of their minds, crypt breakers focus on the\
    \ creation of special draughts that can enhance their senses. When a crypt breaker\
    \ drinks one of these draughts, he gains a +4 bonus on all Perception checks and\
    \ gains one of the following special senses: darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision,\
    \ or scent. While under the effects of a crypt breaker's draught, the alchemist\
    \ also gains light blindness."
