name: "Honor Guard"
description: "Certain cavaliers are trained not as advance combatants, but as loyal\
  \ guards, standing as firm defenders in the face of threats to their chosen charge.\
  \ These honor guards are sometimes merely ornamental, performing their functions\
  \ on a ceremonial basis, but a surprising number are capable, deadly opponents,\
  \ able to take down a threat long before their liege knows of the danger. To be\
  \ an honor guard is to constantly place one's self in harm's way, and to always\
  \ be willing to lay down one's life at a moment's notice."
