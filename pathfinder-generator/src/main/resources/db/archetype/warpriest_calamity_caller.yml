  description: "As a standard action, a calamity caller can cause a 5-foot square\
    \ within 30 feet to suffer a calamity. A calamity deals 1d6 damage plus an additional\
    \ 1d6 damage for every 2 warpriest levels he has beyond 1st to creatures within\
    \ that square. The type of calamity determines what type of damage the calamity\
    \ deals (see below). An affected creature can attempt a saving throw to reduce\
    \ this damage by half (DC = 10 + half the calamity caller's warpriest level +\
    \ the calamity caller's Wisdom modifier); the type of save is determined by the\
    \ calamity. The calamity caller can use this ability at will.\nAt 4th level, a\
    \ calamity caller can create an enhanced calamity when he uses this ability. An\
    \ enhanced calamity deals twice the calamity's normal damage; in addition, a creature\
    \ that fails its save suffers an additional effect (see below). At 8th level and\
    \ again at 12th level and 16th level, effects created by an enhanced calamity\
    \ that last for 1 or more rounds persist for 1 additional round. The calamity\
    \ caller can create an enhanced calamity once per day for every 2 warpriest levels\
    \ he has. A creature must take damage from the calamity to suffer these additional\
    \ effects.\nThe calamities available to calamity callers, the type of damage they\
    \ deal, the saving throw to resist the damage, and the secondary effect they cause\
    \ when enhanced, are listed below.\nAcid Rain: A brief rain shower deals acid\
    \ damage to the target square, with a Fortitude save for half damage. A creature\
    \ that fails its save against enhanced acid rain continues to dissolve for 1 round,\
    \ automatically taking half the original damage. Blizzard: Hail deals cold damage\
    \ to the target square, with a Fortitude save for half damage. A creature that\
    \ fails its save against an enhanced blizzard is blinded for 1 round. Deadfall:\
    \ A tree branch, stone boulder, or other heavy object falls on the target square.\
    \ A deadfall deals bludgeoning damage, with a Reflex save for half damage. A creature\
    \ that fails its save against an enhanced deadfall is knocked prone; at 12th level,\
    \ the target is also confused for 1 round. Flash Flood: A brief surge of stormy\
    \ water deals bludgeoning damage to the target square, with a Reflex save for\
    \ half damage. An enhanced flash flood does not cause additional effects; instead,\
    \ an enhanced flash flood targets creatures in a 5-foot radius. At 12th level,\
    \ the area increases to a 10-foot radius; at 16th level, the area increases to\
    \ a 15-foot radius. Lightning Strike: A bolt of lightning deals electricity damage\
    \ to the target square, with a Reflex save for half damage. A creature that fails\
    \ its save against an enhanced lightning strike is staggered for 1 round by electrical\
    \ impulses. Thorny Vines: Vines covered with thick thorns wrap around the target\
    \ square. The thorny vines deal piercing damage, with a Reflex save for half damage.\
    \ A creature that fails its save against enhanced thorny vines is entangled for\
    \ 1 round. Volcanic Rift: A magmatic rift emits a plume of fire into the air,\
    \ dealing fire damage to the target square, with a Fortitude save for half damage.\
    \ An enhanced volcanic rift also emits poisonous and corrosive gases; a creature\
    \ that fails its save against the enhanced volcanic rift is sickened for 1 round."
