description: "Mutants whose mutations make using standard weapons or other gear difficult\
  \ sometimes attach mechanical prostheses to their existing limbs. Many develop combat\
  \ skills that use their prostheses so they always have a weapon at hand. Over time,\
  \ these brawlers customize their mechanical limbs, adding additional weaponry and\
  \ other mechanisms."
