  description: "A knight of coins is a patron of wealth and seeks to even the playing\
    \ field for those who have unfair economic disadvantages. At 3rd level and every\
    \ 6 levels thereafter, the paladin can select a blessing (see Blessings below).\
    \ By expending a use of lay on hands, the knight of coins can instead grant a\
    \ boon to herself or a creature touched as a standard action. These boons do not\
    \ stack with themselves or with blessings from another knight of coins. A blessing\
    \ of prosperity lasts up to 1 hour, though the knight of coins who bestowed it\
    \ can end a blessing's benefits early (whether it affects her or another creature)\
    \ as a free action. Using this ability requires only one free hand and is a standard\
    \ action, unless the knight of coins targets herself, in which case it is a swift\
    \ action.\nIf she knows multiple blessings of prosperity, the knight of coins\
    \ can bestow multiple blessings on a single target as part of the action and the\
    \ expenditure of a use of lay on hands required to use this ability. If she bestows\
    \ multiple different blessings, these blessings are cumulative. For example, a\
    \ 9th-level knight of coins' blessing of prosperity ability might grant a +4 sacred\
    \ bonus on Appraise and Sense Motive checks as well as a +4 sacred bonus on Perception\
    \ checks and to CMD against disarm and steal combat maneuvers.\nA knight of coins\
    \ who takes the Extra Mercy feat can gain an extra blessing of prosperity instead\
    \ of an extra mercy.\nOnce a blessing of prosperity is chosen, it can't be changed.\n\
    A character who has benefited from a blessing of prosperity cannot benefit from\
    \ that same blessing again (whether bestowed by the same knight of coins or another\
    \ knight of coins) for 24 hours.\nBlessings: The following blessings are available\
    \ to a knight of coins.\nThe target adds an extra 10% to the gp value gained when\
    \ selling off treasure (normally 50% of the item's original value). This blessing\
    \ cannot result in selling treasure for more than 100% of its original value.\
    \ The target gains a +4 sacred bonus on Appraise and Sense Motive checks. The\
    \ target gains a +4 sacred bonus on Perception checks and to CMD against disarm\
    \ and steal combat maneuvers. The target gains a +4 sacred bonus on Craft, Perform,\
    \ and Profession checks. The target can use locate object as a spell-like ability\
    \ once, using the knight of coins' class level as the caster level. The target\
    \ can treat one settlement as having its base value and purchase limit increased\
    \ by 30%. The target must choose the affected settlement when the knight of coins\
    \ bestows this blessing. The target can treat one settlement as being one size\
    \ category larger for the purposes of determining available magic items. The target\
    \ must choose the affected settlement when the knight of coins bestows this blessing."
