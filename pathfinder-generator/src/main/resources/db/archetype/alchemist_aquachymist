  description: "An aquachymist's fire bombs deal steam damage, allowing them to deal\
    \ damage underwater or on land. Since thrown weapons don't work well underwater,\
    \ when the aquachymist creates a bomb, he either weights it or includes excess\
    \ air as part of the action of creating the bomb, granting the bomb his choice\
    \ of swiftly rising or swiftly sinking buoyancy and allowing him to target foes\
    \ directly above or below him. If the attack misses, the bomb doesn't deal splash\
    \ damage, but instead continues to travel up or down until it loses potency at\
    \ the end of the alchemist's turn; the exception is when the aquachymist throws\
    \ a swiftly sinking bomb close to the bottom, in which case it might reach the\
    \ bottom and explode there. Because of the strange aquadynamic features of the\
    \ aquachymist's underwater bombs, they have a range increment of only 5 feet above\
    \ the water."
