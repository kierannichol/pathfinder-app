description: "In lands overrun by giants, dragons, and other hulking beasts, entire\
  \ fellowships of barbarians hone tactics and traditions with one purpose--to bring\
  \ low these massive foes. While her enemies' size makes the creatures strong, the\
  \ titan mauler is even stronger, taking up weapons from her fallen foes that no\
  \ lesser warrior can lift, and using them when she beseeches the spirits to grant\
  \ her increased size and greater ferocity against her titanic foes."
