  description: "A golemfist begins play with a golem arm grafted in place of one of\
    \ his arms. The golem arm is a masterwork weapon that is treated as an unarmed\
    \ strike and deals damage as if he were a monk 2 levels lower than his class level\
    \ (minimum 1st level). The golem arm is made from basic parts and mundane materials\
    \ that grant no additional benefits. A golemfist can recreate his golem arm from\
    \ other materials by spending 1 day and paying an additional +50% of the normal\
    \ cost of the special material used in the creation of this new golem arm. For\
    \ the purposes of determining the weapon type and weight for special materials,\
    \ the golem arm is treated as a heavy mace. If a golemfist recreates his golem\
    \ arm, any previously used special materials are destroyed. The arm gains no benefits\
    \ from items that enhance unarmed strikes, such as an amulet of mighty fists.\n\
    At 1st level, a golemfist can use his arcane pool to enhance his unarmed strikes\
    \ as if they were manufactured weapons. At 5th level, he can use this ability\
    \ to add any of the following special abilities to his unarmed strikes: corrosive,\
    \ corrosive burst, defending, flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, impact,\
    \ shock, shocking burst, or thundering. At 11th level, he gains access to the\
    \ following special abilities: brilliant energy and speed."
