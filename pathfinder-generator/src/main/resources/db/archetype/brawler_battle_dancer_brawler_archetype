  description: "When a battle dancer uses her brawler's flurry, she must move 5 feet\
    \ before each melee attack or combat maneuver. If she is unable to move 5 feet,\
    \ she can't attempt any further attacks or combat maneuvers. She can't exceed\
    \ her maximum speed. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity if\
    \ the brawler would be able to take a 5-foot step normally; if she would be unable\
    \ to (for instance, if she were in difficult terrain), the movement provokes attacks\
    \ of opportunity as normal unless she succeeds at the appropriate Acrobatics checks.\n\
    While using this ability, she can still take her normal 5-foot step before or\
    \ after making her attacks."

  description: "At 4th level, when an opponent attempts a melee attack against a battle\
    \ dancer, the battle dancer can expend one use of an attack of opportunity as\
    \ an immediate action to move 5 feet, granting the battle dancer a dodge bonus\
    \ to AC equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 0) against the triggering attack.\
    \ The attack is still resolved normally, even if the battle dancer's movement\
    \ takes her out of the triggering attack's reach.\nThis movement is not a 5-foot\
    \ step and provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures other than the one that\
    \ triggered this ability, though the battle dancer can attempt an Acrobatics check\
    \ to avoid provoking the attacks. A battle dancer can use this ability a number\
    \ of times per day equal to half her level.\nShe can use this ability only while\
    \ wearing light armor or no armor, and while carrying no heavier than a light\
    \ load."

  description: "At 4th level, once per day when a battle dancer gains a flanking bonus\
    \ on an attack while using her rolling flurry ability, the ally providing the\
    \ flank gains a flanking bonus on its next attack against that opponent, even\
    \ if the battle dancer moves out of a flanking position. If either the opponent\
    \ or the ally moves more than 5 feet before the ally's attack, the flanking bonus\
    \ is lost. This ability works only if the ally is on the opposite side of an opponent\
    \ during the battle dancer's attack, not if a flanking bonus is gained in some\
    \ other way, such as through Gang Up. A battle dancer can use this ability one\
    \ additional time per day at 10th level and at 16th level."
