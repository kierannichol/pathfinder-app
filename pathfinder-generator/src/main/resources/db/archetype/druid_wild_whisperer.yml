description: "A wild whisperer is an expert at studying, predicting, and
  explaining animal behavior. She is less interested in plants, fey, and other
  aspects of the natural world, and uses her gifts to tame or relocate dangerous
  beasts and soothe the hurts of wounded and sickly creatures."

    name: "Inspiration"
    description: "At 2nd level, a wild whisperer gains an inspiration pool as the
      investigator class ability. A wild whisperer uses her druid level as her
      investigator level when determining the effects of this ability. Instead
      of free uses of inspiration on Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill
      checks, the wild whisperer can use inspiration on Handle Animal, Heal,
      Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature), Ride, Sense Motive, and
      Survival skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided
      she's trained in the relevant skill. She can also use inspiration on any
      wild empathy check without expending a use of inspiration. A wild
      whisperer's inspiration pool refreshes each day when she prepares spells."

    description: "At 6th level, a wild whisperer's powers of observation give her an
      advantage when she's fighting natural creatures. When using inspiration on
      an attack roll against an animal or a vermin or on a saving throw against
      an effect from an animal or a vermin, a wild whisperer has to expend only
      one use of inspiration instead of two."
