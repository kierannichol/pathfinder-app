  description: "At 2nd level, a wild whisperer gains an inspiration pool as the investigator\
    \ class ability. A wild whisperer uses her druid level as her investigator level\
    \ when determining the effects of this ability. Instead of free uses of inspiration\
    \ on Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill checks, the wild whisperer can\
    \ use inspiration on Handle Animal, Heal, Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature),\
    \ Ride, Sense Motive, and Survival skill checks without expending a use of inspiration,\
    \ provided she's trained in the relevant skill. She can also use inspiration on\
    \ any wild empathy check without expending a use of inspiration. A wild whisperer's\
    \ inspiration pool refreshes each day when she prepares spells."
