  description: "At 2nd level, the sage's understanding of the spells of bards, clerics,\
    \ and druids is so great that he can use his own magic in an inefficient, roundabout\
    \ way to duplicate those classes' spells. Once per day, a spell sage can spontaneously\
    \ cast any spell on the bard, cleric, or druid spell list as if it were a wizard\
    \ spell he knew and had prepared. Casting the spell requires the spell sage to\
    \ spend 1 full round per spell level of the desired spell (if the spell is on\
    \ multiple spell lists indicated above, using the lowest level from among those\
    \ lists) and requires expending two prepared spells of that spell level or higher;\
    \ if the spell's casting time is normally 1 full round or longer, this is added\
    \ to the spell sage's casting time. For example, if a spell sage wants to use\
    \ spell study to cast cure light wounds (cleric spell level 1st), he must spend\
    \ 2 full rounds casting and expend two prepared wizard spells of 1st level or\
    \ higher.\nAt 6th level and every 5 levels thereafter, a spell sage can use this\
    \ ability an additional time per day (to a maximum of four times per day at 16th\
    \ level)."
