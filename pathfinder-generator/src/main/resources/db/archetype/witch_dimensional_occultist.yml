description: "A dimensional occultist sacrifices some of her mastery over hexes in\
  \ return for increased planar lore-- she spends much of her time researching and\
  \ communing with otherplanar spirits, often through her familiar or via the study\
  \ of ancient texts, and has an increased mastery over various conjurations and other\
  \ extraplanar effects. She can even travel between dimensions as she gains power."

  description: "At 2nd level, a dimensional occultist can augment her spells by incorporating\
    \ complex mathematical equations and formulae into the casting, typically by inscribing\
    \ these equations with chalk or charcoal onto a solid surface (although scribing\
    \ them on paper or into wet sand works fine as well). Augmenting a spell in this\
    \ way adds both a somatic component (the actual scribing of the equations) and\
    \ a material component (the writing stylus and ink, chalk, charcoal, or other\
    \ medium) to the spell, and increases its casting time to a number of rounds equal\
    \ to the spell's level (if the spell's casting time is already 1 minute or more,\
    \ the casting time is not altered). As a result, using dimensional augmentation\
    \ to cast a spell isn't a good option in the heat of combat. Augmenting a spell\
    \ in this manner increases its effective caster level by +1. A dimensional occultist\
    \ can augment her spells in this manner once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional\
    \ time per day for every even-numbered witch level she gains."

  name: "Commune with Familiar"
  label: null
  type: null
  description: "At 8th level, a dimensional occultist can use her familiar as a link\
    \ between herself and strange, otherworldly intelligences on other planes. Once\
    \ per week, she may use this link to cast contact other plane as a spell-like\
    \ ability, at a caster level equal to her witch level. The entity contacted replies\
    \ to the witch via her familiar (which speaks in a strange disembodied voice),\
    \ via telepathic contact, or by some similarly disconcerting method of communication.\
    \ When a witch uses this method to contact other planes, she gains a +4 bonus\
    \ on the Intelligence check to avoid the decrease to Intelligence and Charisma.\
    \ If she still fails the save, the Intelligence/Charisma decrease lasts only 24\
    \ hours rather than a number of weeks."

  label: null
  type: null
  description: "At 12th level, a dimensional occultist can create a dimensional waypoint\
    \ by spending 2d4 minutes inscribing a number of equations on a solid surface\
    \ (such as a wall, tree, stone floor, or structure) with a writing instrument.\
    \ The exact configuration of these equations is unique to each witch. From that\
    \ point on, when she uses dimensional travel to travel to that location, she does\
    \ so without any chance of mishap. Teleport always sends the witch to this spot,\
    \ and even plane shift, if used to travel to that site, is precisely accurate.\
    \ Once a dimensional waypoint is set, it remains active for that witch despite\
    \ the condition of the inscription or even that of the surface upon which it was\
    \ inscribed--it is the act of inscribing the waypoint, not the waypoint itself,\
    \ that matters. At 12th level, and then again every two witch levels thereafter,\
    \ the dimensional occultist can maintain an additional waypoint. She can replace\
    \ a waypoint she's already set by simply using that waypoint's unique equation\
    \ at a new site."
