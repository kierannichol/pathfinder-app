  description: "At 5th level, a cyber-soldier gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and\
    \ damage rolls with implanted weapons, cybernetic arms, and melee or thrown weapons\
    \ wielded with a cybernetic arm. Weapons wielded with two cybernetic arms receive\
    \ double the bonus, except when such weapons are thrown. This damage bonus increases\
    \ by 1 for every 4 levels gained. This attack bonus does not stack with the attack\
    \ bonus for weapon training. A cyber-soldier gains a slam attack for each cybernetic\
    \ arm. These attacks deal 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for a Medium cyber-soldier\
    \ and 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage for a Small cyber-soldier. Note: The text\
    \ has been updated to reflect the 2nd printing errata. [Source]"
