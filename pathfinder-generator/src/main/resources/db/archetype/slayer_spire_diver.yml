  description: "A spire diver does not gain the ability to add her studied target\
    \ bonus on Bluff and Survival checks against an opponent she has studied.\nAt\
    \ 7th level, she cannot add her studied target bonus on Disguise checks. Instead,\
    \ when using any bow or crossbow against her studied target underwater, the spire\
    \ diver ignores the normal penalty for shooting underwater and instead treats\
    \ the weapon as though its range increment were 10 feet. At 5th, 10th, 15th, and\
    \ 20th levels, the range increment increases by 10 feet, to a maximum of 50 feet.\n\
    When using a bow or crossbow that already has an underwater range increment, such\
    \ as an underwater crossbow (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 39–40), the spire\
    \ diver adds the range increment gained from studied target as a bonus to the\
    \ weapon's usual underwater range increment, though the combined range increment\
    \ cannot exceed the weapon's normal range increment."
