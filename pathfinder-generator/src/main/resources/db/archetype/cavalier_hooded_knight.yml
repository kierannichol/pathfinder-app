  description: "When on a road, a hooded knight gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks\
    \ and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks. These bonuses\
    \ increase by 2 at 9th and 17th level. The speed of any mount a hooded knight\
    \ rides is increased by 10 feet at 9th level and by an additional 10 feet at 17th\
    \ level. By spending 1 minute coaxing his allies' mounts and expending one use\
    \ of his challenge ability, a hooded knight can grant the same speed increase\
    \ to the mounts ridden by all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him.\
    \ This speed increase to his allies' mounts lasts for 1 hour.\nA hooded knight\
    \ and his mount can hustle while traveling on a road without taking damage for\
    \ 2 hours each day, plus an additional 2 hours at 5th level and every 5 levels\
    \ thereafter (to a maximum of 8 hours at 15th level)."

    \ he brings along with this ability. If the destination is not a road, the hooded\
    \ knight is shunted to the nearest open space on a road, taking damage as described\
    \ in the dimension door spell. The cavalier can use this ability once per day,\
