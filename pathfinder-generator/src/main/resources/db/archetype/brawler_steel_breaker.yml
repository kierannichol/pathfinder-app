  description: "At 5th level, as a swift action a steel-breaker can observe a creature\
    \ or object to find its weak point by succeeding at a Wisdom check, adding her\
    \ brawler level against a DC of 10 + the object's hardness or the target's CR.\
    \ If it succeeds, the steel-breaker gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls until the\
    \ end of her turn, and any attacks she makes until the end of her turn ignore\
    \ the creature or object's DR or hardness.\nA steel-breaker can instead use this\
    \ ability as a swift action to analyze the movements and expressions of one creature\
    \ within 30 feet, granting a bonus on Sense Motive checks and Reflex saving throws,\
    \ as well as a dodge bonus to AC against that opponent equal to 1/2 her brawler\
    \ level until the start of her next turn."
