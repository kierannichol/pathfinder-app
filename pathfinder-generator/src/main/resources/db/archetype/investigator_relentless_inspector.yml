name: "Relentless Inspector"
description: "The ability of investigators to get to the bottom of a mystery is legendary,\
  \ and troubled settlements often send petitions requesting the aid of a formally\
  \ trained inspector when some mystery threatens the community as a whole. These\
  \ inspectors are tasked with assuming nothing and asking difficult and unpopular\
  \ questions as necessary to get to the truth behind a problem. Inspectors are well-prepared\
  \ to deal with mystical threats, but they are also mindful that what some claim\
  \ are supernatural problems may well be just the result of more mundane threats\
  \ such as bandits, wild beasts, or public hysteria."

    \ through observation that he can deduce the most effective way to deal with the\
    \ subject. Once per day, if a Relentless inspector finds a creature's tracks using\
    \ perceptive tracking, he gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense\
    \ Motive, and Survival checks against or about that creature, as well as on weapon\
    \ attack and damage rolls against that creature. These bonuses last until the\
    \ Relentless inspector selects a new subject for relentless pursuit."
