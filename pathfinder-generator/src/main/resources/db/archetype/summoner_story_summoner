  description: "At 2nd level, a story summoner can use a complete harrow deck he owns\
    \ as an additional focus component for his summon monster spell-like ability.\
    \ When he does so, the summoner draws a random card from the deck and applies\
    \ a simple template to the summoned monster based on the card's alignment: celestial\
    \ (any good), fiendish (any evil), resolute (any lawful), or entropic (any chaotic).\
    \ If a card has more than one alignment--such as a lawful evil or chaotic good\
    \ card--the summoner can choose which template to apply to the summoned creature.\
    \ This ability allows a story summoner to summon and command creatures normally\
    \ prohibited by their alignment."
