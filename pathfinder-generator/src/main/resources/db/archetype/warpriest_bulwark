  description: "Dedicated training and divine grace allow a bulwark to lessen the\
    \ burden of a shield's weight. As long as a bulwark is wielding a shield, she\
    \ reduces her total armor check penalty by 1. This reduction improves by 1 for\
    \ every 5 warpriest levels she has, to a maximum reduction of 5 at 20th level.\n\
    At 4th level, a bulwark can call upon the General of Vengeance's might to bless\
    \ her shield as a swift action. As long as she is wielding a shield, she gains\
    \ DR 1/-- and fire resistance 5. For every 4 levels beyond 4th, this DR increases\
    \ by 1 (to a maximum of DR 5/-- at 20th level) and her fire resistance increases\
    \ by 5 (becoming immunity to fire at 20th level). A bulwark can use this ability\
    \ a number of rounds per day equal to her warpriest level; these rounds need not\
    \ be consecutive.\nAs a swift action while her shield is benefiting from the General\
    \ of Vengeance's blessing (or as part of the action to activate the blessing),\
    \ a bulwark can direct her shield to protect an ally within 60 feet. The shield\
    \ sprouts burning wings and flies to defend the ally, providing its shield bonus,\
    \ damage reduction, and fire resistance to that ally instead of the bulwark. Rounds\
    \ in which she uses her shield in this manner count normally against the rounds\
    \ per day in which she can use this ability. As long as she has rounds of sacred\
    \ shield remaining, she can recall her shield to her arm as a swift action and\
    \ regain its benefits. A bulwark must maintain one hand free to direct the shield;\
    \ if she no longer has a hand free or if the duration of her sacred shield ability\
    \ ends, the shield drops to the ground and ceases providing any benefit."
