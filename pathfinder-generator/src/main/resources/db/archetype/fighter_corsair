description: "A corsair is a pirate who focuses on shipboard combat relying on his\
  \ strength of arms over his agility. He specializes in traditional pirate weapons,\
  \ but often wears heavier armor than is normally seen on a ship. A corsair moves\
  \ and fights easily in his armor, however, even in the water. Captains value corsairs\
  \ because of the skill they exhibit in defending the ship and in boarding actions."
