  description: "At 2nd level, an Oenopion researcher learns how to create an experimental\
    \ mutagen that benefits others, though not as well as his normal mutagen. The\
    \ experimental mutagen works just like a standard mutagen, except the natural\
    \ armor bonus and the alchemical bonus to the ability score are half normal (+1\
    \ natural armor bonus and +2 to one ability score). The experimental mutagen has\
    \ no risk of nauseating a creature who drinks it. The researcher decides when\
    \ he creates the mutagen if it is a standard mutagen (which gives no benefit if\
    \ another creature drinks it) or an experimental mutagen (which does); there is\
    \ no difference in the cost, time to create, or any other aspect of the mutagen.\
    \ If the researcher has discoveries or other abilities that alter or increase\
    \ the benefits of the mutagen, these apply to the experimental mutagen (though\
    \ the drinker only gets half the numerical bonus of the mutagen)."
