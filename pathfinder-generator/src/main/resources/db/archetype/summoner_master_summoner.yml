  description: "Starting at 1st level, a master summoner can cast summon monster I\

    \ one summon monster spell may be in effect while the eidolon is summoned. If\
    \ the summoner's eidolon is not summoned, the number of creatures that can be\
    \ summoned with this ability is only limited by its uses per day. This ability\

    \ than these restrictions, there is no limit to how many summon monster or gate\
    \ spells the summoner can have active at one time.\nThis ability replaces the\
    \ summoner's normal summon monster I ability and shield ally."
