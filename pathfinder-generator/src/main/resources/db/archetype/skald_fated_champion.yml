  description: "At 5th level, a fated champion learns a method of spell kenning that\
    \ is especially suited for divining and understanding the future, but not for\
    \ directly harming opponents. For the purpose of determining what level spell\
    \ slot he expends when using spell kenning, the skald treats the spell level of\
    \ spells that predict the future (such as augury and divination) as one spell\
    \ level lower (minimum spell level 1st), and treats the spell level of spells\
    \ that deal damage as one spell level higher."

    \ The decision to use this ability must be made before the results of the initial\
    \ roll are revealed, and the champion or his opponent must take the result of\
