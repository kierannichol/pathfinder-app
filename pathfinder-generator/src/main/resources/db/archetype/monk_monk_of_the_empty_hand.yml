    \ of the empty hand treats normal weapons as improvised weapons with the following\
    \ equivalencies (substituting all of their statistics for the listed weapon):\
    \ a light weapon functions as a light hammer, a one-handed weapon functions as\
    \ a club, and a Two-handed weapon functions as a quarterstaff."

  description: "At 5th level, a monk of the empty hand may spend 1 point from his\
    \ ki pool as a swift action to deal damage equal to his unarmed strike damage\
    \ with an improvised weapon for 1 round. At 11th level, the monk may spend ki\
    \ to grant an enhancement bonus or magical weapon abilities to an improvised weapon\
    \ for 1 round, at the rate of 1 point of ki per +1 bonus or its equivalent. The\
    \ monk may not spend more than 3 points of ki at one time for this purpose. For\
    \ example, a monk can spend 2 points of ki to give his improvised weapon a +1\
    \ enhancement bonus and the ki focus quality, or just the flaming burst quality.\
    \ At 15th level, the limit increases to 5 ki per round. The monk may use this\
    \ ability to add magical weapon qualities to improvised weapons that could not\
    \ normally have such a quality, such as adding the disruption quality to a slashing\
    \ weapon, or the vorpal quality to a bludgeoning weapon."
