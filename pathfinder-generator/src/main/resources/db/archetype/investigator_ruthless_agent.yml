description: "Ruthless agents are often called upon for their skills at extracting\
  \ information by any means necessary. Though some view their methods as extreme,\
  \ ruthless agents prize getting the job done at all costs. Ruthless agents can be\
  \ found in the employ of nearly any organization--even goodly groups whose leaders\
  \ either don't know the extent of ruthless agents' zeal or are willing to look the\
  \ other way to take advantage of these investigators‘ incredible efficiency."

  description: "A ruthless agent focuses on reading motivations and using interrogation\
    \ tactics. She can use inspiration on Intimidate, Knowledge, and Sense Motive\
    \ checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided she's trained in the\
    \ skill. A ruthless agent can't spend inspiration on attack rolls or saving throws."

  label: null
  type: null
  description: "A ruthless agent adds half her investigator level (minimum +1) as\
    \ a bonus on Intimidate checks. When the ruthless agent uses Intimidate to influence\
    \ an opponent's attitude, the duration of the attitude shift is 1d6x10 minutes\
    \ per investigator level (rather than the normal 1d6x10 minutes).\nAdditionally,\
    \ the ruthless agent is an expert in blending coercion and fear. The first time\
    \ the ruthless agent attempts to use Intimidate to influence an opponent's attitude\
    \ and fails, she can retry it against that same opponent with no increase to the\
    \ DC. Subsequent attempts to influence the same opponent are subject to increased\
    \ DCs as normal."

  description: "At 3rd level as a full-round action, a ruthless agent can ask a target\
    \ one question for every 2 investigator levels she has. The target is not compelled\
    \ to answer truthfully, but the ruthless agent's implicit or explicit threats\
    \ and looming manner leads the target to believe the ruthless agent will cause\
    \ it serious harm if it lies. This imposes a –2 penalty on the target's Bluff\
    \ checks to lie when answering the specific questions the ruthless agent asked.\
    \ At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the penalty increases by 2 (to a\
    \ maximum of –12 at 18th level). She can use this ability a number of times per\
    \ day equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. This is a mind-affecting fear effect."

  description: "At 4th level, a ruthless agent has learned how to finesse her attacks\
    \ to discomfort a foe. When she deals damage using her studied strike, she can\
    \ make this damage nonlethal (regardless of whether her weapon normally deals\
    \ lethal or nonlethal damage), forcing the target to succeed at a Fortitude saving\
    \ throw (DC = 10 + half the ruthless agent's level + her Intelligence modifier)\
    \ or be sickened for 1 round and take a –2 penalty on Will saving throws for 1\
    \ minute. Multiple agonizing strikes do not worsen the condition or impose an\
    \ additional penalty on Will saves, but they do increase the duration of both\
    \ effects."

  label: null
  type: null
  description: "At 11th level, a ruthless agent can issue a binding command to a creature\
    \ as a full-round action once per day. This command acts like geas/quest with\
    \ the creature as the target, using the ruthless agent's investigator level as\
    \ the caster level. The ruthless agent can compel obedience from only one creature\
    \ at a time (as soon as the geas/quest is fulfilled, however, the ruthless agent\
    \ can use this ability again, as long as she has a use of this ability available).\n\
    At 17th level, the ruthless agent can compel obedience from two creatures at once,\
    \ and she is always aware of the targets as if they were under the effects of\
    \ a status spell (caster level = the ruthless agent's investigator level)."
