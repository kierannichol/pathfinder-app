  description: "A spirit binder must select a familiar for his arcane bond. Unlike\
    \ in a normal familiar-summoning ritual, a spirit binder created his special familiar\
    \ through a dangerous ritual catalyzed by the death of a loved one. Before the\
    \ loved one's spirit fully passed on, the spirit binder was able to bind the spirit\
    \ to an animal or vermin, which then became his familiar.\nA soulbound familiar's\
    \ personality is that of the lost loved one, rather than a servant of the spirit\
    \ binder. It can have any alignment, even one that is diametrically opposed to\
    \ the spirit binder's. A soulbound familiar has the base attack bonus and base\
    \ saving throws of the loved one's favored class (using the spirit binder's level\
    \ as its level). If the loved one died before the beginning of the campaign, the\
    \ spirit binder selects the familiar's favored class at 1st level and it cannot\
    \ be changed."
