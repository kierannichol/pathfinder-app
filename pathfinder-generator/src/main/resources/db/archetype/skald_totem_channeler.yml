  description: "When a totem channeler learns a new rage power, he can select from\
    \ more than one group of totem rage powers, even though he normally could not\
    \ do so. Totem rage powers grant benefits related to a theme, are organized in\
    \ groups of three, and usually have the word â€œtotem\"in their name. When the totem\
    \ channeler starts an inspired rage raging song, he can add totem rage powers\
    \ from only one group at a time.\nHe can change the group of added totem rage\
    \ powers by ending the current inspired rage and starting a new one."

  description: "At 5th level, when a totem channeler starts an inspired rage raging\
    \ song and adds a totem rage power, he can add totem rage powers from a different\
    \ group. Adding or maintaining totem rage powers from the additional group requires\
    \ spending 1 additional round of raging song each round. He can activate up to\
    \ two additional totem groups at 11th level and up to three additional totem groups\
    \ at 17th level. He must spend 1 additional round of raging song each round for\
    \ each additional totem group.\nIf the totem channeler does not have enough rounds\
    \ of raging song remaining to maintain his inspired rage, the song ends."

    \ from his totem powers when he wades into battle with song on his lips. When\
    \ he adds a totem rage power to his inspired rage, he and his allies gain a +1\
    \ insight bonus to AC and on saving throws for the duration of the totem channeler's\
    \ raging song. At 14th level, this bonus increases to +2. This bonus applies only\
    \ to the first totem rage power he applies to his inspired rage."
