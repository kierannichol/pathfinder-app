description: "While all shamans use their connection to the spirits of the world to\
  \ draw upon otherworldly magic powers, some shamans have a tradition in which they\
  \ use the power of patron spirits to directly control their enemies. Such overseers\
  \ may assume roles as religious leaders and protectors of their tribes, turning\
  \ foes into short-term allies for the tribe's greater good. Other overseers become\
  \ tyrants who enforce their will upon the weak for personal gain. In combat, an\
  \ overseer manages the battlefield by debilitating foes using her hexes and specialized\
  \ spells."

  description: "At 3rd level, an overseer gains the ability to cast any of her mind-affecting\
    \ spells that target a single creature through her spirit animal. When she's using\
    \ this ability, the selected spell's range becomes touch, and she must deliver\
    \ the spell through the spirit animal via the spirit animal's deliver touch spells\
    \ supernatural ability. The shaman's effective caster level for these spells is\
    \ 2 higher than her normal caster level. The overseer can deliver any other spells\
    \ via the deliver touch spells spirit animal ability."
