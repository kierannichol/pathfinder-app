  description: "A portal seeker can try to locate an unseen magical portal within\
    \ 60 feet by concentrating and attempting a DC 20 Knowledge (planes) check. If\
    \ successful, the portal seeker becomes aware of the presence of all extradimensional\
    \ portals (including those created by spells like rope trick or by magic items\
    \ like bags of holding) in a 60?foot radius. If she concentrates for 3 rounds,\
    \ she can pinpoint the locations of all portals in the area of effect. Some portals,\
    \ at the GM's discretion, may be magically hidden and have a higher DC to detect."

    \ Points equal to her investigator level. She can spend 1 Portal Point as a swift\
    \ action during a move or withdraw action to open and step through a momentary\
    \ portal to a location within 20 feet that she can see. Stepping through the portal\
    \ takes 5 feet of movement, and while the rest of her movement provokes attacks\
    \ of opportunity as normal, the extra movement from the portal is a teleportation\
    \ effect that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.\nThe distance she can travel\

    \ until the end of her next turn, and creatures of any size can step move through\
    \ either, using 5 feet of movement to exit from the other portal. At the end of\
    \ her next turn, she can spend an additional 2 Portal Points as a free action\
