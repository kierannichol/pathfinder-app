  description: "Once per day as swift action, a holy tactician can call on the powers\
    \ of good to aid her against evil. Against evil targets, the holy tactician gains\
    \ her Charisma bonus (if any) on her attack rolls against evil creatures, and\
    \ if she hits, she adds 1/2 her paladin level on her weapon damage rolls as well.\
    \ These bonuses last for 1 round for every two paladin levels the holy tactician\
    \ has attained (minimum 1 round). In addition, for 1 round after the holy tactician\
    \ successfully strikes an evil creature, all non-evil allies within 30 feet of\
    \ her gain a competence bonus on attack rolls equal to 1/2 her Charisma bonus\
    \ against that creature as well as a +1 competence bonus on damage rolls. The\
    \ bonus on damage rolls increases by +1 for every five levels the holy tactician\
    \ attains (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). She can grant this bonus against\
    \ more than one creature at a time. To gain this benefit, the holy tactician's\
    \ allies must be able to see or hear her, and she must be conscious.\nAt 4th level,\
    \ and every three levels thereafter, the holy tactician may use weal's champion\
    \ one additional time per day (to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level)."
