description: "Not all rogues work against the law. Investigators use their skills\
  \ to serve the law, often in the employ of nobles or in the pursuit of noble causes.\
  \ In some cities cabals of investigators work for rulers or bureaucracies, but often\
  \ an investigator is a free agent who pursues whatever mysteries come across her\
  \ path. of course, not all investigators serve the law. Crime lords and guildmasters\
  \ often have squads of investigators serving their own nefarious purposes."

  description: "An investigator can roll twice on any Diplomacy check made to gather\
    \ information, and receives the information for both results. This takes the same\
    \ amount of time as one check. If the lesser of the two checks reveals false information,\
    \ the rogue is aware of it.\nFalse information is not revealed in this way if\
    \ the people she questioned do not know it to be false.\nThis ability replaces\
    \ trapfinding.\nRogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement the investigator\
    \ archetype: coax information, fast picks, follow clues, hard to fool, and minor\
    \ magic*."
