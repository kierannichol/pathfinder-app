  description: "At 12th level, a monk of the lotus makes a foe into a friend with\
    \ a single show of mercy. As an immediate action, when one of his melee attacks\
    \ would reduce a creature to 0 or fewer hit points, the monk can spend 6 ki points\
    \ to make the target of that attack surrender. When the target surrenders, it\
    \ is reduced to 0 hit points, becomes disabled, and is charmed, as if the monk\
    \ had cast charm monster with a caster level equal to the monk's level. The target\
    \ does not get a saving throw against this effect. This charm lasts until its\
    \ duration expires, until the monk dismisses it or uses it on another creature,\
    \ or until the target is again reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, whichever happens\
    \ first. The monk can only have one creature charmed with touch of surrender at\
    \ a time. This is a mind-affecting charm effect.\nThis ability replaces abundant\
    \ step."

  description: "At 15th level, a monk of the lotus can set up vibrations within the\
    \ body of another creature to win over the creature's mind. The monk can use touch\
    \ of peace once per day, and must announce his intent before making his attack\
    \ roll. On a successful hit, the attack deals no damage, but the target is charmed\
    \ as if the monk had cast charm monster with a caster level equal to the monk's\
    \ level. The target does not get a saving throw against this effect. The creature\
    \ is charmed for 1 day per level. If the monk or his allies attack the charmed\
    \ creature, or if the monk asks or commands the charmed creature to take hostile\
    \ actions, the effect ends. This is a mind-affecting charm effect.\nThis ability\
    \ replaces quivering palm."
