  description: "At 5th level, a champion of the cascade's connection to her deity\
    \ allows her to summon rivers and alter her surroundings. As a standard action,\
    \ she can change up to two 5-foot squares per paladin level within 100 feet to\
    \ become freshwater pools with a depth of up to 5 feet per paladin level. The\
    \ squares must be adjacent to each other.\nEach creature standing in the area\
    \ where she first creates the water must attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half\
    \ the paladin's level + the paladin's Charisma modifier) to jump to the nearest\
    \ unaffected space and avoid falling into the water. The champion of the cascade\
    \ can use this ability for 1 minute per paladin level. These minutes do not need\
    \ to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.\nThe changed\
    \ squares revert back to their original form after the duration ends, and any\
    \ creatures in the water are shunted out to the nearest open space.\nAt 10th level,\
    \ as a swift action, she may spend 1 minute of her rising tide's duration to create\
    \ a geyser in any body of water she has created, lifting an allied creature in\
    \ that square up to 10 feet per paladin level into the air for 1 round."
