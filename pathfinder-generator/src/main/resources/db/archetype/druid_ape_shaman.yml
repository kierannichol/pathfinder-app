  description: "At 2nd level, an ape shaman may adopt an aspect of the ape while retaining\
    \ her normal form. She gains one of the following bonuses:\nmovement (climb speed\
    \ 20 ft., +4 racial bonus on Climb checks) senses (low-light vision, scent) natural\
    \ weapons (2 slams [1d6 for a Medium shaman], +2 on combat maneuver checks to\
    \ grapple) toughness (+2 natural armor bonus to AC, Endurance feat)\nWhile using\
    \ totem transformation, the ape shaman may speak normally and can cast speak with\
    \ animals (primates only) at will. Using this ability is a standard action at\
    \ 2nd level, a move action at 7th level, and a swift action at 12th level. The\
    \ ape shaman can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her\
    \ druid level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be used\
    \ in 1-minute increments. This is a polymorph effect and cannot be used while\
    \ the druid is using another polymorph effect, such as wild shape."
