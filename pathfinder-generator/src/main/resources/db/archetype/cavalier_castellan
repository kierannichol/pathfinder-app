  description: "At 1st level, a castellan gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class and an additional\
    \ +1 bonus on attack rolls when he is on higher ground. He also gains an additional\
    \ +1 bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves when he has cover other than soft\
    \ cover from other creatures. At 6th level, a castellan gains evasion (as a rogue)\
    \ when he has cover (but not soft cover) against the source of the attack.\nAt\
    \ 11th level, these bonuses increase by 1. At 16th level, he gains improved evasion\
    \ instead of evasion. Both the evasion and improved evasion abilities work even\
    \ when the castellan wears medium or heavy armor."
