    description: "At 5th level, a dragon shaman may cast summon nature's ally as a
      standard action when summoning lizards, and summoned lizards gain
      temporary hit points equal to her druid level. She can apply the young
      template to any lizard to reduce the level of the summoning spell required
      by one. She can also increase the level of summoning required by one in
      order to apply either the advanced or the giant template, or increase it
      by two to apply both the advanced and giant templates."
