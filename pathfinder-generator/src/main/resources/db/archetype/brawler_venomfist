  description: "A venomfist's unarmed strikes deal damage as a creature one size category\
    \ smaller (1d4 at first level for Medium venomfists). If she hits with her first\
    \ unarmed strike in a round, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw\
    \ (DC = 10 + half the venomfist's brawler level + her Constitution modifier) or\
    \ take an additional amount of damage equal to the venomfist's Constitution modifier.\
    \ The venomfist is immune to this toxin.\nAt 4th level, a target that fails this\
    \ save must succeed at a second saving throw 1 round later or take the same amount\
    \ of damage again. This effect repeats as long as the target continues to fail\
    \ its saving throws, to a maximum number of rounds equal to 1 plus 1 additional\
    \ round for every 4 brawler levels the venomfist has. Unlike other poisons, multiple\
    \ doses of a venomfist's poison never stack; the more recent poison effect replaces\
    \ the older one.\nAt 5th level, after the venomfist gets 8 hours of rest, she\
    \ can choose a secondary effect for her venom to impose. She can choose fatigued,\
    \ shaken, or sickened. A creature that fails its saving throw against her venom\
    \ also gains the chosen condition until it succeeds at a save against the venom\
    \ or until the venom's duration ends. Once a creature succeeds at its save against\
    \ the poison, it becomes immune to the secondary condition for 24 hours, but the\
    \ attack still deals the extra damage.\nAt 10th level, when the venomfist chooses\
    \ the condition her venom imposes, she can also cause her venom to deal ability\
    \ score damage each round instead of hit point damage. She chooses Strength, Dexterity,\
    \ or Constitution, and her venom deals 1d3 points of ability score damage each\
    \ round. In addition, she adds blinded, exhausted, and staggered to the list of\
    \ secondary effects she can choose for her venom.\nAt 16th level, the venomfist's\
    \ venom is particularly potent. If it fails the initial save, the target must\
    \ succeed at two consecutive saves before being cured of the venom, though if\
    \ the first save is successful, the secondary effect ends and the creature is\
    \ immune to the secondary effects of the venomfist's poison for 24 hours. In addition,\
    \ the venomfist adds dazed and stunned to the list of secondary effects she can\
    \ choose for her venom.\nThis is a poison effect. The venomfist can't suppress\
    \ it, but she affects only those she damages with her unarmed strikes (not those\
    \ she merely touches)."
