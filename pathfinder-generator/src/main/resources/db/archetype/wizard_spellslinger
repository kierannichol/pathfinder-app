  description: "The spellslinger gains the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms) feat,\
    \ and one or two of his firearms can be arcane guns. Arcane guns are normal one-handed\
    \ or two-handed firearms in the hands of others, as they were normal firearms\
    \ before the spellslinger imbued them with magic. In a spellslinger's hands, they\
    \ both fire projectiles (bullets and pellets) and cast magic. At 1st level, the\
    \ spellslinger decides whether he wants to have one or two arcane guns at a time.\
    \ If the spellslinger chooses to have only one arcane gun at a time, spells fired\
    \ through the arcane gun that require an attack roll have a ×3 critical hit multiplier.\n\
    A spellslinger can cast any ranged touch attack, cone, line, or ray spells through\
    \ his arcane gun. When he casts through the arcane gun, the gun's enhancement\
    \ bonus (if any) is a bonus to the spell's attack rolls or to the spell's saving\
    \ throw DCs. Yet there are dangers inherent to this method. If any of the spells'\
    \ attack rolls result in a natural 1 (a misfire), or a natural 20 is rolled on\
    \ any saving throw made against the spell by a target (an overload), the arcane\
    \ gun gains the broken condition. If the arcane gun already has the broken condition,\
    \ the gun explodes. When a gun explodes, it lets loose a blast of force, or if\
    \ the spell has the acid, cold, electricity, or sonic descriptor, it deals that\
    \ type of energy damage instead. In the case of spells with multiple descriptors,\
    \ roll randomly among the descriptors to determine the type of damage dealt by\
    \ the blast. The blast is centered on a single intersection within the spellslinger's\
    \ space (spellslinger's choice) and deals 1d6 points of the appropriate energy\
    \ damage or force damage per level of the spell cast. Any creature within the\
    \ blast other than the spellslinger can make a Reflex saving throw to halve the\
    \ damage. The Reflex save DC is calculated using the spell level of the spell\
    \ being sacrificed.\nA spellslinger can attune his arcane guns at the start of\
    \ each day. That attunement lasts until the spellslinger attunes to a new gun,\
    \ even if a formally attuned gun is destroyed."

    \ barrel of his firearm. With that weapon bonus the spellslinger can apply any\
    \ of the following to his arcane bond: enhancement bonuses (up to +5) and dancing,\
    \ defending, distance, flaming, flaming burst, frost, ghost touch, icy burst,\
    \ merciful, seeking, shock, shocking burst, spell storing, thundering, vicious,\
    \ and wounding. An arcane gun gains no benefit from having two of the same weapon\
    \ special abilities on the same barrel. The effect of the mage bullets ability\
    \ lasts for a number of minutes equal to the level of the spell sacrificed, or\
    \ until this ability is used again to assign the barrel different enhancements."
