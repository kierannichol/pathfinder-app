  description: "At 5th level, a trap breaker can attempt to disarm a mechanical trap\
    \ by detonating it rather than disarming it with a Disable Device check. As a\
    \ full-round action, a trap breaker may expend one of his bombs to make a ranged\
    \ touch attack against a trap, using the trap's Disable Device DC as its AC. If\
    \ the attack misses, the bomb's splash damage activates the trap. If the attack\
    \ hits, the bomb deactivates the trap without setting it off. The trap breaker\
    \ must both know the location of the trap and be able to reach the trap's trigger\
    \ with a ranged touch attack in order to use this ability. At 8th level, a trap\
    \ breaker can disarm magic traps with this ability."

  description: "At 6th level, a trap breaker can turn his bombs into land mines. Setting\
    \ a land mine is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The\
    \ land mine fills a single 5-foot square, and can't be placed in the same space\
    \ as another trap, land mine, or magic trap. The trap breaker can arm the land\
    \ mine with any bomb he is eligible to use, and the effects of this bomb are immediately\
    \ transferred to the land mine. Creating a land mine uses up two of the alchemist's\
    \ bombs per day. The DCs for Perception checks to notice the land mine, Disable\
    \ Device checks to disable it, and saving throws to avoid its effects are equal\
    \ to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + his Intelligence modifier. All alchemist\
    \ land mines are mechanical traps with the qualities Trigger: location and Reset:\
    \ none. Land mines last for 1 day per alchemist level or until they are triggered,\
    \ whichever comes first."
