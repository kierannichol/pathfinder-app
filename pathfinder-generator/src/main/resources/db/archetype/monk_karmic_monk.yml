    \ that affects the karmic monk, the karmic monk receives a +2 bonus on attack\

    \ target, this bonus lasts until the end of the karmic monk's turn (or until the\
    \ beginning of the karmic monk's next turn, if it isn't his turn). Otherwise,\
    \ the bonus against a particular creature lasts for 1 minute after the creature's\

  description: "At 16th level, a karmic monk can spend 1 point from his ki pool as\
    \ a swift action to add 1d6 points of damage to his unarmed strikes against creatures\
    \ of either chaotic, evil, good, or lawful alignment for 1 round. This stacks\
    \ with other abilities that deal damage based on alignment. He cannot alter his\
    \ alignment choice until the next time he uses this ability.\nCreatures that are\
    \ of the appropriate alignment and are struck by this attack must succeed at a\
    \ Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the karmic monk's class level + the karmic monk's Wisdom\
    \ modifier) or lose any damage reduction based on alignment for a number of rounds\
    \ equal to the karmic monk's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 round). A creature that\
    \ succeeds at this save is immune to having its damage reduction disrupted by\
    \ that karmic monk for 24 hours. This attack disrupts only alignment components\
    \ of damage reduction, not any other components; for example, DR/cold iron and\
    \ good becomes DR/cold iron."
