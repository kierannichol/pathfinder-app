  description: "At 1st level, affected allies gain a +2 morale bonus to Intelligence\
    \ and Charisma and a +1 morale bonus on Will saving throws, but they also take\
    \ a â€“1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of insightful contemplation, allies\
    \ other than the court poet can't use any Strength-based skills or make any physical\
    \ effort that requires a Constitution check. At 4th level and every 4 skald levels\
    \ thereafter, the song's bonus on Will saves increases by 1; the penalty to AC\
    \ doesn't change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song's bonuses to Intelligence and\
    \ Charisma increase by 2. (Unlike the barbarian's rage ability, those affected\
    \ are not fatigued after the song ends.)"
