description: "Cartographers are eager trailblazers who explore uncharted terrain,\
  \ study landmarks, and find new paths through the wilderness. They record this information\
  \ meticulously so that those who follow in their footsteps can travel swiftly and\
  \ safely within the studied area. Rather than studying poisons like many investigators\
  \ do, cartographers use their alchemical expertise to create better inks that allow\
  \ them to draw maps with an incredible level of detail."

  description: "At 2nd level, a cartographer can expend one use of inspiration to\
    \ sketch a map and take notes of his surroundings. Drawing the map takes 10 minutes.\
    \ While he is within the studied area, the cartographer can use inspiration on\
    \ Acrobatics, Climb, Fly, Ride, Stealth, Survival, and Swim checks without expending\
    \ a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill. If he already has\
    \ the ability to use inspiration on any of these skills without expending a use\
    \ of inspiration, he gains an additional +1 bonus on checks with that skill while\
    \ in the studied area.\nA cartographer can draw three types of maps. He cannot\
    \ combine different map types in the same map, and areas within range that would\
    \ belong in the other categories are excluded.\nDungeon Map: While indoors, underground,\
    \ or in any other type of environment where visibility is limited by walls, the\
    \ radius is 100 feet per level and only areas that the cartographer has explored\
    \ within the past 24 hours count as studied terrain. Areas explored after drawing\
    \ the map do not retroactively become part of the studied terrain.\nOverland Map:\
    \ In natural terrain, the radius of the mapped area is equal to 1 mile per investigator\
    \ level. If he is unable to see the whole area, he extrapolates and uses his knowledge\
    \ of geography to fill in the blanks.\nTown Map: While in an urban area or ruins,\
    \ the radius is 1,000 feet per level or the entirety of the urban or ruined area,\
    \ whichever is smaller.\nMuch like alchemy, cartography requires materials, but\
    \ the cost of those materials is negligible. However, knowing an area so well\
    \ as to gain these benefits requires more than just paper and ink--a great deal\
    \ of memorization and a bit of inspiration are also required. For this reason,\
    \ a cartographer can maintain these benefits in only one area at a time. The benefits\
    \ remain in effect until the cartographer studies a new area or refreshes his\
    \ inspiration pool."

    \ purpose of determining overland speed, the cartographer treats any trackless\
    \ terrain as though he were on a trail, and he treats any terrain with a road\
    \ or trail as though it were a highway. He can extend the benefit to up to one\
    \ creature per investigator level traveling with him."
