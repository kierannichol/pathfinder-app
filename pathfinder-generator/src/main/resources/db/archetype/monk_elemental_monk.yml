  description: "At 2nd level, as a swift action an elemental monk can gain the benefits\
    \ of one of the following style feats, based on one of the five types of genies.\
    \ When she does so, she automatically enters that feat's stance: Djinni Style,\
    \ Efreeti Style, Janni Style, Marid Style, or Shaitan Style.\nAt 6th level, while\
    \ the elemental monk is using a genie style feat, she also gains the benefits\
    \ of a feat from the following list, as appropriate for that style's feat path:\
    \ Djinni Spirit, Efreeti Stance, Janni Tempest, Marid Spirit, and Shaitan Skin.\n\
    At 10th level, while the elemental monk is using a genie style feat, she also\
    \ gains the benefits of a feat from the following list, as appropriate for that\
    \ style's feat path: Djinni Spin, Efreeti Touch, Janni Rush, Marid Coldsnap, and\
    \ Shaitan Earthblast.\nAt 18th level, when the elemental monk gains the benefits\
    \ of Djinni Spirit, Efreeti Stance, Marid Spirit, or Shaitan Skin, her elemental\
    \ resistance from that feat instead becomes immunity to that element, as long\
    \ as she is not denied her Dexterity bonus to AC. While she is using Janni Style,\
    \ she gains the effects of enlarge person or reduce person (her choice), even\
    \ if she is not humanoid. This is a spell-like ability with a caster level equal\
    \ to the elemental monk's level."
