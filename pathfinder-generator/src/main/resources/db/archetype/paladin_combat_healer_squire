  description: "At 2nd level, a combat healer squire can hastily dress a deadly wound\
    \ for her knight, temporary alleviating his suffering. This ability acts in all\
    \ ways like using the Heal skill to treat deadly wounds, except the combat healer\
    \ squire only needs to take a full-round action to use this ability. The hit points\
    \ healed are temporary, and only last 10 minutes, but they are not lost first\
    \ like temporary hit points. A combat healer squire can only use this ability\
    \ on her knight, not other creatures. A knight cannot benefit from this ability\
    \ more than once per day, and cannot be treated for deadly wounds with the Heal\
    \ skill within 24 hours of being subjected to this ability."
