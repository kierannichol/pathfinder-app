  description: "A death druid attracts phantoms like a spiritualist, though she focuses\
    \ her efforts on putting those phantoms to rest. A death druid is continually\
    \ attempting to figure out how to send her phantom to the afterlife (usually by\
    \ completing the phantom's unfinished business as determined by the GM). If she\
    \ is able to do so, she gains a new phantom with no additional effort on her part,\
    \ sometime during the next week. At 1st (level, she gains the spiritualist's phantom\
    \ and etheric tether class features; at 4th level, she gains the bonded manifestation\
    \ class feature; and at 14th level, she gains the spiritual bond class feature.\
    \ She does not gain any of the other spiritualist abilities related to phantoms.\
    \ The death druid treats her druid level as her spiritualist level for these abilities."
