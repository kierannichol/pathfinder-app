  description: "A dragon yapper can use performance to annoy those that hear it, causing\
    \ them to take a –1 penalty on attack and damage rolls (minimum 1) and a –1 penalty\
    \ on saves against fear effects and charm effects as long as the dragon yapper\
    \ continues performing.\nThis penalty increases by 1 at 5th level and every 6\
    \ levels thereafter. Yapping song is a mind-affecting ability that uses audible\
    \ components, but is not language-dependent."
