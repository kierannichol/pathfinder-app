  description: "At 3rd level, whenever a demon dancer inspires rage, all who accept\
    \ his rage gain a bite attack dealing 1d6 points of damage (for Medium allies;\
    \ 1d4 points of damage if Small). This damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small)\
    \ at 7th level, to 2d6 (1d8 if Small) at 12th level, and to 3d6 (2d6 if Small)\
    \ at 17th level.\nThese increases effectively treat the affected creatures as\
    \ though their sizes had increased by one size category, and so don't stack with\
    \ any similar damage increases (such as the increase from the strong jaw spell)\
    \ other than those due to an actual increase in size. If used as part of a full\
    \ attack action, the bite attack is made at the creature's full base attack bonus\
    \ â€“5."
