description: "An unsworn shaman never binds herself to one specific spirit, always\
  \ making new deals as she deems necessary for the circumstances that she finds herself\
  \ in. While this weakens the powers she can access from any one spirit, it gives\
  \ her access to a broader overall range of abilities."

  description: "At 1st level, the unsworn shaman also forms a temporary bond with\
    \ a minor spirit each day, granting her access to a shaman or witch hex of her\
    \ choosing, but not a major hex or a grand hex. She must make this selection each\
    \ day when she prepares her spells for the day. Until she changes the minor spirit,\
    \ she continues to have access to the shaman or witch hex. At 2nd level, she can\
    \ instead select a hex from one of her wandering spirits selected for that day.\
    \ If she selects a shaman or witch hex, she treats her shaman level as her witch\
    \ level, and uses her Wisdom in place of her Intelligence for the purpose of that\
    \ hex.\nShe can make temporary bonds with two minor spirits (thus gaining two\
    \ hexes) at 4th level, and with one additional minor spirit (and hex) every 4\
    \ levels thereafter."
