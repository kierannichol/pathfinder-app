  description: "At 2nd level, whenever an eldritch archer casts a spell that calls\
    \ for a ranged attack, she can deliver the spell through a ranged weapon she wields\
    \ as part of a ranged attack. Instead of the free ranged attack normally allowed\
    \ to deliver the spell, an eldritch archer can make one free ranged attack with\
    \ a ranged weapon (at her highest base attack bonus) as part of casting this spell.\
    \ The attack does not increase the spell's range.\nIf the spell can normally affect\
    \ multiple targets, only a single missile, ray, or effect accompanies each attack;\
    \ if the spell allows multiple attacks and the eldritch archer can make additional\
    \ ranged attacks as part of a full-round action with spell combat, one additional\
    \ ray, missile, or effect from the spell accompanies each subsequent ranged attack\
    \ the eldritch archer makes in the same round until all attacks allowed by the\
    \ spell are made. Unused missiles, rays, or effects remaining at the end of the\
    \ eldritch archer's turn are wasted.\nThis ability alters spellstrike."
