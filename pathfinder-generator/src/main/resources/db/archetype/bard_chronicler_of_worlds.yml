  description: "This performance infuses allies with planar quintessence. At 9th level,\
    \ while on a plane other than the Material Plane, the chronicler of worlds can\
    \ use this performance to target an ally within 30 feet. For every 3 bard levels\
    \ she has beyond 9th, she can affect one additional creature. Affected allies\
    \ gain the plane's basic infusion effect. If the chronicler of worlds is 13th\
    \ level or higher, affected creatures also gain the plane's improved infusion.\
    \ If she is 16th level or higher, affected creatures also gain the plane's greater\
    \ infusion. The first time each day a creature benefits from quintessence infusion,\
    \ the plane infused is set for the day and additional infusions can grant only\
    \ that plane's infusions. Infusions that have limited uses per day remain limited\
    \ in that way, regardless of how many times quintessence infusion is gained. Quintessence\
    \ infusion relies on audible and visual components."

  description: "At 15th level, the chronicler of worlds can create a potent ward against\
    \ outsiders. While maintaining this performance, when the chronicler of worlds\
    \ is hit by an attack from an outsider or fails a saving throw against an outsider's\
    \ extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability, as an immediate action she\
    \ can attempt a Knowledge (planes) check and use the result as her Armor Class\
    \ or her saving throw result against that attack or effect. The chronicler cannot\
    \ use her planar lore ability to take 20 on this Knowledge (planes) check.\nThis\
    \ can retroactively alter the results of the attack or ability. The chronicler\
    \ of worlds must decide to use this ability before the effects of the successful\
    \ attack or failed saving throw have been announced. Mantra of the Angel relies\
    \ on audible components."

    \ or Survival. When attempting skill checks of that type, a chronicler can use\
    \ her Linguistics skill bonus in place of her bonus with the chosen skill. At\
    \ 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a chronicler of worlds selects an additional\
    \ skill to gain this benefit."
