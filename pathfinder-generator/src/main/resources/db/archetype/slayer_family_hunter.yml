  description: "At 2nd level, a family hunter chooses a particular family line of\
    \ mortal creatures to cleanse (she must choose an actual family line like “The\
    \ Montrose family,\"rather than something generic that would cover all creatures\
    \ of a given kind like “All humans descended from the first human created by the\
    \ gods\"). She can target any creature from that family line with discern next\
    \ of kin (with a caster level equal to her slayer level) at will as a spell-like\
    \ ability. The save DC is Charisma-based and is modified by the slayer's studied\
    \ target bonus if the creature is also her studied target. A creature that successfully\
    \ saves against this effect is immune to this ability for 24 hours. If the family\
    \ hunter's chosen family line is completely eradicated, she can choose a new one\
    \ after 1 month of studying."
