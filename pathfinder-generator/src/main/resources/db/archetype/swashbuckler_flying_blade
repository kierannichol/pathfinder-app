  description: "At 5th level, a flying blade gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage\
    \ rolls when using daggers or starknives in combat. When a flying blade wields\
    \ a dagger or starknife, she gains the benefit of the Improved Critical feat with\
    \ those weapons. Additionally, a flying blade increases the range increment of\
    \ a thrown dagger or starknife by 5 feet. The increase of range increment stacks\
    \ with that of precise throw.\nEvery 4 levels thereafter, the bonus on attack\
    \ and damage rolls increases by 1, and the range increment increases by 5 feet."
