name: "Crossblooded"
description: "A crossblooded bloodline combines the powers of two distinct heritages.\
  \ In most cases, sorcerers with this bloodline are the offspring of two sorcerers\
  \ from different ancestries, but occasionally a crossblooded sorcerer arises from\
  \ the conjunction of other powers. A draconic sorcerer who is also the culmination\
  \ of a great destiny, an abyssal sorcerer from a family that dealt with devils,\
  \ and an arcane sorcerer raised from birth by fey are all possible sources for crossblooded\
  \ bloodlines."
