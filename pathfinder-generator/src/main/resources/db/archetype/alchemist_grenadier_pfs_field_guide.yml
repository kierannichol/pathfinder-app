description: "Grenadiers train to exercise their talents in the thick of battle, even\
  \ when not under the influence of their mutagens. They learn methods of combining\
  \ weapon attacks with their alchemical magic, and sacrifice skill with poisons in\
  \ order to become more adept at using alchemical bombs or using alchemical items\
  \ in conjunction with their martial skills. As an unusual side effect of their skill\
  \ at handling bombs and alchemical items with increased speed, grenadiers master\
  \ the ability to drink potions, elixirs, and mutagens quickly and safely, without\
  \ exposing themselves to peril while doing so."

  description: "At 2nd level, a grenadier can infuse a weapon or piece of ammunition\
    \ with a single harmful alchemical liquid or powder, such as alchemist's fire\
    \ or sneezing powder, as a move action. This action consumes the alchemical item,\
    \ but transfers its effect to the weapon in question.\nThe alchemical item takes\
    \ full effect on the next creature struck by the weapon, but does not splash,\
    \ spread, or otherwise affect additional targets. Any extra damage added is treated\
    \ like bonus dice of damage, and is not doubled on a critical hit. The alchemical\
    \ treatment causes no harm to the weapon treated, and wears off 1 minute after\
    \ application if no blow is struck. At 6th level, a grenadier can use her alchemical\
    \ weapon ability as a swift action. At 15th level, this ability becomes a free\
    \ action."

    \ in a 20-foot cone rather than affecting a radius. The cone starts at the alchemist\
    \ and extends away from her in the direction she chooses. The alchemist designates\
    \ one creature in the squares affected by the cone to be the target of the bomb\
    \ and makes her attack roll against that creature; all other squares in the cone\
    \ take splash damage. If the alchemist has the explosive bomb discovery and throws\
    \ an explosive directed blast, the cone of splash damage is 30 feet long instead\
    \ of 20 feet."

  description: "At 10th level, a grenadier's bombs become particularly overwhelming\
    \ when they explode. Whenever a grenadier scores a successful critical hit with\
    \ a bomb, the creature directly struck by that bomb is staggered for 1d4+1 rounds.\
    \ A successful Fortitude save (DC equals the bomb's Reflex save DC to avoid splash\
    \ damage) reduces the duration to 1 round. The effects of this ability stack with\
    \ a frost bomb's staggering effect, but not with the effects of the Staggering\
    \ Critical feat. Additional hits from a staggering blast add to the effect's overall\
    \ duration."
