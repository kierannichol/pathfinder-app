description: "While most magi use a one-handed weapon as their melee implement of\
  \ choice, one group of magi uses the quarterstaff instead. These lightly armored\
  \ magi use staves for both defense and inflicting their spells upon enemies. Skilled\
  \ in manipulating these weapons with one hand or two, they eventually learn how\
  \ to use arcane staves as well, and are just as formidable in combat as their sword-swinging\
  \ brethren."

  description: "A staff magus is proficient with simple weapons only. He can cast\
    \ magus spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell\
    \ failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a magus wearing medium armor\
    \ or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if\
    \ the spell in question has a somatic component. A multiclass magus still incurs\
    \ the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other\
    \ classes."

    \ as a magical quarterstaff with an enhancement bonus to attack and damage equal\
    \ to the staff's caster level divided by 4 (minimum +1). The staff must have at\
    \ least 1 charge for the magus to use this ability. A staff magus can restore\
    \ 1 charge to a staff by expending a number of points from his arcane pool equal\
    \ to the level of the highest-level spell cast in the staff, as long as at least\
    \ one spell in the staff is on the magus spell list. The magus cannot restore\
    \ charges to more than one staff per day.\nThis ability replaces fighter training."
