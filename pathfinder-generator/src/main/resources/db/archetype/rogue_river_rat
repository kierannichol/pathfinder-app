  \ at hiding amid reeds and roots, these rogues strike the unwary from the shallows\
  \ as others would from the shadows. Despite their strong association with banditry,\
  \ river rats make excellent guides and hunters."

  description: "At 1st level, a river rat gains a bonus equal to half her rogue level\
    \ on Swim checks (minimum +1).\nA river rat ignores difficult terrain caused by\
    \ light undergrowth and shallow bogs, and it costs her only 2 squares of movement\
    \ to enter a square of deep bog or heavy undergrowth, rather than 4 squares of\
    \ movement.\nShe takes no penalty on Acrobatics or Stealth checks for being in\
    \ bogs and undergrowth. All of these abilities apply only when she is wearing\
    \ light or no armor and carrying no more than a light load."
