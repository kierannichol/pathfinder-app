    \ a foe below 0 hit points unless that foe is an evil outsider or undead, or if\
    \ the damage she dealt was nonlethal.\nAdditionally, she gains 1 panache point\
    \ if she causes an evildoer with a number of Hit Dice equal to at least 1/2 her\
    \ character level to surrender to her. She can gain this benefit no more than\
    \ once per round, even if multiple enemies surrender."
