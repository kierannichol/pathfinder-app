  description: "A majordomo is trained to uncover forgeries and trace down discrepancies\
    \ in paperwork in order to ferret out intrigue. She adds half her investigator\
    \ level (minimum 1) to Linguistics and Profession checks to spot a forgery, deal\
    \ with paperwork, and notice discrepancies in paperwork.\nA majordomo who analyzes\
    \ the handwriting of a document and succeeds at a Linguistics check against a\
    \ DC equal to 20 + the writer's Bluff bonus gets a hunch about whether the document's\
    \ writer was lying or otherwise nervous. This ability doesn't work if the document\
    \ was dictated to someone who thought the contents were legitimate."

  description: "In order to perform all the necessary tasks of her household, a majordomo\
    \ quickly learns how to delegate. At 1st level and every 3 investigator levels\
    \ thereafter, a majordomo gains a bonus teamwork feat. As a standard action, she\
    \ can grant all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear her one of these teamwork\
    \ feats (even if they don't meet the prerequisites) for a number of rounds equal\
    \ to 3 + her investigator level. She can use this ability once per day at 1st\
    \ level, plus an additional time at 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter.\n\
    At 4th level, a majordomo can use her delegate ability and designate a single\
    \ noncombat task that could make use of the teamwork feat (for instance, designating\
    \ the Cooperative Crafting feat and a session of crafting). As long as the allies\
    \ pursue the task uninterrupted, instead of experiencing the benefits for a number\
    \ of rounds equal to 3 + the majordomo's investigator level, her allies retain\
    \ the benefits until the task is complete, to a maximum of 8 hours. Additionally,\
    \ the majordomo can use her delegate ability as a move action instead of a standard\
    \ action.\nAt 7th level, a majordomo can use her delegate ability to grant two\
    \ teamwork feats to her allies, instead of one feat. At 10th level, she can also\
    \ use her delegate ability as a swift action. At 13th level, she can grant up\
    \ to three teamwork feats to her allies when she uses delegate.\nAt 16th level,\
    \ she can spend 1 minute and use her delegate ability to grant a single teamwork\
    \ feat to all of her allies until the next time she recovers uses of her delegate\
    \ ability. As usual for multiple uses of the same ability, if she later uses delegate\
    \ to grant three teamwork feats, the two uses don't stack to grant four bonus\
    \ teamwork feats, but the longer-duration teamwork feat returns after the three\
    \ shorter-duration feats expire."

  description: "At 3rd level, a majordomo knows how to make just about any work task\
    \ more efficient, from cleaning a great hall after a big party to crafting a magic\
    \ item.\nWhenever an ally begins a workday task such as Craft, Profession, magic\
    \ item creation, spell research, managing a kingdom, using the downtime rules,\
    \ or other similar tasks, the majordomo can spend one use of inspiration and 1\
    \ minute of planning to create a plan for that ally. If the ally chooses to follow\
    \ the majordomo's plan and attempts the task on the same day, if the task would\
    \ normally take at least 4 hours, it instead takes 30 minutes less time, and if\
    \ the task would normally take at least 8 hours, it instead takes 1 hour less\
    \ time.\nIf using the kingdom building rules, at 3rd level, the majordomo counts\
    \ her Intelligence score as 2 higher when determining the bonus she provides in\
    \ a kingdom leadership role.\nHer effective Intelligence score increases by an\
    \ additional 2 at 6th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter."
