  description: "Seekers often look to ancient devices, old tomes, and strange magical\
    \ items in order to learn more about their sorcerous bloodlines. As a result of\
    \ this curiosity and thanks to an innate knack at deciphering the strange and\
    \ weird, a seeker gains Disable Device as a class skill. In addition, at 1st level,\
    \ a seeker adds half his oracle or sorcerer level on Perception checks made to\
    \ locate traps and on all Disable Device skill checks (minimum +1). A seeker can\
    \ use Disable Device to disarm magical traps. If the seeker also possesses levels\
    \ in rogue or another class that provides the trapfinding ability, those levels\
    \ stack with his sorcerer levels for determining his overall bonus on these skill\
    \ checks."

    \ and is more comfortable using the bonus spells gained by that bloodline. He\
    \ gains a +4 bonus on all concentration checks, on caster level checks made to\
    \ overcome spell resistance, and on all Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks\
    \ made on topics associated with his bonus spells."

  description: "At 15th level, a seeker becomes skilled at modifying his bloodline\
    \ spells with metamagic. When a seeker applies a metamagic feat to any bonus spells\
    \ granted by his bloodline, he reduces the metamagic feat's spell level adjustment\
    \ by 1. Thus, applying a Metamagic feat like Still Spell to a spell does not change\
    \ its effective spell level at all, while applying Quicken Spell only increases\
    \ the spell's effective spell level by 3 instead of by 4. This reduction to the\
    \ spell level adjustment for Metamagic feats does not stack with similar reductions\
    \ from other abilities."
