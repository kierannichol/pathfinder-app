    \ as a ranged touch attack. If he hits, the creature receives a Will save to escape\
    \ the trap (DC = 10 + 1/2 his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier).\n\
    If the creature fails its save, it is sealed within the vessel until someone breaks\
    \ or opens that vessel. The ghost trap automatically survives being thrown at\
