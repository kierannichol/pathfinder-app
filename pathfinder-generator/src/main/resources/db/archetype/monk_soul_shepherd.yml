  description: "As an immediate action after hitting an incorporeal undead creature\
    \ with an unarmed strike, a soul shepherd can attempt to calm the creature, encouraging\
    \ it to move peacefully to the next stage of its metaphysical journey. The target\
    \ must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half soul shepherd's level + the soul\
    \ shepherd's Wisdom modifier) or be calmed, as calm spirit, for 1 minute.\nThe\
    \ soul shepherd can use this ability against a haunt by making a touch attack\
    \ against an AC of 10 + the haunt's CR. A haunt does not receive a saving throw\
    \ against this ability, but the ability's duration changes to concentration +\
    \ 1 round, up to 1 round per level. A soul shepherd can use this ability a number\
    \ of times per day equal to his soul shepherd level."

    \ result is at least 11 + the creature or effect's CR."
