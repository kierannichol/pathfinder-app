  description: "A bouda keeps a small fetish: sometimes a carved idol, other times\
    \ a necklace adorned with teeth or bones.\nA bouda's spells come from the will\
    \ of evil spirits residing in the fetish, and its ability to hold spells functions\
    \ in a manner identical to the way a witch's spells are granted by her familiar.\
    \ The bouda must commune with her fetish each day to prepare her spells and can\
    \ only prepare spells stored in the fetish.\nAt 3rd level, a bouda can use her\
    \ fetish to deliver touch spells a number of times per day equal to 1/4 her witch\
    \ level (minimum 1). When casting a touch spell, as a free action she can use\
    \ this ability. When she does, she can deliver her spell as a ranged touch spell\
    \ within a range of 30 feet. At 10th level, she can deliver these spells within\
    \ a range of 60 feet.\nAt 15th level and higher, she can deliver these spells\
    \ within a range of 90 feet."

  description: "At 10th level, a bouda gains the ability to turn into a hyena or dire\
    \ hyena and back again a number of times per day equal to her Intelligence modifier.\
    \ This ability functions as beast shape II, except for the following. The effect\
    \ lasts for 1 hour per witch level, or until the bouda changes back. Changing\
    \ form (to animal or back) is a standard action that does not provoke attacks\
    \ of opportunity. At 20th level, a bouda can change her form at will. If a bouda\
    \ dies while in hyena shape, she does not revert back to her true form.\nThe bouda\
    \ does not lose the ability to speak while in animal form, and can communicate\
    \ with hyenas and dire hyenas as if under the effects of speak with animals. Furthermore,\
    \ while in this form, the bouda gains the benefit of the Natural Spell feat, even\
    \ if she does not meet the prerequisites."
