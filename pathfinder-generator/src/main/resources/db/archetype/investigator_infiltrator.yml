  description: "At 1st level, an infiltrator can use disguise with great results.\
    \ When disguising himself as a different gender, race, age category, or size category,\
    \ an infiltrator reduces the penalties for each by –2. For example, if the infiltrator\
    \ disguises himself as a female two age categories older than himself, he would\
    \ take a –2 to the check instead of a –6. Also, an infiltrator can disguise himself\
    \ with 1d3 minutes of work (instead of the normal 1d3 ? 10 minutes of work)."

  description: "At 2nd level, an infiltrator learns to mimic voices and sounds around\
    \ him. Using this ability requires a special Disguise check, and creatures hearing\
    \ the voice can make a Perception check to discover the ruse. An infiltrator can\
    \ attempt to emulate any creature or other sound he's heard clearly for at least\
    \ 1 minute. The bonuses or penalties to this special Disguise check are modified\
    \ in the following ways, all of which are cumulative.\nDisguised Voice Check Modifier\n\
    Voice is not your own, but not that of a distinct individual +5\nVoice is that\
    \ of a different gender –2\nVoice is that of a different race –2\nVoice is that\
    \ of a different age category –2\nVoice is that of a different size category –\
    5\nAlso, the creature making the Perception check gains a bonus based on its familiarity\
    \ with specific voices, just as if it were confronted with a normal disguise.\
    \ This ability is a language-dependent effect, meaning that if a creature cannot\
    \ hear or understand what the infiltrator is saying, the ruse fails. Magic items,\
    \ feats, and traits that affect typical disguises do not affect this disguise\
    \ check. At 8th level, the infiltrator gains the effects of its master of disguise\
    \ class feature on this special use of the Disguise skill (no penalty for a voice\
    \ of a different gender, race, or age category, and only a –3 penalty for a different\
    \ size category)."

  description: "At 2nd level, when an infiltrator uses disguise self or any polymorph\
    \ extracts on himself, he is treated as 2 investigator levels higher for the purpose\
    \ of determining the duration of that extract's effect. He can use these extracts\
    \ to take the appearance of specific individuals of the type of form he chooses,\
    \ gaining a +10 to Disguise checks even if that extract does not typically grant\
    \ such a bonus. Furthermore, these extracts grant the infiltrator a +10 bonus\
    \ to Disguise checks made as part of his voice mimicry ability."
