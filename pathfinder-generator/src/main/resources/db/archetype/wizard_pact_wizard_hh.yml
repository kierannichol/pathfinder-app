    \ adds his patron's spells to his spellbook instead of to his familiar.\nIn addition,\
    \ the pact wizard can expend any prepared spell that isn't a spell prepared using\
    \ the additional spell slot the wizard receives from his arcane school in order\
    \ to spontaneously cast one of his patron's spells of the same level or lower."

  description: "As a pact wizard grows in power, his choice of patron begins to affect\
    \ his physical body.\nAt 5th level, the pact wizard chooses one oracle curse,\
    \ using 1/2 his character level as his effective oracle level when determining\
    \ the effects of this curse.\nIf an oracle curse would add spells to the oracle's\
    \ list of spells known, the pact wizard instead add those spells to the wizard's\
    \ spell list as well as to his spellbook.\nAt 10th level, the pact wizard can\
    \ invoke his patron's power to roll twice and take the better result when attempting\
    \ any caster level check, concentration check, initiative check, or saving throw.\
    \ He can activate this ability as a free action before attempting the check, even\
    \ if it isn't his turn. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal\
    \ to 3 + 1/2 his Intelligence modifier. At 15th level, when the pact wizard invokes\
    \ his patron's power to roll twice on a check, he adds his Intelligence bonus\
    \ to the result as an insight bonus. When he applies metamagic feats to any spells\
    \ he learned via his patron or curse, he treats that spell's final effective level\
    \ as 1 lower (to a minimum level equal to the spell's original level).\nAt 20th\
    \ level, whenever the pact wizard invokes his patron's power to roll twice on\
    \ a check and his result is a natural 20, he automatically succeeds, regardless\
    \ of whether or not a check of that type would normally allow an automatic success."
