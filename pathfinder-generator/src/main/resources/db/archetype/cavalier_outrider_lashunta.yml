  description: "At 1st level, an outrider receives an Improved combat maneuver feat\
    \ (such as Improved Feint) as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for\
    \ this feat. As a standard action, an outrider can grant this feat to all allies\
    \ within 30 feet, regardless of whether they can see or hear him or they meet\
    \ the feat's prerequisites. Allies retain this bonus feat for 3 rounds, plus 1\
    \ round for every 2 levels the outrider possesses. An outrider can use this ability\
    \ once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and\
    \ for every 5 levels thereafter.\nAt 9th level, an outrider gains an Improved\
    \ or Greater combat maneuver feat (such as Greater Overrun) for which he meets\
    \ the prerequisites as a bonus feat. The outrider can grant this feat to his allies\
    \ using the maneuver tactics ability. Using the maneuver tactics ability becomes\
    \ a swift action.\nAt 17th level, an outrider gains an Improved, Greater, or Strike\
    \ combat maneuver feat (such as Tripping Strike) as a bonus feat. He must meet\
    \ the prerequisites for this feat. An outrider can grant this feat to his allies\
    \ using the maneuver tactics ability."

    \ outrider is conscious, all allies within range of his limited telepathy racial\
    \ ability (30 feet for most outriders) receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws\
    \ against charm and compulsion effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made\
    \ while flanking. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase\
    \ by 1."

  description: "At 14th level, an outrider can send a pulse of psychic energy through\
    \ the minds of allies within range of his limited telepathy as a standard action.\
    \ If he does so during a surprise round, any allies not normally able to act in\
    \ the surprise round can act. If an ally would normally be denied the ability\
    \ to act in the surprise round, that ally's initiative is equal to her initiative\
    \ roll, or to the initiative of the outrider â€“ 1, whichever is lower.\nWhether\
    \ or not it is a surprise round, when the outrider uses this ability, allies within\
    \ range are no longer flat-footed (assuming they were to begin with)."
