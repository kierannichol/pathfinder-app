  description: "At 2nd level, a preservationist adds Handle Animal to his list of\
    \ class skills. He adds summon nature's ally I to his formula book as a 1st-level\
    \ extract. When he prepares that extract, he actually prepares a tiny, preserved\
    \ specimen in a bottle (as with a caster casting the spell, the preservationist\
    \ doesn't have to choose the creature until he uses the extract). When the alchemist\
    \ opens the bottle, the specimen animates and grows to normal size, serving the\
    \ preservationist as per the spell and otherwise being treated as a summoned creature.\
    \ When the duration expires, the preserved creature decays into powder. If the\
    \ preservationist has the infusion discovery, another character can use the infused\
    \ specimen. The Augment Summoning feat can be applied to these specimens."
