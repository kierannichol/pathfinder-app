  description: "A gloom chymist is skilled at mixing potent concoctions known as glooms,\
    \ which are infused with shadow energy. A gloom is identical to a bomb except\
    \ that it deals 1d6 points of cold damage + additional damage equal to the gloom\
    \ chymist's Intelligence modifier. This damage increases by 1d6 for every 2 alchemist\
    \ levels beyond 1st the gloom chymist has. A gloom does not qualify as a bomb\
    \ for the purposes of feats or discoveries."
