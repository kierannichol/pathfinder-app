  description: "At 1st level, the swindler can declare two different actions that\
    \ rely on different types of rolls or checks, such as attacking a creature (an\
    \ attack roll) or sneaking past the same creature (a Stealth check). As a standard\
    \ action, the swindler then uses a random method to choose one of the declared\
    \ activities, such as flipping a coin, rolling a die, or drawing a harrow card.\
    \ The specific method doesn't matter as long as there is an equal chance of either\
    \ activity being chosen.\nIf the swindler then performs the chosen activity within\
    \ the next round, she gains a luck bonus on the roll type required for that activity--attack\
    \ rolls with a specific weapon, a specific skill check, a specific ability check,\
    \ or a specific saving throw--equal to half her rogue level (minimum +1) for 1\
    \ minute. If the swindler performs any other action (whether declared or not)\
    \ in the round after using this ability, she becomes shaken for 1 minute instead.\
    \ The swindler can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her\
    \ Charisma modifier."

  description: "At 2nd level, when the swindler uses Sleight of Hand, creatures take\

    \ amount equal to her class level when attempting a Sleight of Hand check as a\
    \ move action instead of as a standard action.\nLastly, the swindler can draw\
    \ hidden weapons or objects from her person as a move action instead of the usual\
    \ standard action."
