  description: "At 1st level, when an ecclesitheurge chooses his cleric domains, he\
    \ designates one as his primary domain and the other as his secondary domain.\
    \ An ecclesitheurge can use his non-domain spell slots to prepare spells from\
    \ his primary domain's spell list.\nEach day when he prepares spells, an ecclesitheurge\
    \ can select a different domain granted by his deity to gain access to that domain's\
    \ spell list instead of his secondary domain spell list. He does not lose access\
    \ to his actual secondary domain's granted powers or gain access to the other\
    \ domain's granted powers. For example, an ecclesitheurge with Glory as his primary\
    \ domain and Good as his secondary domain can choose to gain access to the Healing\
    \ domain; until the next time he prepares spells, he uses the Healing domain spell\
    \ list as his secondary domain spell list instead of the Good domain spell list,\
    \ but still keeps the granted powers of the Good domain and does not gain the\
    \ granted powers of the Healing domain."

  description: "At 3rd level, an ecclesitheurge forms a powerful bond with a holy\
    \ symbol of his deity, which functions identically to a wizard's bonded object\
    \ except it can be used to cast cleric and domain spells (instead of wizard spells)\
    \ and the ecclesitheurge can grant his bonded holy symbol only magic abilities\
    \ appropriate for a holy symbol or a neck slot item. As with a wizard's bonded\
    \ item, an ecclesitheurge can add additional magic abilities to his bonded holy\
    \ symbol as if he had the required item creation feat (typically Craft Wondrous\
    \ Item), provided he meets the feat's level prerequisites. For example, an ecclesitheurge\
    \ with a bonded holy symbol who wants to add a wondrous amulet ability, like amulet\
    \ of natural armor, to his bonded holy symbol must be at least 3rd level to do\
    \ so. The magic properties of a bonded holy symbol, including any magic abilities\
    \ the ecclesitheurge added to the object, function for only the ecclesitheurge.\
    \ If a bonded holy symbol's owner dies or the item is replaced, the object loses\
    \ all enhancements the ecclesitheurge added using this ability."
