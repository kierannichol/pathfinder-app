    \ ability to gain the benefits of certain monk abilities as well as combat feats.\
    \ Each ability counts as one Combat feat for this purpose, and the winding path\
    \ renegade is treated as a monk of a level equal to her brawler level for the\
    \ purpose of determining the effects of these abilities. The winding path renegade\
    \ gains access to these abilities at the levels listed on the Monk Moves table\
    \ above. She does not gain a ki pool, and she can't use powers that require ki.\
    \ The winding path renegade must be wearing light or no armor to benefit from\
    \ this ability."
