  description: "At 6th level, once per day as a standard action, a symbol striker\
    \ can imbue any spell he knows that has a range of touch or greater and a defined\
    \ number of targets (rather than an area or other nontarget-based effect) into\
    \ a melee weapon he is holding.\nThe spell forms itself into a brightly glowing\
    \ rune, which is obvious to a casual observer. This ability functions only while\
    \ the symbol striker wields the weapon. If dropped or taken, the weapon ceases\
    \ granting this ability until it is returned to the symbol striker. The symbol\
    \ striker can have only a single weapon rune active at a time; if he casts an\
    \ additional weapon rune while a previous rune is active, the earlier rune fades.\
    \ Weapon runes also fade when the symbol striker regains his spell slots for the\
    \ day. Otherwise, the rune remains until the spell is discharged or dispelled.\n\
    At 12th level, a symbol striker can use this ability twice per day. At 18th level,\
    \ he can use this ability three times per day.\nAs a standard action, the symbol\
    \ striker can make a melee attack with a weapon that has an active weapon rune\
    \ and, if the attack is successful, deal normal weapon damage and also expend\
    \ the weapon rune to discharge the stored spell into the target, as if delivering\
    \ the spell with the magus spellstrike class feature."

  description: "At 9th level, as a standard action, the symbol striker can use a melee\
    \ weapon to place a rune trap in any adjacent square. Any creature entering a\
    \ square containing a rune trap takes 1d6 points of damage plus 1 additional point\
    \ of damage for every 2 bloodrager levels the symbol striker has. This rune deals\
    \ either acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, which is decided at the rune's\
    \ creation. The rune is clearly visible and lasts a number of minutes equal to\
    \ the symbol striker's bloodrager level or until discharged. A symbol striker\
    \ cannot create a rune trap in a square occupied by another creature. This rune\
    \ counts as a 1st-level spell for the purpose of dispelling. A creature can disarm\
    \ the rune by succeeding at a DC 26 Disable Device check. The symbol striker can\
    \ use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 plus his Charisma modifier."
