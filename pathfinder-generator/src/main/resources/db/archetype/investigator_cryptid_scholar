  description: "At 4th level, when the cryptid scholar succeeds at a Knowledge check\
    \ to identify a monster's special powers or vulnerabilities, he can take a move\
    \ action to share his insights with his allies. Allies within 30 feet who can\
    \ hear the cryptid scholar gain a +1 insight bonus to their ACs and on saving\
    \ throws against extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities used by\
    \ creatures of the same type and all the same subtypes as the monster identified.\
    \ This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the cryptid scholar's Intelligence\
    \ modifier (minimum 1) or until he uses knowledgeable strike (see below), whichever\
    \ comes first. This bonus increases by 1 at 8th level and every 4 investigator\
    \ levels thereafter (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). A creature cannot benefit\
    \ from opportune advice regarding more than one specific kind of monster at a\
    \ time.\nOnce the cryptid scholar has used this ability to provide a bonus against\
    \ a specific kind of monster, he can't grant a bonus against that same kind of\
    \ monster again for 24 hours, unless he expends one use of inspiration when taking\
    \ a move action to use this ability."

  description: "At 4th level, the cryptid scholar can direct allies to exploit a monster's\
    \ weaknesses. If the cryptid scholar ends his opportune advice early as a move\
    \ action, each ally within 30 feet who can hear the cryptid scholar deals additional\
    \ damage on its next successful unarmed, natural, or weapon attack against that\
    \ specific kind of monster within 1 round. The additional damage is 1d6 at 4th\
    \ level and increases by 1d6 for every 4 investigator levels thereafter (to a\
    \ maximum of 5d6 at 20th level). The damage of knowledgeable strike is precision\
    \ damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit; creatures that are immune to\
    \ sneak attacks are also immune to knowledgeable strike. Ranged attacks gain this\
    \ additional damage only against a target within 30 feet. The ally must be able\
    \ to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach\
    \ such a spot. Knowledgeable strike cannot be used against a creature with concealment."
