  \ multiple objects in the air simultaneously. They often incorporate this talent\

  description: "At 2nd level, a juggler can hold and wield (in other words, “juggle\"\
    ) up to three items or weapons in his hands. The juggler must be able to hold\
    \ and wield an object in one hand in order to juggle it.\nThis ability doesn't\
    \ grant the juggler additional attacks, though it does allow him to use different\
    \ weapons as part of a full attack. As long as he is juggling fewer than three\
    \ objects, the juggler is considered to have a free hand (for the purposes of\
    \ drawing a weapon, using somatic components, using Deflect Arrows, and so on).\
    \ At 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the maximum number of objects the\
    \ juggler can juggle increases by one, to a maximum of seven objects at 18th level.\n\
    If the juggler is affected by any action or condition that would require a concentration\
    \ check while he is juggling, he must attempt a Sleight of Hand check to continue\
    \ juggling and avoid losing concentration. The check's DC is the same as a concentration\
    \ check, treating the spell level as twice the number of objects being juggled.\n\
    If the juggler fails his Sleight of Hand check, he drops all juggled objects but\
    \ one, determined randomly."
