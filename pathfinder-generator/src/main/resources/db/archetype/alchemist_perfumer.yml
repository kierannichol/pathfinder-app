  description: "A perfumer's extracts are stored in atomizers, rather than bottles\
    \ or vials, allowing him to spray them at himself or an adjacent ally. The target\
    \ is considered the imbiber, as if she had drunk an extract prepared with the\
    \ infusion discovery. As the contents of an atomizer are inhaled, the target must\
    \ be able to breathe. Atomized extracts are considered extracts for purposes of\
    \ other abilities, and become inert when not in the alchemist's possession."

  name: "Effervescent Bombs"
  label: null
  type: null
  description: "Rather than deal direct damage, a perfumer's bombs create an effervescent\
    \ puddle in a 5-foot radius for a number of rounds equal to the alchemist's intelligence\
    \ bonus (minimum 1). Each creature within this area takes 1d4 points of fire damage\
    \ immediately and again each round it remains within or enters the puddle.\nA\
    \ creature caught in the puddle when it is first created can attempt a Reflex\
    \ save (DC = 10 + half the perfumer's level + the perfumer's Intelligence modifier)\
    \ for half damage. The effervescent bombs' damage increases by 1d4 at 3rd level\
    \ and every odd level thereafter. Effervescent bombs otherwise functions as bombs,\
    \ and discoveries that apply to bombs apply to effervescent bombs."

  name: "Pheromones"
  label: null
  type: null
  description: "A perfumer can spend 1 hour to distill a special mixture of exotic\
    \ pheromones and alchemical reagents and store it in an atomizer. The mixture\
    \ remains potent until used or until the perfumer distills another pheromone mixture,\
    \ at which point the first becomes inert and the duration of its effects immediately\
    \ end. Spraying this mixture on a willing creature as a standard action grants\
    \ the target a +4 alchemical bonus to Charisma and a â€“2 penalty to Constitution\
    \ for 10 minutes per alchemist level. Additionally, the target creature gains\
    \ a +2 alchemical bonus on Diplomacy and Bluff checks.\nThis replaces mutagen.\
    \ A perfumer can never gain the mutagen, cognatogen, or inspired cognatogen ability,\
    \ even from a discovery or another class.\nPersistent Pheromones: At 14th level,\
    \ the alchemist gains the ability to distill extremely potent pheromones. His\
    \ pheromone atomizers can be sprayed on up to four different targets before becoming\
    \ fully used. This allows a perfumer to affect multiple targets with a single\
    \ atomizer."
