  description: "At 1st level, a celebrity bard may choose a region where he is famous,\
    \ and within that region, the locals are more likely to react favorably toward\
    \ the bard. The bard gains a bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks in that\
    \ area and to influence people from that area.\nAt 1st level, this region is a\
    \ settlement or settlements with a total population of 1,000 or fewer people,\
    \ and the modifier on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks is +1. As the celebrity\
    \ grows more famous, additional areas learn of him (typically places where he\
    \ has lived or traveled, or settlements adjacent to those where he is known) and\
    \ his bonuses apply to even more people. At 5th level, the region is a settlement\
    \ or settlements with a total population of 5,000 or fewer people, and the modifier\
    \ on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks is +2. At 9th level, the region is a settlement\
    \ or settlements with a total population of up to 25,000 people, and the modifier\
    \ on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks is +3. At 13th level, the region is a settlement\
    \ or settlements with a total population of up to 100,000 people, and the modifier\
    \ to Diplomacy and Intimidate is +4. At 17th level and above, the bard's renown\
    \ has spread far, and most civilized folk know of him (GM's discretion); the bard's\
    \ modifier on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks is +5."

  description: "A celebrity gains the following type of bardic performance:\nGather\
    \ Crowd (Ex): At 5th level, the celebrity is skilled at drawing an audience to\
    \ his performances. If he is in a settlement or populated area, he can shout,\
    \ sing, or otherwise make himself noticed in order to attract an audience to his\
    \ impromptu stage. The size of the crowd depends on the local population, but\
    \ typically is a number of people equal to 1/2 the bard's class level × the result\
    \ of the bard's Perform check. The crowd gathers over the next 1d10 rounds. If\
    \ the bard fails to engage the crowd (such as by performing, kissing babies, trying\
    \ to use fascinate, and so on), it disperses over the next 1d10 rounds.\nThis\
    \ ability replaces lore master."

    \ adoring crowd. When using fascinate, a target making a save to break the effect\
    \ because of a potential threat takes a –4 penalty on that save, and even obvious\
    \ threats require a save rather than automatically breaking the effect. Creatures\
    \ affected by the bard's fascinate ability ignore the shaken condition."
