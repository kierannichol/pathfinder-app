  description: "At 9th level, a Tarot student can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir\
    \ and draw a card from her harrow deck as a standard action to learn her own fate\
    \ or that of an ally within 30 feet. The target's fate depends on the suit of\
    \ the card drawn from the deck.\nBooks: The target gains a +2 insight bonus on\
    \ her next caster level check. Crowns: The target gains a +2 insight bonus on\
    \ her next saving throw. Hammers: The target gains a +4 insight bonus on the damage\
    \ roll of her next successful melee attack. Keys: The target gains a +4 insight\
    \ bonus on her next initiative check. Shields: The next time the target receives\
    \ magical healing, she regains an additional number of hit points equal to the\
    \ Tarot student's arcanist class level. Stars: The target gains a +4 insight bonus\
    \ on her next skill check.\nA creature cannot have more than one trump card in\
    \ effect at one time; drawing a new trump card for a target negates the effect\
    \ of the previous trump card. A Tarot student can attempt to read the fate of\
    \ an enemy within 30 feet, resulting in a penalty for that target equal to the\
    \ bonus granted above, but the target is entitled to a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2\
    \ the Tarot student's arcanist level + her Charisma modifier) to negate the effect.\
    \ This is considered a curse effect. A Tarot student can have trump cards in effect\
    \ for multiple creatures at the same time."
