  description: "At 1st level, a siege mage can bond with a single siege engine within\
    \ 30 feet and line of sight as a standard action. He can utilize the power of\
    \ this link to aim and fire the siege engine remotely (as long as he's within\
    \ 30 feet), though it still requires a crew to reload the siege engine. At 10th\
    \ level, he can reload, aim, and fire the siege engine purely by the power of\
    \ this link, and no longer needs a crew to control the siege engine. It still\
    \ takes the normal required amount of time and actions to control a siege engine\
    \ in this manner.\nThis ability replaces arcane bond. The siege mage can end this\
    \ bond with a free action. A siege mage can bond with a siege engine in this manner\
    \ a number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) but\
    \ can only be bonded with one siege engine at a time."

    \ he is bonded with. When he does, the siege engine attack gains a bonus on its\
    \ attack roll or targeting roll equal to the level of the spell he sacrificed,\
    \ and a bonus to damage equal to 3 × the level of the spell.\nThis ability replaces\
    \ cantrips, but the siege mage gains the detect magic and read magic cantrips\
    \ and places them in his spellbook. He can cast either of these as 1st-level spells."

    \ of magic. Once chosen, these opposition schools cannot be changed. A siege mage\
    \ who prepares spells from his opposition school must use two spell slots of that\
    \ level to prepare the spell. In addition, the siege mage takes a –4 penalty on\
    \ any skill checks made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of\
    \ his opposition schools."
