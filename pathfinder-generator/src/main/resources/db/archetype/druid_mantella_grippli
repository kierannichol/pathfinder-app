  description: "At 6th level, both the mantella and her animal companion gain immunity\
    \ to poison. Additionally, as an immediate action when exposed to a dose of poison,\
    \ a mantella can absorb the toxin and store it internally for up to 1 day. As\
    \ a swift action, a mantella can secrete this poison; this changes the poison's\
    \ type to injury and applies the dose of poison to all of the druid's natural\
    \ attacks. A mantella can use this ability three times per day, plus one additional\
    \ time per day at 8th level and every 2 druid levels thereafter."
