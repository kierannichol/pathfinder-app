  description: "At 6th level, a sensei may use his advice ability when spending points\
    \ from his ki pool to activate a class ability (using the normal actions required\
    \ for each) in order to have that ability affect one ally within 30 feet rather\
    \ than the sensei himself.\nAt 10th level, a sensei may affect all allies within\
    \ 30 feet rather than himself (spending points from his ki pool only once, not\
    \ once for each target). At 10th level, a sensei may instead spend 1 point from\
    \ his ki pool (as a swift action) while using advice to provide a single ally\
    \ within 30 feet with evasion, fast movement, high jump, purity of body, or slow\
    \ fall.\nAt 14th level, a sensei may spend 2 points to grant one of the abilities\
    \ listed above to all allies within 30 feet, or diamond body, diamond soul, or\
    \ improved evasion to a single ally within 30 feet. These abilities function at\
    \ the sensei's level and last 1 round."
