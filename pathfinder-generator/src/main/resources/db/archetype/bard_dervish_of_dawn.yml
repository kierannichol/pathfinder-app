description: "Although the dawn goddess is seen mainly as a goddess of healing and\
  \ redemption in most parts of the world, her stern, evil-smiting element is more\
  \ common in some areas. Many of her disciples from these lands become dervishes\
  \ of dawn, religious mystics who use a spinning dance as part of their worship.\
  \ Many bards of her faith hone their skills with dance and scimitar to become dervish\
  \ dancers, but some tread a similar path focused more on magic and healing than\
  \ swordplay. These are the dervishes of dawn."

  description: "Dervishes of dawn are trained in the use of the Perform skill, especially\
    \ dance, to create magical effects on himself. This works like bardic performance,\
    \ except that the performances grant double their normal bonuses, but these bonuses\
    \ only affect him. He does not need to be able to see or hear his own performance.\
    \ Battle dancing is treated as bardic performance for the purposes of feats, abilities,\
    \ and effects that affect bardic performance, except that battle dancing does\
    \ not benefit from the Lingering Performance feat or any other ability that allows\
    \ a bardic performance to grant bonuses after it has ended. The benefits of battle\
    \ dancing apply only when the bard is wearing light or no armor. Like bardic performance,\
    \ battle dancing cannot be maintained at the same time as other performance abilities.\n\
    Starting a battle dance is a move action, but it can be maintained each round\
    \ as a free action. Changing a battle dance from one effect to another requires\
    \ the dervish to stop the previous performance and start the new one as a move\
    \ action. Like a bard, a dervish of dawn's performance ends immediately if he\
    \ is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from\
    \ taking a free action each round. A dervish of dawn cannot perform more than\
    \ one battle dance at a time.\nAt 10th level, the dervish can start a battle dance\
    \ as a swift action instead of a move action.\nWhen a dervish of dawn uses the\
    \ inspire courage, inspire greatness, or inspire heroics bardic performance types\
    \ as battle dances, these performance types only provide benefit to the dervish\
    \ himself. All other types of bardic performance work normally (affecting the\
    \ bard and his allies, or the bard's enemies, as appropriate)."

  description: "At 8th level, when using battle dance, the dervish of dawn can enter\
    \ a trance-like state where his spinning motion represents the movement of the\
    \ planets around the sun, and his spirit is attuned to the healing aspects of\
    \ his goddess.\nBy spending a move action focusing on his whirling, the dervish\
    \ can apply the Quicken Spell feat to any cure spell he is about to cast (effectively\
    \ spending a move action and swift action to cast the spell). This does not alter\
    \ the level of the spell or the casting time. The dervish can use this ability\
    \ once per day at 8th level and one additional time per day for every two dervish\
    \ levels he has beyond 8th."
