    \ of her magic to empower her transmutations. Whenever the brown-fur transmuter\
    \ casts a transmutation spell using one of her arcanist spell slots, she can expend\
    \ 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action to bolster the spell. If\
    \ the spell grants a bonus to an ability score, the bonus then increases by 2.\
    \ If it grants a bonus to more than one ability score, only one of the ability\
    \ scores gains this bonus. The brown-fur transmuter cannot expend more than 1\
    \ point from her arcane reservoir in this way."

    \ or slot used. (She cannot then alter its duration again with the Extend Spell\
