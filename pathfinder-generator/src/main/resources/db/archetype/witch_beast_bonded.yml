    description: "At 4th level, the beast-bonded witch's connection with her
      familiar strengthens. For the purposes of determining her familiar's
      powers and abilities, she treats her familiar as if she were one level
      higher than her actual witch level.

      This ability replaces the witch's 4th-level hex."

    name: "Familiar Form"
    description: "At 8th level, a beast-bonded witch may take the shape of her
      familiar (or a giant version of her familiar or a similar kind of animal)
      as if using beast shape II. For example, a witch with a rat familiar can
      turn into a Tiny rat, Small dire rat, or a larger rodent; one with a cat
      familiar can turn into a Tiny cat or a Large feline such as a tiger or
      lion; one with a monkey familiar can turn into a Tiny monkey or a Large
      gorilla, and so on. The witch can remain in animal form for a number of
      minutes per day equal to her level.

      This ability replaces the witch's 8th-level hex."

    name: "Twin Soul"
    description: "At 10th-level, if the witch or her familiar is gravely injured or
      about to die, the soul of the dying one immediately transfers to the
      other's body. The two souls share the surviving body peaceably, can
      communicate freely, and both retain their ability to think and reason. The
      host may allow the guest soul to take over the body temporarily or reclaim
      it as a move action. They can persist in this state indefinitely, or the
      guest can return to its own body (if available) by touch, transfer into a
      suitable vessel (such as a clone), or take over another body as if using
      magic jar (with no receptacle).

      This replaces the witch's major hex at 10th-level.

      Hexes: The following witch hexes complement the beast-bonded archetype:
      beast of ill omen, charm, feral speech, ward.

      Major Hexes: The following major hex complements the beast-bonded
      archetype: beast eye."
