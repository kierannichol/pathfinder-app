    \ strengthens. For the purposes of determining her familiar's powers and abilities,\
    \ she treats her familiar as if she were one level higher than her actual witch\
    \ level.\nThis ability replaces the witch's 4th-level hex."

  description: "At 8th level, a beast-bonded witch may take the shape of her familiar\
    \ (or a giant version of her familiar or a similar kind of animal) as if using\
    \ beast shape II. For example, a witch with a rat familiar can turn into a Tiny\
    \ rat, Small dire rat, or a larger rodent; one with a cat familiar can turn into\
    \ a Tiny cat or a Large feline such as a tiger or lion; one with a monkey familiar\
    \ can turn into a Tiny monkey or a Large gorilla, and so on. The witch can remain\
    \ in animal form for a number of minutes per day equal to her level.\nThis ability\
    \ replaces the witch's 8th-level hex."

  description: "At 10th-level, if the witch or her familiar is gravely injured or\
    \ about to die, the soul of the dying one immediately transfers to the other's\
    \ body. The two souls share the surviving body peaceably, can communicate freely,\
    \ and both retain their ability to think and reason. The host may allow the guest\
    \ soul to take over the body temporarily or reclaim it as a move action. They\
    \ can persist in this state indefinitely, or the guest can return to its own body\
    \ (if available) by touch, transfer into a suitable vessel (such as a clone),\
    \ or take over another body as if using magic jar (with no receptacle).\nThis\
    \ replaces the witch's major hex at 10th-level.\nHexes: The following witch hexes\
    \ complement the beast-bonded archetype: beast of ill omen, charm, feral speech,\
    \ ward.\nMajor Hexes: The following major hex complements the beast-bonded archetype:\
    \ beast eye."
