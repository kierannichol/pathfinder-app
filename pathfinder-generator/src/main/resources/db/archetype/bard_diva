  description: "At 1st level, a Diva may choose a region where she is famous, and\
    \ within that region, the locals are more likely to react favorably toward her.\
    \ The bard gains a bonus on Bluff and Intimidate checks in that area and to influence\
    \ people from that area.\nAt 1st level, this region is a settlement or settlements\
    \ with a total population of 1,000 or fewer people, and the modifier on Bluff\
    \ and Intimidate checks is +1. As the diva grows more famous, additional areas\
    \ learn of her (typically places where she has lived or traveled, or settlements\
    \ adjacent to those where she is known) and her bonuses apply to even more people.\
    \ At 5th level, the region is a settlement or settlements with a total population\
    \ of 5,000 or fewer people, and the modifier on Bluff and Intimidate checks is\
    \ +2. At 9th level, the region is a settlement or settlements with a total population\
    \ of up to 25,000 people, and the modifier on Bluff and Intimidate checks is +3.\
    \ At 13th level, the region is a settlement or settlements with a total population\
    \ of up to 100,000 people, and the modifier to Bluff and Intimidate is +4. At\
    \ 17th level and above, the diva's renown has spread far, and most civilized folk\
    \ know of her (GM's discretion); the diva's modifier on Diplomacy and Intimidate\
    \ checks is +5."

    \ used, this ability gives her a +2 bonus on her Perform check or saving throw\

    \ costumes for her performances that she gains medium armor proficiency and can\
    \ cast bard spells while wearing medium armor without incurring the normal arcane\
    \ spell failure chance. At 11th level, she gains heavy armor proficiency and can\
    \ cast bard spells while wearing heavy armor without incurring the normal arcane\
    \ spell failure chance. A multiclassed diva still incurs the normal arcane spell\
    \ failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes."

  description: "A Diva gains the following bardic performances. This can never be\
    \ performed more quickly than a standard action.\nDevastating Aria (Su): At 3rd\
    \ level, the Diva can spend 1 round of bardic performance as a standard action\
    \ to direct a burst of sonically charged words at a creature or object. This performance\
    \ deals 1d4 points of damage + the diva's level to an object, or half this damage\
    \ to a living creature.\nThis performance replaces inspire competence.\nScathing\
    \ Tirade (Su): A Diva of 8th level or higher can use her performance to verbally\
    \ lash out at another creature, causing it to become frightened. To be affected,\
    \ the target enemy must be within 30 feet and be able to see and hear the diva's\
    \ performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet\
    \ and the diva continues her performance, plus 1d4 rounds. Although the diva can\
    \ only direct the effect at one creature at a time, its effects persist for as\
    \ long as she continues the performance, even if directed at a different creature.\
    \ For example, she could direct her tirade at an innkeeper, who becomes frightened,\
    \ then focus her wrath on the captain of the guard, and the innkeeper remains\
    \ frightened for 1d4 more rounds even though her attention is no longer directed\
    \ at him. This performance cannot cause a creature to become panicked, even if\
    \ the target is already frightened from another effect. Scathing tirade is a mind-affecting\
    \ fear effect, and it relies on audible and visual components."
