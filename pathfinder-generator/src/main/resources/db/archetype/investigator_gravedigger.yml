    \ invest mental focus into the implement and thus doesn't receive any resonant\
    \ powers. However, once per day she can expend one use of inspiration to use any\
    \ focus power she knows that has a cost of 1 point of mental focus. She can do\
    \ this an additional time each day at 3rd level and every 3 investigator levels\
    \ thereafter. To activate a focus power that costs more than 1 point of mental\
    \ focus, the gravedigger can expend that number of daily uses of this ability\
    \ (as well as uses of inspiration) at the same time. In addition, any number of\
    \ times per day, she can expend 1 use of inspiration to use grave words as spell-like\
    \ ability."
