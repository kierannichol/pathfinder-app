    \ number of spells for a level to 0, she gains only the bonus spells for that\

    \ times per day equal to 1/2 her druid level + her Wisdom modifier. Once a trap\
    \ is learned, it can't be unlearned and replaced with a different type of trap.\

  description: "At 9th level, a survivor can affix a magical ranger trap to an arrow\
    \ or thrown weapon, allowing her to set the trap remotely or use it as a direct\
    \ attack. Attaching the trap to the projectile is part of the full-round action\
    \ of creating a new trap. The trapped projectile is fired or thrown in the normal\
    \ manner. If the projectile is fired at a square, the trap is treated as if the\
    \ survivor had set the trap in that square, except the DC is 5 lower than normal.\
    \ If the projectile is fired at a creature, the target takes damage from the ranged\
    \ weapon and is treated as if it had triggered the trap (saving throw applies,\
    \ if any). The attack has a maximum range of 60 feet, and range increments apply\
    \ to the attack roll. The duration of the trapped projectile starts from when\
    \ it is created, not from when it is used."
