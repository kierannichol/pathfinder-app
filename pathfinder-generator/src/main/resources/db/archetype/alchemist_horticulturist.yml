  label: null
  type: null
  description: "At 1st level, a horticulturist adds summon nature's ally Iâ€“VI as 1st-\
    \ through 6th-level extracts, respectively, to his class extract list. For example,\
    \ he automatically adds summon nature's ally I to his formula book at 1st level\
    \ and adds the next higher-level spell to his formula book each time he gains\
    \ the ability to use extracts of that level. The horticulturist uses these special\
    \ extracts to plant a seed that grows into a creature, bypassing the restriction\
    \ for single target or personal effects. Using these extracts takes 1 round (as\
    \ the spell's normal casting time), and the creature summoned must be placed in\
    \ a space adjacent to the horticulturist. The horticulturist can use these extracts\
    \ to summon only animals and plants on the appropriate summon nature's ally list.\
    \ Creatures the horticulturist summons with these extracts become creatures with\
    \ the plant type (gaining low-light vision and immunity to mind-affecting, paralysis,\
    \ poison, polymorph, sleep, and stunning effects) rather than their normal type,\
    \ but their attack bonuses, Hit Dice, saving throws, and skills don't change."

  description: "A horticulturist's bombs lack the power of a traditional alchemist's\
    \ but can be fine-tuned in ways normal alchemist explosives cannot. The horticulturist's\
    \ bombs deal 1d4 points of damage (instead of 1d6), plus 1d4 points of damage\
    \ for every 2 alchemist levels beyond 1st. When the horticulturist creates a bomb,\
    \ he can formulate it to affect plants and other creatures normally, affect only\
    \ plant creatures, or affect only creatures not of the plant type."

    \ constant speak with plants spell (this ability is supernatural)."

  label: null
  type: null
  description: "At 4th level, a horticulturist creates a Diminutive or Tiny alchemical\
    \ plant creature that vaguely resembles a kind of animal suitable for a familiar\
    \ (such as a cat) and acts as his familiar, granting the horticulturist a skill\
    \ bonus, the Alertness feat, and so on. The plant familiar has all the abilities\
    \ of the animal it resembles (for example, a bat-like plant familiar can fly)\
    \ but is treated as a creature of the plant type and has familiar abilities based\
    \ on the horticulturist's alchemist level (though some familiar abilities may\
    \ be useless to the horticulturist). An alchemist's extracts and mutagens are\
    \ considered spells for the purposes of familiar abilities like share spells or\
    \ deliver touch spells. If a plant familiar is lost or dies, it can be replaced\
    \ 1 week later through a specialized procedure that costs 200 gp per alchemist\
    \ level the horticulturist has. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete."
