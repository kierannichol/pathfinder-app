  description: "An occultist can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to cast summon\
    \ monster I. She can cast this spell as a standard action and the summoned creatures\
    \ remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level and\
    \ every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by one spell\
    \ level, allowing her to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon\
    \ monster IX at 17th level), at the cost of an additional point from her arcane\
    \ spell reserve per spell level. An occultist cannot have more than one summon\
    \ monster spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again,\
    \ any existing summon monster immediately ends."
