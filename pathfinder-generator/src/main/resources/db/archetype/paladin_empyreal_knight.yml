  description: "At 4th level, an empyreal knight can summon a celestial ally as a\
    \ full-round action. This functions as summon monster I, except it can only be\
    \ used to summon celestial creatures, archons, and angels. At 6th level, this\
    \ improves to summon monster II, increasing by one spell level for every two levels\
    \ thereafter, to a maximum of summon monster IX at 20th level. This ability can\
    \ be used a number of times per day equal to the empyreal knight's Charisma modifier\
    \ (minimum 1), but only one ally can be summoned at a time.\nThis ability replaces\
    \ lay on hands and channel positive energy."

  description: "At 20th level, an empyreal knight transcends her mortal self. Her\
    \ DR increases to 10/evil. Her type is treated as outsider for the purposes of\
    \ spells and magical effects. She gains darkvision 60 feet and low-light vision.\
    \ As a standard action and a supernatural ability, she can sprout wings that allow\
    \ her to fly at twice her land speed with average maneuverability. Any armor or\
    \ clothing reshapes to allow her to fly when she uses this ability. She can retract\
    \ the wings as a free action. Unlike other outsiders, an empyreal knight can still\
    \ be brought back from the dead as if she were a member of her previous creature\
    \ type."
