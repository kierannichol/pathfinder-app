  description: "A sea witch can influence the attitude of water-dwelling animals and\
    \ animals that live along coasts and shores, including birds, as if using wild\
    \ empathy. The sea witch uses her witch level as her druid level for this ability.\
    \ If the sea witch has wild empathy from another class, her witch levels stack\
    \ with the other class's levels to determine her wild empathy bonus for these\
    \ kinds of creatures.\nThis ability replaces the witch's 1st-level hex.\nHexes:\
    \ The following witch hexes complement the sea witch archetype: charm, flight,\
    \ water lung.\nMajor Hexes: The following major hexes complement the sea witch\
    \ archetype: hag eye, hidden home, weather control."
