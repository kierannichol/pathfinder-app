  description: "Guildbreakers may work to dismantle their enemies' power structures\

    \ in order to masquerade as a member of those organizations. At 4th level, a guildbreaker\
    \ adds a circumstance bonus equal to twice his favored organization bonus to all\
    \ Bluff and Disguise checks to appear to be a member of the organization (this\
    \ does not apply on Disguise checks to change his appearance and replace a specific\
    \ member, but rather to checks related to appear to be a general member of the\
    \ organization).\nThe bonus on Bluff checks from deep cover stacks with the guildbreaker's\
    \ overall bonus from favored organization if the person he is attempting to deceive\
    \ is also a member of that organization.\nA guildbreaker posing as a member of\
    \ one of his favored enemy organizations automatically defeats truthtelling magic\
    \ (as if under the effects of glibness), but only for the purpose of claiming\
    \ to be a member of the organization. Truth-telling magic can still expose him\
    \ with a more indirect question, such as a member of a non-religious evil organization\
    \ asking the guildbreaker for the identity of his patron deity."
