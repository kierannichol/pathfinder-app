  description: "At 1st level, an invoker can invite spirits associated with her patron's\
    \ themes into her body and mind as a swift action. This functions like a hunter's\
    \ animal focus, except she emulates facets of her patron, chosen from the list\
    \ below. The invoker can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal\
    \ to her level; this duration need not be consecutive, but it must be spent in\
    \ 1-minute increments."
