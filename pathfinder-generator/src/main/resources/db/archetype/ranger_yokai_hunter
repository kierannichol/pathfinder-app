  description: "A yokai hunter possesses a supernatural ability to sense beings connected\
    \ to the spirit world, such as kami, oni, and ghosts, and is formidable at fighting\
    \ them.\nAt 1st level, a yokai hunter gains a +2 bonus on weapon attacks and damage\
    \ rolls against one of the following creature types (and subtypes, if applicable),\
    \ which are considered yokai for the purposes of this archetype: aberration, dragon,\
    \ fey, magical beast, outsider (native), and undead (incorporeal). (A GM may choose\
    \ to alter this list for the purposes of her campaign.)\nAt 5th level and every\
    \ five levels thereafter, a yokai hunter may select another favored yokai from\
    \ this list, gaining a +2 bonus on weapon attacks and damage rolls against that\
    \ yokai.\nIn addition, whenever a yokai hunter sees a favored yokai that is disguised\
    \ or has not made its otherworldly essence known, he gains an automatic check\
    \ to identify the creature as such. To make this check, a yokai hunter rolls 1d20\
    \ and adds his yokai hunter level and Charisma modifier (DC 10 + 1/2 the yokai's\
    \ Hit Dice + the yokai's Cha modifier). A successful check means that the yokai\
    \ hunter recognizes the creature's ties to the spiritual world. Regardless of\
    \ whether the check is successful, a yokai hunter gains the bonus on weapon attacks\
    \ and damage rolls against favored yokai."
