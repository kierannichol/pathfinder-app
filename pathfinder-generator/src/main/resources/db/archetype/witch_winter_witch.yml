  description: "At 1st level, a winter witch gains endure elements as a constant spell-like\
    \ ability, but only against cold temperatures. At 4th level, she gains cold resistance\
    \ 5, making her comfortable in near-freezing temperatures. At 9th-level, this\
    \ increases to cold resistance 10, and at 14th level, it becomes immunity to cold.\n\
    This replaces the witch's 4th-level hex.\nHexes: The following hexes complement\
    \ the winter witch archetype: beast eye, blight, cook people, evil eye, feral\
    \ speech, hag's eye, hoarfrost, ice tomb, witch's hut.\nA winter witch can select\
    \ the following hexes:\nFrostfoot (Su) This ability works like the spider climb\
    \ spell, but the surfaces the witch climbs must be icy. The witch can move across\
    \ icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to\
    \ run or charge on ice. She can move across regular snow without penalty, and\
    \ heavy snow only costs her 2 squares of movement instead of 4. Frozen Caress\
    \ (Su) Whenever the winter witch casts a touch spell, she can infuse the magic\
    \ with cold as a swift action. This grants the spell the cold descriptor, and\
    \ adds 1d4 points of cold damage to the spell's effect. If the touch spell allows\
    \ a saving throw, a successful save negates this additional cold damage."
