  description: "This works like the paladin's normal divine bond ability, except as\
    \ follows. If the paladin's bond is with a weapon, she cannot use that ability\
    \ to add the brilliant energy, disruption, or merciful weapon properties, but\
    \ she can add the bane weapon property (but only against dragons). If the paladin's\
    \ bond is with her steed, the steed gains the paladin's aura-based immunities\
    \ and her aura does not affect allies.\nThis replaces the standard divine bond\
    \ ability."

    \ a dragon, the dragon is also subject to a single-target holy word, using her\
    \ paladin level + 10 as the caster level. After the banishment effect and the\
