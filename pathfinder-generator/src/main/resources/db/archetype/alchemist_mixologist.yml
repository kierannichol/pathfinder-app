    \ additional 10 gp in raw materials to increase his caster level by 1 for the\
    \ purpose of the potion's effects, but the potion counts as a strong alcoholic\
    \ drink. When a mixologist creates his extracts, he can spend 1 extra minute doing\
    \ so to increase his caster level by 1 for the purpose of that extract's effects,\
    \ but the extract counts as a strong alcoholic drink. A mixologist can prepare\
    \ one alcoholic extract for each level of extracts he can prepare. A mixologist\
    \ can't ever gain a mutagen or discoveries that alter mutagens."

    \ produce intoxicating fumes. A creature that takes a direct hit from an alcoholic\
    \ bomb becomes tipsy if it fails a Fortitude saving throw. If the creature is\
    \ already tipsy, it becomes drunk instead. If the creature is already drunk, it\
    \ becomes soused instead. A soused creature that fails its Fortitude saving throw\
    \ passes out for 1d3 hours and wakes up with a hangover. This ability counts as\
    \ a discovery that modifies bombs, so it doesn't stack with other discoveries\
    \ that modify bombs."
