  description: "When a deep shaman gains access to the true version of the waves spirit,\

    \ swim speed of 60 feet. She can use this ability for 1 hour per shaman level\
    \ each day, divided any way she chooses in 1 hour increments, though the spell's\
    \ breath weapon limit applies across the whole day. Time she spends underwater\
    \ doesn't count against this limit, but every minute (or fraction thereof ) that\
    \ she spends flying expends 1 hour of her daily uses. At 18th level, she can assume\
    \ the form of a Huge or smaller brine dragon as per form of the dragon III instead."
