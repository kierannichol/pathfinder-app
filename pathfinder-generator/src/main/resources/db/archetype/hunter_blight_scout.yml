description: "Blight scouts are an elite band of elves skilled and brave enough to\
  \ take the offensive against their foes. Blight scouts rely on their close bonds\
  \ with their animal companions to survive such raids. One blight scout who accompanied\
  \ an expedition to put his demon-fighting skills to work has retired to teach his\
  \ techniques to others, so these skills are slowly being passed on to non-elves."
