    \ (Su) The flamesinger's song causes allies' weapons to burst into flames. To\
    \ be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard perform and be within 30\
    \ feet. An affected creature's successful attacks with manufactured or natural\
    \ weapons deal 1d4 additional points of fire damage.\nThese flames do not harm\
    \ the weapon or its wielder. This damage stacks with other sources of fire damage,\
    \ such as the flaming special weapon ability. At 5th level and every 6 bard levels\
    \ thereafter, this bonus fire damage increases by 1d4 (to a maximum of 4d4 at\
    \ 17th level). This is a fire effect that relies on audible components."
