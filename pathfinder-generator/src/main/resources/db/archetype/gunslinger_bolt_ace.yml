  description: "Starting at 5th level, a bolt ace can select one specific type of\
    \ crossbow, such as hand crossbow or heavy crossbow. She gains a bonus on damage\
    \ rolls equal to her Dexterity modifier with that crossbow. Furthermore, when\
    \ she scores a critical hit with that type of crossbow, her critical modifier\
    \ increases by 1 (a x2 becomes a x3, for example). Every 4 levels thereafter,\
    \ she can pick a different type of crossbow, gaining the bonus damage and increased\
    \ critical multiplier with that type of crossbow as well."
