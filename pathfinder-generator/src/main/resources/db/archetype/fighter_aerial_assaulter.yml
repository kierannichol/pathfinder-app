  description: "At 2nd level, an aerial assaulter gains a +2 bonus on Fly checks.\
    \ Additionally, whenever he is affected by a spell or ability that grants him\
    \ a fly speed, he treats that spell or ability as though its caster level were\
    \ 2 higher for the purposes of determining its effects. At 6th level and every\
    \ 4 levels thereafter, this bonus on Fly checks increases by an additional 2,\
    \ to a maximum of +10 at 18th level."

  description: "At 2nd level, an aerial assaulter can leap above his foes to gain\
    \ an advantage in combat. As a move action, he can attempt an Acrobatics check\
    \ with the DC equal to the CMD of an adjacent enemy. If he succeeds, the aerial\
    \ assaulter is treated as if he had higher ground against that enemy until the\
    \ beginning of his next turn. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, an aerial\
    \ assaulter increases his bonus from higher ground by 1, to a total of a +6 bonus\
    \ at 20th level. At 12th level, an aerial assaulter can use this ability as a\
    \ swift action."

  description: "At 19th level, an aerial assaulter can perform an aerial dodge that\
    \ allows him to evade attacks while flying. As an immediate action, when an opponent\
    \ attempts an attack against the aerial assaulter, he can attempt a Fly check\
    \ with a DC equal to the result of the attacker's attack roll. If he succeeds,\
    \ he can take a 5-foot step and gain a dodge bonus to his AC equal to his Dexterity\
    \ modifier. This movement doesn't negate the attack if the aerial assaulter remains\
    \ in range of the attacking enemy's reach at the end of the 5-foot step. If the\
    \ Fly check fails, the aerial assaulter does not move, does not gain an AC bonus,\
    \ and provokes an attack of opportunity from each creature that threatens him,\
    \ including the initial attacker. The aerial assaulter must be flying to use this\
    \ ability."

    \ bull rush, dirty trick, drag, grapple, reposition, and trip combat maneuver\
