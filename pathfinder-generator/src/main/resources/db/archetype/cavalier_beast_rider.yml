description: "The cavalier is defined not only by his dedication to his order or his\
  \ skill on the battlefield, but also by the special relationship he maintains with\
  \ his mount. Where some cavaliers are simply skilled with horses or well-trained\
  \ knights, the beast rider spends his life in constant pursuit of the most perfect\
  \ mount, forming bonds with greater, more powerful, and more exotic creatures."

  description: "At 1st level, a beast rider forms a bond with a strong, loyal companion\
    \ that permits him to ride it as a mount. This mount functions as a druid's animal\
    \ companion, using the beast rider's level as his effective druid level. The animal\
    \ chosen as a mount must be large enough to carry the beast rider (Medium or Large\
    \ for a Small character; Large or Huge for a Medium character). The beast rider\
    \ does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding his mount.\
    \ The mount is always considered combat trained, and begins play with Endurance\
    \ as a bonus feat. A beast rider's mount does not gain the share spells special\
    \ ability.\nEach time the beast rider increases in level, he can choose to select\
    \ a new, more impressive mount better suited to his increased power.\nSmall-sized\
    \ beast riders can choose a pony or wolf mount at 1st level. At 4th level, a Small\
    \ beast rider can also choose an allosaurus, ankylosaurus, arsinoitherium, aurochs,\
    \ bison, boar, brachiosaurus, elephant, glyptodon, hippopotamus, mastodon, megaloceros,\
    \ riding dog, giant snapping turtle, triceratops, or tyrannosaurus. At 7th level,\
    \ he can also choose a dinosaur (deinonychus or velociraptor).\nMedium beast riders\
    \ can choose a camel or horse mount at 1st level. At 4th level, a Medium beast\
    \ rider can also choose an allosaurus, ankylosaurus, arsinoitherium, aurochs,\
    \ bison, brachiosaurus, elephant, glyptodon, hippopotamus, lion, mastodon, megaloceros,\
    \ giant snapping turtle, tiger, triceratops, or tyrannosaurus as his mount. Additional\
    \ mounts might be available with GM approval.\nIn addition, a 7th-level or higher\
    \ Medium beast rider can select any creature whose natural size is Large or Huge,\
    \ provided that creature is normally available as a Medium-sized animal companion\
    \ at 7th level (like a bear). To generate statistics for such a mount, apply the\
    \ following modifications:\nSize Large Ability Scores Str +2, Dex â€“2, Con +2;\
    \ Increase the damage of each of the mount's natural attacks by one die size.\n\
    A beast rider cannot choose a mount that is not capable of bearing his weight,\
    \ that has fewer than four legs, or that has a fly speed (although the GM may\
    \ allow mounts with a swim speed in certain environments).\nAnytime a feat or\
    \ ability allows a mount to make a hoof attack, it can make a claw, slam, or other\
    \ analogous attack instead."
