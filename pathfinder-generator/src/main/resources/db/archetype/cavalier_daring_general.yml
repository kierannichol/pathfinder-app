  description: "A daring general gains a modified version of the Leadership feat at\
    \ 6th level, even if he doesn't meet the prerequisites. All followers that the\
    \ daring general gains as a result of this version of the Leadership feat can\
    \ only have levels in the warrior class. All cohorts that the daring general gains\
    \ from this ability must have levels only in classes that grant a full base attack\
    \ bonus (such as barbarian, fighter, paladin, or ranger), and must be at least\
    \ 4 levels lower than the daring general himself. However, at 12th level and 18th\
    \ level, the daring general gains an additional cohort (up to a maximum of three\
    \ cohorts at 18th level) and a number of additional followers equal to the number\
    \ of followers he gained from the Leadership feat (up to a maximum of triple his\
    \ normal number of followers at 18th level). When determining the kinds of cohorts\
    \ the daring general can attract, he treats his Leadership score as 3 lower for\
    \ each subsequent cohort (effectively taking a –3 penalty for the second cohort\
    \ and a –6 penalty for the third cohort).\nAdditionally, the daring general can\
    \ grant special roles to his cohorts, as outlined below.\nUnless otherwise stated,\
    \ only one cohort can fill any given role at any given time. Designating a cohort\
    \ as filling a special role requires a 24-hour ceremonial ritual.\nGroom: The\
    \ groom cares for the daring general's mount. She does not take an armor check\
    \ penalty on Ride checks while riding the cavalier's mount. Additionally, once\
    \ per day, the groom can spend 10 minutes preparing the daring general's mount\
    \ for battle. If she does, the mount's speed increases by 10 feet and its Dexterity\
    \ score increases by 2. These benefits last for 1 hour. Squire: The squire's main\
    \ task is to care for the daring general's arms and armor. If the squire aids\
    \ the daring general in donning his armor, it takes half as much time to don as\
    \ it would if someone else aided the daring general. Additionally, when the squire\
    \ is adjacent to the daring general, as a standard action, she can grant a +2\
    \ bonus to the daring general's AC against the first attack made against the daring\
    \ general before the squire's next turn. This counts as an application of the\
    \ aid another action, but the squire does not need to threaten the attacker in\
    \ question. Standard Bearer: The daring general's standard bearer can carry his\
    \ banner in his stead, granting the benefits of his banner ability (and later,\
    \ his greater banner ability) to all allies within 60 feet of the standard bearer.\
    \ If the standard bearer becomes unconscious or dead, she ceases to grant these\
    \ benefits.\nBeyond the rules noted above, if the daring general uses his followers\
    \ to create an army using the mass combat rules, that army starts with one extra\
    \ tactic of the daring general's choice and a +2 bonus to its morale score.\n\
    The daring general can assign each of his followers individually to serve as either\
    \ footmen or honor guards (described below). He does not need to assign either\
    \ role to a given follower, if he prefers. He can change the role of a follower\
    \ at any time, but it takes 1 day per level for the follower to change her tactics\
    \ to suit her new role.\nFollowers with a particular role must group together\
    \ with other followers with the same role to form an army in mass combat.\nFootman:\
    \ Each follower gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls, but takes a –2 penalty\
    \ to her AC and on saving throws. A footman unit gains a +2 bonus to its OM and\
    \ takes a –2 penalty to its DV in mass combat. Honor Guard: The follower gains\
    \ a +2 bonus to her AC and on saving throws, but takes a –2 penalty on attack\
    \ and damage rolls. An honor guard unit gains a +2 bonus to its DV and takes a\
    \ –2 penalty to its OM in mass combat."
