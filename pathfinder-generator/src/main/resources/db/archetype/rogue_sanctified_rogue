description: "The sanctified rogue serves a higher purpose, acting as a representative\
  \ of a church or cult, or following the tenets of a specific faith or deity. While\
  \ most sanctified rogues share the beliefs or ideals of the religions they represent,\
  \ not all of them are necessarily pious. A handful of disreputable holy thieves\
  \ serve purely as mercenaries. At the other end of spectrum, however, more sanctified\
  \ rogues adhere to the tenets of their faith with fanatical devotion. Regardless,\
  \ all seem blessed with the ability to call upon divine favor to aid them in times\
  \ of need."
