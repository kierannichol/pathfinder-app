  description: "At 1st level, a chameleon begins her career knowing that the secret\
    \ to disappearing lies in deceiving the senses of her observers. Every day she\
    \ gains a pool of stealth points equal to her ranks in Bluff. These points refresh\
    \ at the start of each day. Before making a Stealth check, she can choose to put\
    \ stealth points into the roll, gaining a bonus on Stealth checks equal to the\
    \ number of stealth points she puts into the roll. If she gains a bonus on Bluff\
    \ checks because of a feat (such as Skill Focus [Bluff ]), she adds a number of\
    \ points to her stealth pool equal to the bonus the feat grants."

  description: "At 3rd level, the chameleon chooses a single terrain from the ranger's\
    \ favored terrain class feature. While she is within that terrain, she can take\
    \ 10 on any Stealth check she can make within that terrain. When the chameleon\
    \ reaches 6th level, and every three levels thereafter, she chooses a new type\
    \ of terrain from the ranger's favored terrain list. She gains this ability with\
    \ the newly picked terrain.\nThis ability replaces trap sense.\nRogue Talents:\
    \ The following rogue talents complement the chameleon archetype: camouflage,\
    \ fast stealth, quick disguise, and terrain mastery."
