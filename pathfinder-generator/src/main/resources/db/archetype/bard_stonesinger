  description: "A stonesinger's bardic performance is a subsonic vibration that resonates\
    \ from his body and travels through solid rock. This vibration is subtle enough\
    \ to not be heard, though creatures with the tremorsense universal monster ability\
    \ can distinctly hear the stone song out to a range of 100 feet per bard level.\
    \ All allies within 30 feet of the stonesinger benefit from stone song, perceiving\
    \ the effect due to proximity. An allied creature with tremorsense benefits from\
    \ stone song as long as it's within the extended range, provided that there is\
    \ an unobstructed path of solid earth between the creature and stonesinger. Natural\
    \ and manufactured stone does not inhibit stone song's range. A stonesinger must\
    \ use Perform (song) or Perform (oratory) for this bardic performance."

  description: "As part of another bardic performance, a stonesinger can cause the\
    \ ground within 30 feet to tremble, throwing enemies off balance and causing them\
    \ to take a â€“1 circumstance penalty to AC as long as the stonesinger continues\
    \ performing. This penalty increases by 1 at 5th level and every 6 levels thereafter.\
    \ Creatures levitating or flying above the ground are unaffected by this ability."

  description: "At 8th level, a stonesinger causes the ground to shudder and buckle\
    \ with his song. All enemies within 30 feet of the stonesinger must succeed at\
    \ a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the stonesinger's level + his Charisma bonus)\
    \ when he begins a bardic performance or be knocked prone. Prone and flying creatures,\
    \ as well as creatures with the earth glide universal monster ability, are unaffected\
    \ by this performance."
