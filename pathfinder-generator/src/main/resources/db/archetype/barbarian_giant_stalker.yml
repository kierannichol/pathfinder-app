  description: "At 3rd level, a raging giant stalker can take a move action to erupt\
    \ into a violent or vulgar display directed at a single giant within 60 feet.\
    \ This display is infused with secret magical traditions that draw upon the Mammoth\
    \ Lords' ancestral enmities toward giants. A targeted giant must succeed at a\
    \ Will save (DC = 10 + half the giant stalker's barbarian level + the giant stalker's\
    \ Constitution modifier) or be compelled to focus its attacks on the giant stalker;\
    \ this ability can also affect non-giant creatures that are Large or larger, though\
    \ such creatures gain a +4 bonus on the Will save to resist the effect. This compulsion\
    \ ends if the giant stalker is out of sight or inaccessible to the giant's attacks.\
    \ While baited, a giant is distracted and enraged by the insults-a giant stalker\
    \ gains a +1 dodge bonus to her AC against any giant she has successfully baited.\
    \ Once baited, a giant remains baited for a number of rounds equal to the giant\
    \ stalker's Constitution modifier, or until the giant stalker's rage ends (whichever\
    \ comes first). If the giant stalker baits a different giant, any previously baited\
    \ giant is no longer baited. A giant that successfully saves against baiting is\
    \ immune to that giant stalker's giant baiter ability for 24 hours. This is a\
    \ language-dependent mind affecting effect.\nAt 6th level, a giant stalker can\
    \ bait two giants at once, and her AC bonus against baited giants increases to\
    \ +2. At 9th level, baiting giants becomes a swift action, and her AC bonus against\
    \ baited giants increases to +3. At 12th level, she can bait up to three giants\
    \ at once, and her AC bonus against baited giants increases to +4. At 15th level,\
    \ baiting giants becomes a free action, and her AC bonus against baited giants\
    \ increases to +5. At 18th level, a giant stalker can bait a number of giants\
    \ equal to 3 + her Constitution modifier, and her AC bonus against baited giants\
    \ increases to +6."
