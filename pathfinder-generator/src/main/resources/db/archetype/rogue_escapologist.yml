  description: "At 3rd level, an escapologist can attempt an Escape Artist check as\
    \ a full-round action to remove a mind-affecting effect currently affecting her.\n\
    The DC of this check is equal to the effect's original save DC + 20. She cannot\
    \ remove effects that do not allow a saving throw. She can attempt to escape even\
    \ if paralyzed or restrained, as long as she can take purely mental actions. She\
    \ can attempt this check against a particular effect once per round if the effect\
    \ is measured in rounds, once per minute if the effect is measured in minutes,\
    \ once per 10 minutes if the effect is measured in 10-minute intervals, and so\

  description: "At 8th level, as an immediate action, an escapologist can attempt\
    \ an Escape Artist check at a â€“10 penalty and apply the result in place of either\
    \ a failed Reflex save or her AC against an attack that would have hit her. If\
    \ she succeeds, her contortions let her avoid the attack or effect entirely. Using\
    \ this ability leaves the escapologist staggered until the end of her next turn.\
    \ If the escapologist can't become staggered, she can't use impossible escape."
