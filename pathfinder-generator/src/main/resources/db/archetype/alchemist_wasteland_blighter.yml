  description: "At 2nd level, the blighter can prepare extracts of the healing subschool\
    \ as if he had the infusion discovery and can choose to render any such extracts\
    \ inert and prepare other extracts to replace them (unlike infusions, which continue\
    \ to occupy the alchemist's daily extract slots until consumed or used). If the\
    \ blighter has the infusion discovery, or if he is also a chirurgeon, he can use\
    \ touch injection as a spell-like ability once per day as a standard action, but\
    \ only to absorb an infusion of the healing subschool."

    \ it as a swift action."

  description: "At 8th level, a blighter can end any effect affecting a creature that\
    \ could be reversed by break enchantment. To do so, the affected creature must\
    \ imbibe one of the blighter's infused extracts of the healing subschool of at\
    \ least 3rd level. The blighter must then attempt a caster level check as described\
    \ in break enchantment. If the blighter succeeds at the check, the creature is\
    \ free of the spell, curse, or effect. The blighter can also use this ability\
    \ to attempt to dispel primal magic events affecting a creature or an area. To\
    \ do so, the affected creature must imbibe an infused extract as described above,\
    \ and the blighter must attempt a caster level check against a DC equal to 11\
    \ + the primal magic event's CR. If he succeeds at the check, the primal magic\
    \ event ends as if the blighter had successfully used dispel magic. If the blighter\
    \ attempts to dispel a primal magic event affecting an area, as a standard action,\
    \ he must dump an infused extract of the healing subschool of at least 3rd level\
    \ onto an affected square. He then must attempt a caster level check against a\
    \ DC equal to 11 + the primal magic event's CR. If he succeeds at the check, the\
    \ primal magic event ends as if the blighter had successfully used dispel magic.\n\
    This ability replaces poison resistance +6 and the discovery gained at 8th level."
