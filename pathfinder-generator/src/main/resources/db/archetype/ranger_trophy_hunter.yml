name: "Trophy Hunter"
description: "Some rangers have taken up the mysteries of black powder in order to\
  \ become big game hunters. Finding firearms useful for taking down large and dangerous\
  \ prey, they enter the fight with the crack of black powder fire, often ranging\
  \ far and wide in their safaris and searches for ever-more-dangerous denizens of\
  \ the wild to track, study, appreciate--and kill. While this might strike some as\
  \ going against the ranger's usual respect for nature and the creatures of the wild,\
  \ trophy hunters understand that they are just more pieces in nature's grand puzzle,\
  \ and that the laws of the jungle--the right to kill and feed on those weaker than\
  \ you, and the need to establish dominance through cunning and bloodshed--are both\
  \ their rights and their duty as the current top of the food chain."

  description: "At 1st level, a trophy hunter gains a +2 bonus on Survival skill checks\
    \ when following or identifying tracks. When he tracks, he can also attempt a\
    \ Knowledge (nature) check at DC 15. On a success, the trophy hunter can discern\
    \ the type and condition of any animals or magical beasts he tracks. By studying\
    \ their tracks, the trophy hunter is able to identify a rough approximation of\
    \ their health, maneuverability, and their general behavior as compared to the\
    \ norm."
