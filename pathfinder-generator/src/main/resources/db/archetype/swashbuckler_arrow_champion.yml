    \ menacing swordplay, perfect thrust, stunning stab, and targeted strike deeds\
    \ when attacking with a bow, so long as her target is within 30 feet. If she spends\
    \ a panache point to increase the range of her precise aim ability, the increased\
    \ range applies to this ability as well."
