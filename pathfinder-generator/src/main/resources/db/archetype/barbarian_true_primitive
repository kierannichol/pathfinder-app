name: "True Primitive"
description: "Isolated and xenophobic tribes that dwell in areas untouched by civilization\
  \ often see anything from cities and organized settlements as strange, dangerous,\
  \ and decadent. They gain power from their truly primitive nature; their bodies\
  \ and spirits are hardened by the wild and untainted existence far from the pathetic\
  \ softness of so-called civilization. Even when forced to mingle with civilization,\
  \ the true primitive stays apart in both traditions and trappings."

  label: null
  type: null
  description: "A true primitive collects teeth, bones, hair, and other trophies from\
    \ vanquished enemies, representing their power and strength.\nAt 3rd level, a\
    \ true primitive can attach a trophy fetish to one of the traditional true primitive\
    \ weapons listed above. When wielding that weapon, the true primitive gains a\
    \ +1 morale bonus on damage rolls. Furthermore, if that weapon has the fragile\
    \ property, once per day, the true primitive can ignore the effects of a single\
    \ natural 1 roll. A trophy fetish can also be attached to a suit of hide or bone\
    \ armor, granting the true primitive a +1 morale bonus on saving throws. Furthermore,\
    \ if that armor has the fragile property, once per day, the true primitive can\
    \ chose not to have the armor break on the confirmation of a critical hit made\
    \ against her.\nEvery five levels beyond 3rd, a true primitive can use an additional\
    \ trophy fetish. Multiple trophy fetishes can be attached to the same armor or\
    \ weapon; their effects stack. A trophy fetish can be sundered (hardness 5, 1\
    \ hit point) but is not damaged by area attacks or attacks that do not specifically\
    \ target it. It has no effect if attached to other types of weapons or armor.\n\
    This ability replaces trap sense."
