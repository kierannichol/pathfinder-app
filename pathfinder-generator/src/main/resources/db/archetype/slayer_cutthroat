    \ study that foe to find its weaknesses. If a cutthroat can act in the surprise\
    \ round, once during that surprise round he can study a foe as a free action (instead\
    \ of a move action) and select it as his studied target."

    \ maneuver against a dead or unconscious target or a studied target he has just\
    \ confirmed a critical hit against. A dead or unconscious opponent takes a â€“10\
    \ penalty to its CMD against this maneuver.\nThis ability replaces the slayer\
    \ talent gained at 6th level.\nSlayer Talents: The following slayer talents (and\
    \ rogue talents) complement the cutthroat archetype: fast stealth, poison use*,\
    \ slowing strike*, surprise attack, and terrain mastery."
