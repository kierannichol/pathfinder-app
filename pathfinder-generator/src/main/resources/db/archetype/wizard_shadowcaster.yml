  description: "At 1st level, a shadowcaster uses his shadow to prepare additional\
    \ spells. He must spend his entire period of spell preparation in dim illumination\
    \ to use this ability. He may prepare a number of additional spell levels of spells\
    \ equal to the level of the highest-level wizard spell he can cast. For example,\
    \ if he can cast 6th-level wizard spells, he could prepare six 1st-level spells,\
    \ two 3rd level-spells, or any similar combination that adds up to a total of\
    \ six spell levels. These spells are stored in his shadow. He can only cast these\
    \ spells when he is in an area of normal light or dim light. He gains Shadowtongue\
    \ as a bonus language."

  description: "At 10th level, when a shadowcaster casts shades, shadow conjuration,\
    \ shadow evocation, and similar illusion spells that have a listed fraction of\
    \ the strength of real effects, he increases the percentage of damage caused by\
    \ the spell's effect or summoned creatures by one-fifth (+20%) against creatures\
    \ that make their saving throw against the effect, up to a maximum of 100% of\
    \ the strength. For example, shadow evocation and shadow conjuration deal 40%\
    \ normal damage on a successful save instead of 20%."
