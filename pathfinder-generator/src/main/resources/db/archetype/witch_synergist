  description: "At 1st level, a synergist gains the ability to meld or unmeld with\
    \ her familiar as a standard action. While the familiar is melded, its body becomes\
    \ part of the synergist's and can't be targeted or affected by any means (including\
    \ ongoing effects), though the familiar can still communicate its feelings empathically.\
    \ The symbiosis causes the synergist to adopt some basic physical features of\
    \ the familiar and grants additional abilities based on the synergist's level.\n\
    At 1st level, during symbiosis the synergist gains darkvision or low-light vision\
    \ if the familiar possesses it.\nAt 5th level, during symbiosis the synergist\
    \ gains any abilities the familiar possesses that are listed under beast shape\
    \ I, except flight.\nAt 8th level, during symbiosis the synergist gains any abilities\
    \ the familiar possesses that are listed under beast shape II. If the familiar\
    \ can fly, the synergist can fly for a total of 1 minute per witch level she possesses\
    \ per day while in symbiosis. This duration need not be consecutive, but it must\
    \ be spent in 1-minute intervals.\nAdditionally, during symbiosis the synergist\
    \ gains a single natural attack of a type possessed by its familiar.\nThe attack\
    \ deals 1d6 points of damage if a primary attack (1d6 for Small synergists) and\
    \ 1d4 points of damage if a secondary attack (1d3 for Small synergists).\nAt 11th\
    \ level, during symbiosis the synergist gains any abilities the familiar possesses\
    \ that are listed under beast shape III. If the familiar can fly, the synergist\
    \ can fly for an unlimited amount of time each day while in symbiosis.\nAt 14th\
    \ level, during symbiosis the synergist gains any abilities the familiar possesses\
    \ that are listed under beast shape IV. If the familiar has multiple natural attacks,\
    \ the synergist gains them all, rather than just one."
