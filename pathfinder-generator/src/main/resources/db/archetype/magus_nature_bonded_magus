  description: "A 4th level, when a nature-bonded magus is adjacent to his familiar,\
    \ he can merge with his familiar as a standard action; both the nature-bonded\
    \ magus and the familiar provoke attacks of opportunity with this action. Doing\
    \ so causes the plant familiar to bond with a part of the nature-bonded magus's\
    \ body as though it were growing on him. While merged, the nature-bonded magus's\
    \ familiar can take no actions (but can still attempt Perception checks and communicate\
    \ with the nature-bonded magus), and it can't be targeted or harmed by effects.\
    \ As long as his familiar is merged, the nature-bonded magus gains half his plant\
    \ familiar's natural armor adjustment to AC.\nThe nature-bonded magus can separate\
    \ from his plant familiar as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity\
    \ for both of them. Once they have separated, the familiar appears in an adjacent\
    \ square of the nature-bonded magus' choosing."
