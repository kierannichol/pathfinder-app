  description: "At 4th level, a fortune-finder can adapt and orient himself to new\
    \ environments and new enemies. He gains a +1 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge\
    \ (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks whenever he is in a terrain\
    \ he hasn't selected as one of his favored terrains. He leaves no trail and can't\
    \ be tracked in any such terrain (though he can leave a trail if he so chooses).\n\
    In addition to this, the fortune-finder can study an opponent he can see as a\
    \ move action. He then gains a bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive,\
    \ and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, as well as on weapon attack\
    \ and damage rolls against it. The bonus is equal to half the fortune-seeker's\
    \ highest favored enemy bonus. A fortune-finder can't attempt Knowledge checks\
    \ untrained to identify an opponent he has studied with adaptable study. Bonuses\
    \ from adaptable study don't stack with those from the favored enemy ability.\
    \ The ranger can study only a single target at a time."
