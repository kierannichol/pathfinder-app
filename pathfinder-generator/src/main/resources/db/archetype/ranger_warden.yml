description: "All rangers have a bond with the wilderness, but the warden may have\
  \ the strongest. This protector sits guard in the middle of the wilderness, keeping\
  \ a lookout for any dangers that might spill from the deeper wilderness beyond,\
  \ and protecting civilization from the savagery of nature--and vice versa. His long\
  \ weeks, months, and sometimes years of isolation cause him to â€œhear\"what the land\
  \ is saying. Not all are crazy."
