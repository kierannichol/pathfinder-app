    \ ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. Using\
    \ this ability does not expend uses of lay on hands, as it does with other paladins.\n\
    This ability replaces the standard paladin's channel positive energy ability."

  description: "At 11th level, a hospitaler can expend one use of her channel positive\
    \ energy ability to emit a 30-foot aura of healing for a number of rounds equal\
    \ to her paladin level. Allies in this aura (including the hospitaler) automatically\
    \ stabilize if below 0 hit points and are immune to bleed damage. In addition,\
    \ allies (including the paladin) that spend at least 1 full round inside the aura\
    \ are healed an amount of damage equal to their total number of Hit Dice and may\
    \ make a saving throw against any afflictions they are suffering from, such as\
    \ a curse, disease, or poison. This saving throw only counts toward curing the\
    \ affliction and does not impose any penalty on a failed save. Allies can only\
    \ be healed once by a use of this ability and they can only attempt additional\
    \ saving throws once per day, even if they are exposed to this aura multiple times."
