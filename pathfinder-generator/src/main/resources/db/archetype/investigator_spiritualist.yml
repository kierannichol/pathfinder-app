  description: "Instead of relying on alchemical research to find clues, a spiritualist\
    \ relies on communion with the world beyond death. At 1st level, a spiritualist\
    \ gains the ability to use comprehend languages, detect secret doors, and identify,\
    \ but each has a casting time of 1 minute, as the spiritualist needs to consult\
    \ with the spirits of the dead that dwell in his area or that are somehow attached\
    \ to him in some way. The spiritualist can use this ability a number of times\
    \ per day equal to his investigator level + his Wisdom modifier.\nAs he goes up\
    \ in level, the spiritualist gains the ability to use other spells with the casting\
    \ time as above. At 5th level, he can use augury. At 7th level, he can use speak\
    \ with dead and locate object. At 9th level, he can use legend lore. Each of these\
    \ requires one use of this ability."
