  description: "An engineer can create a mechanism, a small device that assists with\
    \ the execution of an activity. Creating a mechanism requires 1 minute of time\
    \ and expends 1 use from the engineer's inspiration pool. An engineer chooses\
    \ a skill to associate with the mechanism when he creates it. As an immediate\
    \ action, a mechanism can be activated to grant the engineer's inspiration die\
    \ on a check of the associated skill. An engineer can create a mechanism that\
    \ affects attack rolls or saving throws, but she expends 2 uses from her inspiration\
    \ pool to do so. Any creature can use a mechanism, but a creature can have only\
    \ 1 mechanism at a time, as multiple mechanisms interfere with each other while\
    \ in close proximity. A mechanism remains active for a number of minutes equal\
    \ to the engineer's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). At 5th level, an engineer's\
    \ mechanisms remain active for a number of minutes equal to the engineer's level.\
    \ At 11th level, an engineer's mechanisms remain active for a number of hours\
    \ equal to the engineer's level."

  description: "At 3rd level, an engineer gains a deeper understanding of constructs\
    \ and machines. He gains a +1 bonus on Knowledge (arcana) checks to identify constructs\
    \ and a +1 bonus on Knowledge (engineering) checks. This bonus increases by 1\
    \ at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter."
