  \ purify the self in the hope of gaining immortality by means of alchemical concoctions\
  \ and controlling vital energy. Internal alchemists develop unusual physical abilities\
  \ from heightened knowledge of how their bodies work."

  description: "At 1st level, the internal alchemist can control his breath and the\
    \ flow of vital energy within his body. Without preparation, he can hold his breath\
    \ for a number of minutes equal to his Constitution score (after this, he must\
    \ begin making Constitution checks or risk suffocation); by spending a full-round\
    \ action preparing himself, he can increase this duration to 1 hour per point\
    \ of Constitution. The alchemist can survive twice as long as normal without food\
    \ or water before he starts to take penalties. He can put himself into a state\
    \ of suspended animation as a move action, and is then unconscious and appears\
    \ completely dead; he awakens at a preset time or in response to a condition set\
    \ by him when he enters this state."

  description: "At 3rd level, an internal alchemist gains a bonus on all saving throws\
    \ against disease equal to his alchemist class bonus against poison. When he gains\
    \ the poison immunity alchemist class ability, he becomes immune to disease as\
    \ well.\nThis ability replaces swift alchemy."

  description: "Starting at 6th level, an internal alchemist can react to danger before\
    \ his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed,\
    \ nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. However,\
    \ he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized, or if an opponent\
    \ successfully uses the feint action (see Bluff ) against him. If the internal\
    \ alchemist already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically\
    \ gains improved uncanny dodge (as a rogue) instead.\nThis ability replaces swift\
    \ poisoning."
