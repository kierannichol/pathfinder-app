  description: "At 1st level, a leshy warden forms an intimate bond with a nature\
    \ spirit, incarnating the spirit as a leaf leshy. She gains a leaf leshy as a\
    \ familiar and treats her druid level as her effective wizard level for the purpose\
    \ of this ability. If the leshy dies, the leshy warden can incarnate the same\
    \ spirit again by paying the normal cost to replace a familiar. So long as the\
    \ leshy lives, the leshy warden gains access to the Plant domain as if through\
    \ a druid's nature bond class feature, but she can't choose the Decay subdomain."
