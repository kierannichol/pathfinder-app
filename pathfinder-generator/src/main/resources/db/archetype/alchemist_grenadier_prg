  description: "At 2nd level, a grenadier can infuse a weapon or piece of ammunition\
    \ with a single harmful alchemical liquid or powder, such as alchemist's fire\
    \ or sneezing powder, as a move action.\nThis action consumes the alchemical item,\
    \ but transfers its effect to the weapon in question. The alchemical item takes\
    \ full effect on the next creature struck by the weapon, but does not splash,\
    \ spread, affect additional targets, or benefit from any other effects that specifically\
    \ affect splash weapons. Any extra damage added is not doubled on a critical hit.\
    \ The alchemical treatment causes no harm to the weapon treated, and wears off\
    \ 1 minute after being applied if no blow is struck. Infusing a new alchemical\
    \ item also removes the effect of any alchemical liquid or powder previously applied\
    \ with this ability. At 6th level, a grenadier can use her alchemical weapon ability\
    \ as a swift action. At 15th level, this ability becomes a free action."

  description: "At 6th level, a grenadier can detonate a bomb so that it splashes\
    \ in a 20-foot cone rather than affecting a radius. The cone starts at the alchemist\
    \ and extends away from her in the direction she chooses. The alchemist designates\
    \ one creature in the squares affected by the cone to be the target of the bomb\
    \ and makes her attack roll against that creature; all other squares in the cone\
    \ take splash damage. If the alchemist has the explosive bomb discovery and throws\
    \ an explosive directed blast, the cone of splash damage is 30 feet long instead\
    \ of 20 feet."

  label: null
  type: null
  description: "At 10th level, a grenadier's bombs become particularly overwhelming\
    \ when they explode.\nWhenever a grenadier confirms a critical hit with a bomb,\
    \ the creature directly struck by that bomb is staggered for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful\
    \ Fortitude saving throw (DC equals the bomb's Reflex save DC to avoid splash\
    \ damage) reduces the duration to 1 round. The effects of this ability stack with\
    \ a frost bomb's staggering effect, but not with the effects of the Staggering\
    \ Critical feat. Additional critical hits with bombs add to any duration remaining\
    \ from previous ones."
