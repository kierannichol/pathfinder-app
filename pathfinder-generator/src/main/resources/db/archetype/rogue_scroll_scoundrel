description: "The scroll scoundrel is a rogue archetype that relies on cunning and\
  \ quick wits to stay alive. He excels in exploiting overconfidence and predictability,\
  \ using knowledge he's gained from his extensive research and field experience combined\
  \ with hearsay and recent observations to react to problems as soon as they arise\
  \ with swift but unnaturally accurate guesswork. A scroll scoundrel is often called\
  \ upon to undertake missions where killing a foe isn't nearly as important as humiliating\
  \ them in public duels or similar conflicts."

    \ the first 10 points, and at 20th level, the first 15 points. If the attack deals\
    \ any sneak attack damage, he ignores all of the foe's damage reduction or hardness\
    \ for that attack. He cannot use this ability on foes that are immune to critical\
    \ hits."
