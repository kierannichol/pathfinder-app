    \ fiery shards. This slays the eidolon and deals 1d6 points of damage per Hit\
    \ Die of the eidolon to every creature in a 20-foot-radius burst (Reflex half,\
    \ DC = 10 + 1/2 his summoner level + his Charisma modifier).\nHalf of this damage\
    \ is fire, and the other half is piercing.\nAt 12th level, the pyroclast can reduce\
    \ the damage by 4d6 to increase the burst radius to 40 feet. The pyroclast can\
    \ use this ability once per day."
