    \ I as a spell like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma\
    \ modifier. He can only use this ability to summon creatures of the animal, magical\
    \ beast, or vermin type. This ability otherwise functions as the summon monster\
    \ I class feature (increasing in level as the naturalist goes up in level and\
    \ with the same restrictions)."

  description: "At 4th level, as a swift action a naturalist can enhance his eidolon\
    \ with the aspect of an animal. Each time he uses this ability, he can select\
    \ a hunter's animal aspect and apply it to his eidolon. His hunter level for this\
    \ ability is equal to his summoner level â€“ 2. He does not gain the ability to\
    \ add an animal aspect to himself (see Shared Focus, below). This effect lasts\
    \ until the eidolon is dismissed or sent back to its home plane.\nWhen an animal\
    \ aspect is applied to an eidolon, its form is altered by superficial physical\
    \ changes appropriate to that aspect. For example, using aspect of the bat might\
    \ give the eidolon larger ears and eyes and perhaps membranes of skin connecting\
    \ its limbs to its body, while using aspect of the stag might give the eidolon\
    \ antlers and hoof like nails on its feat. None of these changes interfere with\
    \ any of the eidolon's natural or magical abilities."

    \ keeps this aspect until his eidolon is dismissed or sent back to its home plane.\
    \ The naturalist gains the effects of only one aspect, even if the eidolon gains\
