description: "Covenbane slayers are scarred by arcane magic at a young age, and that\
  \ resonance gives them supernatural insight into the psychic bonds between others.\
  \ They are adept at fighting tight-knit groups, exploiting their connections to\
  \ hunt and wound teams. The churches of Iomedae and Milani in particular dispatch\
  \ special agents to rescue hexed children from Irrisen, Razmiran, and other lands\
  \ plagued by abusive arcanists and then raise them in this deadly art."

  description: "A covenbane's magical scars throb in the presence of magic. A covenbane\
    \ adds half his level (minimum +1) on Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks\
    \ to identify, recognize, or track a hag, arcane spellcaster, or creature with\
    \ spell-like abilities. He can also use his hag sense to recognize whether someone\
    \ within 30 feet of him is using magic to hide her true form. To do this, he must\
    \ succeed at a Perception check against a DC equal to 15 + the target's CR; success\
    \ indicates the presence of a magical disguise, but it does not reveal the creature's\
    \ true form."

  description: "At 2nd level, a covenbane can designate an entire coven as his studied\
    \ target by studying any single member. He applies his studied target bonus against\
    \ all members of the studied creature's coven, and all members of the coven count\
    \ as one target for the purposes of determining the maximum number of studied\
    \ targets a slayer can maintain. This bonus remains even if one or more members\
    \ of the coven die after the covenbane studies them. Beginning at 7th level, the\
    \ covenbane can designate other magically linked creatures, such as those bound\
    \ by a hivemind or a telepathic bond spell, as a coven, but he can target only\
    \ three members of such a link. Studying a coven always requires a move action,\
    \ even if the slayer could normally study a target with a swift or immediate action."
