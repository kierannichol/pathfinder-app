  description: "At 2nd level, whenever a veneficus witch targets a single creature\
    \ with a hex, she can imbue her hex with a dose of injury or contact poison she\
    \ is holding. The DCs of her hex and the poison are each reduced by 2; if the\
    \ creature fails its save against the hex, the poison is expended and the creature\
    \ must succeed at a Fortitude save against the poison or become poisoned. At 10th\
    \ level, the DC of the witch's hex and poison are each reduced by only 1 and the\
    \ witch can imbue her hexes with inhaled and ingested poisons as well.\nThis ability\
    \ replaces the witch's 2nd- and 10th-level hexes.\nHexes: The following witch\
    \ hexes complement the veneficus witch archetype: blight, cauldron, disguise,\
    \ poison steep.\nMajor Hexes: The following major hexes complement the veneficus\
    \ witch archetype: cook people, witch's brew."
