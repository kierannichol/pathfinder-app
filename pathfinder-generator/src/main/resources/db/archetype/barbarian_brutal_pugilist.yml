    \ condition. She can make an attack of opportunity against creatures trying to\
    \ grapple her even if they possess the Improved Grapple feat or the grab special\
    \ attack. If she hits with this attack of opportunity, she gains a +2 circumstance\
    \ bonus to her CMD against the grapple attempt. She cannot make these attacks\
    \ of opportunity once a grapple has succeeded."

    \ to +2 if the barbarian is wearing no armor (shields are allowed). At every three\
    \ levels after 3rd, the barbarian may select another combat maneuver and add this\
    \ bonus on her CMB or to her CMD. This bonus can be applied to each maneuver no\
