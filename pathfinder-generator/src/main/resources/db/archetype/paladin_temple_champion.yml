  description: "At 5th level, a temple champion gains the minor blessing (as the warpriest\
    \ class feature) of the domain she selected at 4th level. She uses her paladin\
    \ level as her warpriest level for determining the effects of that blessing. Any\
    \ Wisdom-based aspects of that blessing instead use the temple champion's Charisma.\n\
    At 11th level, she gains the major blessing of her chosen domain."
