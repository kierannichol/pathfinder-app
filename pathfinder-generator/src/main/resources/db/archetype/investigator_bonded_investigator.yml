    \ familiar functions as the wizard arcane bond class feature, using the bonded\
    \ investigator's class level to determine the familiar's special abilities.\n\
    The bonded investigator's extracts are considered spells for the purposes of familiar\

  description: "At 4th level, a bonded investigator's familiar becomes a cunning assistant\
    \ to the investigator. The familiar can access the investigator's inspiration\
    \ pool to augment its own actions; the use of inspiration is deducted from the\
    \ investigator's number of daily uses as normal. The familiar can use the inspiration\
    \ ability (and gains the increased benefits of investigator talents that affect\
    \ the bonus dice used in this ability) but cannot expend uses of inspiration for\
    \ other purposes."
