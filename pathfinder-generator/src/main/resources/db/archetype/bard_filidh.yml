    \ day equal to the spell's level.\nIn addition, a filidh gains the following types\
    \ of bardic performances.\nEchoes of Nature's Song (Su) A filidh can use his bardic\
    \ performance to imbue his allies with subconscious knowledge of their own futures,\
    \ improving their reflexes and ability to avoid danger. An affected ally receives\
    \ a +1 insight bonus on Reflex saving throws and to AC. At 5th level and every\
    \ 6 bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of +4 at 17th\
    \ level. This performance is a mind-affecting ability and relies on audible components."
