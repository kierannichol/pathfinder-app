description: "An enlightened bloodrager unlocks a unique method of casting her violent,\
  \ rage-fueled spells. As a result, an enlightened bloodrager's magic looks, feels,\
  \ and functions quite differently from the magic of other bloodragers. In many cases,\
  \ when an enlightened bloodrager encounters a more traditional bloodrager, the meeting\
  \ is laced with tension and suspicion. The enlightened bloodrager is, of course,\
  \ well aware of the other bloodrager's tendency toward violence, and the other bloodrager\
  \ is often unnerved by the calm and reasoned mannerisms of his enlightened counterpart.\
  \ Many bloodragers even take offense at this demeanor, interpreting the enlightened\
  \ bloodrager as a pawn of intellectuals or as having dishonored her ancestry or\
  \ traditions by abandoning emotion and wrath. As one can well expect, such confrontations\
  \ rarely result in lasting friendships!"

  description: "An enlightened bloodrager's unusually sophisticated outlook on the\
    \ relationship between magic and emotional outbursts allows her to cast an expanded\
    \ array of spells. She gains the ability to know and cast 0-level spells, which\
    \ are cast like any other spells, but don't consume spell slots and can be used\
    \ again. At 4th level, she gains a number of 0-level spells known equal to those\
    \ of a bard whose level is 3 lower than her bloodrager level. She selects these\
    \ 0-level spells from the druid's list of 0-level spells.\nAt 4th level, the enlightened\
    \ bloodrager gains one 1st-level druid spell as a bonus spell known. At 7th level,\
    \ she gains one 2nd-level druid spell as a bonus spell known. At 10th level, she\
    \ gains one 3rd-level druid spell as a bonus spell known. At 13th level, she gains\
    \ one 4th-level druid spell as a bonus spell known.\nThe bloodrager treats any\
    \ druid spells she takes with this ability as bloodrager spells for the purposes\
    \ of other abilities, and adds them to her bloodrager class spell list. At 8th\
    \ level and every 3 spell levels thereafter, she can swap out these spells using\
    \ the normal rules for swapping out at a spell. If she chooses to swap out one\
    \ of her bonus druid spells, she must replace it with a druid spell of the same\
    \ level. Any swapped-out spells are removed from her bloodrager class spell list."
