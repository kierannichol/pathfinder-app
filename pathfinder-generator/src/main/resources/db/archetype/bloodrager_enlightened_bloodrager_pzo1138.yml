description: "An enlightened bloodrager unlocks a unique method of casting her
  violent, rage-fueled spells. As a result, an enlightened bloodrager's magic
  looks, feels, and functions quite differently from the magic of other
  bloodragers. In many cases, when an enlightened bloodrager encounters a more
  traditional bloodrager, the meeting is laced with tension and suspicion. The
  enlightened bloodrager is, of course, well aware of the other bloodrager's
  tendency toward violence, and the other bloodrager is often unnerved by the
  calm and reasoned mannerisms of his enlightened counterpart. Many bloodragers
  even take offense at this demeanor, interpreting the enlightened bloodrager as
  a pawn of intellectuals or as having dishonored her ancestry or traditions by
  abandoning emotion and wrath. As one can well expect, such confrontations
  rarely result in lasting friendships!"

    description: "An enlightened bloodrager's unusually sophisticated outlook on the
      relationship between magic and emotional outbursts allows her to cast an
      expanded array of spells. She gains the ability to know and cast 0-level
      spells, which are cast like any other spells, but don't consume spell
      slots and can be used again. At 4th level, she gains a number of 0-level
      spells known equal to those of a bard whose level is 3 lower than her
      bloodrager level. She selects these 0-level spells from the druid's list
      of 0-level spells.

      At 4th level, the enlightened bloodrager gains one 1st-level druid spell
      as a bonus spell known. At 7th level, she gains one 2nd-level druid spell
      as a bonus spell known. At 10th level, she gains one 3rd-level druid spell
      as a bonus spell known. At 13th level, she gains one 4th-level druid spell
      as a bonus spell known.

      The bloodrager treats any druid spells she takes with this ability as
      bloodrager spells for the purposes of other abilities, and adds them to
      her bloodrager class spell list. At 8th level and every 3 spell levels
      thereafter, she can swap out these spells using the normal rules for
      swapping out at a spell. If she chooses to swap out one of her bonus druid
      spells, she must replace it with a druid spell of the same level. Any
      swapped-out spells are removed from her bloodrager class spell list."

      normally granted at 1st level. At 12th level she gains the bloodline power
      normally granted at 4th level, at 16th level she gains the bloodline power
      normally granted at 8th level, and at 20th level she gains the bloodline
      power normally gained at 12th level. She still uses her full bloodrager
      level when making level-based calculations in regard to these abilities."
