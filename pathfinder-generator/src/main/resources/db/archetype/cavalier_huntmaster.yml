  description: "At 1st level, a huntmaster forms a close bond with an animal companion.\
    \ This animal companion functions as a druid's animal companion, using the cavalier's\
    \ level as his effective druid level. He can choose either a bird or a dog when\
    \ selecting his animal companion.\nThe huntmaster can have more than one animal\
    \ companion, but he must divide up his effective druid level between his companions\
    \ to determine the abilities of each companion. Each time a huntmaster's effective\
    \ druid level increases, he must decide how to allocate the increase among his\
    \ animal companions (including the option of adding a new 1st-level companion).\
    \ Once an effective druid level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot\
    \ be redistributed while that companion is in the huntmaster's service (he must\
    \ release a companion or wait until a companion dies to allocate its levels to\
    \ another companion). The share spells animal companion ability does not give\
    \ the huntmaster the ability to cast a single spell so that it affects all of\
    \ his animal companions.\nA huntmaster's animal companions gain a bonus on Survival\
    \ checks to follow tracks equal to 1/2 the cavalier's class level (minimum 1)."
