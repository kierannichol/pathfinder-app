description: "The free hand fighter specializes in the delicate art of handling a\
  \ single weapon in one hand while using his free hand to balance, block, tip, and\
  \ distract his opponents. While not a brawler, his open hand is as much a weapon\
  \ as a bow or blade. His fighting school benefits only apply when he is using a\
  \ one-handed weapon and carrying nothing in his other hand."
