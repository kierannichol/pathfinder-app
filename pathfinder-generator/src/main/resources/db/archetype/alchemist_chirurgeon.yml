  description: "At 2nd level, a chirurgeon's extracts of cure spells automatically\
    \ act as infusions, and can be used by non-alchemists. When a chirurgeon prepares\
    \ his extracts, he may choose to render any or all of his infused curatives inert\
    \ and prepare other extracts to replace them (unlike infusions, which continue\
    \ to occupy the alchemist's daily extract slots until consumed or used)."
