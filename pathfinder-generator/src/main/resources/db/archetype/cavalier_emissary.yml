description: "Cavaliers serve many roles on the battlefield, from bold leaders and\
  \ shock troops to dashing knights and mounted juggernauts. Some cavaliers, however,\
  \ focus more on speed and mobility than they do on the raw power of the mounted\
  \ charge. On foot or in the saddle, the emissary is usually first to meet the enemy,\
  \ with a pointed lance, a drawn sword, or terms for surrender."

  description: "At 20th level, an emissary learns to ride through the thick of combat,\
    \ striking and then moving away with blinding speed. Whenever the emissary is\
    \ mounted and takes the charge action, he can first move 10 feet and make a melee\
    \ attack. This first attack is not a charge, but a regular melee attack, and the\
    \ movement counts toward the total allowed movement for the round. After making\
    \ this attack, the emissary must still move in a straight line to reach the target\
    \ of his charge, and he takes a â€“5 penalty on the attack roll for the attack at\
    \ the end of his charge."
