    \ her goddess to imbue her with glory and make all who see it pay heed. A great\
    \ beam of sunlight shines down upon the skald, casting bright light in a 30-foot\
    \ radius, and allows the skald's raging song to function as the fascinate bardic\

  description: "At 5th level, a sunsinger skald can channel energy as a cleric once\
    \ per day to heal wounds or harm undead like a good-aligned cleric. When she does\
    \ so, she fills the area affected by the channeled energy with light, and can\
    \ outline creatures in the area of effect as per faerie fire. The sunsinger uses\
    \ her skald level as her effective cleric level when channeling positive energy.\
    \ Undead who are particularly harmed by sunlight take a â€“2 penalty on saving throws\
    \ against this channeled energy, and take 1 additional point of damage per die\
    \ of damage dealt by the effect.\nAt 11th level, a sunsinger can channel energy\
    \ twice per day. At 17th level, she can use this ability three times per day."
