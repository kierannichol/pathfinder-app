  description: "A sorrowsoul draws upon grief, rage, and tragedy to fuel his bardic\
    \ performances. When a sorrowsoul begins a bardic performance, he can choose to\
    \ alter its effects with lyric sorrow. If he does so, he uses twice the number\
    \ of rounds of his bardic performance ability as normal, and even if the sorrowsoul\
    \ has the Lingering Performance feat, the performance's effects do not last for\
    \ any additional rounds.\nAt 1st level, a sorrowsoul can use his lyric sorrow\
    \ in conjunction with inspire courage. When he chooses to do so, he increases\
    \ his bonuses on saving throws and on weapon attack and damage rolls from +1 to\
    \ +2, but his other allies receive no benefit. His bonuses when using lyric sorrow\
    \ with inspire courage increase by 2 at 5th level and every 6 bard levels thereafter,\
    \ to a maximum of +8 at 17th level.\nAt 12th level, a sorrowsoul can use his lyric\
    \ sorrow ability in conjunction with inspire greatness to grant himself 3 bonus\
    \ Hit Dice, a +3 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +2 competence bonus on\
    \ Fortitude saves; if he does so, inspire greatness only affects him, not any\
    \ other allies.\nAt 15th level, a sorrowsoul can use his lyric sorrow ability\
    \ in conjunction with the inspire heroics bardic performance. When using the lyric\
    \ sorrow version of this performance, a sorrowsoul gains fast healing 5 and benefits\
    \ from a 50% miss chance, as if under the effects of displacement, in addition\
    \ to the standard bonuses conferred by this bardic performance, but if he does\
    \ so, inspire heroics only affects him, not any other allies."
