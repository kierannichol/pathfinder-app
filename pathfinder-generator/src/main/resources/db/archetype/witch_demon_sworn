  description: "At 6th level, the demon-sworn gains Improved Familiar as a bonus feat.\
    \ The associated familiar is made up of the tiny amount of soul matter lost when\
    \ the demon-sworn made her pact with demonic powers. The familiar must be a quasit,\
    \ regardless of the demon-sworn's actual alignment, and it manifests by eating\
    \ its way out of the demon-sworn's former familiar. The quasit knows all spells\
    \ known to the previous familiar. It loyally serves the demon-sworn, despite any\
    \ conflicts of alignment, obeying its mistress to the best of its abilities.\n\
    This familiar cannot be replaced, and if slain, the ritual to replace the lost\
    \ familiar recreates the same quasit, along with the same spells previously known.\
    \ Replacing the familiar in this fashion also imparts the demon-sworn with 1 permanent\
    \ negative level, as if she had been hit by an energy-draining creature."
