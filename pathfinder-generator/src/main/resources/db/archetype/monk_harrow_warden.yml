  description: "At 1st level, the harrow warden can make an unarmed strike against\
    \ a target and curse the creature with bad luck. Foes damaged by an idiot strike\
    \ must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wisdom\
    \ modifier) or become jinxed. A jinxed creature must roll twice whenever it attempts\
    \ an attack roll, a saving throw, a skill check, or a caster level check for 1\
    \ round, taking the lower result in each instance. The harrow warden can use idiot\
    \ strike once per day per monk level. She must declare that she is using an idiot\
    \ strike before making the attack roll; thus, a failed roll wastes the attempt.\n\
    At 4th level and again at 12th level, the jinx effect lasts an additional round.\n\
    At 16th level, a harrow warden can expend two uses of idiot strike to instead\
    \ curse her target as the bestow curse spell."
