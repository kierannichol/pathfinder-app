  description: "A sea singer gains the following types of bardic performance:\nSea\
    \ Shanty (Su): A sea singer learns to counter seasickness and exhaustion during\
    \ long sea voyages. Each round of a sea shanty, he makes a Perform skill check.\
    \ Allies within 30 feet (including the sea singer) may use his Perform check in\
    \ place of a saving throw against becoming exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, or\
    \ sickened; if already under such an effect, a new save is allowed each round\
    \ of the sea shanty, using the bard's Perform check for the save. A sea shanty\
    \ has no effect on instantaneous effects or effects that do not allow saves. This\
    \ ability requires audible components.\nThis performance replaces countersong.\n\
    Still Water (Su): At 3rd level, a sea singer can use performance to calm rough\
    \ waters within 30 feet, reducing the DC for Profession (sailor) and Swim checks,\
    \ as well as for Acrobatics and Climb checks aboard ship, by an amount equal to\
    \ the bard's level (to a minimum of DC 10) for as long he continues to perform.\
    \ He can extend this duration to 1 hour by playing for 10 consecutive rounds.\
    \ This ability requires audible components.\nThis performance replaces inspire\
    \ competence.\nWhistle the Wind (Su): A sea singer of 6th level or higher can\
    \ use performance to create a gust of wind. This wind lasts for as long as he\
    \ continues his performance. He can extend this duration to 1 minute by playing\
    \ for 5 consecutive rounds.\nThis performance replaces suggestion.\nCall the Storm\
    \ (Su): At 18th level, a sea singer can use performance to duplicate control water,\
    \ control weather, control winds, or storm of vengeance, using his bard level\
    \ as the caster level. Using this ability requires 1 round of continuous performance\
    \ per level of the spell (as if he were a druid). These effects continue for as\
    \ long as the bard continues performing (the effects of control weather happen\
    \ immediately), but not longer than the spell's normal duration."

    \ He can reroll a check against one of these skills, but must take the result\
    \ of the second roll even if it is worse. He can reroll one additional time per\
    \ day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.\nThis ability replaces bardic\
