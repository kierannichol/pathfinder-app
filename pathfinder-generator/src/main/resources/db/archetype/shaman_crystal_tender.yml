  description: "A crystal tender forms a mystic connection with the precious stones\
    \ and gems she has sworn to protect. Her spirit animal always appears to be composed\
    \ of a crystalline substance and gains a +2 bonus to its natural armor. Her spirit\
    \ animal is treated as an outsider with both the earth and native subtypes, and\
    \ counts as a crystalline creature for the purposes of spells and abilities. The\
    \ unique nature of her spirit animal increases the cost of replacing it to 750\
    \ gp per shaman level."

  description: "At 4th level, a crystal tender learns to form a temporary bond with\
    \ a spirit of crystal. When selecting her wandering spirit, she can forgo gaining\
    \ a spirit ability to instead grant herself and her spirit animal DR 1/adamantine\
    \ as long as they're within 10 feet of one another. While benefiting from this\
    \ ability, the crystal tender's skin takes on a crystalline sheen. The DR gained\
    \ from this ability increases to 2/ adamantine at 8th level, 3/adamantine at 12th\
    \ level, 4/adamantine at 16th level, and 5/adamantine at 20th level."

  description: "At 8th level, both a crystal tender and her spirit animal gain all\
    \ of the benefits of any ioun stones worn by one another, as long as they're within\
    \ 100 feet of each other. The crystal tender's spirit animal can also embed a\
    \ number of ioun stones equal to the crystal tender's Charisma modifier into its\
    \ crystalline form. Embedded ioun stones don't gain any additional abilities,\
    \ save that they don't orbit the spirit animal and can't be separately targeted.\
    \ A slain or unconscious spirit animal immediately loses all embedded ioun stones,\
    \ which tumble to the ground beside its body."

    \ her body into a living gemstone as per iron body with a duration of 12 hours.\
    \ Instead of being vulnerable to effects that can harm an iron golem while in\
    \ this form, she is vulnerable to effects that can harm a crystalline creature\
    \ (such as shatter). She can use this ability once per day."
