description: "Changing an eidolon's evolutions is normally a slow process. As a summoner\
  \ progresses in levels, his control over his eidolon's abilities increases. But\
  \ an evolutionist possesses greater power over his eidolon's form, and is able to\
  \ evolve his eidolon and its abilities to meet any challenge or face any threat\
  \ as it comes up, seemingly on a whim."
