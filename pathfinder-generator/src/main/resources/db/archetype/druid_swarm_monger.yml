  description: "A swarm monger bonds with an urban familiar, treating her druid level\
    \ as her wizard level for the purposes of determining her familiar's abilities.\n\
    The swarm monger must select her familiar from the following options: cat, house\
    \ centipede, rat, raven, or scarlet spider. The fecund familiar gains the benefits\
    \ of its master's child of pollution, shadowy opportunist, and venom immunity\
    \ class abilities.\nAs a standard action, a swarm monger can cause her familiar\
    \ to burst forth into a full swarm of identical creatures, filling four contiguous\
    \ 5-foot squares and gaining temporary hit points equal to half its master's maximum\
    \ hit points. While in swarm form, the familiar loses the improved evasion, share\
    \ spells, deliver touch attack, and scry on familiar special abilities. It uses\
    \ its normal AC, saving throws, and skill bonuses, and it gains the swarm subtype\
    \ and the ability to make swarm attacks (dealing 1d6 points of damage at 1st level\
    \ and using the swarm monger's druid level as the swarm's Hit Dice to determine\
    \ damage increases as per the swarm subtype). The swarm monger is immune to her\
    \ own familiar's swarm attack.\nBeginning at 5th level, any creature damaged by\
    \ a fecund familiar's swarm attack must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC\
    \ = 10 + 1/2 the swarm monger's druid level + the swarm monger's Wisdom modifier)\
    \ or be sickened for 1d6 rounds. At 12th level, creatures that fail their Fortitude\
    \ saving throws instead become nauseated.\nA swarm monger can transform her familiar\
    \ into a swarm a number of times each day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum\
    \ 1), and the transformation lasts for 1 minute per druid level, or until the\
    \ swarm monger reverts her familiar back to a singular form as a standard action.\
    \ A fecund familiar cannot be reduced in size to Diminutive or smaller when in\
    \ swarm form."
