  description: "A runesage can use her knowledge of runes to create a runic focus,\
    \ a small, semiprecious stone engraved with runes that she manipulates to alter\
    \ her spellcasting abilities. In function, a runic focus behaves like an ioun\
    \ stone. To activate a runic focus, the runesage must meditate on it as she prepares\
    \ her spells. Following spell preparation, she tosses the gemstone into the air,\
    \ after which it orbits around her head. A runic focus remains in orbit until\
    \ the next time the runesage prepares her spells. A runic focus automatically\
    \ functions as a runesage's bonded object.\nA runesage does not have the option\
    \ to specialize in an arcane school-all runesages must be universalists. However,\
    \ when a runesage creates a runic focus, she must choose one Sin school of magic.\
    \ When she prepares her spells, she is treated as a Sin Magic Specialist of her\
    \ runic focus's school for the purposes of determining what spells she can prepare\
    \ (including gaining two additional spell slots per spell level of her school,\
    \ and being unable to prepare spells from her runic focus's two opposition schools).\
    \ She does not gain the corresponding powers of that school, however, and always\
    \ functions as a universalist wizard in this regard.\nA runic focus allows the\
    \ runesage to augment spells of a single arcane school to which the runic focus\
    \ is aligned. As long as a runic focus remains activated, the runesage doesn't\
    \ require material components for any spell she casts from the runic focus's aligned\
    \ arcane school, provided the component's cost never exceeds 10 gp x the runesage's\
    \ caster level. If the spell requires a material component that surpasses the\
    \ cost limit, the runesage must have the material component on hand to cast the\
    \ spell, as normal.\nA runic focus has an AC of 24, 10 hit points, and hardness\
    \ 5, as per an ioun stone. While the first runic focus a runesage creates is free,\
    \ replacement runic foci can be created using the standard rules for replacing\
    \ a bonded object for a wizard's arcane bond. When a runesage creates a new runic\
    \ focus, she can focus it on a different school of Sin magic than her previous\
    \ focus as long as the new school is not one that was an oppositional school from\
    \ her previous focus. For example, a runesage with a runic focus on necromancy\
    \ could abandon that focus and replace it with a new focus on any school other\
    \ than abjuration and enchantment (as these two schools are opposition schools\
    \ to Sin necromancy)."
