  description: "At 1st level, a vivisectionist gains the sneak attack ability as a\
    \ rogue of the same level. If a character already has sneak attack from another\
    \ class, the levels from the classes that grant sneak attack stack to determine\
    \ the effective rogue level for the sneak attack's extra damage dice (so an alchemist\
    \ 1/rogue 1 has a +1d6 sneak attack like a 2nd-level rogue, an alchemist 2/rogue\
    \ 1 has a +2d6 sneak attack like a 3rd-level rogue, and so on)."
