name: "Bladebound"
description: "A select group of magi are called to carry a black blade--a sentient\
  \ weapon of often unknown and possibly unknowable purpose. These weapons become\
  \ valuable tools and allies, as both the magus and weapon typically crave arcane\
  \ power, but as a black blade becomes more aware, its true motivations manifest,\
  \ and as does its ability to influence its wielder with its ever-increasing ego."
