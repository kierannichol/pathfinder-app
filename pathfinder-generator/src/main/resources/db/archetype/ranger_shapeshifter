  description: "At 3rd level, the shapeshifter can take on the aspects of a wild creature\
    \ once per day as a swift action. He can remain in this form for a number of rounds\
    \ equal to his Ranger level + his Wisdom modifier. While in one of his shifter's\
    \ blessing forms, the Ranger gains the shapeshifter subtype. The shapeshifter\
    \ must choose one of the following forms. Once this choice is made, it cannot\
    \ be changed.\nForm of the Bear: The Ranger's muscles enlarge and tighten, and\
    \ his facial features become more ursine. While in this form, the Ranger gains\
    \ a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, but his base speed becomes 20 feet.\nForm\
    \ of the Cat: The Ranger's muscles become lean and defined, and his gait more\
    \ deliberate and graceful. While in this form, the Ranger increases his base speed\
    \ by 10 feet, and he gains a +4 bonus on Acrobatics and Climb checks.\nForm of\
    \ the Dragon: The Ranger's skin becomes rough and scaly. While in this form, the\
    \ Ranger gains a +2 natural armor bonus to AC.\nForm of the Eagle: The Ranger's\
    \ skin stretches, his nose becomes hooked, and his eyes enlarge. While in this\
    \ form, the Ranger gains a +10 bonus on Perception checks.\nForm of the Jackal:\
    \ The Ranger becomes thin and hyperactive, his movements taking on a nervous spryness.\
    \ While in this form, the Ranger can spend a move action to move up to 1/2 his\
    \ speed without provoking attacks of opportunity.\nForm of the Otter: The Ranger's\
    \ hands and feet grow webs, and his body grows an oily fur that is water resistant.\
    \ While in this form, the Ranger gains a swim speed of 30 feet and a +8 bonus\
    \ on Swim checks.\nAt 8th level and again every five levels thereafter, the Ranger\
    \ may select an additional form for his shifter's blessing and may use this ability\
    \ one additional time per day. This is not a polymorph ability; a Ranger with\
    \ shifter's blessing in one of his shifted forms can be affected by a polymorph\
    \ ability and retain his bonus and Traits gained by the class feature.\nThis ability\
    \ replaces favored terrain."
