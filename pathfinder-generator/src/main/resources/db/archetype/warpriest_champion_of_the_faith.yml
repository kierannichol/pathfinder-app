  description: "At 1st level, a champion of the faith gains the sacred weapon class\
    \ feature as normal. However, this ability does not grant the 4th-level ability\
    \ to enhance the champion of the faith's weapon with divine power, nor does it\
    \ grant any subsequent increases to that ability. Instead, at 4th level, any sacred\
    \ weapon wielded by a champion of the faith counts as having his chosen alignment\
    \ for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.\nAt 12th level, once per day\
    \ as a swift action, a champion of the faith can enhance any one sacred weapon\
    \ with a weapon special ability based on his chosen alignment (anarchic for chaos,\
    \ unholy for evil, holy for good, and axiomatic for law). This effect lasts for\
    \ 1 minute. He can use this ability one additional time per day at 16th and 20th\
    \ levels."

  type: null
  description: "At 4th level, a champion of the faith can focus his powers against\
    \ his chosen foes. As a swift action, the champion of the faith chooses one target\
    \ within sight to smite. If this target is of his opposed alignment, the champion\
    \ of the faith adds his Charisma bonus (if any) to his attack rolls and adds his\
    \ warpriest level to all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If\
    \ the target of his smite is an outsider with the subtype corresponding to his\
    \ opposed alignment, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases\
    \ to 2 points of damage per warpriest level the champion of the faith possesses.\
    \ Regardless of the target, smite attacks automatically bypass any DR the target\
    \ possesses.\nIn addition, while smite is in effect, the champion of the faith\
    \ gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against\
    \ attacks made by the target of the smite. If the smite targets a creature that's\
    \ not of the champion of the faith's opposed alignment, the smite is wasted with\
    \ no effect.\nThe smite effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or\
    \ the next time the champion of the faith regains spells. The champion of the\
    \ faith can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day for\
    \ every 4 levels beyond 4th (to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level).\
    \ Using this ability consumes two uses of his fervor ability."
