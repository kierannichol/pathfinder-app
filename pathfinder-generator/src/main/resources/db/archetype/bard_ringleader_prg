  description: "A ringleader gains an altered version of inspire competence that grants\
    \ greater effects at higher levels.\nInspire Competence (Su): At 3rd level, a\
    \ ringleader can use his performance to help an ally succeed at a task. This ability\
    \ acts as the inspire competence bardic performance with the following additions.\n\
    At 8th level, the ringleader's ally gains a competence bonus on an additional\
    \ skill (for a total of two skills). In addition, he can end the effect to reroll\
    \ a check with one of the affected skills (the reroll still applies the bonus\
    \ from inspire competence). Each ally can only use this latter ability once per\
    \ day, regardless of the number of skills affected and the number of times they\
    \ are affected by inspire competence. At 14th level, the ringleader's ally gains\
    \ a competence bonus on an additional skill (for a total of three skills). In\
    \ addition, he can take 10 on the affected skills when stressed or distracted."

  description: "At 2nd level, a ringleader can alter his performance so it affects\
    \ a single ally at a later time. The ringleader must explain his plan to that\
    \ ally for a number of minutes equal to the number of bardic performance rounds\
    \ he expends on the effect, and use audible and/or visual components according\
    \ to the performance altered.\nThis costs the ringleader the chosen number of\
    \ rounds of bardic performance.\nAt any time before the ringleader recovers bardic\
    \ performance rounds for the day, the inspired character can activate the performance\
    \ as a standard action wherever she is. When activated, the altered performance\
    \ affects only the inspired ally and has no audible or visible components. If\
    \ the performance could normally affect any number of allies, its effects last\
    \ 2 rounds for each round the ringleader spent on the performance. Otherwise,\
    \ the effects last 1 round for each round the ringleader spent on the performance.\n\
    A ringleader can alter only the countersong, distraction, inspire courage, inspire\
    \ competence, inspire greatness, and inspire heroics performances in this way.\
    \ The ringleader makes any necessary choices when establishing the performance,\
    \ though in the case of countersong and distraction, the ringleader attempts Perform\
    \ checks once his ally triggers the plan, ignoring any temporary bonuses or penalties,\
    \ no matter whether they applied when he explained the plan or when the ally triggers\
    \ it.\nA character can be subject to only one inspired plan at a time and cannot\
    \ be subject to a ringleader's inspired plan and any of the ringleader's normal\
    \ performances at the same time, but she can benefit from other bardic performances\
    \ in the interim. The ringleader cannot use inspired plan on himself, but he can\
    \ have dormant plans ready to trigger on as many different allies as he can afford\
    \ to affect at once."

  description: "At 5th level, a ringleader expects the unexpected. When the ringleader\
    \ is in a situation where he could use a particular piece of non-magical gear,\
    \ the ringleader can attempt a Knowledge check appropriate to his current situation\
    \ to have purchased that item in advance. The DC of the check is equal to the\
    \ item's cost in gp. If he succeeds, he deducts the appropriate cost of the item\
    \ from his current gp total and now has the item in question on his person. He\
    \ cannot use this ability to retroactively gain an item that would change his\
    \ encumbrance to a different load category, though in this case, he can attempt\
    \ to retrieve such objects from a pack mule, extradimensional storage space, or\
    \ other location that would not affect his encumbrance. He can use this ability\
    \ once per day at 5th level, plus one additional time per day for every 5 bard\
    \ levels beyond 5th."
