    \ whether the bard receives a bonus from his teamwork feats. His allies do not\
    \ receive any bonuses from these feats unless they actually possess the feats\
    \ themselves. The allies' positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites\
    \ listed in the teamwork feat for the bard to receive the listed bonus."

  description: "An arbiter of 8th level or higher can use his performance to improve\
    \ the attitudes of nearby creatures by two steps. To be affected, a creature must\
    \ be within 30 feet and able to hear the bard. Creatures whose attitude toward\
    \ the bard becomes indifferent or better immediately cease attacking the bard\
    \ and his allies, but may otherwise act as they please.\nThe effect persists for\
    \ as long as the creature is within 30 feet and the bard continues his performance.\
    \ The effect ends if one of the bard's allies attacks the creature. A successful\
    \ Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma modifier)\
    \ negates the effect. Ritual of reconciliation relies on audible components."
