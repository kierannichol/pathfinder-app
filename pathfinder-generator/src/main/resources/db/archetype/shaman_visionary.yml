  description: "At 4th level, the shaman can determine what type of spellcasting expertise\
    \ a creature possesses by studying the creature for 2 rounds with detect magic\
    \ or any of the following spells: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, or detect\
    \ law (if the creature belongs to the alignment). This ability tells the visionary\
    \ what bloodlines, domains, hexes, schools, or mysteries (if any) the creature\
    \ possesses. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect (DC = 10 + 1/2\
    \ the shaman's level + the shaman's Wisdom modifier). A creature affected by this\
    \ ability cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours. This ability functions\
    \ through magical sensors as with clairaudience/clairvoyance and scrying."

  description: "At 6th level, the visionary becomes more adept at divination magic.\
    \ When she casts the augury spell, her chance for an accurate answer is automatically\
    \ the maximum of 90%. Likewise, when she casts divination, she has the maximum\
    \ 90% chance of an accurate answer.\nFinally, the visionary can prepare scrying\
    \ as a 4th-level spell, and it requires only 1 minute to cast. The visionary also\
    \ has a 10% chance per caster level to cast the spells listed in the scrying spell\
    \ description, instead of 5% per caster level (to a maximum of 100%).\nThe visionary\
    \ must still prepare these spells to receive these benefits."

    \ spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic, along with vision\
    \ spirit magic and her original spirit. At 20th level, she gains the abilities\
    \ listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit."
