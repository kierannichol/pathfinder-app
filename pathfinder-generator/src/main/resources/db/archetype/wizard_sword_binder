  description: "A sword binder can send his bound sword to strike his foes. He gains\
    \ the hand of the apprentice ability of the universalist school, but can use that\
    \ ability only with his bound sword. His range with the ability is close (25 feet\
    \ + 5 feet per 2 wizard levels he possesses), and he can use it a number of times\
    \ per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier + 1/2 his level.\nAt 5th level,\
    \ whenever the sword binder casts a spell with a range of touch from the wizard\
    \ spell list, he can use his bonded sword to deliver the touch attack, including\
    \ expending a daily use of hand of the apprentice to make the touch attack at\
    \ range. This occurs as part of the same action as casting the spell. He gains\
    \ all the attack bonuses that apply to his sword (including enhancement bonuses\
    \ and relevant feats), but does not add his sword's damage or effects to the touch\
    \ spell.\nAt 8th level, when a sword binder casts a ranged touch spell or activates\
    \ this ability to cast a touch spell through it, he can send his bound sword to\
    \ deliver the spell and strike the target in one motion. Rather than a touch attack,\
    \ he makes a ranged attack with the sword. If the sword hits, it deals normal\
    \ weapon damage for hand of the apprentice and the spell automatically hits that\
    \ target. If the sword misses, the spell lingers on the weapon and the sword binder\
    \ can attempt to deliver the spell again by activating this ability as a standard\
    \ action. If the sword binder drops or sheaths the weapon with the spell's charge\
    \ still held, the charge dissipates to no effect."

  description: "At 10th level, a sword binder can control his bound sword (and only\
    \ his sword) as per the sustained force option of telekinesis. While the sword\
    \ is flying in this way, the sword binder can monitor the area around the sword\
    \ with clairaudience/clairvoyance as a swift action.\nThis ability can be used\
    \ once per day at 10th level, and an additional time per day at 15th level and\
    \ again at 20th level.\nThis ability can be used for 2 rounds per sword binder\
    \ level each day."
