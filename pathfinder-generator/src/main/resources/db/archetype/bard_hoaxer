  description: "A hoaxer can use his performance to coax a bit of luck (good or bad)\
    \ into a valuable-seeming object. As a standard action that provokes attacks of\
    \ opportunity, the hoaxer can use 1 round of bardic performance to invest a single\
    \ object in his possession with a hex he knows. This object must be light enough\
    \ to hold in one hand, and cannot already have any magical properties. The object\
    \ remains hexed as long as the hoaxer continues to spend 1 round of bardic performance\
    \ each round as a swift action to maintain it, until the hoaxer drops the item,\
    \ or until triggered.\nThe hex triggers immediately upon being willingly accepted\
    \ by another creature, targeting its new owner. A bad deal cannot be forced on\
    \ a creature or slipped into its possession without its knowledge, but a hoaxer\
    \ can lie or cheat to convince his mark to accept the object, or use spells like\
    \ beguiling gift.\nAt 1st level, the hoaxer knows one witch hex from the following\
    \ list: blight, charm, evil eye, fortune, healing, misfortune, slumber, or unnerve\
    \ beasts.\nAt 3rd level and every 3 bard levels thereafter, he can learn one additional\
    \ hex. The save DC for a hoaxer's hexes is equal to 10 + 1/2 the hoaxer's bard\
    \ level + his Charisma modifier. These hexes function identically to witch hexes,\
    \ except they can only target single creatures, and the hoaxer can only use his\
    \ hexes by investing them into objects.\nIf the hoaxer learns hexes from any other\
    \ source (such as the witch class), he cannot invoke them into an object."
