    At 2nd level, she gains the quick disguise rogue talent, and she can create a\
    \ disguise twice as quickly as normal even for that rogue talent (she can create\
    \ a disguise that encompasses only minor details as a standard action)."

  description: "At 10th level, a master of disguise gains the master of disguise advanced\
    \ rogue talent and can use it an unlimited number of times per day. Because she\
    \ must still don a physical disguise to gain this bonus, it doesn't stack with\
    \ the bonuses from spells like alter self and disguise self, but since it is completely\
    \ non-magical, it is more reliable when scrutinized under magical detection."
