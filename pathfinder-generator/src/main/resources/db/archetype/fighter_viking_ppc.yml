description: "The sagas of the northern people are filled with stories of mighty warriors\
  \ sailing south to raid the peoples of warmer climes and returning with longships\
  \ filled with plunder. The northerners call these warriors vikings, and their deeds\
  \ are sung in the longhouses during the long winter nights. A viking strikes fear\
  \ into the heart of her foes, and in battle can fly into a terrible rage. Many vikings\
  \ wear the pelts of bears or wolves, drawing on the strength and ferocity of these\
  \ beasts in battle. Vikings do not wear heavy armor, but are skilled at fighting\
  \ with an ax or spear in conjunction with a shield."
