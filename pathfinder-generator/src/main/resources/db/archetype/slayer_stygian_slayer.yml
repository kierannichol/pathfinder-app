    \ increments.\nThis ability replaces the advanced slayer talent gained at 10th\
    \ level.\nSlayer Talents: The following slayer talents (and rogue talents) complement\
    \ the stygian slayer archetype: bleeding attack, lasting poison, poison use*,\
    \ powerful sneak, rogue crawl, slow reactions, surprise attack, and swift poison.\
    \ (Those with asterisks [*] are detailed in the slayer class.)"
