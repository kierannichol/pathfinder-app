description: "A strangler is trained to choke the life out of her victims with her\
  \ vise-like grip. Some stranglers are self-taught and are little more than brutish\
  \ murderers, unhinged sociopaths, or opportunistic alley-bashers. Others are members\
  \ of murder cults or specialized schools of assassination, trained since the cradle\
  \ to kill with their bare hands."

  description: "At 16th level, a strangler can attempt to instantly kill a pinned\
    \ opponent as a standard action. This works like the sleeper hold ability, but\
    \ imposes a –5 penalty on her grapple combat maneuver check. If the opponent succeeds\
    \ at its Fortitude save, the strangler deals damage as if she had attempted the\
    \ grapple check to damage her opponent; if the opponent fails its Fortitude save,\
    \ it dies. Creatures that are immune to critical hits are immune to this ability.\
    \ At 20th level, the strangler can attempt this as a move action instead of a\
    \ standard can."
