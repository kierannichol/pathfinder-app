    \ magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A flamewarden can use\
    \ this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Wisdom modifier. At\
    \ 12th level, weapons affected by this ability gain the flaming burst special\

    \ remove afflictions from his body, mind, and soul. When the flamewarden takes\
    \ 5 or more points of fire damage, he can remove one of the following conditions:\
    \ fatigued, shaken, or sickened. Alternatively, he can remove 1 point of ability\
    \ damage or drain from an ability score of his choice.\nIf the flamewarden takes\
    \ 10 or more points of fire damage, he can remove one of the following conditions:\
    \ exhausted, frightened, or nauseated. Alternatively, he can remove 1d6 points\
    \ of ability damage or drain from an ability score of his choice.\nThe ranger\
    \ can use this ability only once each time he takes fire damage, regardless of\
    \ how much damage it deals over the required amount. He can use this ability a\
    \ number of times per day equal to 3 + her Wisdom modifier.\nIf the flamewarden\
    \ has fire resistance or immunity to fire, fire damage he would have otherwise\
    \ taken still counts toward activating burning renewal."

  description: "At 16th level, if a flamewarden dies, his body explodes in a conflagration\
    \ in a 20-foot spread. Each hostile creature in the area takes 10d6 points of\
    \ fire damage unless it succeeds at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the ranger's\
    \ level + his Constitution modifier) for half damage. The flames don't harm the\
    \ flamewarden's allies, who instead are healed 5d6 points of damage, and any poisons\
    \ they are currently suffering are neutralized as per neutralize poison. The flamewarden's\
    \ body is reduced to ashes by the explosion.\nAt 20th level, the flamewarden gains\
    \ immunity to fire, and once per week, the flamewarden rises from the ashes of\
    \ his own destruction 1 round after dying. The flamewarden's body re-forms with\
    \ all his equipment, and he returns to life with half his maximum hit points.\
    \ Any ability scores that were 0 become 1, and non-magical diseases and poisons\
    \ are cured. A limited wish, miracle, or wish spell cast before he rises from\
    \ the ashes prevents him from doing so, as does the area of an unhallow effect."
