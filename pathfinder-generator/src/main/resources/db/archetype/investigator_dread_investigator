    \ animate dead; 3rd--animate dead, speak with dead; 4th--rest eternal. A dread\

  description: "At 7th level, a dread investigator adds undead anatomy I to his formula\
    \ book, and he can share this extract with an unconscious creature as if he had\
    \ the infusion discovery. If the creature is dying when it receives the infusion,\
    \ it stabilizes and gains temporary hit points equal to twice the dread investigator's\
    \ level. Rather than having the extract take effect immediately, the dread investigator\
    \ may choose for the extract to remain latent for up to 10 minutes per level.\
    \ He can trigger the extract's effect at any point by touching the creature as\
    \ a standard action, and it automatically triggers if the creature using it is\
    \ reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. The dread investigator can also amplify the\
    \ effect of the extract, allowing it to function as undead anatomy II, but this\
    \ reduces the extract's duration to 1 round per level and at the end of its duration\
    \ the creature using the extract is reduced to â€“1 hit points.\nAt 13th level,\
    \ a dread investigator adds undead anatomy II to his formula book, and at 19th\
    \ level undead anatomy III, which he can use in the same way, including amplifying\
    \ the effect of the extract to the next-higher-level undead anatomy spell."
