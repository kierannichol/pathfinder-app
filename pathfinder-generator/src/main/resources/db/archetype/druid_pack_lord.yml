  description: "A pack lord druid may not select a domain and must choose an animal\
    \ companion. The druid gains a +2 bonus on wild empathy and Handle Animal checks\
    \ made regarding her animal companion. The pack lord may have more than one animal\
    \ companion, but she must divide up her effective druid level between her companions\
    \ to determine the abilities of each companion. For example, a 4th-level pack\
    \ lord can have one 4th-level companion, two 2nd-level companions, or one 1st-level\
    \ and one 3rd-level companion.\nEach time a pack lord's druid level increases,\
    \ she must decide how to allocate the increase among her animal companions (including\
    \ the option of adding a new 1st-level companion). Once a druid level is allocated\
    \ to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is\
    \ in the pack lord's service (she must release the companion or wait until the\
    \ companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion, which she can do\
    \ the next time she prepares spells). The share spells animal companion ability\
    \ only applies to one animal companion at a time--the pack lord cannot use it\
    \ to cast a one-target spell and have it affect all of her animal companions."

  description: "The pack lord gains an empathic link with all of her animal companions.\
    \ This functions like an empathic link with a familiar. In addition, as a swift\
    \ action the pack lord can shift her perception to one of her companions, allowing\
    \ her to experience what it sees, hears, and so on. She can maintain this connection\
    \ as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and end it\
    \ as a free action. The druid can only use this ability on one companion at a\
    \ time, and cannot see, hear, or smell with her own body while maintaining this\
    \ connection."
