    \ can act in a surprise round even if she doesn't notice her enemies, though she\
    \ remains flat-footed until she acts. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on initiative\
    \ checks. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 gunslinger levels beyond 2nd.\
    \ Finally, at 10th level, she can spend 1 grit point to take both a standard action\
    \ and a move action (or a full-round action) during the surprise round."
