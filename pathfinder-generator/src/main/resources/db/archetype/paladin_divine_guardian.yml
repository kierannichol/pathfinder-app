    When the paladin first selects a creature for divine troth, that creature must\
    \ be present and agree to receive the paladin's protection, but if the paladin\
    \ already has a creature selected for divine troth, she can maintain that selection\
    \ each day without her charge being present. Once per day, the divine guardian\
    \ can cast locate creature to find the current target of her divine troth."
