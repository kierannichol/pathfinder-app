  description: "At 2nd level, instead of a single eidolon, a broodmaster summons two\
    \ Small eidolons to his side, each less powerful than the single eidolon of a\
    \ standard summoner. Each eidolon has it own base form and associated base statistics\
    \ and free evolutions. Regardless of the number of eidolons in the brood, each\
    \ eidolon has the same base attack bonus and base saving throw bonuses, but the\
    \ rest of the eidolons' base statistics must be divided between the eidolons,\
    \ including Hit Dice (minimum 1), skill points, number of feats, armor bonus,\
    \ Str/Dex bonus, evolution pool (but see below), and maximum number of natural\
    \ attacks. Individual eidolons in the brood must purchase evolutions separately.\
    \ Once a broodmaster decides on the forms and abilities of his eidolons, they\
    \ cannot be changed until the summoner gains a level. Example: A 2nd-level broodmaster\
    \ can summon two eidolons. Each eidolon has 1 Hit Dice, BAB +2, +3 on its two\
    \ good saves and +0 on its bad save. The broodmaster decides to give the first\
    \ eidolon 4 skill points, one feat, a +1 armor bonus, a +1 bonus to Strength,\
    \ 2 points from the evolution pool, and a maximum of two attacks. The remaining\
    \ 4 skill points, +1 armor bonus, +1 bonus to Dexterity, and 2 points from the\
    \ evolution pool go to the second eidolon, but it gains no feats and can have\
    \ only one natural attack.\nThe broodmaster must dismiss all of his eidolons at\
    \ one time. Likewise, all of the eidolons in a brood are banished if the broodmaster\
    \ is unconscious, asleep, or killed. However, each eidolon in the brood is sent\
    \ back to its home plane individually when its hit points are reduced to a negative\
    \ number equal to or greater than its Constitution score.\nThis ability replaces\
    \ the summoner's normal eidolon ability.\nThe following are new class features\
    \ of the broodmaster archetype. Those with the same name as the standard summoner\
    \ class have slightly different rules, but otherwise work as and replace the standard\
    \ summoner class features of the same name."
