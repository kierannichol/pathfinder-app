  description: "An herbalist's studies allow him a unique method of creating alchemical\
    \ discoveries. He can attempt Profession (herbalist) checks in place of Craft\
    \ (alchemy) checks for all purposes, and he gains a competence bonus equal to\
    \ half his alchemist level on Profession (herbalist) checks to create alchemical\
    \ items and to forage for and process herbs. An herbalist uses his Wisdom score\
    \ instead of his Intelligence score for all alchemist class abilities."

  description: "An herbalist's study of the leshy spirit grants him access to natural\

    \ of extracts (including 1st level), he can add two spells from that spell level\
    \ on the druid spell list to his alchemist class spell list; these spells must\
    \ target a creature or creatures or have a range of â€œyou,\"and he must still add\
    \ them to his formula book as normal before he can prepare them. As always, the\
    \ extracts affect the drinker as if she were the target, so offensive touch spells\
    \ are a nasty trap for the drinker."

  description: "An herbalist can produce and throw seedpods as ranged touch attacks,\
    \ similar to the ranged attacks of other leshys. He can create a number of seedpods\
    \ each day equal to his alchemist level + his Wisdom modifier and can throw them\
    \ as a standard action with a range increment of 20 feet. A seedpod deals 1d6\
    \ points of bludgeoning damage, plus an additional 1d6 points of damage at 3rd\
    \ level and every 2 levels thereafter (this additional damage isn't multiplied\
    \ on a critical hit or from effects like Vital Strike). Seedpods are considered\
    \ weapons and can be selected for feats like Weapon Focus, and the herbalist can\
    \ take the Extra Bombs feat to gain additional daily uses of his seedpods. His\
    \ seedpods also gain one of the following additional effects unless the target\
    \ succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the herbalist's alchemist level\
    \ + his Wisdom modifier).\nAt 1st level, his seedpods can deafen their target\
    \ for 1 round like a leaf leshy.\nAt 2nd level, they can reduce the target's vision\
    \ to 10 feet for 1 minute (unless the target spends a full-round action to wash\
    \ the spores from its eyes early) like the spores of a fungus leshy.\nAt 5th level,\
    \ they can entangle their target for 2d4 rounds (unless the target succeeds at\
    \ a Strength check or Escape Artist check at the save DC to break the vine early)\
    \ like the seeds of a gourd leshy.\nAt 8th level, they can sicken their target\
    \ for 1d4 rounds like the spittle of a flytrap leshy.\nAt 10th level, they can\
    \ blind their target until the end of their next turn like the water jets of a\
    \ seaweed leshy."
