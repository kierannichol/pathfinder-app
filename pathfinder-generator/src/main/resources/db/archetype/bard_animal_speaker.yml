  description: "An animal speaker selects a particular kind of animal, such as apes,\
    \ badgers, bears, boars, cats, snakes, and so on. The bard gains a +4 bonus on\
    \ Handle Animal checks to influence animals of his chosen kind. Animals of this\
    \ kind have a starting attitude of at least â€œindifferent\"toward the bard and\
    \ never attack him unless he attacks them first.\nAnimal companions and magically\
    \ controlled animals of the bard's chosen kind can be directed to attack the bard\
    \ if the controlling creature wins an opposed Charisma check against the bard\
    \ (this check can be made once per round until it succeeds, after which no further\
    \ checks are needed). Supernatural versions of animals (such as animals with the\
    \ fiendish template) can attempt an opposed Charisma check against the bard with\
    \ a +4 bonus on its roll to overcome this hesitation. This ability has no effect\
    \ on creatures other than animals."

  description: "An animal speaker gains the following types of bardic performance:\n\
    Soothing Performance: At 3rd level, an animal speaker can use bardic performance\
    \ to influence animals. This works like the druid ability wild empathy, except\
    \ he expends 1 round of bardic performance and makes a Perform check. If the bard\
    \ already has wild empathy from another class, he adds the class levels that provide\
    \ wild empathy to the result of his Perform check to influence an animal.\nThis\
    \ ability replaces inspire competence.\nAttract Rats: At 6th level, the animal\
    \ speaker can use bardic performance to summon 1d3 rat swarms; they remain as\
    \ long as he continues performing. At 11th level, he summons 2d3 swarms instead\
    \ of 1d3 and the swarms have the advanced creature simple template. At 17th level,\
    \ the number of swarms he summons increases to 3d3.\nThis ability replaces suggestion.\n"
