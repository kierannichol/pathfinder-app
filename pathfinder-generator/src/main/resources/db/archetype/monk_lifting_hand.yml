  description: "A lifting hand gains Savage Slam as a bonus feat, even if she doesn't\
    \ meet the prerequisites.\nAt 4th level, when the lifting hand succeeds at her\
    \ grapple combat maneuver check while using the Savage Slam feat and her grapple\
    \ combat maneuver check result exceeds the opponent's CMD by at least 5, she can\
    \ throw the opponent into an non-adjacent square. The lifting hand can throw the\
    \ opponent 10 feet, plus an additional 5 feet for every 5 by which her grapple\
    \ check exceeds the opponent's CMD. For instance, if the lifting monk exceeds\
    \ the target's CMD by 15, she can throw the target into a square 20 feet away.\n\
    At 8th level, when using Savage Slam, the lifting hand's target no longer receives\
    \ a bonus to its CMD when the lifting hand attempts to throw it into a dangerous\
    \ area."

  description: "At 10th level, when a lifting hand succeeds at a combat maneuver check\
    \ to maintain a grapple, instead of choosing to damage, move, pin, or tie up the\
    \ opponent, she can instead force one of the target's limbs into an agonizing\
    \ position. The target becomes sickened as long as the lifting hand maintains\
    \ the grapple. When the grapple is released or broken, the target is fatigued\
    \ for a number of rounds equal to the lifting hand's level. This is a pain effect."

    \ she grapples the creature and negates the triggering attack, and she can spend\
