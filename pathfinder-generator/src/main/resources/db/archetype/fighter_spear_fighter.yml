  description: "At 3rd level, a spear fighter learns to parry his opponents' attacks\
    \ with his spear. This functions as a swashbuckler's opportune parry and riposte\
    \ deed except as noted below. The spear fighter must use a weapon from the spears\
    \ weapon group to perform the parry. He doesn't need panache to parry an attack\
    \ or to make an attack against a creature whose attack he has parried; instead,\
    \ he takes a cumulative â€“4 penalty on all attacks (including further parry attempts)\
    \ until the end of his next turn. At 7th, 11th, and 15th levels, the penalty decreases\
    \ by 1. At 19th level, a spear fighter can use spear parry without penalty."
