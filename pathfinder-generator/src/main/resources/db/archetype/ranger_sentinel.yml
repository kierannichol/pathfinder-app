  description: "A sentinel can spend 1 minute studying the appearance of a target\
    \ or a likeness of the target in the form of a picture, carving, or visual illusion\
    \ and memorize it with perfect recall. From that point on, the sentinel gains\
    \ a +4 bonus on Perception checks to notice the target in disguise or pick him\
    \ out of a crowd. The sentinel is automatically allowed a Perception check against\
    \ the target's Disguise check whenever she sees the target, even if the individual\
    \ isn't doing anything to draw attention to himself.\nA sentinel can memorize\
    \ the appearance of a number of targets equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum\
    \ 1) at any given time. Once a sentinel has reached her maximum number of memorized\
    \ appearances, she must forget one of the memorized faces before gaining a new\
    \ one."

  description: "At 6th level, a sentinel gains the ability to establish an incredibly\
    \ effective watch by standing still and focusing on all of her senses as once.\
    \ At any time, she can spend 1 minute setting up this ability. Once she has done\
    \ so, she must stand still, taking no other actions except to keep track of her\
    \ surroundings; she can't even take free actions like talking. Her heightened\
    \ senses grant her a supernatural awareness of her surroundings within 20 feet.\
    \ If any Tiny or larger creature enters the area over which her awareness extends,\
    \ she automatically knows that it did so (this part of the ability is a divination\
    \ effect and can't be deceived by spells that block sensory input, only by extreme\
    \ effects like mind blank). Furthermore, unless that creature is simultaneously\
    \ negating its visual, auditory, and scent stimuli (such as by being under invisibility,\
    \ silence, and negate aroma all at once), the sentinel can attempt a Perception\
    \ check as an immediate action to pinpoint the intruder's location, ignoring any\
    \ Stealth bonuses the intruder might gain from effects that obscure only one of\
    \ those senses, such as invisibility, camouflage, or other spells or abilities.\n\
    This sort of heightened analysis of sensory stimuli is taxing, as much so as hustling\
    \ overland for an equivalent period of time, despite not moving from a single\
    \ spot. The sentinel can use this ability for 1 hour without penalty.\nUsing sense\
    \ intruder for a second hour in between sleep cycles deals 1 point of nonlethal\
    \ damage to the sentinel, and each additional hour deals twice the damage taken\
    \ during the previous hour. A sentinel who takes any nonlethal damage from using\
    \ this ability becomes fatigued. Each hour the sentinel uses sense intruder also\
    \ counts as 1 hour of hustling overland for the purpose of determining how much\
    \ nonlethal damage the sentinel takes in a single day.\nStarting at 10th level,\
    \ whenever the sentinel gains a combat style feat, she can choose to trade it\
    \ for a 10-foot increase in the radius of this ability."
