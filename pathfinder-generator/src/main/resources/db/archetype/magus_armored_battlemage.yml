  description: "An armored battlemage cannot spend points from his arcane pool to\
    \ enhance weapons. Instead, he can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift\
    \ action to grant armor he is wearing a +1 enhancement bonus for 1 minute. For\
    \ every 4 magus levels he has beyond 1st, the armor gains another +1 enhancement\
    \ bonus, to a maximum of +5 at 17th level. These bonuses stack with existing armor\
    \ enhancement bonuses to a maximum of +5.\nMultiple uses of this ability do not\
    \ stack with themselves.\nAt 5th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of\
    \ the following armor special abilities: balanced, bitter, fortification (heavy,\
    \ light, or medium), ghost touch, invulnerability, spell resistance (13, 15, 17,\
    \ or 19), or spell storing.\nAdding these special abilities consumes an amount\
    \ of bonus equal to the ability's base price modifier. In addition, the armored\
    \ battlemage can grant his armor the energy resistance special ability at the\
    \ cost of a +3 bonus or the improved energy resistance special ability at the\
    \ cost of a +5 bonus. These special abilities are added to any the armor already\
    \ has, but duplicates do not stack. If the armor is not magical, at least a +1\
    \ enhancement bonus must be added before any other special abilities can be added.\
    \ These bonuses and special abilities are decided when the arcane pool point is\
    \ spent and cannot be changed until the next time the armored battlemage uses\
    \ this ability. These bonuses do not function if the armor is worn by anyone other\
    \ than the magus.\nAn armored battlemage can enhance only one suit of armor in\
    \ this way at one time. If he uses this ability again, the first use immediately\
    \ ends."
