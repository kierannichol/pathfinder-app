  description: "At 20th level, a paladin becomes a conduit for the power of her god.\
    \ Her DR increases to 10/evil. Whenever she uses smite evil and successfully strikes\
    \ an aberration, the creature must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the paladin's\
    \ level + the paladin's Charisma modifier) or be banished to oblivion. This ability\
    \ does not kill the creature, but it is sent to a remote place, such as deep underground\
    \ or far into space (if it is a creature native to space), and cannot return under\
    \ its own power for at least 100 years.\nWhenever the paladin channels positive\
    \ energy or uses lay on hands to heal a creature, she heals the maximum possible\
    \ amount."
