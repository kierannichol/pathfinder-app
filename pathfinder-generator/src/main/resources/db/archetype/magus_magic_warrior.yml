  description: "At 3rd level, as a standard action, a Magic Warrior can gain an aspect\
    \ of an animal's might by expending 1 point from her arcane pool. The animal must\
    \ be the same one that the Magic Warrior's mask represents (the animal can change\
    \ if the Magic Warrior creates or obtains a new mask). The Magic Warrior gains\
    \ one ability the animal has from the list of abilities given in beast shape I\
    \ (this ability doesn't allow her to change her size). The ability lasts for 1\
    \ minute per class level."

    \ her spellbook as magus spells of the same level at which they appear on the\
    \ druid spell list. She gains one druid spell not on the magus spell list for\
    \ each of the listed spell levels: 0 level, 1st level, 2nd level, 3rd level, 4th\
    \ level, 5th level, and 6th level.\nShe can ignore the divine focus component\
    \ of these spells.\nThis replaces greater spell access."
