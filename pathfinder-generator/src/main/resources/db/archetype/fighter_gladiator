description: "Most fighters battle out of necessity, with each battle a contest of\
  \ life and death. Some, however, fight for glory and for the adulation of the crowd.\
  \ The gladiator is both a cunning warrior and a consummate performer, knowing life\
  \ and death are balanced not only on a sword's edge, but also on the cheers or jeers\
  \ of the crowd."
