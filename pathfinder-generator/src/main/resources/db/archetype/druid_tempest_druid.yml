  description: "At 9th level, a tempest druid can redirect nearby electrical attacks.\
    \ As an immediate action, the druid can shift the area or target of an electricity\
    \ attack by 5 feet in any direction. If the electricity affects an area, the druid\
    \ selects one square to be unaffected and an adjacent square to be affected. If\
    \ the adjacent square is already in the area, this has no additional effect in\
    \ that square. If the electricity affects a target, the druid selects an adjacent\
    \ target. For example, if he were in the line of a wizard's lightning bolt, he\
    \ could have the spell skip his square and instead affect an adjacent square,\
    \ even if this meant the spell did not form a continuous line. If another druid\
    \ attacked him with call lightning, he could shift the called bolt to an adjacent\
    \ square, affecting a creature in that square (if any).\nHe can't redirect electricity\
    \ damage conducted to him by physical contact with an object or creature (such\
    \ as a shocking grasp or a shock weapon). He can use this ability a number of\
    \ times per day equal to his Wisdom bonus."
