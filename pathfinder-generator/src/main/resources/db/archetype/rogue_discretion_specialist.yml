  description: "A discretion specialist is highly skilled at convincing others not\
    \ to trust their own senses. At 3rd level as a full-round action, the discretion\
    \ specialist can convince one living creature within 30 feet that up to 5 minutes\
    \ of its memories from the past hour are unreliable. If the target fails a Will\
    \ saving throw (DC = 10 + half the discretion specialist's rogue level + her Intelligence\
    \ modifier), the target is convinced that those memories didn't happen or that\
    \ it's confusing the memories with a dream (or is otherwise hazy as to the memories'\
    \ reality).\nEach hour after the discretion specialist uses this ability, the\
    \ target can attempt a new Will saving throw to realize that its relevant memories\
    \ have been tampered with, although not necessarily that the discretion specialist\
    \ was the originator of the tampering.\nThe discretion specialist can use this\
    \ ability once per day, and one additional time per day for every 5 rogue levels\
    \ she has. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the discretion specialist\
    \ can obfuscate memories from an additional hour in the past (to a maximum of\
    \ 6 hours at 18th level)."

  description: "A discretion specialist can cover up a corpse's cause of a death--or\
    \ dispose of it entirely. At 4th level, the discretion specialist gains the ability\
    \ to cast dress corpse as a spell-like ability, using her rogue level as her caster\
    \ level. She can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day\
    \ for every 5 rogue levels she has (to a maximum of five times at 20th level).\n\
    At 12th level, she can spend two uses of this ability to disintegrate a corpse\
    \ entirely as a full-round action, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust (a\
    \ disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected). The target cannot be an undead\
    \ creature. A corpse disintegrated this way cannot be brought back to life except\
    \ by resurrection or more powerful magic, including miracle or wish."

  description: "At 4th level, the discretion specialist can prevent opponents from\
    \ escaping. Opponents damaged by the discretion specialist's sneak attack are\
    \ unable to take the withdraw action for 1 round, though they can still move as\
    \ normal.\nAt 8th level, a creature damaged by the discretion specialist's sneak\
    \ attack is hampered in casting spells of the teleportation subschool (such as\
    \ dimension door) as well as using methods of magical transport such as shadow\
    \ walk. A target attempting to cast such a spell before the end of the discretion\
    \ specialist's next turn must succeed at a concentration check (in addition to\
    \ any concentration checks required for casting while threatened or other circumstances)\
    \ or lose the spell. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + half the discretion\
    \ specialist's rogue level + her Intelligence modifier.\nThis replaces uncanny\
    \ dodge and improved uncanny dodge.\nRogue Talents: The following rogue talents\
    \ complement this archetype: camouflage, charmer, convincing lie, honeyed words,\
    \ and quick disguise."
