description: "While most clerics are associated with a particular temple, adventuring\
  \ clerics spend much of their time away from their favored place of worship, and\
  \ there are those who worship primarily on the road and during the journey. These\
  \ clerics see the act of travel and the arrival at sites sacred to their religion\
  \ as valuable, and perhaps more so than time spent sequestered inside a church.\
  \ These pilgrims love to travel, typically on foot or with caravans."
