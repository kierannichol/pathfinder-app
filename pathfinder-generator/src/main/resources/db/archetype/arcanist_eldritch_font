  description: "At 3rd level, an eldritch font can, as a swift action, pour more power\
    \ into her spells and abilities. She can add 2 to the caster level and DC of a\
    \ spell, or increase her effective arcanist level by 2 when using an arcanist\
    \ exploit. She becomes fatigued upon using this ability. If she is already fatigued,\
    \ she becomes exhausted. If she's already exhausted, or something would prevent\
    \ her from becoming fatigued or exhausted, she cannot use this ability. This ability\
    \ does not stack with spending points from her arcane reservoir to increase the\
    \ spell's caster level or DC (as the arcane reservoir class feature). Only rest\
    \ can remove fatigue or exhaustion caused by an eldritch surge--spells and abilities\
    \ have no effect."
