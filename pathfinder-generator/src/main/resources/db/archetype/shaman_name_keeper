description: "Some study the names of fallen adventurers, correlating their names\
  \ with the quests they were on when they perished or went missing, and then take\
  \ it upon themselves to finish these incomplete missions. In delving into the storied\
  \ histories of these fallen explorers, they have discovered how to commune with\
  \ the departed spirits of those who have fallen. These mystical agents soon became\
  \ known as name-keepers, and they pride themselves on helping their predecessors\
  \ find peace while preventing other names from being added to the wall."

  description: "At 4th level, a name-keeper can form a temporary bond with a deceased\
    \ person. The name-keeper must make this selection each day when preparing her\
    \ spells. While this feature is active, she gains one or more benefits. Each allows\
    \ her to select one or more options (such as a weapon or shaman spirit), and she\
    \ can choose different options each time she forms this bond.\nScrolls: The name-keeper\
    \ selects an oracle mystery. She can use any of the mystery's associated skills\
    \ untrained, and she treats them as class skills. For any of those skills that\
    \ were already class skills, she instead gains a +2 sacred bonus on those checks.\
    \ At 12th level, she gains Skill Focus for one of the associated skills as a bonus\
    \ feat. At 20th level, she gains Skill Focus a second time as a bonus feat, and\
    \ she always counts as having at least 10 ranks in those skills for calculating\
    \ these temporary feats' benefits.\nSpells: The name-keeper selects a second shaman\
    \ spirit and adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that\
    \ she can cast using spirit magic. She gains one additional spirit magic spell\
    \ slot of her highest spell level. At 12th level, she selects two shaman spirits\
    \ and adds both their granted spells to the list of spells she can cast using\
    \ spirit magic. At 20th level, her number of spirit magic spell slots at each\
    \ spell level increases to two.\nSwords: The name-keeper gains proficiency in\
    \ all martial weapons and one exotic weapon of her choice. At 12th level, whenever\
    \ she makes a full attack, she gains one additional attack at her highest base\
    \ attack bonus; this ability stacks with the extra attack from haste, but it doesn't\
    \ stack with other abilities that grant extra attacks. At 20th level, she gains\
    \ two combat feats for which she qualifies."
