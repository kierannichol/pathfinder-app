  description: "At 1st level, a blightseeker creates a special kind of alchemist bomb\
    \ that delivers a payload of alchemically engineered fungal spores. These bombs\
    \ infest their target with a virulent blight (see below). The blightseeker's bombs\
    \ deal 1d4 points of damage (instead of 1d6), plus 1d4 points of damage for every\
    \ 2 alchemist levels beyond 1st.\nA creature that takes a direct hit from a spore\
    \ bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the blightseeker's level\
    \ + his Intelligence modifier) or suffer the associated blight effects. Creatures\
    \ that take splash damage from the bomb are not affected by the blight."

    \ When he prepares bombs at the start of the day, a blightseeker chooses which\
    \ blight to apply to each bomb. If a blight has no duration listed, it lasts a\
    \ number of rounds equal to the blightseeker's Intelligence modifier. At 1st level,\
    \ a blightseeker gains the following blights.\nImpairing: The target's base land\
    \ speed decreases by 10 feet, to a minimum of 10 feet. This effect doesn't stack\
    \ with itself. Minor Sickening: The target is sickened, but it takes only a â€“\
    1 penalty on affected rolls.\nAt 6th level, a blightseeker adds the following\
    \ blights to the list of those that can be applied to his bombs.\nFatiguing: The\
    \ target is fatigued. Fear-Inducing: The target is shaken. Sickening: The target\
    \ is sickened.\nAt 12th level, a blightseeker adds the following blights to the\
    \ list of those blights that can be applied to his bombs.\nConfusing: The target\
    \ is confused. Exhausting: The target is exhausted. Nauseating: The target is\
    \ nauseated for 1 round. Staggering: The target becomes staggered for 1 round.\n\
    At 18th level, a blightseeker adds the following blights to the list of those\
    \ that can be selected.\nBlinding: The target is blinded. Deafening: The target\
    \ is deafened. Stunning: The target is stunned for 1 round."
