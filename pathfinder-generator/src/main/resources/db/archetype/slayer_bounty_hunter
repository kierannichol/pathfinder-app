    \ damage to a studied target, he can instead attempt to hamper the target. The\
    \ bounty hunter must declare that he's using this ability before the attack roll\
    \ is made. If the attack hits, it deals damage normally, but instead of rolling\
    \ sneak attack damage, the bounty hunter can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver\
    \ against the studied target as a free action, adding 1 to the combat maneuver\
    \ check for each die of the bounty hunter's sneak attack damage. This combat maneuver\
    \ does not provoke attacks of opportunity."

  description: "At 10th level, a bounty hunter can incapacitate a studied target.\
    \ This functions like the assassinate slayer talent, except instead of killing\
    \ the target, the bounty hunter's successful attack knocks the target unconscious\
    \ for 1d6 rounds unless it succeeds at its saving throw. If the target does succeed\
    \ at its saving throw, it still takes the sneak attack damage as normal, but the\
    \ damage is nonlethal, and the target is immune to that slayer's incapacitate\
    \ ability for 24 hours.\nThis ability replaces the advanced slayer talent gained\
    \ at 10th level.\nSlayer Talents: The following slayer talents (and rogue talents)\
    \ complement the bounty hunter archetype: camouflage, fast stealth, hard to fool,\
    \ slowing strike*, snap shot, surprise attack, and terrain mastery."
