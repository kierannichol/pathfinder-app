    \ attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must\
    \ succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the wild soul's level + his Wisdom\
    \ modifier) or die. The wild soul can instead deal an amount of nonlethal damage\
    \ equal to the creature's current hit points, which the target can negate with\
