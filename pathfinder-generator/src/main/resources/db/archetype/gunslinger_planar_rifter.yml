  description: "Each day when a planar rifter recovers grit, he can attune his grit\
    \ pool to one of the following subtypes: air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good,\
    \ lawful, or water.\nWhenever he is on a plane that has an alignment or elemental\
    \ trait, he can switch his attunement to match one of that plane's traits as a\
    \ standard action. After reducing an outsider to 0 hit points or below, he can\
    \ switch his attunement to match one of that outsider's subtypes as a free action.\
    \ He regains grit as normal from critical hits, but killing blows replenish his\
    \ grit pool only if the target is an outsider.\nThis alters grit.\nDeeds: A planar\
    \ rifter gains the following deeds.\nInfused Bullet (Su) At 1st level, a planar\
    \ rifter's bullets carry the essence of a plane to which his grit pool is attuned,\
    \ striking true against creatures that shrink from that plane's nature. As long\
    \ as he has at least 1 point in his grit pool, he gains the following benefits:\
    \ if he infuses his bullets with an alignment, his bullet's damage counts as that\
    \ alignment for the purposes of overcoming DR; if he infuses his bullets with\
    \ an element, half of his bullet's damage changes to an energy type determined\
    \ by the element infused: acid (earth), cold (water), electricity (air), or fire\
    \ (fire).\nThis deed replaces the deadeye deed.\nPlanar Surge (Su) At 7th level,\
    \ a planar rifter can spend 1 grit point as a swift action to change the attunement\
    \ of his grit pool to any alignment or element. This new attunement remains for\
    \ 1 minute, after which time the grit pool becomes unattuned.\nThis deed replaces\
    \ the dead shot deed.\nBreaching Shot (Su) At 15th level, a planar rifter can\
    \ fire bullets with such precision that he tears temporary rifts between planes.\
    \ As a standard action, he can spend 3 grit points to shoot at a location within\
    \ his firearm's first range increment and tear a 10-foot-radius portal to a plane\
    \ of his choice. The rift leads to a random location on the plane that is between\
    \ 5 and 500 miles from his intended destination, as plane shift. The rift remains\
    \ open for 1 minute, during which time any number of willing creatures can pass\
    \ through. It is a one-way rift, and it is insufficiently stable to reveal details\
    \ about the environment on the other side.\nThis deed replaces the menacing shot\
    \ deed.\nBanishing Shot (Su) At 19th level, whenever a planar rifter confirms\
    \ a critical hit against an extraplanar target, he can spend 1 grit to deal normal\
    \ damage, and the target must succeed at a Will saving throw with a DC equal to\
    \ 20 + the planar rifter's Wisdom modifier. On a failed saving throw, the target\
    \ is returned to its original plane as per the banishment spell."

  description: "At 2nd level, when a planar rifter infuses his grit with the essence\
    \ of a plane, he gains protection against that plane's dangers. If he attunes\
    \ his grit pool to chaos, good, evil, or law, he gains resistance to magical effects\
    \ that deal damage based on the chosen alignment, such as holy smite, order's\
    \ wrath, a paladin's smite evil attack, or an unholy weapon. If he attunes his\
    \ grit pool to air, earth, fire, or water, he gains protection against the energy\
    \ type associated with that element (see infused bullet on page 6). He reduces\
    \ the amount of damage taken from attacks of the chosen type by 2 points per gunslinger\
    \ level."

  description: "At 5th level, as long as he has at least 1 point in his grit pool,\
    \ a planar rifter's weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 points of damage of the same\
    \ damage type reduced by his planar resistance. Aligned damage harms only creatures\
    \ of an opposed alignment. At 13th level, this damage increases to 2d6."
