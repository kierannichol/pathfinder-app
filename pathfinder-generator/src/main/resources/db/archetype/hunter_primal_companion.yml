  description: "At first level, a primal companion hunter can awaken a primal creature\
    \ from within his animal companion as a swift action. The animal companion gains\
    \ a pool of 2 evolution points that can be used to temporarily give the companion\
    \ evolutions as if it were an eidolon. A primal companion hunter uses her hunter\
    \ level to determine her effective summoner level for the purpose of qualifying\
    \ for evolutions and determining their effects. At 8th level, the number of evolution\
    \ points in her pool increases to 4, and at 15th level, it increases to 6.\nThe\
    \ animal companion gains a pool of evolution points that can be used to temporarily\
    \ give the companion evolutions as if it were an eidolon. A primal companion hunter\
    \ uses her hunter level to determine the number of evolution points gained, limitations\
    \ on how often an evolution can be selected, and so on. Whenever she gains a level,\
    \ she must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until she gains\
    \ another level.\nActivating these evolutions on the animal companion is a swift\
    \ action. A primal companion hunter can use this ability for 1 minute per day\
    \ per hunter level. This duration need not to be consecutive, but it must be spent\
    \ in 1-minute increments. An animal companion transformed in this way cannot exceed\
    \ the maximum number of attacks available to the eidolon of a summoner whose class\
    \ level equals that of the hunter. While transformed in this way, the animal companion's\
    \ type changes to magical beast, though the primal companion hunter still treats\
    \ it as an animal for the purpose of the Handle Animal skill.\nIf a primal companion\
    \ hunter's animal companion is dead, she can apply these evolutions to herself\
    \ instead of to her animal companion. Uses of this ability count toward the hunter's\
    \ maximum daily duration of evolution use."

  description: "At 8th level, once per day as a swift action, a primal companion hunter\
    \ can touch her animal companion and grant it one evolution that costs up to 4\
    \ evolution points. The companion must meet the prerequisites of the selected\
    \ evolution. Unlike the evolutions from primal transformation, this evolution\
    \ is not set; it can be changed each time the hunter uses this ability. Using\
    \ primal surge activates the primal transformation ability on the companion if\
    \ it isn't already active. This effect lasts until the hunter ends the primal\
    \ transformation. This does not allow a companion to exceed its maximum number\
    \ of natural attacks.\nThis ability can grant only one evolution at a time, even\
    \ if the chosen evolution could be selected multiple times.\nThis ability can\
    \ grant an evolution that allows additional evolution points to be spent to upgrade\
    \ that evolution (such as damage reduction or flight), and any points left over\
    \ can be spent on such upgrades. This ability cannot be used to grant an upgrade\
    \ to an evolution that the companion already possesses."
