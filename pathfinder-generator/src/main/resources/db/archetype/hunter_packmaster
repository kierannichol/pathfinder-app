  description: "A packmaster can have more than one animal companion, but she must\
    \ divide her effective druid level between her companions to determine the abilities\
    \ of each one. For example, a 4th-level packmaster can have one 4th-level animal\
    \ companion, two 2nd-level companions, one 3rd-level companion and one 1st-level\
    \ companion, or four 1st-level companions.\nWhen a packmaster gains a level, she\
    \ must decide how to allocate the increase among her animal companions, including\
    \ whether or not to add a new 1st-level companion. Once a hunter level is allocated\
    \ to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is\
    \ in the packmaster's service. She must release the companion or wait until the\
    \ companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion, which she can then\
    \ do the next time she refreshes her spell slots for the day. The share spells\
    \ animal companion ability applies to only one animal companion at a time--the\
    \ packmaster cannot use it to cast a spell that affects only a single target and\
    \ have the spell affect all of her animal companions.\nA packmaster's precise\
    \ companion, woodland stride, and teamwork feats apply to only one of her animal\
    \ companions at a time. (For example, a packmaster can apply precise companion\
    \ to one companion, woodland stride to another, and a given teamwork feat to a\
    \ third, but cannot apply any of those to two animal companions at once.) As a\
    \ swift action, she can change which companion gains any or all of these benefits."

  description: "This ability functions like animal focus, with the following exceptions.\
    \ A packmaster can apply her animal aspect to only one of her animal companions\
    \ at a time without it counting against the number of minutes per day she can\
    \ use that ability. When using animal focus on herself or her other animal companion,\
    \ the ability counts against her minutes per day as normal. She can have only\
    \ two animal aspects in effect at a time--one that counts against her minutes\
    \ per day and one that doesn't--and they can't both target the same companion.\
    \ Unless both her companions are dead, the hunter can't apply the companion's\
    \ aspect to herself (and thereby gain the benefit of its unlimited duration)."
