  description: "At 14th level, as a standard action a turncoat can choose a single\
    \ creature within 30 feet. He gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks\
    \ against this target. If the target has an attitude of indifferent or better\
    \ toward him, the first attack roll the turncoat makes against that target is\
    \ automatically treated as threatening a critical hit. If the target's attitude\
    \ is friendly or better, a successful attack is treated as a confirmed critical\
    \ hit. This ability can be used only once per day.\nAt 19th level, the bonus increases\
    \ to +6, and the attack is treated as a confirmed critical hit if the target is\
    \ at least indifferent to the turncoat."
