    \ of stone, 12th--stone tell, 14th--statue, 16th--repel metal or stone, 18th--clashing\
    \ rocks.\nStone Spirit Hex: A mountain witch can select hexes from the shaman's\
    \ stone spirit as if they were witch hexes. She uses her witch level as her shaman\
    \ level to determine the effect of the hex, and Intelligence instead of Wisdom\
    \ to determine its DC."

  description: "At 2nd level, a mountain witch can influence the attitude of mountain-dwelling\
    \ animals, as the druid's wild empathy class feature but only on animals native\
    \ to mountainous environments. The mountain witch uses her witch level as her\
    \ druid level for this ability.\nThis ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.\n\
    Hexes: The following witch hexes complement the mountain witch archetype: beast\
    \ of ill-omen, crystal sight*, lodestone*, metal curse*, stone stability*, and\
    \ ward of stone*. (Those with asterisks [*] are detailed in the shaman class.)\n\
    Major Hexes: The following major hexes complement the mountain witch archetype:\
    \ Beast Eye, hidden home, hoarfrost, and Weather Control."
