    \ casting spells directly from ley lines. A ley line guardian is a spontaneous\
    \ spellcaster. She knows the same number of spells and receives the same number\
    \ of spell slots per day as a sorcerer of her witch level. Bonus spells granted\
    \ by a ley line guardian's patron are added to the ley line guardian's total spells\
    \ known at the appropriate levels."

  description: "At 1st level, a ley line guardian is adept at channeling energy from\
    \ ley lines to enhance her own spells. As a swift action, she can increase her\
    \ effective caster level for the next spell she casts in that round by 1d4â€“1 levels.\
    \ After performing a conduit surge, the ley line guardian must succeed at a Fortitude\
    \ save (DC = 10 + level of spell cast + number of additional caster levels granted)\
    \ or become staggered for a number of minutes equal to the level of the spell\
    \ cast. At 8th level, the caster level increase becomes 1d4. She can use this\
    \ ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier."
