  description: "At 10th level, as a free action a deliverer can declare a studied\
    \ target to be his divine anathema. The studied target's alignment must be at\
    \ least two steps away from that of the deliverer. Against this target, the deliverer's\
    \ attacks deal an additional 2d6 points of damage; this damage is directly from\
    \ divine power and does not stack with the bonus damage from a holy or unholy\
    \ weapon, or a weapon with a similar weapon special ability or effect. A deliverer\
    \ can have only one divine anathema at a time.\nThis ability replaces the advanced\
    \ slayer talent gained at 10th level.\nSlayer Talents: The following slayer talents\
    \ (and rogue talents) complement the deliverer archetype: combat trick, finesse\
    \ rogue, foil scrutiny*, terrain mastery, trap spotter, and trapfinding*. (Those\
    \ with asterisks [*] are detailed in the slayer class.)\nAdvanced Slayer Talents:\
    \ The following advanced slayer talents (and advanced rogue talents) complement\
    \ the deliverer archetype: assassinate*, evasion, hunter's surprise, and master\
    \ of disguise."
