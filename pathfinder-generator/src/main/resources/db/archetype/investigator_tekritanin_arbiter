  description: "A Tekritanin arbiter gains Tekritanin as a bonus language. Tekritanin\
    \ is a fluid and evolving hybrid tongue which shares roots with many modern languages.\
    \ When the arbiter speaks Tekritanin, any creature that speaks a common human\
    \ language will understand him well enough to allow the arbiter to use the Diplomacy\
    \ skill or affect the creature with language-dependent effects. At the GM's discretion,\
    \ some human languages might be too divergent or unrelated to Tekritanin to use\
    \ this ability immediately. In this case, the arbiter must interact with creatures\
    \ speaking the language for at least 1 hour to permanently apply this ability\
    \ to the foreign language. A Tekritanin arbiter adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1)\
    \ to Linguistics checks."

  description: "A Tekritanin arbiter learns to forge lasting harmony between enemies.\
    \ At 2nd level, whenever the arbiter uses the Diplomacy skill to improve the starting\
    \ attitude of a creature, that attitude shift lasts for 24 hours instead of 1d4\
    \ hours, barring any circumstance or event that causes it to be decreased. If\
    \ the arbiter spends 1 minute continuously interacting with a creature, he can\
    \ attempt a Sense Motive check (DC = 10 + the creature's Bluff skill bonus) to\
    \ identify the creature's starting attitude (per the Diplomacy skill) in regard\
    \ to all other creatures present (including himself ). With this understanding,\
    \ the arbiter can use the Diplomacy skill to improve a target's attitude toward\
    \ any other creature present. This functions as if using the Diplomacy skill to\
    \ improve the target's attitude toward the arbiter, but instead uses the Diplomacy\
    \ DC determined by the target's starting attitude toward the creature of the arbiter's\
    \ choosing."

  description: "At 3rd level, a Tekritanin arbiter learns to speak one language with\
    \ the skill of a native speaker. He chooses one language he knows and gains a\
    \ +1 bonus on Disguise checks to appear as an individual native to any region\
    \ where the language is primarily spoken. In addition, he gains a +1 bonus on\
    \ both Diplomacy checks to change initial attitudes and Sense Motive checks to\
    \ detect falsehoods when dealing with individuals with the selected language as\
    \ their native language. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses\
    \ increase by 1 and the Tekritanin arbiter can select one additional language\
    \ that his bonuses apply to, up to a maximum of +6 each for six languages at 18th\
    \ level."
