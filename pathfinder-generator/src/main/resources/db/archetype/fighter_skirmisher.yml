description: "Not all battles are fought between armies; sometimes, a settlement or\
  \ nation faces a threat too dire to fight in the open. In order to repel a much\
  \ larger enemy force, some soldiers must abandon equipment and tactics designed\
  \ for open-field warfare and instead rely on ambushes, hit-and-run tactics, and\
  \ sabotage to whittle down their enemies' strength and morale. Skirmishers use harsh\
  \ weather and unforgiving terrain to their advantage, attacking isolated groups\
  \ of enemies that cannot flee or fight back effectively. Many tribal warriors also\
  \ employ small-unit tactics because it is part of their warrior culture, because\
  \ they cannot field a large army, or simply because they refuse to fight on the\
  \ enemy's terms."

  description: "At 2nd level, a skirmisher becomes more resistant to mental and physical\
    \ threats that are commonly employed by his enemies or often encountered in the\
    \ terrain in which he operates. The skirmisher must choose one of the specializations\
    \ below, gaining a +1 bonus on saving throws of the appropriate type. This bonus\
    \ increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 2nd.\nAlpine Training (Ex): A skirmisher\
    \ operating in mountainous terrain becomes resistant to cold climates and the\
    \ rigors of long treks at high altitudes. He gains a bonus on Fortitude saving\
    \ throws against altitude sickness, exposure to cold weather, and other effects\
    \ that cause fatigue or exhaustion. Counter-Interrogation Training (Ex): A skirmisher\
    \ undertaking infiltration missions learns to resist interrogation and persuasion.\
    \ The skirmisher gains a bonus on Will saving throws against charms and divinations.\
    \ Jungle Training (Ex): Through repeated exposure, a skirmisher operating in jungles\
    \ and wetlands builds up a tolerance against pathogens and toxins. He gains a\
    \ bonus on Fortitude saving throws against disease and poison. Light Infantry\
    \ Training (Ex): A skirmisher fighting in a light infantry unit learns to avoid\
    \ fire from enemy artillery, siege weapons, and spellcasters. He gains a bonus\
    \ on Reflex saving throws against attacks that deal half damage on a successful\
    \ save (such as the fireball spell) but not against traps, natural hazards, or\
    \ environmental effects."
