  description: "At 4th level, a spell trapper learns how to craft magical traps in\
    \ exchange for the use of spell slots. These traps work as ranger traps, except\
    \ they always count as spell-like abilities. A spell trap is always considered\
    \ magical, and is treated as a spell with a spell level equal to 1/3 the spell\
    \ trapper's class level. A magical trap lasts only 1 hour per level or until triggered,\
    \ whichever comes first. A trap's DC decreases by 1 for each full hour that passes\
    \ after it is set. Upon gaining this ability, the spell trapper automatically\
    \ knows the snare trap.\nSetting a spell trap is a full-round action that provokes\
    \ attacks of opportunity. If attacked during the course of conjuring a trap, the\
    \ spell trapper must attempt a concentration check, as though damaged while casting\
    \ a spell. A trap fills a single 5-foot square, and cannot be placed in the same\
    \ area as another spell trapper trap or a magical trap such as a glyph of warding.\
    \ Spell trappers need access to a material component pouch to craft spell traps\
    \ (unless they have the Eschew Materials feat) and must sacrifice a spell slot\
    \ to create the trap. The DCs for Perception checks to notice the trap, Disable\
    \ Device checks to disable it, and saving throws to avoid it are equal to 10 +\
    \ 1/2 the spell trapper's magus level + the spell slot level sacrificed to create\
    \ the trap. All spell traps are Trigger location, and Reset none."
