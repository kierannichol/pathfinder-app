description: "Clerics revere their deity as the embodiment of nature and the incarnation\
  \ of wind and waves. Clerics who live in or near the sea sometimes embrace the watery\
  \ aspect of their deity's other dimensions and take the title of crashing wave.\
  \ In aquatic communities, a crashing wave is often a healer and spiritual leader.\
  \ Such clerics understand the tempestuousness and cruelty of the sea, but also its\
  \ generosity and bounty."

  description: "At 1st level, a crashing wave can channel the pure balance of the\
    \ ocean--its wildness, its calm, its cruelty, and its gentleness. This energy\
    \ can be used to harm or heal creatures, as the crashing wave chooses.\nChanneling\
    \ this energy causes a 30-foot-radius burst centered on the cleric. Using balanced\
    \ channel is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A\
    \ crashing wave can choose whether to include herself in the effect. The cleric\
    \ must be able to present her holy symbol to use this ability, and she can channel\
    \ energy a number of times equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.\nIf the crashing\
    \ wave chooses to harm, creatures within the burst that are chaotic good, chaotic\
    \ evil, lawful good, or lawful evil take 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points\
    \ of damage for every 2 levels the cleric has beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th,\
    \ and so on). Creatures with a neutral alignment component are unaffected by this\
    \ energy. Creatures that take damage from the channeled energy can attempt a Fortitude\
    \ save (DC = 10 + half the crashing wave's level + her Charisma modifier) for\
    \ half damage. This damage is neither negative nor positive energy, so a creature's\
    \ resistance to positive or negative energy does not reduce this damage. (However,\
    \ resistance to channeled energy in particular, such as that provided by channel\
    \ resistance, applies normally.)\nIf the crashing wave chooses to heal, creatures\
    \ within the burst that have any neutral alignment component are healed 1d6 points\
    \ of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every 2 levels the cleric has beyond\
    \ 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on). This healing does not affect creatures\
    \ that are chaotic good, chaotic evil, lawful good, or lawful evil. This healing\
    \ is positive energy, so any creatures not healed by positive energy (such as\
    \ undead) receive no healing from this effect, even if they have a neutral alignment."
