  description: "A questioner casts arcane spells drawn from the bard spell list. He\
    \ can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or\
    \ cast a spell, a questioner must have an Intelligence score equal to at least\
    \ 10 + the spell's level. The saving throw DC against a questioner's spell is\
    \ equal to 10 + the spell's level + the questioner's Intelligence modifier.\n\
    Like other spellcasters, a questioner can cast only a certain number of spells\
    \ of each spell level per day. He knows the same number of spells and receives\
    \ the same number of spell slots per day as a bard of his investigator level,\
    \ including for cantrips. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he\
    \ has a high Intelligence score.\nAt 5th level and every 3 investigator levels\
    \ thereafter, a questioner can learn a new spell in place of one he already knows,\
    \ using the same rules as a bard. In effect, the questioner loses the old spell\
    \ in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that\
    \ of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the\
    \ highest-level spell the questioner can cast.\nA questioner need not prepare\
    \ his spells in advance. He can cast any bard spell he knows at any time, assuming\
    \ he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell's level."

  description: "At 2nd level, a questioner receives a +1 bonus on skill checks for\
    \ all Knowledge skills in which he is trained. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th\
    \ level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter, to a maximum of +6 at 17th\
    \ level. If he has the perceptive tracking investigator talent, he also adds this\
    \ bonus on Perception checks to find and follow tracks. At 5th level, the questioner\
    \ gains the eidetic recollection investigator talent as a bonus talent, ignoring\
    \ its prerequisites.\nThis ability replaces poison lore.\nRestricted Talents:\
    \ A questioner selects investigator talents as normal, except he cannot select\
    \ the alchemist discovery investigator talent.\nThis ability alters investigator\
    \ talents."
