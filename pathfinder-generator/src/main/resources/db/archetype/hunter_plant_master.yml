  description: "A plant master can take on the aspect of a plant as a swift action.\
    \ He must select one type of plant to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability\
    \ based on the type of plant emulated and his hunter level. The plant master can\
    \ use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to his level. This duration\
    \ does not need to be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. He\
    \ can emulate only one plant at a time.\nThe plant master can also apply one of\
    \ these aspects to his plant companion. An aspect applied in this way does not\
    \ count against the hunter's minutes of duration per day--it remains in effect\
    \ until he changes it. The companion's aspect can be the same aspect the hunter\
    \ has taken on or a different one. A plant master can select or change the plant\
    \ foci on both himself and his plant companion as part of the same swift action.\n\

    \ This bonus increases to +3 at 8th level and +4 at 15th level. Brambles: When\

    \ 1 point of piercing damage. This increases to 2 points at 8th level and 3 points\

    \ checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level. Giant\

  description: "A plant master can improve the attitude of a plant creature. Green\

    \ has a starting attitude of indifferent.\nTo use green empathy, the plant master\
    \ and the plant creature must be within 30 feet of each other under normal conditions.\
    \ Generally, influencing a plant creature in this way takes 1 minute, but as with\
    \ influencing people, it might take more or less time.\nA plant master can also\
    \ use this ability to influence an animal, but he takes a â€“4 penalty on the check.\
    \ He has no ability to influence magical beasts."
