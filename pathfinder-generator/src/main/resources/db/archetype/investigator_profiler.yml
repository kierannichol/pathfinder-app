  description: "A profiler gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his class level (minimum +1)\
    \ on Sense Motive checks. At 2nd level, he can use inspiration on any Sense Motive\
    \ check without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the\
    \ skill.\nAt 3rd level, he can attempt to predict a creature's movements using\
    \ his knowledge of the creature's psychology. He can use this ability only on\
    \ a creature familiar to him (for example, a serial killer whose crimes the profiler\
    \ has studied will suffice, even if the profiler hasn't yet identified the serial\
    \ killer's true identity). To do so, he starts from a place where he knows that\
    \ the creature has been and why (most often the scene of a crime) and attempts\
    \ a Sense Motive check against a DC equal to 40 or to 20 + the creature's Bluff\
    \ modifier, whichever is higher, which the GM rolls in secret. On a failure, the\
    \ profiler's guess about the creatures movements is inaccurate. On a success,\
    \ the profiler is able to track the creature's general movements as if using Survival\
    \ to track (though the usual modifiers on Survival checks to track don't apply,\
    \ and this ability allows her to track a creature using pass without trace or\
    \ otherwise leaving no trail). After at most 1 hour (or sooner if there are many\
    \ possible options for the creature to take, at the GM's discretion), if the profiler\
    \ has not yet found further evidence of the creature's passing (such as footprints,\
    \ fingerprints, or any other indication that the creature came this way), he loses\
    \ track of the creature's movements; if he does, he can try to guess where the\
    \ creature went next by attempting another check."
