  description: "At 2nd level, a mad scientist can deal 1d3 points of Wisdom damage\
    \ to herself (or 1d6 points of sanity damage if employing the sanity rules) to\
    \ create a genius extract as one of her daily 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-, or 5th-level\
    \ extracts. This otherwise takes the same amount of time and effort as creating\
    \ a normal extract of its level, but instead of her choosing a formula she knows\
    \ for it to grant, a genius extract has an unpredictable result. When the alchemist\
    \ (or an ally, if she has the infusion discovery) drinks the extract, it produces\
    \ a random effect from the list of alchemist formulae of 1 spell level higher\
    \ than the extract's spell level.\nFor instance, if she creates a genius extract\
    \ using a 2nd-level extract, it would produce the effect of a random 3rd-level\
    \ alchemist formula. There is no way to predict which effect a genius extract\
    \ will produce before drinking it. A genius extract's minimum caster level is\
    \ equal to the minimum caster level of the extract used, not the effect produced.\
    \ So, for instance, a genius extract that produced a fox's cunning effect would\
    \ have a minimum caster level of 1 (for the 1st-level extract used) rather than\
    \ 4 (for the 2nd-level effect). There are 29 potential 2nd-level extracts, 23\
    \ potential 3rd-level extracts, 18 potential 4th-level extracts, 15 potential\
    \ 5th-level extracts, and 15 potential 6th-level extracts."

  description: "At 4th level, a mad scientist can brew a mad mutagen in place of a\
    \ normal mutagen. If she does so, she need not make any decisions about the mutagen\
    \ (including whether to make it a cognatogen or another variant mutagen if she\
    \ has the appropriate discoveries) when she brews it.\nWhen the mad scientist\
    \ drinks her mad mutagen, she makes those decisions on the fly, but she also takes\
    \ 1d4 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d8 points of sanity damage if using the sanity\
    \ rules). If anyone else, even another alchemist, drinks a mad mutagen, that person\
    \ must succeed at a Will save (with the same DC as for the Fortitude save against\
    \ nausea) or she becomes confused for 1 hour."
