    \ and so on. It does not learn tricks, but it does have an Intelligence score\
    \ equal to that of a familiar belonging to a wizard of the courtly hunter's hunter\
    \ level. Levels in other classes that grant animal companions do not stack with\
    \ levels of courtly hunter for the purpose of determining the abilities of her\

  description: "At 2nd level, a courtly hunter can transform her animal companion\

    \ could be transformed into a Tiny dog, a dire bat could be transformed into a\
    \ Tiny flying fox, and so on. This functions as a polymorph effect, and the animal\
    \ companion gains a +2 size bonus to Dexterity and a â€“4 size penalty to Strength\
    \ (use the polymorph table to adjust its ability score if the animal companion\
    \ is larger than Medium). As a standard action, the courtly hunter can touch her\
