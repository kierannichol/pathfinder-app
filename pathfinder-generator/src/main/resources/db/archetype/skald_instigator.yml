  description: "At 10th level, the instigator can fill the hearts of his listeners\
    \ with hatred and rouse them into a frenzy. He can use this performance on all\
    \ targets with fewer than 4 Hit Dice and a Wisdom score lower than 16 who are\
    \ currently enthralled, without disrupting the enthrall effect (even if a creature\
    \ succeeds at its saving throw). This ability requires a standard action to activate\
    \ and costs 4 additional rounds of raging song.\nEnthralled creatures must each\
    \ attempt a new saving throw against an effect that functions as the foster hatred\
    \ spell, except that, unlike with the spell, the instigator is free to choose\
    \ subgroups, organizations, religions, or the like regardless of the targets'\
    \ races. Creatures that fail the saving throw or choose to forgo it also gain\
    \ the effects of the instigator's raging song whenever they attack the target\
    \ of their hatred, for as long as the foster hatred effect lasts; however, they\
    \ do not gain the effects of the instigator's rage powers when they're under the\
    \ effects of raging song in this way."

  description: "At 7th level, an instigator's tumultuous mastery of demagoguery and\
    \ revolution makes it difficult for others' compulsions to sway him.\nOnce per\
    \ day, when he fails a saving throw against a compulsion effect, he can attempt\
    \ another saving throw after 1 time increment (1 round if the effect is measured\
    \ in rounds, 1 minute if the effect is measured in minutes, 10 minutes if the\
    \ spell is measured in 10-minute increments, and so on). Every 6 skald levels\
    \ thereafter, he gains an additional daily use of this ability (to a maximum of\
    \ 3 per day at 19th level)."
