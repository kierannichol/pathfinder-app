  description: "At 6th level, a seducer can kiss another creature as a melee touch\
    \ attack. The target must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + half the seducer's level\
    \ + her Charisma modifier) or be staggered for 1 round. If the target is (or could\
    \ be) sexually attracted to the seducer, the save DC is increased by 2. If the\
    \ seducer and the target have had willing sexual relations in the past 24 hours,\
    \ the save DC is instead increased by 4. Whether or not the creature succeeds\
    \ at this save, it cannot be the target of this ability again for 1 day. At 10th\
    \ level, this ability causes the target to become stunned for 1 round, then staggered\
    \ for an additional round. This is a mind-affecting charm effect."

    \ This functions as tiny hut with a caster level equal to the seducer's witch\
    \ level, but the interior is a lush garden. Those who rest for 8 hours within\
    \ the garden heal at twice the usual rate. In addition, any creature engaging\
    \ in willing sexual relations with the seducer in this garden gains a +2 morale\
    \ bonus on saving throws for the next 24 hours. This bonus does not apply on saving\
    \ throws against the seducer's spells or abilities."
