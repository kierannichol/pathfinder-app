description: "Spire defenders are magi who train themselves to accompany sages and\
  \ archaeologists who venture from the Mordant Spire, acting as aids and bodyguards.\
  \ Because they often operate in difficult terrain--narrow trenches in dig sites,\
  \ flooded dungeons, and tight corridors in ancient ruins--spire defenders place\
  \ mobility and agility at a premium. As a result, they eschew armor entirely."

    \ if the spire defender becomes proficient in light armor, he automatically gains\
    \ the magus's ability to ignore the arcane spell failure chance of light armor.\

    \ chance of arcane spell failure. If he becomes proficient in heavy armor, at\
    \ 13th level he ignores heavy armor's chance of arcane spell failure."
