  description: "At 1st level, a steelbound fighter selects one type of weapon (such\
    \ as shortswords, longbows, or heavy flails). He gains Weapon Focus with that\
    \ specific weapon. Whenever he isn't wielding or carrying at least one weapon\
    \ of this type (the weapon can be broken but not destroyed), a steelbound fighter\
    \ takes a â€“2 penalty to his Wisdom score and can't benefit from his fighter class\
    \ abilities (excluding bonus feats gained from fighter levels). Once the steelbound\
    \ fighter's weapon awakens (see steelbound awakening below), these penalties apply\
    \ whenever the fighter isn't carrying or wielding that particular weapon."

  description: "At 5th level, one non-intelligent weapon carried by the steelbound\
    \ fighter becomes possessed by the latent spiritual energies that cling to his\
    \ soul, transforming that weapon into an intelligent weapon. The weapon must be\
    \ of the type the fighter chose at 1st level as his steelbound weapon. The steelbound\
    \ weapon grants its wielder Alertness as a bonus feat as long as the weapon is\
    \ wielded. A steelbound fighter gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls\
    \ with his steelbound weapon. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level, +3 at 13th\
    \ level, +4 at 17th level, and +5 at 20th level.\nA steelbound weapon gains Intelligence,\
    \ Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 10 when it awakens, and has the same alignment\
    \ as its wielder. It communicates via empathy, and has senses that extend 30 feet.\
    \ It has 5 ranks in a skill of the steelbound fighter's choice.\nAt 9th level,\
    \ the steelbound weapon's ability scores increase to 12 and it gains the ability\
    \ to speak in its wielder's native tongue. The weapon gains the ability to cast\
    \ a 3rd-level spell once per day (the choice of the spell is made by the steelbound\
    \ fighter, but is subject to GM approval, and once chosen, it can't be changed),\
    \ with a caster level equal to the steelbound fighter's level. The spell's save\
    \ DC is based off of the item's Charisma.\nAt 13th level, the steelbound weapon's\
    \ ability scores increase to 14 and its senses extend to 120 feet. The weapon\
    \ gains a special purpose of the steelbound fighter's choice (subject to GM approval).\n\
    At 17th level, the steelbound weapon's ability scores increase to 16 and it gains\
    \ telepathy as well as darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The weapon can now\
    \ use its spell-like ability three times a day, and can select a second 3rd level\
    \ spell that it can use once per day.\nA steelbound fighter transfers the effects\
    \ of his steelbound awakening to a new weapon of the proper type automatically\
    \ after carrying that weapon on his person for 24 hours, but can have only one\
    \ weapon under the effects of steelbound awakening at any given time."
