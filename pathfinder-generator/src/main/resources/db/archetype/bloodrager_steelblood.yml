  description: "At 5th level, a steelblood learns to be more maneuverable while wearing\
    \ armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1\
    \ (to a maximum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his\
    \ armor by 1. Every 4 levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), these bonuses increase\
    \ by 1, to a maximum 4-point reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase\
    \ of the maximum Dexterity bonus. This ability stacks with the fighter class feature\
    \ of the same name."

    \ turn. This ability can be applied after an attack roll is made against the steelblood,\

    \ is high enough."
