  description: "At 3rd level, a shadow walker can manipulate nearby illumination.\
    \ At the start of each day, a shadow walker gains a number of illumination points\
    \ equal to half her rogue level and can spend illumination points to use certain\
    \ spell-like abilities. As long as she has at least 1 illumination point, she\
    \ can cast light at will.\nShe can spend 2 illumination points to cast darkness,\
    \ and 3 illumination points to cast daylight, deeper darkness, or motes of dusk\
    \ and dawn. These spell-like abilities have a caster level equal to the shadow\
    \ walker's rogue level. Using these spell-like abilities does not hamper the shadow\
    \ walker's vision; for example, she can see through the deeper darkness she creates,\
    \ and does not take penalties for light sensitivity in the area of her own daylight."

  description: "At 4th level, a shadow walker chooses one illumination level: bright\
    \ light, normal light, dim light, or darkness (including supernatural darkness).\
    \ While she is within her chosen illumination level, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative\
    \ checks and Acrobatics, Perception, and Sleight of Hand skill checks, and can\
    \ take 10 on any Stealth check attempted within that illumination level.\nWhen\
    \ the shadow walker confirms a critical hit with a melee attack that deals sneak\
    \ attack damage while in her chosen illumination level, she regains 1 illumination\
    \ point (to a maximum of half her rogue level).\nConfirming a critical hit on\
    \ a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the shadow walker's character level\
    \ doesn't restore illumination points. When the shadow walker reaches 6th level,\
    \ and every 3 rogue levels thereafter, the bonuses she gains within her chosen\
    \ illumination level increase by 1."
