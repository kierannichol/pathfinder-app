  description: "At 3rd level, a makeshift scrapper gains the ability to enhance an\
    \ item, making it a more effective weapon or changing the way it can be used.\
    \ As a swift action, she can alter a single improvised weapon to either grant\
    \ it a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls or use it to gain\
    \ a +1 shield bonus to her AC. The makeshift scrapper can use this ability for\
    \ a number of rounds per day equal to her rogue level. These rounds need not be\
    \ consecutive, and the makeshift scrapper can change the enhancement each time\
    \ she activates the ability. The bonus increases by 1 every 4 levels thereafter,\
    \ up to a maximum bonus of +5 at 19th level."
