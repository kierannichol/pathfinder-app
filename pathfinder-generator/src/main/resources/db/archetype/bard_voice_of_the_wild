    \ the Wild (Su): At 3rd level, the voice of the wild can use bardic performance\
    \ to grant an animal aspect to an ally, as if using the hunter's animal focus\
    \ class feature. The ally must be able to hear or see the performance. The voice\
    \ of the wild uses his bard level as his hunter level for determining the effect\
    \ of the animal aspect. The bard can affect a second ally with this performance\
    \ at 10th level and a third at 17th level. Song of the wild relies on audible\
    \ or visual components."
