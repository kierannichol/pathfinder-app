    \ failure chance due to armor she is wearing by 15% for any spells she casts this\
    \ round. This reduction increases to 20% at 7th level, 25% at 11th level, and\
    \ 30% at 15th level. In addition, if she has Arcane Armor Training or Arcane Armor\
    \ Mastery, rather than having their normal effects, each of those feats increases\
    \ the arcane spell failure reduction of her eldritch armor training by 10%."

  description: "Starting at 5th level, the spellcasting ability of a child of war\
    \ increases to allow her to cast a limited number of spells drawn from the bloodrager\
    \ spell list. She automatically adds to her spellbook a number of 1st-level bloodrager\
    \ spells equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. Her caster level for these spells\
    \ is equal to her fighter level, and the bloodrager class spell list is considered\
    \ to be her class spell list for the purposes of meeting prerequisites and using\
    \ magic items.\nShe uses the ranger's spells per day, but uses her Intelligence\
    \ score to determine her bonus spells and spell saving throw DCs, just as a wizard\
    \ does. She does not gain any other wizard abilities, such as an arcane bond or\
    \ school.\nEach time she attains a new fighter level, she gains one bloodrager\
    \ spell of her choice to add to her spellbook. The free spells must be of spell\
    \ levels she can cast. She otherwise follows the rules for a wizard regarding\
    \ her spellbook and learning or preparing spells."
