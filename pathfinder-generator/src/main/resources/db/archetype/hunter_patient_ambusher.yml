description: "Wandering the wilds, some hunters eschew the bond of innate teamwork\
  \ with their animal companions. Instead, these hunters master the creation and deployment\
  \ of intricate ranger traps, often using themselves or their animal companions to\
  \ lure foes into their snares."

  description: "At 10th level, a patient ambusher can affix a magical ranger trap\
    \ to an arrow, a crossbow bolt, or a thrown weapon, allowing her to set the trap\
    \ remotely or use it as a direct attack. Attaching the trap to the projectile\
    \ is part of the full-round action to create a new trap. The trapped projectile\
    \ is fired or thrown in the normal manner. If fired at a square, the trap is treated\
    \ as if the hunter had set the trap in that square, except the DC is 5 lower than\
    \ normal. If the trap is fired at a creature, the target takes damage from the\
    \ ranged weapon and is treated as if it had triggered the trap (attempting a saving\
    \ throw, if any). The attack has a maximum range of 60 feet, and penalties from\
    \ range increments apply on the attack roll. The duration of the trap starts when\
    \ it is created, not when it is triggered."
