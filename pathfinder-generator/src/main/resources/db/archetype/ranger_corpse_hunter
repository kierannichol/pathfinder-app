    \ in areas where corpses are interred, such as graveyards, catacombs, crypts,\
    \ or necropolises. When in such an environment, the corpse hunter may move at\
    \ his normal speed without taking damage or suffering any impairment, although\
    \ any magical effects and enchantments that impair movement still affect him."

  description: "At 8th level, a corpse hunter can channel his will into any weapon\
    \ he wields, making it effective against incorporeal undead. A corpse hunter may\
    \ imbue a single wielded weapon with the ghost touch special ability as a swift\
    \ action, causing it to deal damage normally against incorporeal creatures. The\
    \ corpse hunter may use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to half\
    \ his ranger level; these rounds need not be consecutive. The corpse hunter can\
    \ end this ability as a free action."
