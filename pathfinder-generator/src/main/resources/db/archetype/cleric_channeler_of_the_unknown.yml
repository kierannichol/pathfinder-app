    \ The weapon chosen cannot be one associated with her former deity.\nOnce she\

    \ of her level would deal by channeling negative energy, except it affects living,\
    \ unliving, and undead creatures alike. This functions in all other ways as a\
    \ cleric's channel energy class feature, including benefiting from feats that\
    \ affect channel energy (such as Selective Channeling)."
