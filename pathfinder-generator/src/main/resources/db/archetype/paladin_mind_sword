  description: "At 2nd level, a mind sword can make a telekinetic attack with a melee\
    \ weapon. This functions as the hand of the apprentice universalist wizard school\
    \ ability, but any calculations of that ability based on Intelligence are instead\
    \ based on Charisma. At 6th level, a mind sword can expend two uses of this ability\
    \ as a full-round action to attack the same opponent multiple times, as if using\
    \ the full-attack action. At 12th level, a mind sword can expend one use of this\
    \ ability as a full-round action to combine melee attacks and ranged attacks aimed\
    \ at different targets within 60 feet as part of a single full-attack action."
