  description: "At 1st level, as an immediate action, a flowing monk can attempt a\
    \ reposition or trip combat maneuver against a creature that the flowing monk\
    \ threatens and that attacks him. If the combat maneuver is successful, the attacker\
    \ is sickened for 1 round (Reflex DC = 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + monk's Wisdom\
    \ modifier to halve the duration), plus 1 additional round at 4th level and for\
    \ every four levels afterward (to a maximum of 6 rounds at 20th level). The monk\
    \ gains a +2 bonus on the reposition or trip combat maneuver check and the save\
    \ DC for redirection increases by 2 if the attacker is using Power Attack or is\
    \ charging when attacking him. The benefit increases to a +4 bonus and an increase\
    \ of the saving throw by 4 if both apply.\nAt 4th level, a flowing monk can use\
    \ redirection against an opponent that the flowing monk threatens and that attacks\
    \ an ally with a melee attack. At 8th level, a flowing monk can make both a reposition\
    \ and a trip maneuver as part of a single immediate action with this ability.\
    \ At 12th level, a flowing monk can use redirection against any opponent that\
    \ attacks him in melee, even if the flowing monk is not threatening the opponent\
    \ who attacks him. A flowing monk can use this ability once per day per monk level,\
    \ but no more than once per round.\nThis ability replaces Stunning Fist."

  description: "At 5th level, as an immediate action, a flowing monk may spend 2 points\
    \ from his ki pool to attempt a Reflex save opposed by an attacker's attack roll\
    \ to halve damage from that attack. At 11th level and above, the flowing monk\
    \ suffers no damage on a successful save, or half damage on a failed save. If\
    \ the attacker is flanking the monk, the flanking opponent who is not attacking\
    \ becomes the target of the attack. Use the same attack roll, and if the attack\
    \ hits the new target, that creatures takes half damage (or full damage if the\
    \ attack is completely avoided). Any associated effects from the attack (such\
    \ as bleed, poison, or spell effects) apply fully even if the attack deals only\
    \ half damage.\nThis ability replaces purity of body and diamond body."
