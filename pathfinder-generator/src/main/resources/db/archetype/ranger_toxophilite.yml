  description: "At 3rd level, a toxophilite can ready a ranged attack to deflect a\
    \ ranged weapon attack against her or an ally within 30 feet. To deflect the attack,\
    \ the toxophilite makes an attack with a ranged weapon. If her attack roll is\
    \ greater than the attacking opponent's roll, the opponent's initial attack automatically\
    \ misses. For each size category the attacking creature is larger than the toxophilite,\
    \ the toxophilite takes a â€“4 penalty on her attack roll. The toxophilite must\
    \ declare the use of this ability after the attack is announced, but before the\
    \ roll is made. Unusually massive ranged weapons, such as boulders or ballista\
    \ bolts, and ranged attacks by firearms or generated by natural attacks or spell\
    \ effects can't be deflected."

    \ readied action at any time before her next turn. Her attack roll to intercept\
    \ uses the same bonuses as the attack she chose to forgo during her previous action."
