  description: "At 1st level, a hungry ghost monk gains Punishing Kick as a bonus\
    \ feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 10th level, and every five\
    \ levels thereafter, the monk can push the target of his Punishing Kick an additional\
    \ 5 feet (10 feet at 10th level, 15 feet at 15th level, and 20 feet at 20th level).\
    \ At 15th level, he can instead choose to push the target 5 feet and knock the\
    \ target prone with the same attack. The target still gets a saving throw to avoid\
    \ being knocked prone."

  description: "At 5th level, a hungry ghost monk can steal ki from other creatures,\
    \ though this ability is controversial in some circles of monks, who see it as\
    \ nothing less than a form of vampirism. If the monk scores a confirmed critical\
    \ hit against a living enemy or reduces a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points,\
    \ he can steal some of that creature's ki. This ability replenishes 1 spent ki\
    \ point to the monk's ki pool, as long as the monk has at least 1 ki point in\
    \ his pool. He cannot exceed his ki pool's maximum. At 11th level, each time the\
    \ monk successfully steals ki, he can make an immediate saving throw against one\
    \ disease he is suffering from. There is no penalty for failing this saving throw.\
    \ The monk gains a bonus equal to his Wisdom modifier on the saving throw.\nThis\
    \ ability replaces purity of body."

  description: "At 7th level, a hungry ghost monk can steal a creature's life force\
    \ to replenish his own. If the monk has at least 1 ki point in his ki pool and\
    \ scores a confirmed critical hit against a living enemy or reduces a living enemy\
    \ to 0 or fewer hit points, he heals a number of hit points equal to his monk\
    \ level. As with steal ki, some monks believe that life funnel is an unsavory\
    \ act, no better than what the undead do to the living. A monk with this ability\
    \ cannot steal both ki and hit points at the same time.\nThis ability replaces\
    \ wholeness of body."

    \ a critical hit against any creature or reduces any creature to 0 or fewer hit\
    \ points.\nThis ability replaces diamond body."
