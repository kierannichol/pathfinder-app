  description: "At 3rd level, a divine defender can spend one use of her lay on hands\
    \ ability as a standard action to grant all adjacent allies (including paladins)\
    \ a bonus. At 3rd level, adjacent allies receive a +1 sacred bonus to their AC\
    \ and CMD and on their saving throws. These bonuses last for a number of rounds\
    \ equal to the divine defender's Charisma modifier. At 9th level and 15th level,\
    \ this bonus increases by +1. At 6th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies\
    \ within 10 feet, and allies that are at fewer than 0 hit points within this area\
    \ are automatically stabilized. At 12th level, these bonuses are granted to all\
    \ allies within 15 feet, and allies within this area are immune to bleed damage.\
    \ At 18th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 20 feet, and allies\
    \ within this area gain a 25% chance to negate any sneak attack or critical hit\
    \ scored against them. This ability does not stack with the chance provided from\
    \ the light, medium, or heavy fortification armor special abilities. These bonuses\
    \ are cumulative with each other. Allies only benefit from these bonuses while\
    \ in the listed area."

  description: "At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or\
    \ a mount, a divine defender can form a bond with her armor. As a standard action,\
    \ a divine defender can enhance her armor by calling upon the aid of a celestial\
    \ spirit. This bond lasts for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit\
    \ causes the armor to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants\
    \ the armor a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the armor\
    \ gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These\
    \ bonuses can be added to the armor, stacking with existing armor bonuses to a\
    \ maximum of +3, or they can be used to add any of the following armor properties:\n\
    champion, ghost touch, heavy fortification, invulnerability, light fortification,\
    \ moderate fortification, spell resistance (13, 15, 17, or 19)\nAdding these properties\
    \ consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost. In addition, the bonuses\
    \ can be consumed at the listed amount to add any of the following armor properties:\
    \ energy resistance for +3 bonus, improved energy resistance for +5 bonus, or\
    \ righteous for +4 bonus. These bonuses are added to any properties the armor\
    \ already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the armor is not magical,\
    \ at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can\
    \ be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when\
    \ the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again.\
    \ The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the armor is worn by anyone other\
    \ than the divine defender, but it resumes giving bonuses if the divine defender\
    \ dons the armor again. A divine defender can use this ability once per day at\
    \ 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th,\
    \ to a total of four times per day at 17th level.\nIf a suit of armor with a celestial\
    \ spirit is destroyed, the divine defender loses the use of this ability for 30\
    \ days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day\
    \ period, the divine defender takes a â€“1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls."
