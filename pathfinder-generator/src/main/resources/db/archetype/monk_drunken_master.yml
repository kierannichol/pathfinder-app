  description: "At 3rd level, a drunken master can drink a tankard of ale or strong\
    \ alcohol and gain one temporary ki point. The act of drinking is a standard action\
    \ that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The monk can have a maximum number\
    \ of drunken ki points equal to 1 plus one additional point for every two levels\
    \ thereafter (5th, 7th, and so on). The monk can gain this temporary ki even before\
    \ he gains a ki pool at 4th level. These drunken ki points last for 1 hour or\
    \ until spent, whichever is shorter. As long as he has at least 1 drunken ki point,\
    \ the monk can spend 1 ki point as a swift action to move 5 feet without provoking\
    \ attacks of opportunity."
