description: "Some say that the sniper is the worst kind of assassin: a killer who\
  \ waits silently in the shadows and then strikes from a distance without remorse.\
  \ Snipers, of course, understand that such protestations about “cowardice\"and “\
  honor\"regarding their profession are in fact merely the bleatings of sheep fearing\
  \ the slaughter and pay them no heed. Most snipers take pride in their formidable\
  \ abilities, which allow them to take life quickly, quietly, and efficiently, then\
  \ disappear into their surroundings without a trace."
