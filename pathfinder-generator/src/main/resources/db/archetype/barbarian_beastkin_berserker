    \ a specific kind of creature with the animal type (such as a badger or a triceratops).\
    \ She adds half her level (minimum 1) on Handle Animal, Intimidate, and Sense\
    \ Motive checks involving the chosen type of animal.\nAt 5th level and every 5\
    \ levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th levels), the beastkin berserker can\

  description: "At 4th level, when entering a rage, a beastkin berserker can take\
    \ the form of a Small or Medium animal. This functions as beast shape I, except\
    \ the duration is for as long as the beastkin berserker rages and the animal must\
    \ be one she has chosen with her savage rapport.\nAt 8th level, the beastkin berserker\
    \ can use feral transformation to take the form of a Large or Tiny animal that\
    \ she has chosen with her savage rapport. Feral transformation now acts as beast\
    \ shape II.\nAt 12th level, a beastkin berserker is able to use feral transformation\
    \ to take the form of a Huge or Diminutive animal that she has chosen with her\
    \ savage rapport. Feral transformation now functions as beast shape III."
