  description: "The totem-bonded adopts a powerful animal native to the region-often\
    \ one suited to the cold tundra-selected from the following list: aurochs, badger,\
    \ bear, big cat, elk, giant raven, mastodon, rhinoceros, walrus, wolf, or any\
    \ creature categorized as megafauna. At the GM's discretion, she can select other\
    \ animal companions.\nIn addition, a 7th-level totem-bonded's animal companion\
    \ can grow further. If the animal companion's natural size is Large but it is\
    \ normally available as a Medium animal companion at 7th level (such as a bear),\
    \ the totem-bonded can have the companion increase in size. To generate statistics\
    \ for such a creature, apply the following modifications: Size Large; AC +1 natural\
    \ armor; Ability Scores Str +4, Dex -2, Con +2. Increase the damage of each of\
    \ the companion's natural attacks by one die size."

  description: "At 1st level, the connection the totem-bonded has with her animal\
    \ companion allows them to draw upon one another's strength. The totem-bonded\
    \ can activate this ability as a swift action, and she can use it for a number\
    \ of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive,\
    \ but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The effect ends immediately if\
    \ the animal companion is ever more than 100 feet away from the totem-bonded.\n\
    While the shared strength ability is active, the totem-bonded manifests one aspect\
    \ of her animal companion drawn from the following list: low-light vision, scent,\
    \ +1 bonus to natural armor, +10-foot bonus to speed, climb speed 30 feet, swim\
    \ speed 40 feet, 2 claws (1d4), bite (1d6), gore (1d6), or slam (1d6); the natural\
    \ attacks are all primary attacks, and the listed damage is for a Medium creature.\
    \ The totem-bonded can select only a movement speed or natural attack that her\
    \ animal companion also has, and an aspect cannot cause her speed or size to exceed\
    \ that of her animal companion with this ability. At 8th level, the totem-bonded\
    \ manifests two aspects of her animal companion, and she adds the following to\
    \ her list of available aspects: +20-foot bonus to speed, fly speed 50 feet (average),\
    \ increased size (as enlarge person), and powerful charge (doubles the damage\
    \ dice dealt by the granted gore or slam attack). At 15th level, the damage dealt\
    \ by any natural attacks granted by this ability increases by two die steps.\n\
    A totem-bonded's animal companion also benefits from the shared strength ability,\
    \ and while it is active, the animal understands the totem-bonded's known languages\
    \ and can be pushed to perform an unfamiliar trick as a free action. At 8th level,\
    \ the animal companion gains a +1 bonus on saving throws and a +2 bonus on checks\
    \ with each skill in which it has at least 1 rank. At 15th level, the animal companion's\
    \ bonuses on saving throws and skill checks increase to +2 and +4 respectively."
