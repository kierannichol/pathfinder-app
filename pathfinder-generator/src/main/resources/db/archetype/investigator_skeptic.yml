  description: "At 1st level, a skeptic's knowledge of haunts allows her to notice\
    \ them with ease, regardless of the methods by which the haunts make their presence\
    \ known in the realm of the living. The skeptic adds 1/2 her level to all skill\
    \ checks to notice haunts. If she notices a haunt, she adds this same bonus to\
    \ any initiative check made as a result of that haunt activating. This bonus is\
    \ an insight bonus."

    \ that trickery or hoaxing is at hand. This mindset helps to set the skeptic at\
    \ ease even when confronted by the most terrifying of situations, be the source\
    \ of that fear mundane or legitimately supernatural. At 2nd level, a skeptic gains\
    \ a +1 insight bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities\
    \ used to falsely create the impression of a supernatural presence, as well as\
    \ a +1 insight bonus on saving throws caused by the effects of actual haunts or\
    \ incorporeal undead. This bonus increases to +2 at 5th level, and to +3 at 8th\
    \ level. At 11th level, a skeptic is immune to fear effects."

    \ to channel positive energy or wield spells capable of doing the same, but the\
    \ skeptic learns methods of using her own convictions to accomplish the same feat.\
    \ At 4th level, as a standard action, a skeptic can focus her willpower to damage\
    \ an active haunt. She must be within a haunt's area to smite the haunt. When\
    \ the skeptic uses this ability, she deals an amount of damage to the haunt equal\
    \ to her studied strike bonus."

    \ another without lethally harming the possessed creature. To make an exorcising\
    \ strike, the skeptic must make a touch attack against the possessed creature.\
    \ On a hit, she damages the possessing creature or entity, dealing an amount of\
    \ lethal damage equal to her studied strike bonus damage.\nThe possessed creature\
    \ takes this amount of damage as nonlethal damage at the same time."
