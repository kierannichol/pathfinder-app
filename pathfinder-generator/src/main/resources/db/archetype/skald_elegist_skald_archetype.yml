  description: "By using music, oration, and similar performances, an elegist can\
    \ call forth a physical manifestation of the sorrow of his tales. This functions\
    \ as a spiritualist‘s phantom with the despair focus. He can manifest his melancholic\
    \ apparition as a standard action and dismiss it as a free action. The phantom\
    \ appears adjacent to the skald and can act immediately. The melancholic apparition\
    \ is immediately dismissed if the elegist is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked\
    \ unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to\
    \ maintain the performance that keeps the phantom manifested. At 1st level, an\
    \ elegist can keep his apparition manifested for a total number of rounds each\
    \ day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. For each skald level beyond 1st, he\
    \ can manifest his apparition 2 additional rounds per day.\nUnlike a spiritualist‘\
    s phantom, a melancholic apparition can't be harbored in the elegist's consciousness.\
    \ When manifested, the melancholic apparition has the same number of hit points\
    \ it had when previously manifested that day. It regains all of its hit points\
    \ when the elegist regains his spells for the day. If the melancholic apparition\
    \ is slain, the elegist can manifest it again in the same day by spending a number\
    \ of additional rounds ot'this ability equal to half his skald level (minimum\
    \ 1); the melancholic apparition returns with half its normal total of hit points."
