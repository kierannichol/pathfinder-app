  description: "A clocksmith forms a bond with one of his clockwork creations and\
    \ begins play with a constructed familiar. He must select this familiar as his\
    \ arcane bond. The constructed familiar functions as a typical familiar of its\
    \ type except as noted here.\nThe construct familiar is always a construct with\
    \ the clockwork subtype. A construct familiar grants only half of its typical\
    \ bonus (minimum +1 bonus) from its special familiar ability to its master."
