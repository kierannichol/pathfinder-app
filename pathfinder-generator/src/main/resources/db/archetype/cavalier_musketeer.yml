  description: "At 1st level, a musketeer is gifted by his order with a firearm (either\
    \ a pistol or a musket). This weapon is both a symbol of the cavalier's duty and\
    \ a focus for much of his talent. He cannot sell this weapon. He also gains the\
    \ Gunsmithing feat. Beginning at 8th level, the musketeer can focus himself when\
    \ wielding his gifted weapon. As a standard action, he can focus himself to gain\
    \ a number of benefits for 1 minute per cavalier level. The musketeer can use\
    \ this ability twice per day, plus one additional time per day for every four\
    \ levels beyond 8th, to a total of five times per day at 20th level.\nAt 8th level,\
    \ the cavalier gains the benefit of the Improved Critical feat. At 11th level,\
    \ he can reduce the misfire chance of his weapon by 1 (to a minimum of 1, and\
    \ at 17th level, the musketeer can double the range increment of his weapon. These\
    \ abilities do not stack with the magical weapon special abilities that they duplicate.\
    \ Finally, at 20th level, during a period of such focus, the musketeer can engage\
    \ in a flurry of gunfire. The cavalier can expend one of his daily challenges\
    \ to make a full attack with his firearm. The musketeer ignores the normal load\
    \ times for his weapon, but must still expend enough doses of powder and enough\
    \ bullets to complete each attack.\nIf the musketeer's gifted firearm is destroyed,\
    \ the cavalier loses this ability for 30 days while a replacement weapon is crafted\
    \ for him. During this 30-day period, the musketeer takes a â€“1 penalty on weapon\
    \ and damage rolls."
