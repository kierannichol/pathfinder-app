  \ others and restrict their practices to the healing arts. They often take the place\
  \ of clerics in rural communities and may wander the countryside servicing the needs\
  \ of several small communities."

  description: "A hedge witch can minister to a diseased or poisoned target, redirecting\
    \ the affliction into herself. For a poisoned target, the witch must tend to him\
    \ as a standard action; he makes his next saving throw against the poison as normal,\
    \ but the witch suffers the effects of the failed save instead of the poisoned\
    \ creature. For a diseased target, the witch must tend to the sick person for\
    \ an hour; he makes his next saving throw against the disease as normal, but the\
    \ witch suffers the effects of the failed save instead of the diseased creature.\
    \ The witch does not actually become poisoned or diseased (and is not contagious\
    \ and does not need to be cured), but suffers the effects of the affliction as\
    \ if she had been. The witch normally uses this ability to extend the life of\
    \ someone near death, giving him time to recover. This ability has no effect if\
    \ the witch is immune to disease or poison.\nThis replaces the witch's hex gained\
    \ at 8th level.\nHexes: The following witch hexes complement the hedge witch archetype:\
    \ cauldron, feral speech [UM], healing, tongues.\nMajor Hexes: The following major\
    \ hexes complement the hedge witch archetype: major healing, weather control,\
    \ witch's brew [UM]."
