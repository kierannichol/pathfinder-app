  description: "A primal warden's spirit is ever shifting, and the spells it grants\
    \ the primal warden change from moment to moment.\nWhen the primal warden would\
    \ spontaneously cast a 1st- through 8th-level spell using the spirit magic class\
    \ feature, she produces a random spell from the list of shaman spells of 1 spell\
    \ level higher than the spell slot expended; use an appropriate die or another\
    \ randomization method to determine the spell. When she would spontaneously cast\
    \ a 9th-level spell using spirit magic, she instead casts a random 9th-level spell\
    \ from the shaman spell list, treating her caster level as 2 higher.\nThere is\
    \ no way to predict the spell before the shaman begins casting it using spirit\
    \ magic, and she cannot enhance the spell using metamagic feats. The spell uses\
    \ the shaman's caster level, even if that caster level would normally be too low\
    \ to cast the spell. There are 47 potential 2nd-level spells, 46 potential 3rd-level\
    \ spells, 41 potential 4th-level spells, 30 potential 5th-level spells, 22 potential\
    \ 6th-level spells, 22 potential 7th-level spells, 18 potential 8th-level spells,\
    \ and 14 potential 9th-level spells.\nAt 8th level, after determining the spell\
    \ that she would cast using spirit magic, once per day as a free action, the primal\
    \ warden shaman can choose to randomly select another spell instead, using the\
    \ same method of randomization as she used before (if she obtains the same result\
    \ a second time, she must keep that result). At 12th level and every 4 shaman\
    \ levels thereafter, she can choose to randomly select a different spirit magic\
    \ spell one additional time per day, up to a maximum of four times per day at\
    \ 20th level. She cannot use this ability more than once in the same round."
