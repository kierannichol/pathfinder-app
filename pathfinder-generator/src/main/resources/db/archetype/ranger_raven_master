    \ Ravens allows her to add a limited number of bard spells to her spell list.\

    \ manner as her other ranger spells.\nAt 6th level, the raven master selects one\
    \ 1st-level bard spell of her choice and adds it to her spell list as a 1st-level\
    \ ranger spell. At 9th level she does the same but for a 2nd-level bard spell.\
    \ She adds a 3rd-level bard spell at 12th level, and adds a 4th-level bard spell\
    \ at 15th level."
