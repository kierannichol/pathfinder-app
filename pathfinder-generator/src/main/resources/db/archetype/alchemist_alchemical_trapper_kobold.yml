  description: "At 2nd level, an alchemical trapper can use one of her bombs to make\
    \ a trap. Setting a bomb trap is a full-round action that provokes attacks of\
    \ opportunity. A bomb trap fills a single 5-foot square and cannot be placed in\
    \ the same area as any other trap. The alchemical trapper needs the same materials\
    \ required for making a bomb. The DCs for Perception checks to notice the trap,\
    \ Disable Device checks to disable it, and saving throws to avoid it are equal\
    \ to the DC for the alchemical trapper's bombs. All bomb traps have location triggers\
    \ and do not reset. The alchemical trapper can use any one discovery that applies\
    \ to a bomb when making a bomb trap. The bomb trap lasts 10 minutes for each alchemist\
    \ level the trapper possesses. If the bomb trap is not disabled or exploded within\
    \ that time frame, the trap becomes inert.\nCreating a bomb trap uses one of the\
    \ alchemical trapper's bombs per day."
