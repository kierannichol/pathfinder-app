  description: "At 1st level, a dreamthief selects an emotional focus from among those\
    \ available to a spiritualist's phantom.\nShe gains the abilities granted by that\
    \ emotional focus (with the exception of the focus determining her good saving\
    \ throws--she retains the typical rogue saves). For each of the two skills associated\
    \ with that emotional focus, a dreamthief gains ranks in that skill equal to her\
    \ rogue level; this does not allow her ranks in these skills to exceed her Hit\
    \ Dice.\nA dreamthief is considered to be both a phantom and a spiritualist for\
    \ the purpose of emotional focus abilities whose effect references both a phantom\
    \ and a spiritualist, such as dutiful strike, and she treats her rogue level as\
    \ both her spiritualist level and her phantom Hit Dice when determining abilities\
    \ and save DCs.\nOnce per round when a dreamthief makes a melee attack, she can\
    \ declare that attack to be a dreamstrike. This does not require an action, but\
    \ a dreamthief must declare a dreamstrike before making the attack roll. A dreamstrike\
    \ is treated as a slam attack for the purpose of emotional focus abilities that\
    \ apply to a phantom's slam attacks, such as miserable strike. At 20th level,\
    \ any melee attack a dreamthief makes automatically gains this benefit."
