    \ round of rage and take an additional –2 penalty to Intelligence to take on a\
    \ single ability of the valid consumed creature whose flesh she ate most recently.\
    \ For the purpose of this ability, a valid consumed creature is any dead animal,\
    \ dragon, humanoid, or magical beast that died and was consumed by the flesheater\
    \ within the past 24 hours. She can choose any ability listed under beast shape\
    \ I, as long as the creature possessed that ability.\nAt 5th level, the flesheater\
    \ can take on any number of the creature's abilities that are listed under beast\
    \ shape I. At 8th level, the flesheater can instead take on one of the creature's\
    \ abilities listed under beast shape II. The flesheater's appearance alters to\
    \ resemble the consumed creature, but she does not change shape. This is a polymorph\
    \ effect."
