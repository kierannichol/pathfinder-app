  \ Instead, she invites the spirits to share her body, granting them the chance to\
  \ experience corporeal existence. In return, they grant her their skills and protect\

    \ skills must use the same ability score. The possessed shaman treats these skills\

    \ her Wisdom modifier in place of the ability modifier the skills would normally\
    \ use. If either of the skills are class skills, she receives the usual +3 bonus\
    \ on those skill checks for having ranks in those skills. These ranks do not stack\

  description: "At 2nd level, whenever a possessed shaman fails a saving throw against\
    \ a charm or compulsion spell or effect, she can attempt a new saving throw (using\
    \ the original DC) at the end of her next turn as the spirits inside her attempt\
    \ to regain control. If the saving throw is successful, the charm or compulsion\
    \ effect ends. If the saving throw fails, she is affected as normal for the remainder\
    \ of the duration."

  description: "At 6th level, a possessed shaman is able to make room for another\
    \ spirit. When choosing her wandering spirit for the day, the possessed shaman\
    \ chooses one skill. The possessed shaman treats this skill as if she had a number\
    \ of ranks in it equal to her shaman level, and uses her Wisdom modifier in place\
    \ of the ability modifier the skill would normally use. If the skill is a class\
    \ skill, she receives the usual +3 bonus on skill checks for having ranks in that\
    \ skill. Each time the possessed shaman changes her wandering spirit, she can\
    \ also change the skill gained through this ability. These ranks do not stack\
    \ with her other skill ranks (only the higher number of ranks applies)."
