  description: "At 7th level, while a pack rager is raging, she grants a single teamwork\
    \ feat she knows to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear her. She chooses\
    \ the feat at the start of the rage, and cannot change it during the rage. An\
    \ ally who moves more than 30 feet away from the raging pack rager loses access\
    \ to the feat, but regains it again each time he moves back within 30 feet of\
    \ the raging pack rager. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of these\
    \ teamwork feats.\nAt 13th level, the pack rager chooses two teamwork feats when\
    \ she enters a rage, and grants her allies the use of both of those feats when\
    \ they are within 30 feet of her.\nAt 16th level, the pack rager grants these\
    \ teamwork feats as long as her allies are within 60 feet of her.\nAt 19th level,\
    \ the pack rager chooses three teamwork feats when she enters a rage, and grants\
    \ her allies the use of all three feats when they are within 60 feet of her."
