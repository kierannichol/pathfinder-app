  description: "A gingerbread witch concocts her familiar out of gingerbread, sugar,\
    \ and other confections.\nIt has the shape of the original animal or vermin, but\
    \ its type changes to construct. As a construct, it gains 60-foot darkvision and\
    \ construct immunities, it loses any special abilities the animal or vermin has\
    \ other than movement speed, and it doesn't provide the usual familiar benefit\
    \ (for instance, a gingerbread toad doesn't provide 3 bonus hit points). With\
    \ a supply of flour and sugar at hand, the gingerbread witch can spend 8 hours\
    \ and use her cauldron to restore her familiar to full health at no cost, unless\
    \ the familiar is destroyed, in which case she must follow the usual rules for\
    \ replacing her familiar.\nA gingerbread witch can never gain an improved familiar."

    \ as per the scar hex for a number of days equal to the witch's witch level, except\
    \ that at extended range, the witch can use only harmful hexes on the creature.\n\
    She can create a number of sweets each day equal to her Intelligence modifier\

  description: "At 8th level, a gingerbread witch can use shadow conjuration as a\
    \ spell-like ability. Items and creatures she conjures appear to be made of fanciful\
    \ foodstuffs, and because of this, sentient creatures gain a +2 bonus on Will\
    \ saves to disbelieve the illusion. However, they otherwise function as described\
    \ for the shadow conjuration spell. For every 3 witch levels beyond 8th, the gingerbread\
    \ witch can duplicate conjuration (creation) and conjuration (summoning) spells\
    \ of 1 level higher, up to a maximum of 7th-level spell effects at 20th level\
    \ (though they are still only 20% real). The witch can use this ability once per\
    \ day for every 4 witch levels she has."

  description: "At 12th level, a gingerbread witch gains a bite attack that deals\
    \ 1d6 points of damage for a Medium witch. As a full-round action, she can make\
    \ a single bite attack that deals double base damage (2d6 for a Medium witch)\
    \ and functions as if she had the grab and swallow whole special attacks, allowing\
    \ her to grab and swallow a creature of her size or smaller. Her stomach doesn't\
    \ deal damage to swallowed creatures, but a living creature she swallows must\
    \ succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 her witch level + Constitution modifier)\
    \ at the beginning of each of its turns or become nauseated for 1 round.\nIf a\
    \ gingerbread witch successfully swallows a creature, her torso distends grotesquely\
    \ and she is treated as if she were carrying a heavy load if the creature is the\
    \ same size and a medium load if it's one size smaller; regardless, she can swallow\
    \ only one such creature at a time. Creatures two or more sizes smaller do not\
    \ distend her belly, though every four creatures of a smaller size count as one\
    \ creature one size category larger (she can swallow 4 Tiny, 16 Diminutive, or\
    \ 64 Fine creatures). She can regurgitate a swallowed creature of her choice as\
    \ a move action, leaving it prone in an adjacent open square. If she is struck\
    \ with a confirmed critical hit while she has a creature swallowed, the swallowed\
    \ creatures each take half as much damage as the witch does (this doesn't reduce\
    \ the damage the gingerbread witch takes)."
