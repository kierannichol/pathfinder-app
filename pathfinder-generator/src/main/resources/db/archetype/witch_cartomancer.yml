  description: "Each cartomancer carries a special harrow deck that allows her to\
    \ communicate with her patron. Its ability to hold spells functions identically\
    \ to the way a witch's spells are granted by her familiar. The cartomancer must\
    \ consult her harrow deck each day to prepare her spells and cannot prepare spells\
    \ that are not stored in the deck. The spell deck cannot be used for this purpose\
    \ if any cards are missing.\nThis ability replaces the witch's familiar.\nThe\
    \ following familiar ability works differently for a cartomancer."

  description: "At 2nd level, a cartomancer gains the Deadly Dealer feat as a bonus\
    \ feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. The cartomancer gains the\

    \ Dealer.\nThis replaces the witch's 2nd-level hex.\nHexes: The following witch\
    \ hexes complement the cartomancer archetype: evil eye, fortune, misfortune, soothsayer.\n\
    Major Hexes: The following major hexes complement the cartomancer archetype: harrowing\
    \ curse (see below), vision."
