    \ of many styles may select a bonus style feat or the Elemental Fist feat. He\
    \ does not need to meet the prerequisites of that feat, except the Elemental Fist\
    \ feat. Starting at 6th level, a master of many styles can choose to instead gain\
    \ a wildcard style slot. Whenever he enters one or more styles, he can spend his\
    \ wildcard style slots to gain feats in those styles' feat paths (such as Earth\
    \ Child Topple) as long as he meets the prerequisites. Each time he changes styles,\
    \ he can also change these wildcard style slots."

  description: "At 1st level, a master of many styles can fuse two of the styles he\
    \ knows into a more perfect style. The master of many styles can have two style\
    \ feat stances active at once. Starting a stance provided by a style feat is still\
    \ a swift action, but when the master of many styles switches to another style\
    \ feat, he can choose one style whose stance is already active to persist. He\
    \ may only have two style feat stances active at a time.\nAt 8th level, the master\
    \ of many styles can fuse three styles at once. He can have the stances of three\
    \ style feats active at the same time. He gains a bonus on attack rolls equal\
    \ to the number of styles whose stances he currently has active. Furthermore,\
    \ he can enter up to three stances as a swift action.\nAt 15th level, the master\
    \ of many styles can fuse four styles at once. He can have the stances of four\
    \ style feats active at the same time. Furthermore, he can enter up to four stances\
    \ as a free action by spending 1 point from his ki pool.\nThis ability replaces\
    \ flurry of blows."
