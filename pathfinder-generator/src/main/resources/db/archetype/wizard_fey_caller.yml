  description: "A fey caller must select a familiar as his arcane bond. This familiar\
    \ is often the fey creature that was created when the fey caller's soul passed\
    \ through the fey on the way to being born. The familiar counts as both an animal\
    \ and a fey for the purposes of effects that depend on its type, rather than counting\
    \ as a magical beast.\nIt gains only half the normal natural armor bonus for a\
    \ familiar based on the fey caller's level (rounded down, minimum 0), and it doesn't\
    \ grant its special familiar ability to its master. Instead, the familiar gains\
    \ the fey-touched creature template (see sidebar). At 10th level, the familiar\
    \ grows a pair of delicate, gossamer wings, gaining a fly speed equal to its land\
    \ speed and average maneuverability. If the familiar could already fly, its maneuverability\
    \ improves by one step instead."

  description: "A fey caller is able to conjure fey creatures. He gains Augment Summoning\
    \ as a bonus feat. He adds the following creatures to the summon monster list\
    \ of the same level, allowing him to summon them with the appropriate summon monster\
    \ spell:\n1st--grimple (gremlin), mite, sprite; 2nd--atomie, fuath (gremlin),\
    \ nixie; 3rd-- leprechaun, nuglub (gremlin), pooka; 4th--kelpie, korred, twigjack;\
    \ 5th--lampad, lurker in light, swan maiden; 6th--cold rider, oceanid, sangoi;\
    \ 7th--alp, bogeyman, ijiraq; 8th--banelight, fastachee, rusalka; 9th--ankou,\
    \ kamaitachi, wild hunt archer.\nThis ability is a function of the fey caller\
    \ himself, and it applies even if he uses a scroll, wand, or other magic item\
    \ to cast a summon monster spell. If he creates such an item and it is used by\
    \ another character, the spell functions as an ordinary summon monster spell."

  description: "At 10th level, a fey callers can reshape the nearby area at his whim,\
    \ as he pulls in aspects of the mutable and primal fey. To use this ability, he\
    \ must expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher as a standard action and succeed\
    \ at a DC 15 Charisma check. If he succeeds, he can apply one of the following\
    \ planar traits to the area in a 60-foot radius for 2d4 minutes: normal gravity,\
    \ heavy gravity, light gravity, mildly aligned (chaos, evil, good, or law), enhanced\
    \ magic, or impeded magic.\nAt 15th level, he can instead expend a slot of 7th\
    \ level or higher and attempt a DC 20 Charisma check. If successfully, he can\
    \ apply two planar traits from the previous list, or any one of the following\
    \ traits: no gravity, subjective directional gravity, erratic time, fire-dominant,\
    \ water-dominant, negative-dominant, positive-dominant, or wild magic."
