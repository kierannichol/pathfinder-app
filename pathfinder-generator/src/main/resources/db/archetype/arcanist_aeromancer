  description: "Aeromancers specialize in magic that manipulates the wind and sky.\
    \ Whenever an aeromancer expends a point from her arcane reservoir to increase\
    \ the caster level of a spell with the air, cold, electricity, or sonic descriptor,\
    \ she increases that bonus by an additional 1. At 5th level, and every 5 levels\
    \ thereafter, the amount by which she increases the caster level of such spells\
    \ further increases by an additional 1 (to a maximum additional caster level increase\
    \ from this ability of 5 at 20th level).\nAlternatively, if the aeromancer expends\
    \ a point from her arcane reservoir to increase the saving throw DC of a spell\
    \ with the air, cold, electricity, or sonic descriptor, she increases it by an\
    \ additional 1. At 10th level, she increases it by an additional 2 instead."

  description: "At 5th level, an aeromancer can expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir\
    \ to call upon the winds to gently carry her through the air while protecting\
    \ her from harm. She is affected as though by the spell air walk and is surrounded\
    \ by protective winds that function similarly to a wind wall spell, except the\
    \ effect surrounds only the aeromancer and moves with her wherever she goes. Both\
    \ of these effects last for 1 minute."

  description: "At 11th level, by expending 3 points from her arcane reservoir, an\
    \ aeromancer can release a powerful blast of wind to push back her foes. This\
    \ takes the form of either a 20-foot-radius burst centered on the aeromancer or\
    \ a 40-foot cone originating from the aeromancer's space. She can choose which\
    \ form the wind takes each time she uses the ability. The affected area is filled\
    \ with hurricane-force winds (75 mph). This makes normal ranged attacks passing\
    \ through this area impossible, imposes a –8 penalty on ranged attacks from siege\
    \ weapons that pass through the area, and imposes a –12 penalty on Fly checks\
    \ attempted within the area. Additionally, Large creatures in the area are in\
    \ danger of being checked, and Medium or smaller creatures in the area are in\
    \ danger of being blown away. The winds created by this ability last for 1 round."
