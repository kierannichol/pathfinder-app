  description: "At 3rd level, when a burn rider succeeds at a Reflex save to avoid\
    \ fire damage, she can spend an immediate action to move up to half her speed.\
    \ If the burn rider ends this movement outside the area of effect, she takes no\
    \ damage from the effect. After this sudden movement, the burn rider is staggered\
    \ until the end of her next turn. If the burn rider is mounted, her mount makes\
    \ the movement instead, and both the mount and the burn rider are staggered until\
    \ the end of the burn rider's next turn."

    \ can gain additional options at the GM's discretion) and her effective druid\
