  description: "At 1st level, as part of a full-attack action, a maneuver master can\
    \ make one additional combat maneuver, regardless of whether the maneuver normally\
    \ replaces a melee attack or requires a standard action. The maneuver master uses\
    \ his monk level in place of his base attack bonus to determine his CMB for the\
    \ bonus maneuvers, though all combat maneuver checks suffer a –2 penalty when\
    \ using a flurry.\nAt 8th level, a maneuver master may attempt a second additional\
    \ combat maneuver, with an additional –3 penalty on combat maneuver checks.\n\
    At 15th level, a maneuver master may attempt a third additional combat maneuver,\
    \ with an additional –7 penalty on combat maneuver checks.\nA maneuver master\
    \ loses this ability when wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium\
    \ or heavy load.\nThis ability replaces flurry of blows."
