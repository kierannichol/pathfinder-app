  description: "At 1st level, a vermin tamer chooses a giant beetle, giant centipede,\
    \ giant gecko, giant slug, or giant spider as his mount.\nThe selected mount is\
    \ combat trained. The vermin tamer does not take an armor check penalty on Ride\
    \ checks while riding his mount. If the vermin tamer's starting mount is large\
    \ enough to act as a mount, it gains Light Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat.\
    \ If the selected animal companion is too small to act as a proper mount, then\
    \ the vermin tamer gains Undersized Mount as a bonus feat."
