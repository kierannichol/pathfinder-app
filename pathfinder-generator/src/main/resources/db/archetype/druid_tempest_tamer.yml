    \ abilities of creatures with the air, aquatic, or water subtype.\nThis bonus\
    \ also applies to saving throws to avoid damage from a vortex, whirlpool, or similar\
    \ effects, as well as to saving throws to prevent being pulled into or moved by\

  description: "At 4th level, a tempest tamer gains the ability to turn herself into\
    \ a Small water elemental.\nThis ability functions as per the elemental body I\
    \ spell except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level or until\
    \ she changes back. Changing form (to an elemental or back) is a standard action\
    \ and doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.\nAt 6th level, a tempest tamer can\
    \ use tempest wild shape to change into a Small air elemental. At 8th level, a\
    \ tempest tamer can use tempest wild shape to change into a Medium air or water\
    \ elemental, as per elemental body II. At 10th level, a tempest tamer can use\
    \ tempest wild shape to change into a Large air or water elemental, as per elemental\
    \ body III. At 12th level, a tempest tamer can use tempest wild shape to change\
    \ into a Huge air or water elemental, as per elemental body IV.\nA tempest tamer\
    \ can use this ability once per day plus an additional time per day at 6th level\
    \ and every 2 levels thereafter (up to a total of eight times at 18th level).\
    \ At 20th level, she can use tempest wild shape at will."
