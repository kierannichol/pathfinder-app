description: "These duelists use their bucklers both to defend themselves and to launch\
  \ unexpected strikes while chopping and hewing at their foes' unprotected bodies\
  \ and heads with their falcatas. They wear any type of armor, but favor bucklers,\
  \ and are comfortable using both hands for offense and defense."

  description: "At 3rd level, a buckler duelist can catch his opponent's weapon between\
    \ his buckler and his forearm, effectively wedging the hafts of polearms and hammers\
    \ or the flats of blades. This functions as a disarm combat maneuver, and the\
    \ buckler duelist gains a +4 bonus on the roll. If the buckler duelist's attack\
    \ fails by 10 or more, he suffers a â€“2 penalty to his AC until the start of his\
    \ next turn."

  description: "At 5th level, a buckler duelist gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage\
    \ rolls when wielding a falcata and buckler that applies to attacks made by either\
    \ hand. These bonuses increase by +1 for every four levels beyond 5th. With a\
    \ full-attack action, a buckler duelist may alternate between using his falcata\
    \ or his buckler for each attack. This does not grant additional attacks or incur\
    \ penalties as two-weapon fighting does."
