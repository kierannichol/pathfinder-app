  description: "At 3rd level, a living avalanche must choose overrun as her first\
    \ combat maneuver for maneuver training. At 7th level, she must choose bull rush\
    \ as her second combat maneuver for maneuver training. She doesn't gain training\
    \ in any new combat maneuvers at later levels, but her bonuses on combat maneuver\
    \ checks and to CMD for bull rush and overrun combat maneuvers increase as normal.\
    \ She gains the following benefits at the listed levels. At 11th level, if she\
    \ succeeds at an overrun combat maneuver as part of a charge, she automatically\
    \ knocks her target prone (no matter the result of her check). In addition, if\
    \ the living avalanche succeeds at a bull rush combat maneuver as part of a charge,\
    \ she reduces the penalty combat maneuver checks to bull rush each creature beyond\
    \ the first by 2. At 15th level, the living avalanche can attempt bull rush and\
    \ overrun combat maneuvers against creatures two sizes larger than herself, but\
    \ only as part of a charge. At 19th level, if the living avalanche succeeds at\
    \ a bull rush combat maneuver as part of a charge, she reduces the penalty on\
    \ combat maneuver checks to bull rush each creature beyond the first by an additional\
    \ 2. When attempting an overrun combat maneuver as part of a charge, she also\
    \ ignores any increase to a creature's CMD from having more than two legs."

    \ creature in her path, as long as that creature is no more than two size categories\
    \ larger than herself. Each creature she succeeds against is knocked prone and\

    \ she stops her movement in the space directly in front of the creature."
