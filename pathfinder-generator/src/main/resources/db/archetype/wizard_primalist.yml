  description: "At 1st level, a primalist may attempt to channel primal magic as a\
    \ swift action to cast a prepared spell without losing that spell from its spell\
    \ slot. Essentially, a primalist is forcing primal magic into the world and attempting\
    \ to shape it into a specific spell effect. To use this ability, she casts the\
    \ spell as she would normally, but as the spell's effects take place, she makes\
    \ a concentration check (DC 20 + double the spell's level). If she fails this\
    \ check, she expends the spell normally as if she had cast it, but its actual\
    \ effects are replaced by a primal magic event with a CR equal to her caster level\
    \ and she is staggered for 1 round per level of the spell she was attempting to\
    \ cast. If she makes this check, she casts the spell normally and it is not expended\
    \ from her prepared spell slot, allowing her to cast that spell again at a later\
    \ point."

    \ swift action she can increase or decrease its CR by 1. If she makes a concentration\
    \ check (DC = 15 + the primal magic event's CR), she can instead increase or decrease\
    \ the CR by 2. If she reduces a primal magic event's CR to less than 1, the event\
    \ is negated. She can choose to use this ability after she determines what primal\
    \ magic event she triggers, but before she resolves the effects of that event."

  description: "At 10th level, whenever a primalist triggers a primal magic event,\
    \ she rolls the percentile dice twice to determine the event that occurs and chooses\
    \ which one of the two possible events occurs. She becomes resistant to the effects\
    \ of primal magic events. Anytime an event would affect her, the GM rolls 1d20\
    \ + the event's CR against a DC of 11 + her wizard level. If this roll fails,\
    \ the event does not affect her, similar to a creature with spell resistance ignoring\
    \ magical effects with an SR check. If the primal magic event is duplicating the\
    \ effects of a spell that does not allow spell resistance (such as create pit),\
    \ this resistance does not apply."
