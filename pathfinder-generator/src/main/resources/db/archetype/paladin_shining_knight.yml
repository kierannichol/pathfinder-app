    \ movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, for either her or her mount.\
    \ In addition, if her target is also the target of her smite evil ability and\
    \ the charge attack hits, the target must make a Will save or be panicked for\
    \ a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the shining knight's level. The DC of this save\
