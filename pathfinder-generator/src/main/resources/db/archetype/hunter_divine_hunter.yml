  description: "At 3rd level, a divine hunter learns to call upon the power of her\
    \ deity. The divine hunter must select one domain from those available to her\
    \ deity. She gains the granted powers of this domain, using her hunter level â€“\
    \ 2 as her cleric level for determining when the powers are gained and what effects\
    \ they have. Once she chooses this domain, it cannot be changed.\nIf the divine\
    \ hunter selects the animal domain, she does not gain a second animal companion\
    \ upon reaching an effective cleric level of 4th. When the divine hunter would\
    \ gain that ability, her animal companion instead gains two ability score increases\
    \ (gaining +1 to two different ability scores or +2 to one ability score). If\
    \ her animal companion dies or is released, when she gains a new one, it benefits\
    \ from this ability score increase.\nIn addition, the divine hunter adds the 1st-level\
    \ domain spell from her domain to her list of spells known. She adds the 2nd-level\
    \ domain spell at 6th level, the 3rd-level domain spell at 9th level, the 4th-level\
    \ domain spell at 12th level, the 5th-level domain spell at 15th level, and the\
    \ 6th-level domain spell at 18th level."
