  description: "This ability acts as the vigilante ability of the same name, except\
    \ as follows. The masked performer's identities are referred to as social and\
    \ masked, rather than social and vigilante.\nUnlike a vigilante, most people who\
    \ know of the masked performer actually know that the masked performer's identities\
    \ are one and the same. Nonetheless, the dual identity ability is valuable to\
    \ the masked performer due to offering her two perspectives on any problem and\
    \ two different alignments."
