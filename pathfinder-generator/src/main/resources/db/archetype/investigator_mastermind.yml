  description: "A mastermind's reputation precedes him. At 1st level, once per day\
    \ a mastermind can spend 10 minutes preparing an ally to make a single Diplomacy\
    \ or Intimidate check (mastermind's choice when preparing the ally) within the\
    \ next 24-hour period at the mastermind's behest. This skill check uses the mastermind's\
    \ skill ranks instead of the ally's. The mastermind's affected ally still uses\
    \ its own ability bonus for the check.\nFurthermore, when a mastermind uses this\
    \ ability, he can expend one use of inspiration to give the ally use of the inspiration\
    \ die when making the check.\nAt 3rd level, a mastermind can use this ability\
    \ an additional time each day, and the number of times he can use this ability\
    \ per day increases by 1 for every third level thereafter. Multiple uses of this\
    \ ability on the same ally grant that ally the benefit on additional Diplomacy\
    \ or Intimidate checks.\nAt 12th level, a mastermind can use this ability to bestow\
    \ on his ally the use of his skill ranks, similar to the 1st-level effects of\
    \ this ability but with a wider range of skills to choose from. The mastermind\
    \ can only bestow this for a skill check that he can use inspiration on without\
    \ expending uses of inspiration. For instance, a mastermind with the underworld\
    \ inspiration talent can bolster his ally's Bluff, Disable Device, Disguise, or\
    \ Sleight of Hand skill checks, selecting a single skill for each use of the ability."

    \ uses of inspiration to make an inspired defense. He rolls his inspiration die\
    \ and applies the result as a penalty on an attack roll made against him. If the\
    \ mastermind has the combat inspiration talent, he can expend one use of inspiration\
    \ instead of two."

  description: "At 9th level, a mastermind's secrecy, obscurity, and mental conditioning\
    \ reach superhuman levels. He becomes immune to any divination spell, spell-like\
    \ ability, or effect that allows a saving throw (though he can still allow a divination\
    \ effect to affect him if he wishes). Even divination effects that do not allow\
    \ a saving throw have difficulty piercing a mastermind's barriers, as a mastermind\
    \ can now choose to think in any language he speaks. Unless the opponent reading\
    \ a mastermind's thoughts speaks all of the mastermind's languages, attempts at\
    \ thought reading automatically fail."
