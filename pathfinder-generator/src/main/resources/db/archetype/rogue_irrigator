  description: "At 8th level, if a harvester irrigator studies his target for 3 rounds\
    \ (spending a standard action each round to do so) and then makes a sneak attack\
    \ with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the attack has the additional\
    \ effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (Harvester irrigator's\
    \ choice). The death attack fails if the target detects the harvester irrigator\
    \ or recognizes him as an enemy. If the victim of the attack fails a Fortitude\
    \ save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the harvester irrigator's class level + the harvester irrigator's\
    \ Intelligence modifier) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw\
    \ fails against the paralysis effect, the victim is rendered helpless and unable\
    \ to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per 2 rogue levels that the harvester irrigator\
    \ has. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak\
    \ attack. Once the harvester irrigator has completed the 3 rounds of study, he\
    \ must make the irrigation attempt within the next 3 rounds. A Harvester irrigator\
    \ can attempt to kill or paralyze a creature in this way once per day, plus one\
    \ additional time per day for every 4 additional rogue levels he has after 8th."
