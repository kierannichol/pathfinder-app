  description: "A tattooed sorcerer gains a familiar as an arcane bond, as a wizard\
    \ equal to her sorcerer level. Her sorcerer levels stack with any wizard or witch\
    \ levels she possesses when determining the powers of her familiar--this ability\
    \ does not allow her to have both a familiar and a bonded item.\nUnlike most familiars,\
    \ her familiar can transform itself into a tattoo that she carries in her flesh.\
    \ Transforming into a tattoo or back to normal familiar form is a move action\
    \ for her familiar. In tattoo form, the familiar looks like a stylized version\
    \ of itself, but does not count as a creature separate from the tattooed sorcerer.\
    \ In tattoo form it continues to grant its special familiar ability, but otherwise\
    \ has no abilities and can take no actions except to transform from tattoo into\
    \ creature. A familiar tattoo cannot be erased or dispelled."

  description: "At 7th level, a tattooed sorcerer can create a spell tattoo once per\

    \ must be willing to receive the spell tattoo. If she gives the spell tattoo to\
    \ herself, it does not count against the regular limit of magic tattoos she can\
    \ have. The spell tattoo must be of a spell that she knows that has no material\
    \ or focus component. She can maintain one spell tattoo created by this ability\
    \ at a time--if she uses this ability again, the previous spell tattoo she created\
    \ fades away. Spell tattoos she creates with Inscribe Magic Tattoo do not count\
    \ against this limit. She can use this ability twice per day at 11th level, and\
    \ three times per day at 15th level."

    \ ability once per day. This spell-like ability is not enhanced by her Mage's\
    \ Tattoo, but it functions at +2 caster levels above her sorcerer caster level.\

    \ ability to another qualifying spell."
