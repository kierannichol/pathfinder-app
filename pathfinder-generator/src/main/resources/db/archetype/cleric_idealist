  description: "At 1st level, an idealist must choose one plane as his planar bond.\
    \ This plane must be his deity's home plane. An idealist can spontaneously cast\
    \ the 1st-, 4th-, and 7th-level spells listed below for his chosen plane (provided\
    \ he can cast spells of that level), in addition to cure or inflict spells.\n\
    Abaddon: Protection from good, unholy blight, and blasphemy.\nAbyss: Doom, unholy\
    \ blight, and blasphemy.\nAstral: Summon monster I, dismissal, and lesser create\
    \ demiplane.\nAxis: Protection from chaos, order's wrath, and dictum.\nBoneyard:\
    \ Deathwatch, death ward, and arbitrament (page 39).\nElysium: Remove fear, freedom\

  description: "When an idealist channels energy, she channels raw essence rather\
    \ than positive or negative energy, superimposing a portion of her deity's planar\
    \ realm over her location. This effect extends out to a radius of 10 feet, plus\
    \ 5 feet for every 2 cleric levels she has beyond 1st, to a maximum radius of\
    \ 55 feet at 19th level. This effect lasts for 1 round plus 1 round per point\
    \ of the idealist's Charisma bonus. While this effect is active, the idealist\
    \ gains a +1 bonus on Diplomacy checks against creatures who worship her deity\
    \ and a +1 bonus on Intimidate checks against creatures who do not. This bonus\
    \ increases by 1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.\nThis channeled energy\
    \ imposes itself over the current terrain, changing its visual appearance to more\
    \ thematically suit the energy's associated planar realm, but cannot hide obvious\
    \ hazards or otherwise allow for a creature to hide any more effectively than\
    \ the normal terrain would. This is an illusion (glamer) effect with a caster\
    \ level equal to the idealist's level.\nWithin the radius of the idealist's channeling,\
    \ all alignment and magic planar traits are suppressed and replaced with the traits\
    \ of the plane that matches the idealist's planar bond. This includes alignment,\
    \ gravity, and magic traits. In the case of the Astral Plane, since the time trait\
    \ remains unaltered, your spellcasting only feels fast--you gain a +4 bonus on\
    \ all concentration checks rather than the ability to apply Quickened Spell effects.\n\
    This ability is considered channel energy for purposes of feats that grant additional\
    \ uses of channel energy or allow the cleric to exclude creatures from channel\
    \ energy's effects."
