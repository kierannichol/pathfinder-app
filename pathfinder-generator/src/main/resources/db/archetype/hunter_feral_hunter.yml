  description: "At 1st level, a feral hunter gains a limited ability to change her\
    \ shape into hybrid animal forms. This functions as the animal focus class feature,\
    \ except that the hunter always applies the animal aspect to herself, and there\
    \ is no limit to this ability's duration. She can end this ability as a free action.\n\
    When a feral hunter uses this ability, her body takes on cosmetic aspects of an\
    \ animal, such as furry skin, longer nails, elongated teeth, and oddly colored\
    \ eyes; these changes do not grant her any abilities other than what is stated\
    \ in the animal focus, and end when she takes on a different aspect or ends the\
    \ ability. This physical change is a polymorph effect, though the effects of the\
    \ animal focus are not.\nThis ability alters animal focus and replaces the hunter\
    \ tactics and speak with master class abilities."

  description: "Starting at 6th level, whenever a feral hunter casts a summon nature's\
    \ ally spell to summon one or more animals, she summons one additional animal\
    \ of the same type. The summoned creature or creatures must be animals and must\
    \ be of the same type as the hunter's current aspect or of a similar type (bears\
    \ for bear aspect, dogs or wolves for wolf aspect, great cats for the tiger aspect,\
    \ and so on). The additional creature immediately vanishes if the hunter chooses\
    \ a different aspect or ends his feral focus ability. She can increase the duration\
    \ of any one summon nature's ally spell affected by this ability to 1 minute per\
    \ level. She can have only one spell with a duration increased by this ability\
    \ active at a time."
