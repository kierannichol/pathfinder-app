  description: "At 4th level, a life channeler gains a selection of wicker talismans\
    \ that can store and convert the life energy of sentient creatures into the growth,\
    \ health, and fertility of plants around her. The life channeler gains one wicker\
    \ talisman corresponding to each level of druid spells she can cast, starting\
    \ with 1st-level spells. These talismans are initially empty, but can hold life\
    \ energy. When the life channeler ritualistically kills a creature with a coup\
    \ de grace, she can store life energy in a talisman instead of gaining the plant\
    \ growth effect.\nThe creature must be of a CR equal to at least twice the spell\
    \ level of the corresponding talisman. For instance, a CR 8 creature's life energy\
    \ could provide energy for a talisman holding up to a 4th-level spell.\nA talisman\
    \ is either full or empty; it can't hold more than one creature's life energy.\
    \ A life channeler can expend the energy stored in a talisman to cast her domain\
    \ spell of the talisman's level without expending a spell slot.\nStarting at 6th\
    \ level, a life channeler gathers a flock of willing sacrifices. This grants her\
    \ the benefits of the Leadership feat, except that using a follower as a human\
    \ sacrifice with this ability doesn't cause the life channeler to take a penalty\
    \ to her Leadership score."

  description: "At 9th level, a life channeler gains a third option when using a coup\
    \ de grace on a sentient humanoid.\nIf the victim had a CR at least as high as\
    \ the life channeler's class level, the life channeler can store the creature's\
    \ life energy in her body. She can have the life energy from only 1 creature in\
    \ her body at a time. While she is storing life energy, if she would take damage\
    \ or die from a death effect or if she would gain negative levels or take energy\
    \ drain, she can sacrifice the stored energy to negate the effect without spending\
    \ an action."
