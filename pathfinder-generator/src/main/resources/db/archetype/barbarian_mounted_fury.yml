  description: "At 5th level, the mounted fury gains the service of a feral mount.\
    \ This ability functions as a druid's animal companion, using the barbarian's\
    \ level â€“4 as her effective druid level. This companion must be one that she is\
    \ capable of riding and is suitable as a mount. A Medium barbarian can select\
    \ a camel or a horse. A Small barbarian can select a pony or a wolf, but can also\
    \ select a boar or a dog if she is at least 8th level. Whenever a barbarian is\
    \ raging while mounted on her bestial mount, the mount gains a +2 morale bonus\
    \ to its Strength.\nThis ability replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge."
