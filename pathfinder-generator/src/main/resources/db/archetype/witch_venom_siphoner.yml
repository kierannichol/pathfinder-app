  description: "The venom siphoner chooses either her familiar's bite attack or its\
    \ claw attacks; once chosen, this selection can't be changed. The chosen natural\
    \ attack gains the following poison ability:\nSiphoner Poison: Natural attack--injury;\
    \ save Fort DC 10 + half the witch's level + the witch's Intelligence modifier;\
    \ frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex; cure 1 save.\nFamiliars without\
    \ an appropriate natural attack instead gain the ability to spit the poison as\
    \ a ranged touch attack.\nThis spit attack deals no damage, but it exposes the\
    \ struck creature to the poison, forcing it to attempt a saving throw to resist\
    \ the poison as normal. If the familiar already has a poison, the witch can instead\
    \ empower its poison. An empowered poison's frequency increases by 50%. If the\
    \ witch ever replaces her familiar, she must choose how this ability applies to\
    \ her new familiar as soon as she receives it."

  description: "At 6th level, the venom siphoner's blood becomes toxic, empowering\
    \ her abilities. Any creature that deals bleed damage to her with a natural, light\
    \ or one-handed weapon is automatically exposed to the same poison granted to\
    \ her familiar and must succeed at the save or be affected by the poison. Additionally,\
    \ when casting spells that have a single target and require a Fortitude save,\
    \ she can cause the spell to deliver this poison as a free action; a target who\
    \ succeeds at the save against the spell also avoids being affected by the poison.\
    \ She can cause spells to deliver poison in this way a number of times per day\
    \ equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. This ability refreshes when the venom\
    \ siphoner communes with her familiar to prepare her daily spells."
