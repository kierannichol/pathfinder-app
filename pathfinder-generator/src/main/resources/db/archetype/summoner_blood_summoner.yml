  description: "At 4th level, the blood summoner can sacrifice a flask of blood, extracted\
    \ up to 1 day ago from a living creature or a corpse that's been dead no longer\
    \ than 1 minute, to aid and appease an evil outsider within 30 feet as a standard\
    \ action. This blood can be extracted from a willing or helpless creature as a\
    \ full-round action that deals 1 point of Constitution damage. The offering grants\
    \ the outsider a +2 enhancement bonus to the ability score of the blood summoner's\
    \ choice and grants the blood summoner a +4 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks\
    \ and Charisma checks to bargain with it. The bonuses last for 10 minutes. The\
    \ offering cannot be made to the same fiend twice in the same day."

  description: "At 8th level, a blood summoner can use his maker's call ability to\
    \ allow his eidolon to travel through the blood of other creatures instead of\
    \ bringing it to his side.\nThe eidolon can either emerge from the blood of a\
    \ living creature within range that has fewer than its maximum hit points remaining,\
    \ or burst from the corpse of a Small or larger creature within range that has\
    \ been dead for no longer than 1 minute. If the eidolon emerges from an injured\
    \ creature, that creature takes 4d6 points of damage, which is halved if the creature\
    \ succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the blood summoner's level + his\
    \ Charisma modifier).\nThe eidolon appears in its choice of the nearest unoccupied\
    \ square to the creature or corpse it emerged from, and is staggered for 1 round."

  description: "At 16th level as a full-round action, a blood summoner's eidolon can\
    \ enter and control the body of any corporeal creature that has blood.\nThis ability\
    \ functions as marionette possession, except that the eidolon's body also enters\
    \ the target and the target can be unwilling. A successful Will save (DC = 10\
    \ + 1/2 the blood summoner's level + his Charisma modifier) negates this effect.\
    \ This ability can be used once per day at 16th level, twice per day at 18th level,\
    \ and three times per day at 20th level. The eidolon can end this possession at\
    \ any time as a standard action. If the host body is slain while the eidolon is\
    \ possessing it, the eidolon is immediately ejected, takes 4d6 points of damage,\
    \ and is stunned for 1 round."
