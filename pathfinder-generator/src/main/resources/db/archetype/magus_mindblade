  description: "A mindblade casts spells from the magus spell list as psychic spells.\
    \ She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn\
    \ or cast a spell, a mindblade must have an Intelligence score equal to at least\
    \ 10 + the spell's level. The saving throw DC to resist a mindblade's spell is\
    \ equal to 10 + the spell's level + the mindblade's Intelligence modifier.\nLike\
    \ other spellcasters, a mindblade can cast only a certain number of spells of\
    \ each spell level per day. She knows the same number of spells and receives the\
    \ same number of spells slots per day as a bard of her magus level, and knows\
    \ and uses 0-level knacks as a bard uses cantrips. In addition, she receives bonus\
    \ spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1â€“3 on page 17\
    \ of the Core Rulebook).\nAt 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mindblade\
    \ can learn a new spell in place of one she already knows, using the same rules\
    \ as a bard. In effect, the mindblade loses the old spell in exchange for the\
    \ new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged,\
    \ and the new spell must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell\
    \ the mindblade can cast.\nA mindblade need not prepare her spells in advance.\n\
    She can cast any magus spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used\
    \ up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level."

  description: "A mindblade gains a psychic pool, similar to a normal magus's arcane\
    \ pool. At 1st level, a mindblade can expend 1 point from her psychic pool as\
    \ a standard action to manifest a light melee weapon of her choice, formed from\
    \ psychic energy. By spending 2 points, the mindblade can manifest a one-handed\
    \ melee weapon, and by spending 3 points, she can manifest a two-handed melee\
    \ weapon (but not a double weapon). This psychic weapon can last indefinitely,\
    \ but it vanishes if it leaves the mindblade's hand. The mindblade can dismiss\
    \ a held psychic weapon as a free action. When a psychic weapon vanishes, the\
    \ mindblade regains the psychic energy used to create it. She can maintain only\
    \ one weapon at a time.\nAt 1st level, a psychic weapon counts as a magic weapon\
    \ of whatever type the mindblade selected, with a +1 enhancement bonus. At 3rd\
    \ level and every 3 levels thereafter, the weapon's enhancement bonus increases\
    \ by 1, up to maximum of +5 at 12th level. Starting at 5th level, the mindblade\
    \ can add any of the weapon special abilities listed in the arcane pool class\
    \ feature in place of these bonuses, although the weapon must maintain at least\
    \ a +1 bonus to benefit from any weapon special abilities. At 15th and 18th levels,\
    \ the weapon gains an additional +1 enhancement bonus, which the mindblade can\
    \ spend only on weapon special abilities."
