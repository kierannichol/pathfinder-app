description: "Though bards may have different reasons for wanting to heal the sick\
  \ and injured, both out of pure altruism and in order to keep adventuring companions\
  \ safe, the ability to heal also makes it much easier for a bard to pose as a cleric\
  \ or other divine healer, opening the door for a wide array of swindles and scams."

  description: "At 2nd level, an arcane healer gains the ability to channel positive\
    \ energy as a cleric of one level lower than his level. If a creature within the\
    \ channeled energy's area of effect would be allowed a save against its effects,\
    \ the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcane healer's level + the arcane healer's\
    \ Charisma modifier. An arcane healer can use this ability once per day at 2nd\
    \ level, gaining an additional use per day every four levels thereafter (6th,\
    \ 10th, 14th, and 18th), to a maximum of 5 times per day at 18th level."
