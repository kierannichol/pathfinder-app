  description: "A bacchanal adds goodberry to his list of 1st-level skald spells known.\
    \ In addition, he can cast it as a spell-like ability once per day. When he casts\
    \ goodberry as a spell or spell-like ability, the targeted berries ferment; this\
    \ causes each berry to act as a serving of an alcoholic beverage. A creature that\
    \ eats a fermented berry does not gain a meal's nourishment, but it is cured of\
    \ 1 point of damage and becomes slightly foolhardy as if tipsy, gaining a +1 bonus\
    \ on saves against fear effects for 1 minute after eating the berry."

  description: "At 2nd level, while maintaining a raging song, a bacchanal can consume\
    \ a berry affected by goodberry, a potion, or a serving of alcohol as a move action\
    \ that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A berry affected by goodberry\
    \ or a potion has its normal effect, while an alcoholic drink or a berry affected\
    \ by goodberry via fermented fruit (see above) allows the skald to maintain his\
    \ raging song that round without expending a round of raging song for the day\
    \ (instead of the normal effects of the alcohol or fermented berry). For each\
    \ alcoholic drink or fermented berry consumed while raging, the skald is nauseated\
    \ for 1 round after his raging song ends. The internal fortitude rage power prevents\
    \ this nauseated condition from occurring.\nAt 7th level, when the bacchanal consumes\
    \ an alcoholic drink or fermented berry while maintaining his rage song, he can\
    \ gain the benefits of cure light wounds or remove fear (for the duration of the\
    \ raging song) at his caster level by spending 2 rounds of raging song. At 12th\
    \ level, the bacchanal can gain the benefits of heroism (for the duration of the\
    \ raging song) in this manner. At 17th level, he can gain the benefits of persistent\
    \ vigor (for the duration of the raging song) in this manner."
