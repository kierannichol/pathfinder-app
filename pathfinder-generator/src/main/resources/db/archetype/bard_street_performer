  description: "A street performer gains the following types of bardic performance:\n\
    Disappearing Act (Su): A street performer can use performance to divert attention\
    \ from an ally. All creatures within 30 feet that fail a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2\
    \ the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier) treat one creature chosen by the\
    \ bard as if it were invisible. This performance affects one additional creature\
    \ at 5th level and every 6 levels thereafter. If the targets take any action that\
    \ would cause them to become visible, they become visible to everyone. The bard\
    \ cannot use this ability on himself. This ability is a mind-affecting effect\
    \ that requires visual components.\nThis performance replaces inspire courage.\n\
    Harmless Performer (Su): At 3rd level, a street performer can use performance\
    \ to appear meek and unworthy of being attacked. While using this performance,\
    \ whenever an enemy targets the street performer, the enemy must succeed at a\
    \ Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha bonus) or be unable\
    \ to attack the bard this round, as per sanctuary. The enemy loses the attack\
    \ that targeted the bard, but may spend additional attacks targeting other creatures.\
    \ If the opponent was targeting the street performer with a spell, it must succeed\
    \ at a concentration check at the same DC or lose the spell. If this check succeeds,\
    \ it may target another creature with the spell instead. This mind-affecting ability\
    \ requires audible or visual components.\nThis performance replaces inspire competence.\n\
    Madcap Prank (Su): At 9th level, a street performer can use performance to discomfit\
    \ a target within 30 feet, causing its clothing to become tangled, its headgear\
    \ to fall down over its eyes, or even causing it to slip and fall or otherwise\
    \ be made to appear a fool. The target must make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the\
    \ bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier) each round that it hears or sees the\
    \ performance, or it takes one of the following random effects each round:\n1--blinded,\
    \ 2--dazzled, 3--deafened, 4--entangled, 5--fall prone, 6--nauseated.\nEach effect\
    \ lasts 1 round.\nThis performance replaces inspire greatness.\nSlip through the\
    \ Crowd (Su): At 15th level, a street performer's disappearing act enables affected\
    \ creatures to move through crowd squares and enemy-occupied squares without impediment.\
    \ Affected creatures are treated as if having greater invisibility, but enemies\
    \ gain a new saving throw to notice them each time they are attacked."

    \ take 20 on a Bluff or Disguise check once per day, plus one time per six levels\
