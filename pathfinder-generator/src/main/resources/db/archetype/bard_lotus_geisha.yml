  description: "At 2nd level, a lotus geisha gains the ability to execute an enrapturing\
    \ performance in addition to her bardic performance ability. An enrapturing performance\
    \ is exactly like a bardic performance with the following exceptions.\nA lotus\
    \ geisha can use an enrapturing performance to recreate the effects of any of\
    \ her known bardic performances, but she focuses the performance on only a single\
    \ target within range. While other creatures see and hear a lotus geisha's enrapturing\
    \ performance, only the target of this ability is affected by it. A lotus geisha\
    \ cannot have a bardic performance and an enrapturing performance in effect at\
    \ the same time. Every round spent engaged in an enrapturing performance counts\
    \ against the total number of rounds per day she can use her bardic performance,\
    \ and she cannot use this ability if she does not have any more rounds of bardic\
    \ performance left for that day. Starting an enrapturing performance is a standard\
    \ action; at 7th level, it becomes a move action, and at 13th level, it becomes\
    \ a swift action.\nA lotus geisha adds a +2 bonus to the DC of Will saves made\
    \ to resist the effects of her fascinate, frightening tune, and suggestion enrapturing\
    \ performances. When a lotus geisha uses her enrapturing performance ability to\
    \ emulate inspire competence, inspire courage, inspire greatness, or inspire heroics,\
    \ any bonuses to AC or on ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws,\
    \ and skill checks increase by +1. For example, a lotus geisha using inspire heroics\
    \ as an enrapturing performance would grant her target a +5 morale bonus on saving\
    \ throws and a +5 dodge bonus to AC, instead of the usual +4 bonuses."
