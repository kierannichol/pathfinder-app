  description: "An arcane tinkerer can turn the animating magic of a construct against\
    \ itself.\nAs a standard action, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir\
    \ to impose a â€“1 penalty on a single construct's attack and damage rolls for 1\
    \ round. The target can attempt a Will save to negate this effect (DC = 10 + half\
    \ the arcane tinkerer's level + the arcane tinkerer's Charisma modifier). At 7th\
    \ level, instead of gaining an arcanist exploit, an arcane tinkerer can improve\
    \ her manipulate construct ability to instead affect a construct with slow for\
    \ 1 round. At 13th level, if the arcane tinkerer has previously improved this\
    \ ability, instead of gaining an arcanist exploit, she can improve this ability\
    \ again to instead cause a construct to become helpless for 1 round."

    \ level, a construct is instead treated as if it has spell resistance equal to\
