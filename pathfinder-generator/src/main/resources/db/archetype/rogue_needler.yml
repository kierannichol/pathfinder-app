  description: "At 8th level, a needler learns how to deliver all types of poisons\
    \ with subtlety. As a standard action, she can deliver an ingested or inhaled\
    \ poison to a creature within reach by placing a dose of poison on the target's\
    \ lips, on the target's neck, or through other similar contact with the target's\
    \ skin as if the poison were a contact poison. Delivering poison in this way requires\
    \ a successful Sleight of Hand check opposed by the target's Perception check.\
    \ The poison is not lost on a failed check, but it must be successfully delivered\
    \ within 1 minute of the first attempt, or it is wasted."
