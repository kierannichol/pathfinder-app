  description: "At 3rd level, an aquanaut gains a swim speed equal to his unmodified\
    \ base land speed (if he has a racial swim speed, he instead increases it by 10\
    \ feet) and can choose to have a neutral buoyancy once per turn as a free action.\
    \ At 7th level, he can choose any of the five states of buoyancy once per turn\
    \ as a free action, and can take his buoyancy movement as part of that free action\
    \ instead of at the end of his turn without becoming off-balance and without requiring\
    \ a Swim check; additionally, he can choose to double or halve how far a current\
    \ moves him. At 11th level, whenever he takes a move, double move, withdraw, or\
    \ run action underwater, he can leave a current behind him in the squares along\
    \ his path; this current has a speed of 10 feet in the direction of his movement\
    \ (if his movement was circuitous, so is the current) and lasts until the beginning\
    \ of his next turn. At 15th level, as a full round action, an aquanaut can spin\
    \ ferociously underwater, creating a whirlpool around himself with a spinning\
    \ force that drags all creatures within 120 feet of him 30 feet closer to him.\
    \ Creatures closer than 30 feet spend the 30 feet of movement circling around\
    \ the aquanaut in a single direction of his choice. The whirlpool isn't fast enough\
    \ to deal damage, but the aquanaut is unaffected by his own whirlpool, allowing\
    \ him to make attacks of opportunity against creatures moving in it. At 19th level,\
    \ the aquanaut learns to use the water around him to soften blows, gaining DR\
    \ 5/-- while underwater."

    \ melee weapons. If he chooses piercing melee weapons, he gains a +1 bonus on\
    \ attack and damage rolls with those weapons when attacking underwater. If he\
    \ chooses bludgeoning or slashing melee weapons, he can ignore the usual underwater\
    \ penalties for attacking with those weapons. At 9th and 13th levels, he can choose\
    \ another type of melee weapon, applying this ability's initial benefit to his\
    \ new choice and gaining an additional +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls to\
    \ his previously chosen weapon types. At 17th level, he gains an additional +1\
    \ bonus on attack and damage rolls with all three types."
