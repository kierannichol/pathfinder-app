  description: "A blatherskite swaps four deeds for the following.\nBlatherskite's\
    \ Stagger (Ex) At 1st level as an immediate action, when a ranged attack would\
    \ normally miss a blatherskite, he can allow it to hit him and dramatically stagger\
    \ a few steps backward, moving up to 10 feet directly away from the attacker.\
    \ This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. The attack deals the\
    \ minimum amount of damage (as though the attacker had rolled a natural 1 on each\
    \ damage die).\nAt 2nd level, if a ranged attack hits the blatherskite but the\
    \ attack roll exceeds his AC by no more than his bonus from the nimble class feature,\
    \ he can spend 1 grit point as an immediate action to take the minimum amount\
    \ of damage and move up to 10 feet directly away from the attacker. This movement\
    \ provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.\nThe gunslinger can perform this\
    \ deed only while wearing medium or light armor and while carrying no more than\
    \ a light load.\nThis deed replaces the gunslinger's dodge deed.\nBlatherskite's\
    \ Initiative (Ex) At 3rd level, the blatherskite gains benefits as long as he\
    \ has at least 1 grit point.\nThe blatherskite gains a +2 bonus on initiative\
    \ checks.\nFurthermore, if he is trained in Stealth (and as long as he is not\
    \ paralyzed, prone, or otherwise immobilized), he can take a 5-foot step and attempt\
    \ a Stealth check to hide as part of the initiative check, provided there is an\
    \ object or a larger creature to hide behind; if he spends 1 grit point, he can\
    \ move up to half his speed instead of taking only a 5-foot step as part of the\
    \ initiative check.\nThis deed replaces the gunslinger initiative deed.\nCheap\
    \ Shot (Ex) At 3rd level, if the blatherskite has at least 1 grit point and makes\
    \ a successful attack against an unarmed target with a firearm that is not making\
    \ a scattering shot, he deals 1d6 additional points of damage. This is precision\
    \ damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.\nThis deed replaces the pistol-whip\
    \ deed.\nBlatherskite's Surprise (Ex) At 7th level, when the blatherskite succeeds\
    \ at a saving throw against a spell or an effect that would cause him to be blinded,\
    \ confused, dazed, fascinated, frightened, nauseated, paralyzed, or stunned, he\
    \ can allow the effect to affect him normally. As long as he has at least 1 grit\
    \ point, as an immediate action he can cause the creature from which the effect\
    \ originated to lose its Dexterity bonus to AC for a number of rounds equal to\
    \ half the duration of the effect (in rounds) or half the gunslinger's level,\
    \ whichever is lower (minimum 1 round). If he instead spends 1 grit point, he\
    \ does not need to allow the effect to affect him normally to use this deed."
