  description: "At 3rd level as a standard action, a chameleon adept can cause her\
    \ companion to assume a humanoid form of the same race as herself. This functions\
    \ as alter self, except it is used on an adjacent animal companion to have it\
    \ assume a humanoid form. The companion always assumes the same form, selected\
    \ when the hunter reaches 3rd level. The hunter can change this form when she\
    \ gains a new level, but the companion loses the old form and can't resume it\
    \ unless the chameleon adept chooses that form when she reaches a new level. The\
    \ companion is no more intelligent or less savage than normal; the hunter still\
    \ needs to control it as normal, and it still can't activate magic items or wield\
    \ manufactured weapons. The hunter can use this ability for 10 minutes per day\
    \ per hunter level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must\
    \ be spent in 10-minute increments."
