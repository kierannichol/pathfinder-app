  description: "An angelfire apostle is less concerned with the traditional divine\
    \ magic that many religious adherents receive. The angelfire apostle receives\
    \ one fewer spell slot at each spell level. When an angelfire apostle gets no\
    \ spells per day at a spell level, he can cast domain spells of that level normally,\
    \ but can only cast nondomain spells of that level if he gets them as bonus spells."

    \ not devoted to a particular deity. When an angelfire apostle channels positive\
    \ energy, affected nongood creatures are dazzled for 1 round, with no saving throw\
    \ for this effect, in addition to experiencing the normal effects of channel energy."
