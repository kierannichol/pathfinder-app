description: "Bandits, brigands, and highwaymen hone their craft along the roadsides\
  \ and byways of the world, where they leap from the shadows to plunder the spoils\
  \ of passing travelers. Bandits tend to have a variety of skills; sometimes these\
  \ skills are similar to a ranger's, but a bandit's tactics always deal with surprise\
  \ followed by intimidation, with the clear threat of naked force if intimidation\
  \ does not do the trick. But not all bandits are ruthless thugs. There are those\
  \ who become outlaws in opposition to tyrants or similar oppressors. These bandits\
  \ target the status quo and distribute their spoils back into the needy hands of\
  \ the peasantry."
