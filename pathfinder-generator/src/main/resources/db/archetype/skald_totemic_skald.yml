    \ animal focus list. Once selected, this choice cannot be changed. This animal\
    \ becomes the skald's personal totem animal and influences his later abilities.\
    \ He gains the following rage power.\nSong of the Beast (Su): The totemic skald\
    \ grants the animal focus abilities of his totem animal (as the hunter's animal\
    \ focus ability) to all allies affected by his raging song. He treats his skald\

  description: "At 4th level, the totemic skald can improve the attitude of animals\
    \ of the same type as his totem. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy\
    \ check to improve the attitude of a person. The skald rolls 1d20 and adds his\
    \ skald level and his Charisma modifier to determine the totem empathy check result.\
    \ The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild\
    \ animals are usually unfriendly.\nIn addition, at 4th level, the totemic skald\
    \ can cast charm animal once per day as a spell-like ability, using his skald\
    \ level as his caster level and his Charisma modifier to determine the DC. This\
    \ only functions against animals that are of the same type as his totem animal\
    \ (subject to GM discretion). At 8th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, he\
    \ can use this ability one additional time per day."

  description: "At 5th level, a totemic skald gains the ability to wild shape into\
    \ the form of a Small or Medium version of his totem animal, as the druid class\
    \ feature. His effective druid level for this ability is equal to his skald level\
    \ â€“ 1. He can use this ability twice per day at 11th level, and three times per\
    \ day at 17th level. This doesn't allow the skald to assume other forms, such\
    \ as elementals, plants, or other kinds of animals.\nWhen in animal form, the\
    \ skald is treated as able to speak normally for the purpose of using raging song,\
    \ but not for using other abilities that require speech (such as spellcasting).\
    \ The skald uses his class level as his druid level for the purpose of qualifying\
    \ for feats that affect wild shape (such as Wild Speech).\nThis ability replaces\
    \ spell kenning."
