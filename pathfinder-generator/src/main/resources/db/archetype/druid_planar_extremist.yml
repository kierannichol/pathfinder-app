  description: "A planar extremist forms a bond with a manifestation of the Outer\
    \ Planes with which she is aligned.\nThis bond can take one of two forms. The\
    \ first is a close tie to the plane to which she is aligned, granting the planar\
    \ extremist one of the domains of her alignment (for example, a lawful good planar\
    \ extremist could take either the Lawful or Good domain). This option otherwise\
    \ functions as a druid's nature bond if she chose a close tie to the natural world.\n\
    The second option is to form a close bond with an outsider from an Outer Planes.\
    \ The abilities of this outsider companion are determined using the rules for\
    \ eidolons for the unchained summoner class, as if the planar extremist were a\
    \ summoner of her druid level, except the outsider companion gains no additional\
    \ evolution pool (only the evolutions from its base form and base evolutions for\
    \ its subtype), and it must be of a subtype whose alignment exactly matches the\
    \ alignment of the planar extremist. The planar extremist can summon her outsider\
    \ companion with the same 1-minute ritual a summoner normally uses to do so, but\
    \ she can't cast summon monster spells if she currently has her outsider companion\
    \ summoned, and she can't summon her companion if she already has a creature summoned\
    \ through other means.\nAs the planar ally gains class levels, her eidolon's base\
    \ statistics and base evolutions increase as if her druid level were her summoner\
    \ level. The eidolon gains the darkvision, link, share spells, evasion, ability\
    \ score increase, devotion, multiattack, and improved evasion abilities at the\
    \ appropriate levels, but never gains an evolution pool.\nAbilities and spells\
    \ that grant additional evolution points to eidolons do not function for her outsider\
    \ companion, though any abilities that would grant evolution points to an animal\
    \ companion do work. The planar extremist does not gain life link or any other\
    \ class features a summoner gains in relation to her eidolon."

  description: "At 4th level, as a standard action, a planar extremist can gain the\
    \ benefits of the bloodrager bloodline associated with her alignment (choosing\
    \ from Abyssal, Celestial, or Infernal), as if she were a bloodrager of her druid\
    \ level. She can gain these benefits for 1 minute per druid level as if she were\
    \ bloodraging (but she gains no other benefits or penalties of bloodrage) or until\
    \ she dismisses it as a swift action; this duration need not be used consecutively\
    \ but must be spent in 1-minute increments. She can use this ability an additional\
    \ time per day at 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, for a total of five\
    \ times per day at 18th level.\nAt 20th level, a planar extremist can use planar\
