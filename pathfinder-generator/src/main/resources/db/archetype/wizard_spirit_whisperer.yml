  description: "At 1st level, a spirit whisperer forms a mystical bond with a spirit.\
    \ The spirit whisperer picks a spirit from the shaman's list of spirits. At 1st\
    \ level, he gains a spirit ability granted by that spirit. At 8th level, he gains\
    \ the greater spirit ability granted by that spirit. At 20th level, the spirit\
    \ whisperer gains the manifestation ability granted by the spirit. He uses his\
    \ wizard level as his shaman level for determining the effects and DCs of abilities\
    \ granted by the spirit. In addition, he uses his Intelligence modifier in place\
    \ of his Wisdom modifier for these abilities. He does not gain hexes, spirit magic\
    \ spells, or the true spirit ability typically granted to a shaman by these spirits."
