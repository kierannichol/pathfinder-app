  description: "At 20th level, a virtuous bravo becomes a master at dispensing holy\
    \ justice with her blade.\nWhen the virtuous bravo confirms a critical hit with\
    \ a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, she can choose one of the following\
    \ three effects in addition to dealing damage: the target is rendered unconscious\
    \ for 1d4 hours, the target is paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or the target is slain.\
    \ Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Fortitude save.\n\
    On a success, the target is instead stunned for 1 round (it still takes damage).\
    \ The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the virtuous bravo's paladin level\
    \ + her Charisma modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a bravo's holy\
    \ strike, regardless of whether or not it succeeds at the save, that creature\
    \ is immune to that bravo's holy strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune\
    \ to critical hits are also immune to this ability."
