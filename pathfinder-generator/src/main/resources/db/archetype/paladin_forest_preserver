    \ tree. This fills the area with dense undergrowth, though it does not impede\

    \ forest preserver gain a +1 sacred bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving\
    \ throws, and animals, fey, and plants called or summoned within this area gain\
    \ 1 hit point per Hit Die as long as the calling or summoning effect lasts or\
    \ until the sacred grove effect ends (whichever comes first). If the area contains\
    \ a shrine or hallowed area dedicated to a good-aligned deity (or at the GM's\
    \ discretion, a place of natural magical power, such as a natural portal to the\
    \ Fey World), these bonuses are doubled.\nWhen she uses this ability in her favored\
    \ terrain, she can also imbue plants in the area with limited animation, allowing\
    \ them to obscure vision and impede movement and attacks as if the area were affected\
    \ by solid fog.\nA sacred grove remains enhanced in this way for a number of minutes\
    \ equal to the paladin's level."
