  description: "A worldseeker's travels and dealings across the planes allow her to\
    \ make connections she can call upon when necessary to gain assistance without\
    \ needing to resort to planar binding. A worldseeker must choose a familiar for\
    \ her arcane bond. At 5th level, she gains Improved Familiar as a bonus feat and\
    \ must choose an outsider familiar that matches her alignment exactly; she can\
    \ choose an outsider in this way even if it normally requires a 7th-level spellcaster\
    \ as its master.\nAt 7th level, a worldseeker automatically learns lesser planar\
    \ ally as a 4th-level wizard spell. She automatically learns planar ally as a\
    \ 6th-level wizard spell at 11th level, and greater planar ally as an 8th-level\
    \ wizard spell at 15th level. She can swap out a prepared spell of an equal spell\
    \ level to spontaneously cast any of these three spells (one 4th-level spell for\
    \ lesser planar ally, a 6th-level spell for planar ally, and a 8th level spell\
    \ for greater planar ally).\nThe first time each day she casts one of these three\
    \ spells, the worldseeker reduces the gp value of the material component cost\
    \ by an amount equal to her caster level x 100 (to a minimum cost of 0 gp)."
