  description: "At 11th level, as a standard action, a soul forger can restore a number\
    \ of hit points equal to his magus level to a damaged object by touching it and\
    \ spending 1 point from his arcane pool. Repairing a destroyed object takes 1\
    \ minute and materials equal to 1/4 the item's sale value, and restores the object\
    \ to 1 hit point.\nRestoring the enchantments of a destroyed magical item requires\
    \ additional points from the soul forger's arcane pool equal to the item's caster\
    \ level. The soul forger gains one temporary negative level if the item's caster\
    \ level is lower than his own, two negative levels if equal or greater (or none\
    \ if the item is his bonded weapon); the save DC to remove these negative levels\
    \ is equal to 10 + the item's caster level."
