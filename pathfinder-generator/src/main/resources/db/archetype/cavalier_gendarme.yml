description: "The gendarme cares less for the finer points of tactical precision than\
  \ he does for the exhilaration of the charge: the rush of wind through the visor\
  \ of his helmet, the feel of his couched lance, the satisfying shriek of armor giving\
  \ way before his weapon's force as the point drives past metal into his foes."

  description: "A gendarme trains to be a mounted terror, almost to the exclusion\
    \ of all other abilities. He gains bonus feats at 1st level, 5th level, and then\
    \ every three levels thereafter, but must select these bonus feats from the following\
    \ list: Improved Bull Rush, Mounted Combat, Power Attack, Ride-by Attack, Spirited\
    \ Charge, Spring Attack, and Unseat. If the gendarme has already selected all\
    \ of the listed feats, then he may select his bonus feats from those feats listed\
    \ as Combat Feats."

  description: "At 20th level, a gendarme represents the epitome of Mounted Combat.\
    \ Whenever he makes a charge attack while mounted, he deals triple the normal\
    \ damage (quadruple if using a lance); this damage includes all increases from\
    \ the Spirited Charge feat and from the use of a lance. In addition, if the gendarme\
    \ confirms a critical hit on a charge attack while mounted, the attack deals maximum\
    \ damage for the weapon wielded. Additional damage from weapon properties, magic\
    \ effects, precision-based bonuses, or other increases are rolled normally."
