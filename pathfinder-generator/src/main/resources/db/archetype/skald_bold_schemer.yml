  description: "At 4th level, a bold schemer becomes increasingly adept at infiltration\
    \ and devising cunning strategies to overcome enemy fortifications.\nA bold schemer\
    \ can spend 8 hours observing a physical location (such as a fortress, a walled\
    \ city, or perhaps even a section of an underground dungeon or cavern complex),\
    \ contemplating methods to infiltrate the location and engage its defenders in\
    \ battle in ways that subvert their defensive advantages.\nAt the end of the 8\
    \ hours, the bold schemer gains a +2 insight bonus on her Bluff, Disable Device,\
    \ Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks while in that same physical location.\
    \ This bonus increases by 2 at 8th level and every 4 skald levels thereafter,\
    \ to a maximum of +10 at 20th level. The bonus lasts until the bold schemer observes\
    \ a new location. While observing a location, the bold schemer must fully focus\
    \ her attention; any distractions, such as engaging in combat, immediately ends\
    \ the observation and the bold schemer must start a new period of observing a\
    \ physical location to receive the bonus."
