description: "Bloodragers are frequently rough-and-ready, untrained scrappers who\
  \ learn to exploit any advantage to gain the upper hand in a fight. The bloody-knuckled\
  \ rowdy focuses on tricks and maneuvers that are quick and effective, duplicating\
  \ combat styles from professional brawlers, street thugs, and even trapped animals.\
  \ Rather than focusing on a single style, most bloody-knuckled rowdies dabble in\
  \ multiple techniques, mixing and matching their array of vicious maneuvers to suit\
  \ the occasion."
