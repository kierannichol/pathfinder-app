  description: "Starting at first level, a dragon drinker gains the ability to drink\
    \ dragon blood to alter or augment her spellcasting abilities. For the purposes\
    \ of harvesting dragon's blood, treat the dragon drinker as though she has Dragoncrafting\
    \ feat.\nAt 5th level, drinking a vial of dragon's blood is a standard action\
    \ that provides the dragon drinker with the normal benefits of the item, as well\
    \ as a +1 bonus to her caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell effects\
    \ on a single spell cast within 1 minute.\nAt 7th level, a consumed vial of dragon\
    \ blood also heals 1d8 points of damage instead of the standard 1d4.\nAt 11th\
    \ level, the alchemical bonus on Fortitude and Reflex saves granted by the blood\
    \ increases to +2.\nIn the absence of true dragon's blood, the dragon drinker\
    \ may tap into the draconic blood flowing through her veins to gain the temporary\
    \ effects of having consumed dragon's blood. As a free action, she can activate\
    \ this ability, healing 1d4 points of damage and gaining a +1 resistance bonus\
    \ on Will and Fortitude saves for 1 round. This action may only be performed once\
    \ per round, and can be performed a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma\
    \ modifier."
