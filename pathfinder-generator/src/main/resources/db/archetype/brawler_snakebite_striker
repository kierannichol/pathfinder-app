description: "With her lightning quickness and guile, a snakebite striker keeps her\
  \ foes' attention focused on her, because any one of her feints might be an actual\
  \ attack. By giving up some of a brawler's versatility, she increases her damage\
  \ potential and exposes opponents to deadly and unexpected strikes."

  description: "At 3rd level, a snakebite striker who uses a standard action to move\
    \ can combine that move with a feint. If she is able to feint as a move action\
    \ (such as from having the Improved Feint feat), she can combine a move action\
    \ to move with her feint. At 11th level, once per round she can declare her square\
    \ and one adjacent square as the origin of her attacks until her next turn (allowing\
    \ her to use one or both squares to determine whether she or allies are flanking\
    \ an opponent). At 15th level, she counts an additional adjacent square for this\
    \ purpose."
