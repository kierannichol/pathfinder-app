  description: "A green scourge can lose a prepared 1st- or 2nd-level spell in order\
    \ to cast shillelagh or flame blade, respectively. She can instead choose to lose\
    \ a higher-level spell in order to increase the enhancement bonus of her shillelagh,\
    \ or to add any of the following weapon special abilities to her shillelagh or\
    \ flame blade: bane (aberrations only), frost, mighty cleaving, returning, shock,\
    \ throwing, or vicious. If the target weapon is a quarterstaff, these bonuses\
    \ apply to only one of its ends. If a flame blade gains the frost or shock special\
    \ ability, the base damage of the spell changes to match the energy type; neither\
    \ a flame blade nor shillelagh can gain both of these special abilities. A green\
    \ scourge cannot add the throwing property to a flame blade unless she also adds\
    \ the returning property.\nWhen adding weapon special abilities or increasing\
    \ the enhancement bonus, the final level of the spell expended is 1 higher than\
    \ the base spell level (2nd for shillelagh and 3rd for flame blade), increased\
    \ by the additional special abilities' total base price modifier. For example,\
    \ creating an aberrationâ€“bane vicious flame blade requires spending a 5th-level\
    \ spell slot, which also counts as a 5th-level spell for purposes of dispelling."
