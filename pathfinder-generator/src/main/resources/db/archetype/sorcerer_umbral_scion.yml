  description: "An umbral scion is capable of influencing light around her. As a standard\
    \ action, she can produce a 10-foot-radius veil centered on a creature or object\
    \ within 30 feet. This veil decreases the light level by one step and remains\
    \ for a number of rounds equal to the sorcerer's Charisma modifier.\nAt 7th level,\
    \ the veil increases to a 30-foot radius. At 8th level, the veil decreases the\
    \ light level by two steps. If the light level is decreased past darkness, the\
    \ veil is treated as deeper darkness.\nAt 14th level, the veil increases to 60\
    \ feet and grants any creature within it cover (even against senses normally able\
    \ to penetrate total darkness, such as the see in darkness ability).\nAn umbral\
    \ scion can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma\
    \ modifier."
