  description: "At 2nd level, a charlatan can convincingly fake the ability to use\
    \ occult skill unlocks such as automatic writing and dowsing. An untrained onlooker\
    \ can't tell the difference between the false medium's scams and a true use of\
    \ occult skill unlocks.\nAn onlooker capable of using the particular occult skill\
    \ unlock that the false medium is faking can attempt the appropriate skill check\
    \ for that unlock, opposed by the false medium's Bluff check, to detect the fraud.\n\
    In any case, any results of the false medium's charades are fabricated (for instance,\
    \ the false medium might ask leading questions to elicit false memories while\
    \ pretending to use hypnotism)."

  description: "At 3rd level, the false medium exploits his natural talent for deception\
    \ to convince others of the presence of false supernatural entities. As long as\
    \ the false medium is in conditions of dim light or darkness, he can use Bluff\
    \ skill checks to emulate the effects of dancing lights, ghost sound, silent image,\
    \ or ventriloquism by throwing his voice, subtly misdirecting or convincing subjects,\
    \ or manipulating light and shadows. The range of these effects is 10 feet from\
    \ the false medium, plus an additional 5 feet for every 3 rogue levels he possesses\
    \ beyond 3rd. The effects last for 1 round, though they can be maintained with\
    \ additional checks.\nOnly one of these effects can be created or maintained in\
    \ a given round. Observers can attempt either a Perception or Sense Motive check\
    \ (whichever of their bonuses is higher) to oppose this Bluff check; the GM should\
    \ roll these checks secretly. This is an extraordinary ability and not an illusion,\
    \ so if the false medium succeeds at the opposed check, even powerful effects\
    \ like true seeing don't detect the fakery.\nThis ability replaces trap sense.\n\
    Rogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement the false medium rogue archetype:\
    \ esoteric scholar, fast fingers, honeyed words, major magic, minor magic, and\
    \ quick trapsmith."
