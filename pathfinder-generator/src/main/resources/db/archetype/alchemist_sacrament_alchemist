  description: "A sacrament alchemist can anoint himself as his deity's servant using\
    \ his own special version of a mutagen called a sacramental cognatogen. This is\
    \ brewed, imbibed, maintained, and can nauseate non-alchemists in the same way\
    \ as a mutagen. While a sacramental cognatogen is in effect, the sacrament alchemist\
    \ takes a â€“2 penalty to Dexterity.\nInstead of providing physical benefits, the\
    \ sacramental cognatogen grants the sacrament alchemist access to the domain powers\
    \ of one domain or subdomain belonging to his deity as if he were a cleric of\
    \ his alchemist level. The sacrament alchemist must choose the domain or subdomain\
    \ when he brews the sacramental cognatogen. A sacrament alchemist can select an\
    \ alignment domain only if his alignment matches that domain. He treats his alchemist\
    \ level as his cleric level for purposes of using these domain powers, and treats\
    \ his Intelligence modifier as his Wisdom modifier for purposes of variable effects.\
    \ The effects of the sacramental cognatogen last for 10 minutes per alchemist\
    \ level.\nA sacrament alchemist doesn't gain the bonus spells listed for each\
    \ domain, nor does he gain any bonus spell slots. Levels of classes that normally\
    \ provide access to domains stack with the sacrament alchemist's alchemist level\
    \ for purposes of determining domain powers and abilities, but not for purposes\
    \ of determining bonus spells. Discoveries, feats, and effects that interact with\
    \ the mutagen class feature do not affect sacramental cognatogen. A sacrament\
    \ alchemist cannot take the cognatogen or mutagen discoveries."

  description: "At 3rd level, a sacrament alchemist's faith inspires him with ideas\
    \ for novel alchemical achievements, although the mental strain means that he\
    \ can't reliably repeat them. Once per day while preparing extracts, for a period\
    \ of 24 hours, a sacrament alchemist can gain an alchemist discovery for which\
    \ he qualifies. He treats his alchemist level as 2 lower for the purpose of this\
    \ discovery.\nThis ability replaces swift alchemy."
