  description: "Whenever an energy scientist regains his daily uses of bombs, he must\
    \ attune to one element and its corresponding energy type: air (electricity),\
    \ earth (acid), fire (fire), or water (cold). The energy scientist's bombs deal\
    \ the type of energy damage that corresponds to his attuned element until he regains\
    \ his daily uses of bombs, at which point he must attune to one element again.\
    \ If the energy scientist uses a discovery that changes his bomb's damage type\
    \ to one that is different from that of his attuned element (such as using the\
    \ acid bomb discovery when the alchemist is attuned to fire), instead of its normal\
    \ amount of damage, the bomb deals 1d4 points of damage, plus 1d4 for every odd-numbered\
    \ alchemist level.\nThis ability causes the explosive bomb and inferno bomb discoveries\
    \ to change the bomb's damage type to fire if the alchemist is not attuned to\
    \ fire."

    \ corresponding energy damage. This bonus increases to +3 at 5th level and to\

  description: "At 2nd level, an energy scientist can siphon power from slain elementals\
    \ into temporary alchemical weapons. While studying the remains of an elemental\
    \ that has been dead for no longer than 1 minute per alchemist level, you can\
    \ attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC = 20 + the elemental's CR) as a standard\
    \ action.\nSuccess means the alchemist produces a number of canisters of alchemist's\
    \ fire (from fire and magma elementals), bottled lightning (from air and lightning\
    \ elementals), deadground dust (from earth and mud elementals), or liquid ice\
    \ (from water and ice elementals) equal to half the elemental's CR, rounded down.\
    \ These items cannot be sold and become inert after 24 hours. At 6th level, the\
    \ save DCs of the items produced increase by 2."
