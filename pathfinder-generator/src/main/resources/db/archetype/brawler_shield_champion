  description: "At 3rd level, a shield champion can throw a heavy or light shield\
    \ as a normal (non-improvised) thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet\
    \ or the shield's range increment, whichever is greater. The thrown shield deals\
    \ the same damage as a shield bash, and any damage increases from shield spikes\
    \ apply to this attack. A shield champion is treated as having the Far Shot feat\
    \ for the purpose of determining range increment penalties for throwing a shield.\n\
    At 7th level, a shield champion can use a thrown shield to perform a bull rush,\
    \ dirty trick, disarm, reposition, or trip combat maneuver as if she were making\
    \ a melee shield bash attack. At 11th level, a shield champion gains Shield Master\
    \ as a bonus feat. She must meet all prerequisites before selecting that feat."

    \ this ability, the shield champion must attempt a Fortitude saving throw, with\
    \ the DC equal to the damage dealt. If it succeeds, she takes only half damage\
    \ from the blow; otherwise, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack\
    \ and able to react to it in order to use this ability--if she is denied her Dexterity\
    \ bonus to AC, she can't use this ability. At 19th level, she can use this ability\

  description: "At 5th level, a shield champion can throw a shield so it ricochets\
    \ off her target (and possibly other solid objects) to return to her at the end\
    \ of her turn. This ability functions whether or not the shield champion hits\
    \ her opponent or moves on her turn. The shield deals no damage to targets it\
    \ bounces off other than the original target of the shield champion's attack.\
    \ Other circumstances can prevent the shield from returning to the shield champion,\
    \ such as an opponent using a readied action to catch the shield, or the shield\
    \ sticking to a mimic's adhesive. The shield champion can opt to not have a thrown\
    \ shield return to her, in which case it falls to the ground as it normally would.\
    \ If the shield has the returning weapon special ability, she can use either that\
    \ or this ability.\nIf a shield champion has additional attacks from a high base\
    \ attack bonus, these additional attacks can be ricochets off an earlier target.\
    \ The distance to each additional target adds to the total range of the shield,\
    \ and range penalties apply, but there are no additional penalties for attacking\
    \ in this manner. Because ricocheting attacks are treated as separate attacks,\
    \ effects and modifiers that only apply to one attack roll (such as true strike)\
    \ only apply to the first attack and not to the others. A shield champion can\
    \ throw a shield as part of a brawler's flurry.\nAt 9th level, a shield champion\
    \ gains Greater Shield Focus as a bonus feat. She must meet all prerequisites\
    \ before selecting that feat. At 12th level, a shield champion can use her unarmed\
    \ strike damage when dealing damage with a shield (whether in melee or thrown)\
    \ or the shield's damage, whichever is greater. At 17th level, by ricocheting\
    \ her shield off a nearby surface before hitting your intended target, she can\
    \ treat that surface as the origin square of the attack to determine whether the\
    \ target is flanked and whether the target gains a cover bonus to its AC. She\
    \ can use this ability to attack a creature with total concealment from her if\
    \ she knows what square it occupies, but the attack still has a 50% miss chance."
