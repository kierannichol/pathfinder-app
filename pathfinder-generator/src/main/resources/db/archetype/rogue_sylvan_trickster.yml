description: "Sylvan tricksters are rogues who model themselves after the mischievous\
  \ fey of legend. Though not spellcasters, sylvan tricksters learn minor magical\
  \ abilities reminiscent of those favored by fey creatures. The journey for many\
  \ sylvan tricksters began in childhood, learning at an elder's knee the stories\
  \ of the fey and the secrets of how to resist their tricks. Sylvan tricksters often\
  \ live in areas where the boundary with the Fey World is thin, and a few have even\
  \ been there-- voluntarily or not."
