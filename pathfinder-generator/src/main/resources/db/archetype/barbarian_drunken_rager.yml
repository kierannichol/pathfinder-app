  description: "At 1st level, a drunken rager can drink a unit of ale or other strong\
    \ alcohol while raging to gain 1 drunken rage point. The act of drinking is a\
    \ standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At 1st level,\
    \ the barbarian can have a maximum of 1 drunken rage point; this maximum increases\
    \ by 1 every 2 levels thereafter. These drunken rage points last for 1 hour or\
    \ until spent, whichever comes first. The barbarian can use drunken rage points\
    \ only while raging. Unless otherwise noted, spending a drunken rage point is\
    \ a free action.\nA drunken rager can spend 1 drunken rage point to increase her\
    \ movement speed by 20 feet for 1 round, provided she is wearing no armor, light\
    \ armor, or medium armor and is not carrying a heavy load. She can also spend\
    \ 1 drunken rage point to gain 1 additional round of her rage class feature, which\
    \ lasts for 1 hour or until used."

  description: "At 12th level, a drunken rager can spend 1 drunken rage point as a\
    \ swift action before making a melee attack to drastically increase the deadliness\
    \ of her attack. The critical threat range of her next attack that round increases\
    \ by 1 (for example, a critical threat range of 20 would increase to 19â€“20). This\
    \ ability does not stack with any other effect that expands the critical threat\
    \ range of a weapon. At 16th level and again at 20th level, the barbarian can\
    \ spend 1 additional drunken rage point to further increase the critical threat\
    \ range of her next attack (to a maximum critical threat range increase of 3 at\
    \ 20th level)."
