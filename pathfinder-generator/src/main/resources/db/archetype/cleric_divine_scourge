  description: "At 3rd level and every 4 cleric levels thereafter, a divine scourge\
    \ can select the following hexes from the witch class hex list, up to a maximum\
    \ of five hexes at 19th level: blight, cursed wound, evil eye, misfortune, scar,\
    \ slumber, and unnerve beasts.\nAt 11th level, a divine scourge can instead select\
    \ from the following list of major hexes: agony, hoarfrost, infected wounds, nightmares,\
    \ and retributions.\nThe divine scourge uses her Wisdom modifier instead of her\
    \ Intelligence modifier to determine the save DCs of her hexes. Any hex that refers\
    \ to using her Intelligence modifier to determine its duration or effect instead\
    \ uses her Charisma modifier for that purpose."
