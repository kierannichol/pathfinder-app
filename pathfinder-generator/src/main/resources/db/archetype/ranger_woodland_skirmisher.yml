name: "Woodland Skirmisher"
description: "The forested regions are known for their rangers--skilled trackers,\
  \ marksmen, and silent stalkers under the leafy canopy. The people love freedom\
  \ and are reluctant to take orders from anyone, so defense falls to individual scouts\
  \ and small groups of allied commandos. Many rangers take the guide or skirmisher\
  \ archetypes, but some focus on the magic of stealth. These irregular troops fight\
  \ against the frequent invasions by foreign soldiers, striking quickly and melting\
  \ into the green shadows as soon as their opponents rally themselves for a counterattack."
