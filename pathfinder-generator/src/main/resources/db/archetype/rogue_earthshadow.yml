  description: "At 2nd level, an earthshadow can draw upon the power of earth to perform\
    \ mystical tricks. At the start of each day, an earthshadow gains a pool of earthcraft\
    \ points equal to half her rogue level plus her Wisdom modifier, and she can spend\
    \ earthcraft points to use certain spell-like abilities. The caster level of these\
    \ spell-like abilities is equal to the earthshadow's rogue level. Earthcraft effects\
    \ affect only the earthshadow, even if the spell could normally affect others.\
    \ She can spend 1 earthcraft point to cast blend, even if she is not an elf, but\
    \ this ability works only in areas of natural earth or unworked stone.\nAt 4th\
    \ level, an earthshadow can spend 2 earthcraft points to cast meld into stone.\n\
    At 8th level, an earthshadow can spend 3 earthcraft points to cast dimension door.\
    \ She must be able to see her destination (or she must be able to otherwise sense\
    \ its surface, such as with tremorsense), and her current location must be connected\
    \ to her destination by continuous natural earth or unworked stone.\nAt 12th level,\
    \ an earthshadow can spend 5 earthcraft points to cast the spell stone tell but\
    \ can communicate only with unworked stone.\nAt 16th level, an earthshadow can\
    \ spend 6 earthcraft points to cast statue.\nThis ability replaces evasion and\
    \ the rogue talents gained at 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th levels.\nRogue Talents:\
    \ The following rogue talents complement the earthshadow archetype: extra earthcraft\
    \ (see below), favored terrain, fortified position (see below), major magic, minor\
    \ magic, resiliency, and trap spotter."
