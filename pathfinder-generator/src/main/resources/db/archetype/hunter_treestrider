  description: "A treestrider can gain a climb speed equal to half her base speed\
    \ as a free action for 1 minute per hunter level per day. This duration must be\
    \ spent in 1-minute increments. In addition, she can use her climb speed to move\
    \ through the canopies of forests or jungles, provided the limbs of the trees\
    \ are strong enough to support her weight. The treestrider's companion gains a\
    \ +10-foot enhancement bonus to its climb speed. At 8th level, the treestrider's\
    \ climb speed increases to equal her base speed, the duration of her brachiation\
    \ increases to 10 minutes per hunter level per day (usable in 10-minute increments),\
    \ and the enhancement bonus to her companion's climb speed increases to +20 feet.\
    \ At 15th level, she can use brachiation with no limit on the duration."

    \ two trees, as per the spell tree stride. Unlike the spell, this ability has\
    \ a duration of instantaneous and the treestrider can make only a single transfer.\
    \ She can bring her animal companion with her, but if she does, her companion\
    \ can't take any actions that round. Tree stride can be used a number of times\
    \ per day equal to 3 + the hunter's Wisdom modifier."
