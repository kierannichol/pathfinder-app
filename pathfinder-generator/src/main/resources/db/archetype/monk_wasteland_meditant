  label: null
  type: null
  description: "As a free action as part of a melee attack, a wasteland meditant can\
    \ draw the moisture out of a living creature damaged by his unarmed strike. Unless\
    \ the creature succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the monk's level + his\
    \ Wisdom modifier), the creature is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to half\
    \ the wasteland meditant's level (minimum 1). At 5th level, the creature struck\
    \ is also staggered for 1 round if it fails its save. At 10th level, a creature\
    \ that fails its save is exhausted instead of fatigued.\nWhen used against a plant\
    \ creature or a creature with the water subtype, dehydrating strike inflicts the\
    \ above conditions (as applicable) on a failed save and also deals 1d6 points\
    \ of damage, plus 1d6 additional points of damage at 4th level and every 4 levels\
    \ thereafter. This damage is in addition to the wasteland meditant's normal unarmed\
    \ strike damage. A wasteland meditant can use this ability a number of times per\
    \ day equal to 3 + his Wisdom modifier but only once per round.\nCreatures immune\
    \ to critical hits or precision damage are immune to this ability."

  description: "At 4th level, a wasteland meditant ignores movement penalties for\
    \ difficult terrain when in desert terrain. Additionally, he kicks up dust around\
    \ his body whenever he performs a double move action in desert terrain. This dust\
    \ grants the wasteland meditant concealment. The miss chance granted by this concealment\
    \ starts at 10% at 4th level and increases by 10% at 6th level and every 2 levels\
    \ thereafter, to a maximum of 80% at 18th level. This concealment lasts until\
    \ the start of the meditant's next turn and stacks with any concealment provided\
    \ by movement, such as from the Wind Stance feat."

  description: "At 15th level, a wasteland meditant can transform a creature's body\
    \ into a column of crumbling salt with a touch. He can use pillar of salt once\
    \ per day as part of an unarmed strike, and he must announce his intent before\
    \ making his attack roll. Creatures immune to critical hits or transmutation effects\
    \ cannot be affected. A creature successfully damaged by the wasteland meditant's\
    \ unarmed strike must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the\
    \ monk's level + his Wisdom modifier) or begin to calcify. Each round thereafter,\
    \ the target of pillar of salt takes 2 points of Strength and Dexterity drain\
    \ and gains a +1 bonus to its natural armor as a crust of salt begins to cover\
    \ its body and restrict movement. These effects take place every round at the\
    \ start of the wasteland meditant's turn and continue for 1 round per level the\
    \ wasteland meditant has. If the target is reduced to 0 Strength or Dexterity\
    \ at any time during this duration, the creature is instantly killed and its body\
    \ is transformed into a pillar of salt. A creature killed in this way can't be\
    \ brought back to life except by miracle, true resurrection, or wish. Total immersion\
    \ in water suppresses the ongoing effects of pillar of salt but resets the accumulated\
    \ natural armor bonus to zero. As long as the target lives, the ongoing effect\
    \ of pillar of salt can be ended via a heal spell."
