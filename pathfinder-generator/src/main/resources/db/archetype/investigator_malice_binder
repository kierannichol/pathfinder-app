  label: null
  type: null
  description: "A malice binder forgoes alchemy for the study of sympathetic magic\
    \ that allows him to hinder foes.\nFetters rely on the magical resonance of creatures\
    \ capable of casting spells (spellcasters and creatures with spell-like abilities)\
    \ which saturates even their hair and clothing.\nFetters cannot target a creature\
    \ with no magical ability. The malice binder knows one fetter at 1st level and\
    \ gains another at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter.\nEvery fetter requires\
    \ a token taken from his desired target: a few hairs, a lost tooth, nail clippings,\
    \ a scrap of clothing, or a small treasured possession with some significance.\n\
    An investigator can obtain a single token in any of the following ways: a successful\
    \ Sleight of Hand check against an unsuspecting target, a successful steal combat\
    \ maneuver, or a successful Perception check (DC = 15 + the creature's CR) to\
    \ search an area his target occupied for at least 2 hours.\nMalice binders can\
    \ search such a location for additional tokens, but each subsequent Perception\
    \ check increases the DC by 5, regardless of success or failure. Tokens rely on\
    \ the magic that clings to spellcasters and creatures with spell-like abilities;\
    \ they must be carefully preserved as soon as they are recovered and before they\
    \ can be used. Preparing a token requires a move action, and a malice binder can\
    \ maintain one prepared token per class level. Each token can be used only to\
    \ power a fetter targeting the creature it came from, and it is consumed in the\
    \ process. At 7th level, the malice binder can instead prepare a token as a swift\
    \ action.\nThe DC to resist a fetter is equal to 10 + half the investigator's\
    \ class level + the investigator's Charisma bonus. Activating a fetter is a standard\
    \ action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and unless otherwise stated the\
    \ target must be within 30 feet, plus 5 feet per 2 levels. Once a creature has\
    \ been the target of a specific fetter, it is immune to that effect for 24 hours.\n\
    This replaces alchemy."
