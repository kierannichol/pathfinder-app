  description: "At 2nd level, whenever a ragechemist creates a mutagen that improves\
    \ his Strength, that mutagen's bonus to Strength increases by +2 and penalizes\
    \ the alchemist's Intelligence score.\nFurthermore, while under the effects of\
    \ this mutagen, whenever the alchemist takes damage, his rage grows, with detrimental\
    \ effects. At the end of each turn that he takes hit point damage, the ragechemist\
    \ must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 15, or DC 20 if any of the damage came\
    \ from a critical hit that turn) or take a –2 penalty on Will saving throws and\
    \ to Intelligence. These penalties end 1 hour after the mutagen ends and stack\
    \ with themselves. If the penalty lowers the ragechemist's Intelligence score\
    \ to 0, the ragechemist is comatose until 1 hour after the mutagen expires.\n\
    This ability replaces poison use."
