    \ duel with an extra edge that she can use for the presence tactic so long as\
    \ she is not at a significant or extreme disadvantage in the duel. However, her\

  description: "Whenever a battle scion would gain a rage power from the skald's rage\
    \ power ability (at 3rd level and every 3 skald levels thereafter), she can instead\
    \ choose to gain a combat feat or teamwork feat for which she meets the prerequisites.\n\
    Like rage powers she selects in this way, the battle scion can grant this feat\
    \ to allies under the effect of inspired rage, as long as those allies also meet\
    \ the prerequisites, but she must expend 2 rounds of raging song for each round\
    \ in which she grants a combat feat or teamwork feat.\nIf the battle scion gains\
    \ multiple feats from battle prowess, allies can use these feats to meet the prerequisites\
    \ for other feats while they're affected by battle prowess (for example, a battle\
    \ scion with Power Attack and Cleave from battle prowess could grant both, allowing\
    \ allies with a +1 base attack bonus and a Strength score of 13 to gain both,\
    \ since they can use Power Attack to qualify for Cleave)."

  description: "A battle scion gains the following raging song.\nSong of Questing\
    \ (Su): At 10th level, the battle scion can spend 4 rounds of raging song to draw\
    \ upon a target's honor, ambition, and sense of self in order to bind the target\
    \ to an agreed-upon task, often a noble quest. This works like geas/quest, except\
    \ it applies only if the target is truly willing (not magically compelled or tricked),\
    \ and the target automatically understands the full terms of the agreement before\
    \ deciding whether he is willing. The battle scion can offer a reward for the\
    \ completion of the noble quest, but if she does so and fails to live up to her\
    \ agreement, she becomes an ex-battle scion and loses all benefits gained from\
    \ the archetype (she does not gain the abilities they replaced, either). At 14th\
    \ level, she can offer the same quest to up to one willing creature per skald\
    \ level. If she does so, the effect ends for all creatures as soon as anyone completes\
    \ the quest, though only the creature who completes it earns any offered reward."

    \ that it can restore her even if she was slain by a death effect. Spells that\
