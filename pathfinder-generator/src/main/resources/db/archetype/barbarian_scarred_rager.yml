description: "Some barbarians wear marks of prowess and savagery upon their bodies.\
  \ The scarred rager believes each wound tells the tales of her prowess and bravery.\
  \ She augments these ragged trophies with brands and tattoos in order to win the\
  \ notice and favor of her gods, ancestors, or totem spirits. The scarred rager's\
  \ gnarled and exotic appearance terrifies civilized onlookers, but is awe-inspiring\
  \ to her savage kin."
