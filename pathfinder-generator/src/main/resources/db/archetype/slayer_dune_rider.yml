    \ following effects: kill, knock unconscious for 1d4 hours, or paralyze for 2d6\
    \ rounds. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed\
    \ at a Fortitude save or suffer the additional effect. The DC of this save is\
    \ 20 + the dune rider's Intelligence modifier. Whether or not the target succeeds,\
    \ it can't be targeted by this ability again for 24 hours."
