  description: "Starting at 1st level, each day when she prepares spells, a season\
    \ keeper can imbue her animal companion with the spirit of summer or the spirit\
    \ of winter.\nSpirit of Summer: The season keeper's animal companion projects\
    \ a 15-foot-radius aura of cooling and vigor. Allies in the aura can exist comfortably\
    \ in hot conditions as if they each had the seasoned racial ability of a Triaxian.\
    \ At 3rd level, the aura increases the power of the season keeper's healing magic--whenever\
    \ the season keeper targets an ally with a spell that has the healing descriptor,\
    \ the target also gains fast healing 2 for a number of rounds equal to the spell's\
    \ level. At 9th level, allies within the aura leave no trails in natural grassy\
    \ or forest environments, thus can't be tracked in such terrain. At 15th level,\
    \ the duration of the fast healing effect increases to 2 rounds per spell level\
    \ and affected allies can ignore difficult terrain caused by natural undergrowth\
    \ such as non-magical thorns, briars, overgrowth, and similar terrain. Spirit\
    \ of Winter: The season keeper's animal companion projects a 15-foot-radius aura\
    \ of warmth and calm. This aura allows allies to exist comfortably in cold conditions\
    \ as if they each had the seasoned racial ability of a Triaxian. At 3rd level,\
    \ allies gain resistance 10 to cold as long as they remain within the aura. At\
    \ 9th level, affected allies leave no trails in natural snow or ice, thus can't\
    \ be tracked in such terrain. At 15th level, affected allies gain resistance 20\
    \ to cold and can ignore difficult terrain caused by ice or snow."

  description: "A season keeper gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective\
    \ druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level â€“ 2. If she has imbued\
    \ her animal companion with the spirit of winter, she uses her full druid level\
    \ when taking on the form of an ice elemental. If she has imbued her companion\
    \ with the spirit of summer, she uses her full druid level when taking on the\
    \ form of a plant. A season keeper cannot use wild shape to assume the form of\
    \ an elemental except an ice elemental, and can assume that shape only if her\
    \ animal companion has the spirit of winter. Similarly, she can assume a plant\
    \ form only if her animal companion has the spirit of summer."
