    \ a second blessing.\nAt 7th level, an arsenal chaplain gains Quicken Blessing\
    \ (War) as a bonus feat even if he does not meet the prerequisites, but cannot\
    \ grant a War blessing to himself as a swift action with Quicken Blessing until\
    \ he is at least 10th level.\nAt 13th level, an arsenal chaplain can use the War\
    \ blessing on an ally at a range of up to 30 feet by spending an additional use\
    \ of the blessing ability.\nAt 16th level, an arsenal chaplain can use the War\
    \ blessing on a second target with a single use of the blessing ability.\nAt 19th\
    \ level, an arsenal chaplain can use the War blessing on any number of targets\
    \ at once with a single use of the blessing ability."
