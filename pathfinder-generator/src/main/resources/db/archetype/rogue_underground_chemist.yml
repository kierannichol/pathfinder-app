    \ alchemist discoveries in place of a rogue talent: concentrate poison, dilution,\
    \ enhance potion, extend potion, mummification, nauseating flesh, poison conversion,\
    \ preserve organs, spontaneous healing, or sticky poison. She uses her rogue level\
    \ as her alchemist level for determining the effects of her discoveries and whether\
    \ she is able to select one.\nThis ability alters advanced talents.\nRogue Talents:\
    \ The following rogue talents complement the underground chemist archetype: black\
    \ market connections, fast fingers, lasting poison, sniper's eye, and swift poison."
