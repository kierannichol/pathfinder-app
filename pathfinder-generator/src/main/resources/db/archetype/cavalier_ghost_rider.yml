  description: "At 1st level, a ghost rider gains the ability to manifest a special\
    \ mount of conjured ectoplasm rather than one of flesh and bone. This spectral\
    \ companion functions like a spiritualist's phantom companion, using the ghost\
    \ rider's cavalier level as her effective spiritualist level. The phantom takes\
    \ the form of a ghostly creature analogous to one of a cavalier's normal mount\
    \ options for her size and class level, such as a Large horse for a Medium ghost\
    \ rider or a wolf for a Small ghost rider. A ghost rider must choose a mount that\
    \ is capable of bearing her weight, that has four or more legs, and that lacks\
    \ a fly speed (although the GM may allow mounts with a swim speed in certain environments).\
    \ The GM might approve other animals as suitable mounts.\nThe ghost rider can\
    \ manifest her ghost mount only in ectoplasmic form, and she gains the spiritualist's\
    \ etheric tether class feature, applied to her ghost mount.\nThe mount shares\
    \ the cavalier's alignment. Though the mount cannot speak, it understands its\
    \ master's verbal commands and gains the phantom's link ability. The ghost mount\
    \ has good Fortitude and Reflex saves, and can have ranks in any of the following\
    \ skills: Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Escape Artist (Dex), Fly (Dex), Intimidate\
    \ (Cha), Perception (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str). The\
    \ ghost rider's ghost mount does not gain the share spells, deliver touch spells,\
    \ or incorporeal flight abilities. Ghost mounts do not gain emotional focus abilities.\n\
    The ghost rider does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding\
    \ her mount. The mount is always considered combat trained, and begins play with\
    \ Endurance as a bonus feat.\nGhost Mount Starting Statistics: Type animal (phantom);\
    \ Size one size category larger than the ghost rider; Speed 50 ft.; AC +4 natural\
    \ armor; Attack bite (1d4), 2 hooves (1d6; this is a secondary natural attack);\
    \ Ability Scores Str 16, Dex 13, Con 15, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6."

  description: "At 1st level, a ghost rider can use this ability on opponents within\
    \ 30 feet as a standard action, which acts as a gaze attack until the ghost rider's\
    \ next turn. Creatures within range that meet the ghost rider's gaze must succeed\
    \ at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the ghost rider's class level + the ghost\
    \ rider's Charisma modifier) or stand paralyzed in fear for 1 round. This is a\
    \ mind-affecting fear effect. Creatures that successfully save against that ghost\
    \ rider's frightful gaze are immune to it for 24 hours. At 9th level, this ability\
    \ can affect creatures that are mindless or immune to mind-affecting effects,\
    \ though it still counts as a fear effect. The ghost rider can use this ability\
    \ a number of times each day equal to her Charisma modifier."
