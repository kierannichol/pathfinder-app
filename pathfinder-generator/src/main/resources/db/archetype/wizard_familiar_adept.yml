    \ cannot use its lesser school power until 4th level. At 8th level, it gains access\

  description: "A familiar adept stores his spells in his familiar rather than in\
    \ a spellbook, exactly as a witch does. His familiar can freely trade spells known\
    \ with a witch's familiar, provided the spells traded are on both casters' class\
    \ spell lists. The familiar adept's familiar uses the witch rules for familiars,\
    \ including the increased cost of replacing the familiar."
