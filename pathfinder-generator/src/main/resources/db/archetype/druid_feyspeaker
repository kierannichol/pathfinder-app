  description: "At 1st level, a feyspeaker allows the strange idylls of the fey to\
    \ guide her magic. The feyspeaker uses her Charisma score instead of her Wisdom\
    \ score as her key spellcasting ability score (to determine her spell DCs, bonus\
    \ spells per day, concentration checks, and so on).\nAt 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th,\
    \ 14th, 16th, and 18th levels, a feyspeaker adds one enchantment or illusion spell\
    \ from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to her druid spell list as a spell of 1\
    \ level higher (for instance, at 4th level, she could add color spray as a 2nd-level\
    \ druid spell). In order to select a spell, she must be of a level high enough\
    \ (including the increased spell level) to cast it. Once selected, the spell cannot\
    \ be changed.\nA feyspeaker loses the ability to spontaneously cast summon nature's\
    \ ally spells. She gains the wild shape ability at 6th level and gains all benefits\
    \ related to wild shape 2 druid levels later than usual. She can never use wild\
    \ shape to transform into an elemental."

  description: "At 1st level, a feyspeaker's words carry a tiny fragment of the otherworldly\
    \ power of the fey's voices. She gains Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, and Sense Motive\
    \ as class skills. A feyspeaker also learns Sylvan as a bonus language. In addition,\
    \ the feyspeaker gains a number of skill ranks at each level equal to 6 + her\
    \ Intelligence modifier, instead of 4 + her Intelligence modifier. The feyspeaker's\
    \ base attack bonus from her druid levels is equal to half her druid level (much\
    \ like a sorcerer's base attack bonus is calculated), rather than the usual druid\
    \ base attack bonus."

  description: "At 1st level, a feyspeaker can fool an animal into thinking there\
    \ is food, a potential mate, or a predator nearby. This ability functions just\
    \ like a Bluff check to deceive a character. To determine the result of the wild\
    \ mischief check, the feyspeaker rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma\
    \ modifier. As with Bluff checks, wild mischief checks are modified depending\
    \ on the believability of the false information. A typical domestic animal is\
    \ not particularly suspicious of the feyspeaker (no circumstance modifier), whereas\
    \ wild animals are usually suspicious (–5 penalty on the check).\nTo use wild\
    \ mischief, the feyspeaker and the animal must be able to study each other, which\
    \ means they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions.\n\
    Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but as when influencing\
    \ people, it could take more or less time. A feyspeaker can also use this ability\
    \ to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes\
    \ a –4 penalty on the check."
