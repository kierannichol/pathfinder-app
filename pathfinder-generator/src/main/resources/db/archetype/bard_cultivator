  description: "A cultivator can spontaneously promote massive plant growth with his\
    \ bardic performance. While he maintains his song of growth, the cultivator can\
    \ spend a standard action to select one side of a square within 30 feet of himself\
    \ and instantly create an opaque barrier of plant matter to block that face, providing\
    \ total cover. He can create one barrier as part of starting his bardic performance\
    \ if he starts the performance as a standard action. The side the cultivator selects\
    \ must be supported by the ground, and the growth itself cannot support more than\
    \ 5 pounds of weight. The conjured barrier has hardness 0, AC 5, and 2 hit points\
    \ per bard level. A cultivator can maintain a number of plant growths equal to\
    \ his Charisma modifier + half his bard level. These barriers immediately crumble\
    \ to dust when the cultivator ends his performance."
