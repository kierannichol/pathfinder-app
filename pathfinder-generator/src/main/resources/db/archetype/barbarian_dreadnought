  description: "A dreadnought can enter a dispassionate killing spree as a free action,\
    \ granting her additional combat prowess. The dreadnought gains only half the\
    \ usual bonuses from her rage but takes no penalty to her AC, can use all her\
    \ normal skills and effects that require concentration, and is not fatigued when\
    \ her rage ends. The dreadnought cannot enter a rage for 1 minute after she ends\
    \ her rage, and she cannot charge or run while under the effects of her rage."
