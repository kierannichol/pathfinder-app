    \ that modifies poisons he creates and applies, using his Wisdom modifier in place\
    \ of his Intelligence modifier and his ranger level in place of his alchemist\
    \ or rogue level for the purpose of meeting prerequisites. He can use the sticky\
    \ poison discovery to apply a single dose of poison to two blowgun darts without\
