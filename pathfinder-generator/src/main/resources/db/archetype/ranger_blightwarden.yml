  description: "Once per day as a standard action, a blightwarden can examine visible\
    \ evidence of a creature that has been affected by a natural or supernatural blight.\
    \ This might include visible tracks left by a creature with the fungal creature\
    \ template, or a dead creature with the blighted fey template, or any similar\
    \ evidence left by any creature as described in the hunt the blighted fey ability.\n\
    When the blightwarden does this, for the next 24 hours, he can use any one extraordinary,\
    \ supernatural, or spell-like ability granted by the template (or the blight subtype)\
    \ for a number of minutes equal to his ranger level. This duration need not be\
    \ used all at once, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. Saving throw\
    \ DCs for this ability are calculated as if the blightwarden had the relevant\
    \ template (for example, the DC of an ability from the blighted fey template would\
    \ be equal to 10 + half the blightwarden's Hit Dice + his Constitution modifier).\
    \ He cannot use abilities that would create a permanent effect beyond this ability's\
    \ duration, and can never use more than one ability from a template or subtype\
    \ in this way during a single 24-hour period.\nFor example, the blightwarden cannot\
    \ use a blighted ooze's cursed domain ability to create a domain of evil. However,\
    \ the blightwarden could gain a blighted fey's thorn throw ability for a number\
    \ of minutes equal to his ranger level (in this case, the blightwarden would gain\
    \ a thorn attack for that duration)."

  description: "At 3rd level, a blightwarden gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks\
    \ and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks when in\
    \ areas afflicted by a natural or supernatural blight. Blighted areas include\
    \ cursed lands, domains of evil, regions negatively affected by a spell or ability\
    \ that affects at least a 300-square-foot area, or regions where a specific affliction\
    \ is prevalent. In addition, the blightwarden adds this bonus to ability checks,\
    \ saving throws, and skill checks to avoid natural and supernatural hazards in\
    \ blighted areas. He can choose to improve this bonus in place of improving a\
    \ favored terrain bonus. A blightwarden traveling through blighted areas leaves\
    \ no trail and cannot be tracked (though he can leave a trail if he chooses)."
