  \ to their more savage side, letting their rages take them to a confusing and uncontrolled\
  \ place of terrible savagery. These barbarians become beasts, consumed with absolute\
  \ bloodlust to the point where they cannot tell friend from foe."

  description: "At 2nd level, even when not raging, wild ragers often fight with reckless,\
    \ savage abandon. A wild rager using the full-attack action can make one extra\
    \ attack per round at her highest base attack bonus. Until the beginning of her\
    \ next turn, however, she takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and –4 penalty to\
    \ AC."

  description: "At 5th level, a wild rager who fails a saving throw against any mind-affecting\
    \ effect can attempt a new saving throw at the beginning of her next turn. If\
    \ the save succeeds, that effect ends and she instead rages and becomes confused\
    \ as noted above.\nThis ability replaces improved uncanny dodge."
