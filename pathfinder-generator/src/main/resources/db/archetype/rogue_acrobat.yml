  description: "At 3rd level, an acrobat can reroll any Acrobatics, Climb, or Fly\
    \ skill check she has just made. This reroll is made at a â€“5 penalty. She must\
    \ take the second result, even if it is worse. An acrobat can use this ability\
    \ only once on any given skill check. She can use this ability once per day at\
    \ 3rd level, plus one additional time per day for every 3 levels beyond 3rd.\n\
    This ability replaces trap sense.\nRogue Talents: The following rogue talents\
    \ complement the acrobat archetype: expert leaper, ledge walker*, nimble climber,\
    \ peerless maneuver, rogue crawl*, and stand up*."
