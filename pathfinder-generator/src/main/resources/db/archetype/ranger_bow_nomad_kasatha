  description: "At 1st level, a bow nomad can simultaneously wield a combination of\
    \ two of any of the following ranged weapons: shortbow, longbow, and their composite\
    \ versions. When a bow nomad makes a full attack with two bows, two-weapon penalties\
    \ apply and can be offset with Two-Weapon Fighting feats. Since bows aren't light\
    \ weapons, a bow nomad with Two-Weapon Fighting takes a –4 penalty on attacks\
    \ with each of her bows. Extra attacks from other sources, such as those granted\
    \ by Manyshot or Rapid Shot, can be applied to only one of the wielded bows per\
    \ round."

  label: null
  type: null
  description: "A bow nomad can make a number of trick shots per day equal to 1/2\
    \ her ranger level + her Dexterity modifier. Unless otherwise noted, making a\
    \ trick shot is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.\nDeflecting\
    \ Arrow: At 3rd level, as an immediate action that doesn't provoke attacks of\
    \ opportunity, a bow nomad can deflect a single ranged attack. This ability functions\
    \ as the Deflect Arrows feat, except the bow nomad need not have a hand free and\
    \ can deflect an attack targeting any creature within 30 feet. Hampering Strike:\
    \ At 8th level, a bow nomad can attempt to disarm or trip an opponent within 30\
    \ feet in place of a ranged attack, with a –4 penalty on the combat maneuver check.\
    \ Pinning Strike: At 13th level, a bow nomad can attempt to pin a Large or smaller\
    \ opponent's limb or clothing to the ground or a wall in place of an attack. If\
    \ the bow nomad's attack roll exceeds her opponent's CMD, the opponent is pinned\
    \ and cannot move from its current position. As a move action, the opponent can\
    \ attempt a Strength check to free itself (DC = 10 + 1/2 the bow nomad's ranger\
    \ level + her Strength modifier). Only creatures adjacent to a solid, anchored,\
    \ penetrable surface can be affected by this ability. Exploit the Gap: At 18th\
    \ level, a bow nomad can exploit the natural weaknesses of her foes. When a bow\
    \ nomad makes a full attack with her twin bows, each arrow that deals damage in\
    \ that attack also reduces the target's natural armor bonus (if any) by 1 (to\
    \ a minimum of 0) for 1 round."

  description: "At 6th level, the bow nomad must select the Manyshot feat as her 6th-level\

    \ can specify the bow in her off hands as the source of the second arrow (precision\
    \ damage and critical damage are still only added once). The bow nomad takes no\
    \ two-weapon penalties when using this ability, but she cannot use it and Two-Weapon\
    \ Fighting in the same round. The nomad can still choose to use Manyshot in the\
    \ normal manner.\nAt 11th and 16th level, the bow nomad can apply this ability\
    \ to each of her iterative attacks."
