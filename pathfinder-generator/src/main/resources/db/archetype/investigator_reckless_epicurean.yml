  description: "At 5th level, once per day, a reckless epicurean can prepare one experimental\
    \ potable using a formula that she does not know from the alchemist formulae list\
    \ into an extract slot of the appropriate level.\nThese experimental potables\
    \ often have side effects. When a creature consumes one of these potables, the\
    \ investigator must succeed at a Spellcraft check (DC = 15 + the formula's level).\
    \ On a failure, she must roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to determine the extra\
    \ effects. If the wild magic surge effect isn't possible due to the nature of\
    \ the spell or effect, roll instead on the Universal Surge Effects table.\nResults\
    \ concerning the caster affect the drinker of the experimental potable instead.\n\
    At 8th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, the reckless epicurean can prepare\
    \ one additional experimental potable per day."

  description: "At 13th level, when a reckless epicurean drinks an extract or a potion,\
    \ she gains an alchemical bonus on saves against spells and spell-like abilities\
    \ of the same school as that potion or extract for a number of rounds equal to\
    \ her Intelligence modifier.\nThis bonus is equal to the level of the spell contained\
    \ in the extract or potion. The investigator can use this ability a number of\
    \ times per day equal to her Intelligence modifier (minimum 1)."
