    \ investigator level to determine the effects of this ability. She gains free\
    \ uses of inspiration on Diplomacy, Knowledge (arcana, history, local, nobility,\
    \ planes, religion), and Sense Motive skill checks without spending a use of inspiration,\
    \ provided she's trained in that skill. A psychic searcher's inspiration pool\
    \ refreshes each day, usually when she refreshes her spells. A psychic searcher's\
    \ inspiration pool is based on her Charisma modifier, not her Intelligence modifier.\

  description: "At 3rd level, a psychic searcher's mastery of her supernatural insight\
    \ grows, granting her a new investigator talent from the following list: amazing\
    \ inspiration, eidetic recollection, empathy, inspired alertness, item lore, perceptive\
    \ tracking (except using Sense Motive instead of Perception or Survival), rogue\
    \ talent (only for hard to fool), and tenacious inspiration. Whenever a psychic\
    \ searcher can select a new revelation, she can instead select an investigator\
    \ or rogue talent from the above list.\nThis ability replaces the revelation gained\
