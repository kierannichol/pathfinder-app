  description: "At 4th level, a season sage can infuse living things with the essence\
    \ of a season with a touch, causing them to manifest the changes associated with\
    \ that season--for example, a touch of winter can make some animals grow a thick\
    \ winter coat, while a touch of summer can make them shed. A touch of autumn would\
    \ make a deciduous tree's leaves change colors, a touch of winter would make its\
    \ leaves fall, and a touch of spring would make it put forth new leaves. In addition,\
    \ a season sage can use the following abilities (in any combination) a total number\
    \ of times per day equal to 1 + his Wisdom modifier.\nVernal Growth: A touched\
    \ living creature gains the effects of enlarge person (even if it is not a humanoid)\
    \ for 1 minute per druid level. A touched non-creature plant likewise doubles\
    \ in all dimensions for the same duration. Summer Might: A touched creature gains\
    \ a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution for 1 minute per druid level. Autumn\
    \ Rot: A touched creature or object made of plant matter takes 1d6 points of acid\
    \ damage per 2 druid levels. Winter Frost: A touched creature or object takes\
    \ 1d6 points of cold damage per 2 druid levels."
