  description: "At 1st level, a roof runner becomes entirely adept at moving across\
    \ the tops of buildings, spires, and similar locations. Provided she is wearing\
    \ light armor or no armor, the roof runner can move at full speed while traveling\
    \ across the tops of buildings or similar structures, and takes no penalties on\
    \ any Dexterity-based Skill checks or Reflex saves that might be incurred from\
    \ moving about on a roof."

  label: null
  type: null
  description: "At 2nd level, a roof runner can use her Acrobatics skill to attempt\
    \ a rapid descent from a rooftop or another surface, ricocheting against another\
    \ surface and then diving through an opening (such as a balcony or window) directly\
    \ below. So long as she has at least two surfaces no farther than 10 feet apart\
    \ to bounce against, she can ricochet her body back from one to the next, descending\
    \ great distances with a single check. The DC is 10 + 5 for every additional 10-foot\
    \ increment descended beyond the initial 10 feet dropped. If she fails, she falls\
    \ the full distance.\nThis ability replaces trap sense.\nRogue Talents: The following\
    \ rogue talents complement the roof runner archetype: expert leaper, ledge walker,\
    \ nimble climber, stand up, and terrain mastery."
