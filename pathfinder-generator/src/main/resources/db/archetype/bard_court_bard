  description: "A court bard gains the following types of bardic performance:\nSatire\
    \ (Su): A court bard can use performance to undermine the confidence of enemies\
    \ who hear it, causing them to take a –1 penalty on attack and damage rolls (minimum\
    \ 1) and a –1 penalty on saves against fear and charm effects as long as the bard\
    \ continues performing. This penalty increases by –1 at 5th level and every six\
    \ levels thereafter. Satire is a language-dependent, mind-affecting ability that\
    \ uses audible components.\nThis performance replaces inspire courage.\nMockery\
    \ (Su): A court bard of 3rd level or higher can subtly ridicule and defame a specific\
    \ individual. The bard selects one target who can hear his performance. That individual\
    \ takes a –2 penalty on Charisma checks and Charisma-related skill checks as long\
    \ as the bard continues performing. This penalty increases by –1 every four levels\
    \ after 3rd. Mockery is a language-dependent, mind-affecting ability that relies\
    \ on audible components.\nThis performance replaces inspire competence.\nGlorious\
    \ Epic (Su): A court bard of 8th level or higher can weave captivating tales that\
    \ engross those who hear them. Enemies within 30 feet become flat-footed unless\
    \ they succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier).\
    \ A save renders them immune to this ability for 24 hours. Glorious epic is a\
    \ language-dependent, mind-affecting ability that uses audible components.\nThis\
    \ performance replaces dirge of doom.\nScandal (Su): A court bard of 14th level\
    \ or higher can combine salacious gossip and biting calumny to incite a riot.\
    \ Each enemy within 30 feet is affected as if by a song of discord for as long\
    \ as it can hear the performance. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's\
    \ level + the bard's Cha modifier) negates the effect, and that creature is immune\
    \ to this ability for 24 hours. Scandal is a language-dependent, mind-affecting\
    \ ability that uses audible components."

    \ feet (radius) or 20 feet (cone). If the power instead affects multiple creatures,\
    \ it affects one additional creature than normal for every five levels beyond\
    \ 5th. This does not affect powers that affect only a single creature."
