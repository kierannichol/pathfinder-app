    Benefit: "The magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a standard action\
      \ to charge his free hand with energy. He can make a melee touch attack with\
      \ that hand as a free action as part of activating this ability. If the touch\
      \ attack hits, it releases the charge and deals 2d6 points of energy damage\
      \ (acid, cold, electricity, or fire, chosen when he spends the arcane pool point\
      \ to activate this ability). He can use this ability with the spellstrike class\
      \ feature. If he misses with this attack, he can hold the charge for up to 1\
      \ minute before it dissipates. At 6th level, and every three levels thereafter,\
      \ the amount of damage dealt by this attack increases by 1d6."
