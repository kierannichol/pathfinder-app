    Benefit: "The magus forms a much closer relationship with his weapon. The power\
      \ turns her weapon almost into an extension of his body. The magus can spend\
      \ 1 point from her arcane pool as a swift action to reach out into the history\
      \ of the weapon to learn its secrets, casting her mind back through time and\
      \ space. For a moment, she literally embodies the weapon’s history and use.\
      \ Consequently, the magus gains the use of one feat of her choice that directly\
      \ improves her use of the weapon, such as Weapon Focus or Improved Critical.\
      \ The magus must meet all of the feat’s prerequisites to gain it; a magus with\
      \ the black blade class ability uses her magus class level in place of her base\
      \ attack bonus. The feat remains with her for one minute per magus class level."
