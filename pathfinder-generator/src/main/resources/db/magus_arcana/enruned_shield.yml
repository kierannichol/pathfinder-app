    Benefit: "The magus may expend a point from his arcane pool to scribe a rune of\
      \ power on a shield with which the magus is proficient. While the rune is in\
      \ place, the magus can use the hand holding that shield to complete somatic\
      \ components of magus spells he casts, and is considered to have that hand free\
      \ for purposes of spell combat. The rune lasts 10 minutes per level."
