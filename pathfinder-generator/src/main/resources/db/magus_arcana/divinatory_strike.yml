    Benefit: "Whenever the magus scores a critical hit against an opponent with a\
      \ melee attack, he can gain preternatural insight into his foe’s strengths and\
      \ weaknesses as though he had rolled a natural 20 on a Knowledge check to identify\
      \ the creature struck. Any bonuses or penalties the magus normally applies to\
      \ such a Knowledge check are applied to this ability, including his Intelligence\
      \ modifier, ranks in the requisite Knowledge skill, and other applicable modifiers.\
      \ Depending on the final calculated outcome of this ability and the CR of the\
      \ creature struck, the magus may still be unable to glean information about\
      \ his enemy. This ability works even if the magus has already attempted a Knowledge\
      \ check to identify the creature."
