    Special: "A magus can select this magus arcana more than once."
    Benefit: "When a magus selects this arcana, he must select one spell from the\
      \ bard spell list that is at least one level lower than the highest magus spell\
      \ level he can cast. He adds this spell to his spellbook and list of magus spells\
      \ known as a magus spell one level higher than its bard spell level. He can\
      \ instead select two spells to add in this way, but both must be at least two\
      \ levels lower than the highest-level magus spell he can cast."
