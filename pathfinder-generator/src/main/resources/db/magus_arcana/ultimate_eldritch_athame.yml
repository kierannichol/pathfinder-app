    Benefit: "As a free action, the magus can cause his weapon to manifest new powers\
      \ as she literally sculpts its magical form with her arcana. Once per round\
      \ as a free action, the magus can alter the weapon’s magical properties. She\
      \ can choose to spend its total enhancement bonus on weapon traits and powers,\
      \ or she can devote them to an enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage\
      \ rolls (+5 maximum as normal). For example, an magus’s weapon is a +5 weapon\
      \ and has been given the frost (+1), keen (+1), and speed (+3) special abilities.\
      \ The eldritch blade could alter the +5 bonus spent on abilities to gain a different\
      \ set of powers, such as dancing (+4) and flaming (+1). This change is permanent\
      \ until the magus changes them yet again."
