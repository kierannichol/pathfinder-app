    Benefit: "The elves have many songs that speak of their great victories. The magus\
      \ can spend 1 point from her arcane pool as a swift action to inject the triumphant\
      \ emotions behind such tunes with magical energy, causing them to lift his allies’\
      \ hearts while crushing her enemies’ hopes for 1 round per magus class level.\
      \ All her allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale bonus on attacks, checks,\
      \ and saves. Enemies with an Intelligence score within this same area must make\
      \ Will saves (DC 10 + half her magus class level + her Intelligence modifier)\
      \ or take a –1 morale penalty on attacks. The magus does not gain the benefits\
      \ of this ability—only her allies gain them."
