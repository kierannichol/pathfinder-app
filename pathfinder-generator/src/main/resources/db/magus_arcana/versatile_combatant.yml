    Benefit: "The magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action\
      \ to augment his combat skill. The magus selects one feat for which he meets\
      \ all the prerequisites. The magus is considered to have that feat for a number\
      \ of rounds equal to the magusâ€™s Intelligence modifier. The magus can only access\
      \ one feat at a time using this magus arcane; if he uses it to select a new\
      \ feat, any previously gained feat is immediately lost."
