    Benefit: "The magus can spend 1 point from her arcane pool as a free action so\
      \ that the damage dealt by her pool strike grants her temporary hit points equal\
      \ to the damage she deals with her pool strike. She can’t gain more than the\
      \ subject’s current hit points + the subject’s Constitution score (which is\
      \ enough to kill the subject). The temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later."
