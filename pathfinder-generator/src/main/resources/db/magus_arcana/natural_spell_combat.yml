    Benefit: "The magus can use his spell combat class feature with a natural attack\
      \ of his choice. If he does, he gains a +2 bonus on concentration checks. If\
      \ the natural attack is made with an appendage that would normally hold a weapon\
      \ (such as a claw attack), the magus cannot wield a weapon in that appendage\
      \ while making natural attacks with it. If the natural attack is a bite or other\
      \ attack that does not require a free appendage to make, the magus can use the\
      \ natural attack in addition to all of the attacks he could make with his melee\
      \ weapon, if he has one."
