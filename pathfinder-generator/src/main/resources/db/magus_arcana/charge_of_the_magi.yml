  sections:
    Benefit: "The magus can spend 1 point from her arcane pool as a swift action when\
      \ charging, so she can turn herself into a living projectile that blasts her\
      \ opponent with a jolt of arcane power. She makes a charge as normal. If her\
      \ attack hits, she deals an extra 1d6 points of force damage plus an additional\
      \ 1d6 for every 3 magus levels she possesses in addition to her attackâ€™s normal\
      \ damage, and her foe must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + half her magus class\
      \ level + her Intelligence modifier) or be knocked prone. This extra damage\
      \ is doubled on a critical hit, in addition upon a critical hit a +2 circumstance\
      \ bonus is added to the DC of the save. When making this charge, she is considered\
      \ to be flying. She can move over pits and other hazards, but she lands in the\
      \ space where her charge ends and suffers any drawbacks for standing there after\
      \ resolving her attack. If she misses the ability is expended."
