    Benefit: "The magus can use special scar-based tattoos called spell-scars on his\
      \ skin to cast or prepare spells, much like scrolls. He can cast a spell from\
      \ a spell-scar exactly like casting from a scroll; the ink and scars vanish\
      \ when the spell is cast. The magus can also prepare spells from his spell-scars\
      \ without expending them, similar to a wizard using the Spell Mastery feat."
