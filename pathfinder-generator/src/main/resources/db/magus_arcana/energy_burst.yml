    Benefit: "The magus can spend 2 points from her arcane pool as a swift action\
      \ to create a burst of energy that fills a 30-foot spread centered on her. This\
      \ energy is of a type chosen at the time she selects this major arcana and once\
      \ chosen it cannot be changed (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). This\
      \ burst of energy deals 1d6 points of damage per magus class level (maximum\
      \ of 20d6). Anyone in this area must make Reflex saves (DC 10 + half her + her\
      \ Intelligence modifier) for half damage. The magus is immune to the effects\
      \ and damage from her own energy burst."
