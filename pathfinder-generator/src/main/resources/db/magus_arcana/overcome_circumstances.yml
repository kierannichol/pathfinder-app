    Benefit: "The magus can expend 1 or more point from her arcane pool as a free\
      \ action to shrug off detrimental effects. She can immediately attempt a second\
      \ saving throw to shrug off one unwanted condition even if she fails this save\
      \ she ignores one debilitating conditions per point expended that she is currently\
      \ under the effect of for 1 round per magus class level, that time counts as\
      \ part of each conditionâ€™s duration. Once this benefit lapses, the remaining\
      \ conditions return for the remainder of their durations. She cannot delay or\
      \ shrug off the dead condition."
