    Benefit: "The magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as an immediate action\
      \ after hitting a target with a weapon attack, granting him a premonition of\
      \ his enemyâ€™s intentions. The magus gains a bonus to his AC and on Reflex saves\
      \ equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 0) against attacks by that opponent\
      \ until the beginning of his next turn."
