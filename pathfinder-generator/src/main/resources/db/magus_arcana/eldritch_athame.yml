    Benefit: "The magus can spend 1 point from her arcane pool as a swift action to\
      \ transforms her weapon into a weapon of pure magical energy for 1 minute per\
      \ magus class level. She can cause it to adopt a new form suitable to the opponent\
      \ at hand. The weapon retains any magical qualities it had in its normal form.\
      \ The magus can choose to return it to its normal form before that time. The\
      \ weapon can become any weapon that is the same size or one category larger\
      \ or smaller than its base form. The magus gains proficiency with that specific\
      \ weapon during that time. A magus can transform the weapon into a ranged weapon,\
      \ but she must supply ammunition as normal."
