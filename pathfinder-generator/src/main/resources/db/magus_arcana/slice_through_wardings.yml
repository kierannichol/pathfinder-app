    Benefit: "The magus can spend 1 point from her arcane pool to make a single attack\
      \ as a standard action that ignores all a foe’s magic-based protections (Armor\
      \ Class bonuses, stoneskin, and so on). The magus cannot use this ability to\
      \ ignore spells or effects that take affect when a foe is attacked, like fire\
      \ shield. The character must declare his use of this ability before making the\
      \ attack."
