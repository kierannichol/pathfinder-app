  sections:
    Benefit: "The magus can spend 1 point from her arcane pool as a swift action to\
      \ create a tangible web of searing energy that wraps and tangles around her\
      \ weapon. When she attacks, this web clings to her opponent and continues to\
      \ damage the foe for a number of rounds equal to half her magus class level.\
      \ She creates a web of pure energy that can burn, shock, or freeze an opponent.\
      \ This energy is of a type chosen at the time she selects this major arcana\
      \ and once chosen it cannot be changed (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic).\
      \ If she makes a successful melee attack before this ability’s duration ends,\
      \ she transfers the web of energy to her opponent. He takes 1d6 points of energy\
      \ damage per two magus class levels she possesses in each round, at the start\
      \ of her turn, until this ability’s duration ends. She also gains this extra\
      \ damage on the attack that transfers the web to the target. Her opponent may\
      \ make a Reflex save (DC 10 + half her magus class level + her Intelligence\
      \ modifier) to avoid the web; If he succeeds, the magus deals the extra energy\
      \ damage with her attack but he avoids becoming trapped in the web and does\
      \ not take any further damage from it. A creature caught in an energy web can\
      \ escape by taking a move action and making a successful Escape Artist check\
      \ against a Difficulty Class equal to the Reflex save DC needed to avoid it."
