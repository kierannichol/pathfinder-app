    Benefit: "An magus can transform her weapon into a glittering weapon of pure energy\
      \ by channeling her spell slots directly into it. The magus can expend a single\
      \ spell slot to increase her weapon’s enhancement bonus on attacks and damage\
      \ by an amount equal to half the slot’s level. This bonus can improve the weapon’\
      s enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, or it can be spent on\
      \ weapon special abilities that are expressed as an enhancement bonus. This\
      \ bonus lasts for 1 minute per magus class level, and the magus can use only\
      \ one spell slot in this manner at a time. If a magus activates this ability\
      \ while a previous use of it is still in effect, the new bonus replaces the\
      \ old one—it does not stack."
