    Benefit: "The magus can expend 1 point from her arcane pool as a swift action\
      \ to strengthen her legs and improve her agility, granting a +10 foot enhancement\
      \ bonus to her speed for a number of rounds equal to her magus class level.\
      \ She can walk up vertical surfaces at her base land speed. She does not gain\
      \ the ability to hang upside down, making it impossible for her to move along\
      \ any surface that is more than a 90- degree slope with respect to the ground.\
      \ She can also make a double move and run when moving in this manner. If she\
      \ does not end her move on a horizontal surface, she falls as normal. She suffers\
      \ attacks of opportunity and other effects for moving along a surface as normal."
