    Benefit: "The magus can sacrifice 1 or more points from his arcane pool as an\
      \ immediate action to reflect a spell back at its caster. This functions as\
      \ spell turning, but only if the targeted spell is of a level equal to or lower\
      \ than the number of points expended. If insufficient points are expended, they\
      \ instead grant an insight bonus on any saving throws allowed by the spell,\
      \ equal to the number of points spent."
