    Benefit: "The magus may expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action\
      \ to grant any armor he is wearing a +1 enhancement bonus to AC for 1 minute.\
      \ For every four levels beyond 1st, the armor gains another +1 enhancement bonus,\
      \ to a maximum of +5 at 17th level. These bonuses can be added to the armor,\
      \ stacking with existing armor enhancement to a maximum of +5. Multiple uses\
      \ of this ability do not stack with themselves."
