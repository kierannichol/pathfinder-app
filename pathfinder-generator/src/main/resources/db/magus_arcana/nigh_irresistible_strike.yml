  text: "Use your arcane pool to penetrate your foe’s defenses"
  sections:
    Special: "A creature or object that saves against this ability is immune to the\
      \ effects of her resistant strike for 24 hours."
    Benefit: "The magus can spend 1 point from her arcane pool as a swift action to\
      \ channel arcane energy through her weapon, which allows the power to flow into\
      \ her opponent and disrupt his magical defenses. As a free action before resolving\
      \ an attack, she may declare that she is using this ability. If she hits, roll\
      \ and apply damage as normal. In addition, if the target fails a Will Save (DC\
      \ 10 + half her magus class level + her Intelligence Modifier) the target’s\
      \ spell resistance, energy resistance, or damage reduction is reduced by her\
      \ magus class level for a number of rounds equal to her magus class level."
