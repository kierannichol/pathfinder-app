    Benefit: "The magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as an immediate action\
      \ after hitting a target with a weapon attack. All damage from that attack (including\
      \ damage from a spell cast using the spellstrike ability) is considered continuous\
      \ damage for the purposes of any concentration checks made by the target prior\
      \ to the beginning of the magusâ€™s next turn."
