    Benefit: "The magus can spend 1 point from her arcane pool as a swift action so\
      \ that her attack creates a hypnotic pattern, weaving an arcane matrix that\
      \ lulls her foe into quite a state of distraction. With his defenses down, she\
      \ can strike him more easily. She chooses a single target that she can see.\
      \ This foe must make a Will save (DC 10 + half her magus class level + her Intelligence\
      \ modifier) or the foe lose his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against her attacks\
      \ (and only her attacks) for 1d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting ability."
