    Benefit: "The magus can spend 1 point from her arcane pool as a swift action to\
      \ hammer her foe with a concussive strike that sends ripples of raw, arcane\
      \ energy through him, forcing him to tumble to the ground. In addition to dealing\
      \ normal damage with her next attack the target must make a Fortitude save (DC\
      \ 10 + half her magus class level + her Intelligence modifier) or she knocks\
      \ her opponent backward 5 feet for every two magus class levels she possesses\
      \ (minimum 5â€™) and the foe is knocked prone. If her strike misses, this use\
      \ of the ability is wasted."
