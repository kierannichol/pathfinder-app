    Benefit: "The magus can deliver ray spells that feature a ranged touch attack\
      \ as melee touch spells. He can use a ranged touch attack spell that targets\
      \ more than one creature (such as scorching ray), but he makes only one melee\
      \ touch attack to deliver one of these ranged touch effects; additional ranged\
      \ touch attacks from that spell are wasted and have no effect. These spells\
      \ can be used with the spellstrike class feature."
