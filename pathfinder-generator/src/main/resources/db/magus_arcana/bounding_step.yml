    Benefit: "The magus can expend 1 point from her arcane pool as a swift action\
      \ to move through the air. In essence, she can fly for short distances merely\
      \ by invoking the power of this ability speed for a number of rounds equal to\
      \ her magus class level. When she moves, she is considered to be flying through\
      \ the air. At the end of her movement, she lands. She can choose to take a double\
      \ move when she uses this feat, and she can move directly up, or horizontally\
      \ from the roof of one building to another, or across a castleâ€™s moat. The total\
      \ distance she moves cannot exceed her total movement allowance, but she can\
      \ go in any direction she wants. She can even jump safely down. If she is not\
      \ over a solid surface when her movement ends, she falls as normal. She may\
      \ use the run action in conjunction with this ability."
