    Benefit: "The magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a standard action\
      \ to infuse a ranged weapon with elemental power. As a free action while making\
      \ an attack roll with the infused ranged weapon, after the attack roll has been\
      \ made but before the results are revealed by the GM, the magus can release\
      \ the charge and cause his attack to deal 1d6 points of energy damage (acid,\
      \ cold, electricity, or fire, chosen when he spends the arcane pool point to\
      \ activate this ability). If he misses with this attack, the charge is lost\
      \ and the effect is wasted. If the magus has the ranged spellstrike class feature\
      \ (such as through the myrmidarch archetype), he can use this ability with ranged\
      \ spellstrike to treat it as its own ranged touch attack. At 6th level and every\
      \ 3 levels thereafter, the amount of damage dealt by this attack increases by\
      \ 1d6."
