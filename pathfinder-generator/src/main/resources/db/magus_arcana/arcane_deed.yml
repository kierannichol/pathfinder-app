  text: "Gain a swashbuckler deed. The deed must be able to be used by a swashbuckler\
    \ of your magus level. You can use that deed by spending points from your arcane\
    \ pool as the panache points required for that deed."

    Benefit: "When a magus takes this arcana, he can pick any one deed from the swashbuckler\
      \ class feature as long as that deed can be used by a swashbuckler of his magus\
      \ level. The magus can use that deed by using points from his arcane pool as\
      \ the panache points required for that deed. Even if he gains a panache pool\
      \ through another means, the magus is not considered to have at least 1 point\
      \ in his panache pool for the purpose of deeds selected with arcane deed, and\
      \ his effective swashbuckler level for determining such a deedâ€™s effect is 0."
