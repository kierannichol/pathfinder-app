  sections:
    Benefit: "Her black blade slashes out of its own accord, striking opponents who\
      \ menace her even while she cannot defend herself. If she provokes an attack\
      \ of opportunity for any reason and she or her black blade have at least 1 point\
      \ in her arcane pool while she has her black blade in hand, anyone who attacks\
      \ her immediately provokes an attack of opportunity in turn. Resolve her attack\
      \ after her opponent resolves his own attack of opportunity. Her black blade\
      \ strikes with her full base attack bonus. It receives any enhancement bonuses\
      \ it normally provides her, but it does not gain any other bonuses to its attack\
      \ or damage, such as from her Strength score, spells, or feats. The black blade\
      \ uses one of her attacks of opportunity for the round as normal."
