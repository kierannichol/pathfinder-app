    Benefit: "The magus can use all his arcana that apply to casting a spell to spells\
      \ activated from a magic staff. Additionally, any feat that increases the magus’\
      s attack rolls with a quarterstaff also increase his UMD check to activate a\
      \ magic staff, and any feat that increases the magus’s damage with a quarterstaff\
      \ also increases the damage dealt to one creature (selected by the magus) effected\
      \ by any spell activated from a magic staff."
