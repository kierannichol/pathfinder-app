    Benefit: "The magus can imbue a specific weapon with the mystic pattern of a spell\
      \ that has a range of touch. The magus must know the spell, and it cannot be\
      \ the highest level of spell the magus can cast. Imbuing this spell into a weapon\
      \ is done at the same time the magus prepares spells for the day, and cannot\
      \ be changed until the magus next prepares spells for the day."
