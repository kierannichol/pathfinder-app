  text: "Expend 1 or more arcane pool points as a swift action to empower weapon with\
    \ shadowy energy."
  sections:
    Benefit: "The magus can expend 1 or more points from his arcane pool as a swift\
      \ action to empower his weapon with shadowy energy that dissipates within 1\
      \ minute. A creature struck with the weapon must succeed at a Will save (DC\
      \ = 1/2 the magusâ€™s level + his Intelligence modifier) or treat the magus as\
      \ being in an area of dim light for 1d4 rounds, plus 1 additional round for\
      \ each arcane pool point expended. True seeing penetrates this effect, but darkvision\
      \ and similar darkness-penetrating effects do not."
