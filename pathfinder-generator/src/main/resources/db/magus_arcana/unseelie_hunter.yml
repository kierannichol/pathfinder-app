    Benefit: "Whenever the magus enhances her weapon using her arcane pool, she may\
      \ spend 1 additional point from her arcane pool to temporarily infuse that weapon\
      \ with aetherplasm, causing it to shed light. When the magus hits with the infused\
      \ weapon the target is affected as if by a faerie fire spell. At 6th level,\
      \ when the magus hits with the infused weapon, the magus can choose to spend\
      \ 1 additional point to instead effect the target as if by a glitterdust spell."
