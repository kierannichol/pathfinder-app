    Benefit: "The grim, terrible song of death’s herald foretells the doom of the\
      \ magus’s foe. The magus can spend 1 point from her arcane pool as a swift action\
      \ to select a single opponent within her line of sight that can hear his words\
      \ for 1 round per magus class level. The target need not understand the bladesong’\
      s language. The intent and meaning behind the song transcends such barriers.\
      \ Creatures with an Intelligence of 4 or less are immune to this ability. The\
      \ target of this ability must make a Will save (DC 10 + half her magus class\
      \ level + her Intelligence modifier). On a failed save, the magus’s weapon forms\
      \ a deadly link to the target. The magus sings of each of his attacks against\
      \ the target before he completes it, but she exactly predicts the result of\
      \ each stroke. Her target takes a –2 morale penalty to Armor Class on all attacks\
      \ by the magus. In addition, the magus increases her critical threat range by\
      \ one (do this before doubling the range due to the keen quality and other effects)\
      \ against her target, and she deals an additional 1d6 points of sonic damage\
      \ against the foe."
