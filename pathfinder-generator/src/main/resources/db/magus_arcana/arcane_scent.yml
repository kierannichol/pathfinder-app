    Benefit: "The magus can sniff out other spellcasters. By spending 1 point from\
      \ his arcane pool, the magus gains the scent special quality for 1 hour per\
      \ magus level. This scent can only detect creatures capable of casting spells\
      \ or using spell-like abilities. Additionally, while this effect persists, the\
      \ magus can attempt a Spellcraft check as a move action to determine the highest\
      \ level spell a detected creature is capable of casting (DC = 10 + the creatureâ€™\
      s caster level). The magus can only attempt this Spellcraft check once per creature\
      \ per 24 hours."
