    Benefit: "Choose a single metamagic feat that uses a spell slot one level higher\
      \ than the spell’s actual level, such as Enlarge Spell or Merciful Spell. The\
      \ magus can cast one spell per day as if it were modified by that metamagic\
      \ feat without preparing it ahead of time. This does not increase the casting\
      \ time or the level of the spell. A magus can take this arcana more than once,\
      \ each time selecting a different metamagic feat. The magus must meet all requirements\
      \ of the metamagic feat. At 6th level a magus that selects this arcana can choose\
      \ a single metamagic feat that uses a spell slot up to two levels higher than\
      \ the spell’s actual level, such as Persistent Spell or Sickening Spell. At\
      \ 12th level a magus that selects this arcana can choose a single metamagic\
      \ feat that uses a spell slot up to three levels higher than the spell’s actual\
      \ level, such as Widen Spell or Dazing Spell."
