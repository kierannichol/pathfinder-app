    Benefit: "The mighty song of arcane triumph allows a magus to channel the raw\
      \ energy of her magical power into her elven music. The magus can spend 1 point\
      \ from her arcane pool as a swift action to sing a litany of triumph on a single\
      \ successful hit. The opponent that his attack struck suffers 1d6 points of\
      \ sonic per magus class level (maximum 20d6) in addition to normal damage. A\
      \ Fortitude save (DC 10 + half her magus class level + her Intelligence modifier)\
      \ halves the sonic damage this effect deals. On a critical hit, double this\
      \ damage (unlike other bonus damage). Apply this extra damage even if the opponent\
      \ is immune to critical hits."
