    Benefit: "The magus may expend two points from his arcane pool to scribe a rune\
      \ of power on a 2-handed weapon with which the magus is proficient. While the\
      \ rune is in place, when the magus is holding that weapon with two hands, he\
      \ can use one of the two hands holding the weapon to complete somatic components\
      \ of magus spells he casts, and it is considered to have one hand free for purposes\
      \ of spell combat. The rune lasts 10 minutes per level."
