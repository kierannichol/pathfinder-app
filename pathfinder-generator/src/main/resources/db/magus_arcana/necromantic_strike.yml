    Benefit: "The magus can spend 1 point from her arcane pool as a swift action to\
      \ imbue his weapon with a shimmering halo of black, necromantic energy, allowing\
      \ her to disrupt her opponentâ€™s life force. This energy is also baneful to undead\
      \ creatures, allowing her to destroy them with a single, savage blow. She deals\
      \ an extra 2d6 points of damage with her next attack as the necromantic energy\
      \ weakens her living foe. In addition, her opponent must make a Fortitude save\
      \ (DC 10 + half her magus class level + her Intelligence modifier). On a failed\
      \ save, the opponent takes 1d6 points of Strength and Constitution damage. This\
      \ is a negative energy effect."
