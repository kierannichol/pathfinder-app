    Benefit: "When the magus enhances her weapon using her arcane pool, she may spend\
      \ 1 additional point from her arcane pool to duplicate the qualities of either\
      \ cold iron or silver. This infusion does not modify the weapon’s hardness,\
      \ its hit points, or its weight, but the weapon is considered to be made of\
      \ the special material for purposes of bypassing damage reduction. Only a single\
      \ metal type may be infused at one time. At 9th level, the infusion may instead\
      \ duplicate the abilities of adamantine for purposes of bypassing damage reduction,\
      \ and for bypassing hardness less than 20 when sundering weapons or attacking\
      \ objects."
