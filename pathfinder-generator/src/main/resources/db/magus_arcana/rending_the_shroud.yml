    Benefit: "Whenever the magus makes a successful melee attack, she may spend 1\
      \ point from her arcane pool as a swift action to reduce her target’s spell\
      \ resistance with no save allowed. The target’s spell resistance is reduced\
      \ by the magus’s Intelligence modifier for a number of rounds equal to ½ her\
      \ magus level. Multiple uses of rending the shroud do not lower the target’\
      s spell resistance further, but do reset the duration to ½ the magus’s level."
