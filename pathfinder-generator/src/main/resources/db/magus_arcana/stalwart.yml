  sections:
    Benefit: "A hexcrafter magus can use mental and physical resiliency to avoid certain\
      \ attacks. If she makes a Fortitude or Will saving throw against an attack that\
      \ has a reduced effect on a successful save, she instead avoids the effect entirely.\
      \ This ability can only be used if the hexcrafter magus is wearing light armor,\
      \ medium armor, or no armor. A helpless hexcrafter magus does not gain the benefit\
      \ of the stalwart ability."
