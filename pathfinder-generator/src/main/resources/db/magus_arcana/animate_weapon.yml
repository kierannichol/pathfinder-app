    Benefit: "The magus can expend 1 point from her arcane pool as a swift action\
      \ to imbue a single weapon she touches with the ability to fight on its own\
      \ for a number of rounds equal to her magus class level. The weapon deals its\
      \ standard damage, including any bonuses and abilities it gains from magical\
      \ enchantments. It strikes with a base attack bonus equal to her magus class\
      \ level + her Intelligence modifier. If the base attack bonus is high, enough\
      \ it can gain multiple attacks. The weapon never gains a flanking bonus, nor\
      \ does it provide one for another attacker, and her feats do not aid its attacks.\
      \ It acts on her initiative count. The weapon can influence at a speed of 30\
      \ feet with perfect maneuverability (using her class level + her intelligence\
      \ modifier for any influence skill checks). It must remain within 100 feet of\
      \ her. She can direct it to attack a foe as a free action when she first uses\
      \ this ability to animate the weapon, but on subsequent rounds, she must use\
      \ a move action to set it against a new foe. If its current foe is defeated,\
      \ the weapon automatically moves to attack the closest enemy. The weapon never\
      \ willingly attempts to move farther than 100 feet from the magus. The weaponâ€™\
      s Armor Class, hit points, and hardness are as normal for its size. It does\
      \ not gain attacks of opportunity, nor does it provoke them, unless an opponent\
      \ tries to grapple it. In that case, it gains an attack of opportunity against\
      \ any would-be grapplers. The weapon can only make one attack of opportunity\
      \ each round. The weapons CMB and CMD are equal to its base attack bonus and\
      \ size modified only by her Intelligence Modifier. It gains no Strength/Dexterity\
      \ bonus or penalty."
