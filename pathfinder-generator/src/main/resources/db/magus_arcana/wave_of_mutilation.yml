    Benefit: "The magus can spend 1 point from her arcane pool as a swift action transforming\
      \ a single cut of her weapon into a scything wave of energy that tears through\
      \ her enemies’ ranks. She unleashes magical force in a single sweep of her weapon\
      \ in a 30-foot cone. Roll damage for her attack as normal except the damage\
      \ type is changed to force and apply it to all targets in the cone’s area. Her\
      \ opponents can make Reflex saves (DC 10 + half her magus class level + her\
      \ Intelligence modifier) for half damage."
