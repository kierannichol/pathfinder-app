      \ checks, and she gains a bonus on Profession (herbalist) checks equal to half\
      \ her class level.\nHerb witches are adept at brewing thick herbal cure-alls\
      \ called remedies. An herb witch prepares these remedies while communing with\
      \ her familiar, during which she can prepare a number of remedies equal to 3\
      \ + her Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 remedy). A remedy becomes inert if\
      \ it leaves the herb witch's possession, reactivating as soon as it returns\
      \ to her keeping. A witch can never have more remedies than 3 + her Intelligence\
      \ modifier.\nAs a standard action, the herb witch can administer a remedy to\
      \ herself or a creature within reach which consumes the remedy. The herb witch\
      \ attempts a Profession (herbalist) check against the save DC of any one disease\
      \ or poison currently afflicting the consumer. If she is successful, the affliction\

      \ a remedy to attempt to remove the blinded, deafened, fatigued, nauseated,\

      \ check with a DC equal to the spell or effect that caused the condition, or\
      \ a DC 25 check if the condition was caused by an effect that doesn't allow\
      \ a saving throw. If the herb witch succeeds, the condition is removed unless\
      \ the condition is permanent; at 10th level, if the herb witch succeeds by 10\
      \ or more, her remedy can remove a permanent condition.\nOnly a single condition,\
      \ disease, or poison can be removed with each application of a remedy, and a\
      \ creature can only benefit from one herbal remedy each day, whether or not\
      \ the herb witch succeeds at her skill check."

      \ have a value of 50 gp plus 100 gp for every character level he has beyond\
      \ 1st. Only non-magical objects that are not alchemical items, weapons, armor,\
      \ or useful tools can be part of a wyrmwitch's hoard.\nIf the hoard falls below\
      \ this value, the wyrmwitch cannot sleep on his hoard (see below) or add new\
      \ spells to it until its value is restored.\nA wyrmwitch's spells come from\
      \ this link with his hoard, and its ability to hold spells functions in a manner\
      \ identical to the way a witch's spells are normally granted by a familiar.\n\
      A wyrmwitch can add spells to his hoard in a similar fashion to the way conventional\
      \ witches store spells in their familiars. A witch's familiar and a wyrmwitch's\
      \ hoard can exchange spells in the same way two normal witch familiars do. Also,\
      \ a witch can add a spell to his hoard from a wizard's spellbook, if the spellbook\
      \ is kept in the hoard and the spell is on the witch's class spell list. The\
      \ wyrmwitch must sleep on the spellbook in his hoard for a number of days equal\
      \ to the spell's level, after which he must succeed at a Spellcraft check (DC\
      \ = 15 + spell level) to learn the spell. No matter the result, the spell is\
      \ erased from the spellbook.\nA wyrmwitch must commune with his hoard to ready\
      \ his body and mind for casting spells. If he does not spend at least 8 hours\
      \ resting atop his hoard prior to preparing spells, he must attempt a concentration\
      \ check anytime he attempts to cast a spell (DC = 20 + the spell's level). If\
      \ the wyrmwitch does prepare spells after properly sleeping on his hoard, he\
      \ gains the ability to call on his hoard to cast any one spell it is holding\
      \ and that he is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This\
      \ spell is treated like any other spell cast by the wyrmwitch, including when\

      \ level. This spell cannot be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities."

      \ This replaces the monk class ability the qinggong monk gives up for this ki\
      \ power.\nKi powers are abilities that draw on the power of a monk's ki. The\
      \ standard monk has several abilities that count as ki powers, such as wholeness\
      \ of body, abundant step, and empty body. A qinggong monk can learn additional\
      \ ki powers, which often replaces a non-ki monk ability such as purity of body.\
      \ Ki powers are divided into three categories: feats, monk abilities, and spells.\n\
      Feats: These ki powers duplicate the effects of specific feats. A monk does\
      \ not need to qualify for a feat to select it as a ki power. For example, a\
      \ qinggong monk can select Spring Attack as a ki power even if she doesn't meet\
      \ the prerequisites for selecting Spring Attack as a feat. Activating one of\
      \ these ki powers is a free action on the monk's turn; until the start of her\
      \ next turn, the monk is treated as if she had that feat. Some of these ki powers\
      \ that duplicate feats may also be activated as an immediate action; these powers\
      \ are noted in the ki powers list. Monk Abilities: Some ki powers are standard\
      \ monk abilities. Even if a qinggong monk selects a different ki power in place\
      \ of a standard monk ability, she can select that monk ability later as one\
      \ of her ki powers. Spells: These ki powers duplicate the effects of a spell,\
      \ and are spell-like abilities. A qinggong monk's class level is the caster\
      \ level for these spell-like abilities, and she uses Wisdom to determine her\
      \ concentration check bonus.\nRequirements: All ki powers have a minimum monk\
      \ level requirement to select them. A monk who does not meet this requirement\
      \ cannot select that ki power.\nActivation: Most ki powers require the monk\
      \ to spend ki points; the exact amount is listed after the ki power. Ki powers\
      \ that cost 0 ki do not require the monk to have any ki points in her ki pool\
      \ to use the ability."

      \ infused with the essence of his plane of choice, taking on physical characteristics\
      \ of denizens native to his chosen plane as well as the abilities listed below.\n\
      Aligned Plane: If the planar scout selects a plane with an alignment trait,\
      \ he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against outsiders and creatures\
      \ with the extraplanar subtype whose alignments oppose this alignment trait.\
      \ This bonus increases by 1 at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter.\nAstral\
      \ Plane: Each day, the planar scout can teleport up to 5 feet per ranger level\
      \ as a move action. This must be used in 5-foot increments. At 10th level, he\
      \ can do so as a swift action.\nEthereal Plane: The planar scout can damage\
      \ incorporeal creatures with mundane weapons as if they were ghost touch weapons,\
      \ and at 10th level, he can inflict critical hits and deal precision damage\
      \ to incorporeal creatures.\nFey World: As a swift action a number of times\
      \ per day equal to his Wisdom modifier, a planar scout can gain fast healing\
      \ 2 for a number of rounds equal to his ranger level.\nPlane of Air: As a swift\
      \ action, the planar scout can gain a fly speed (average) equal to his base\
      \ speed for a number of minutes equal to his ranger level (minimum 1 minute).\
      \ This duration need not be used consecutively.\nPlane of Earth: The planar\
      \ scout gains a +1 bonus to his natural armor. This bonus increases by 1 for\
      \ every 4 levels he gains beyond 4th level.\nPlane of Fire: As a swift action,\
      \ the planar scout can wreathe his body in flames. This grants the planar scout\
      \ fire resistance 5 and causes his melee attacks to each deal 1d4 additional\
      \ points of fire damage. The scout's fire resistance increases to 10 at 9th\
      \ level, and 15 at 14th level. He can use this ability for a number of rounds\
      \ per day equal to his level. These rounds need not be used consecutively.\n\
      Plane of Shadow: The planar scout gains darkvision 60 feet and a +4 bonus on\
      \ Stealth checks. The bonus on Stealth checks increases by 2 at 8th level and\
      \ every 4 levels thereafter.\nPlane of Water: The planar scout gains the amphibious\
      \ subtype and a swim speed equal to base speed."

      \ trick more than once.\nThe following is a list of hunter tricks and their\

      \ against the target creature before the start of the Ranger's next turn gains\
      \ a +2 circumstance bonus on that attack roll.\nBolster Companion (Ex): The\

      \ is hit with an attack or a combat maneuver. The companion's AC and combat\
      \ maneuver defense increase by +4 for the purposes of that attack. If the attack\
      \ still hits, the animal companion only takes half damage (if any). The animal\
      \ companion must be able to see and hear the Ranger to benefit from this trick.\n\
      Catfall (Ex): The Ranger can use this trick as an immediate action when he falls\
      \ 20 or more feet, ignoring the first 20 feet of the fall when calculating the\
      \ falling damage. If the Ranger takes no damage from the fall, he does not fall\
      \ prone.\nChameleon Step (Ex): The Ranger can move up to twice his speed as\
      \ a move action. The Ranger does not take any penalty on Stealth checks for\
      \ movement during this move. This move provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.\n\
      Cunning Pantomime (Ex): As a standard action, the Ranger can communicate with\
      \ a single creature as if using the tongues spell for 10 minutes. Because the\
      \ communication is slow and lacks subtlety, the Ranger suffers a –4 penalty\
      \ on all Bluff and Diplomacy checks relating to the creature he is communicating\
      \ with when using this trick.\nDefensive Bow Stance (Ex): The Ranger can use\
      \ this trick as a swift action. Until the start of his next turn, his ranged\
      \ attacks do not provoke attacks of opportunity.\nDeft Stand (Ex): The Ranger\
      \ can spend a move action to stand up without provoking attacks of opportunity.\n\
      Distracting Attack (Ex): The Ranger can use this trick as a free action before\
      \ he makes an attack. If the attack hits, the target takes a –2 penalty on all\
      \ attack rolls for 1 round.\nHateful Attack (Ex): The Ranger can use this trick\
      \ as a free action when he makes an attack against one of his favored enemies.\
      \ The Ranger doubles the threat range of his weapon for this attack. This does\
      \ not stack with other abilities that increase a weapon's threat range.\nHeel\
      \ (Ex): The Ranger can use this trick as an immediate action when his animal\
      \ companion moves. When the companion moves, the square it starts out in is\
      \ not considered threatened by any opponent it can see, and therefore visible\
      \ enemies do not get attacks of opportunity against it when it moves from that\
      \ square. The companion must end this movement in a square adjacent to the Ranger.\
      \ The animal companion must be able to see and hear the Ranger to take this\
      \ movement.\nHobbling Attack (Ex): The Ranger can use this trick as a free action\
      \ when he hits with an attack. The target of the attack's land speed is reduced\
      \ by 1/2 for 1d4 rounds.\nQuick Climb (Ex): The Ranger can climb at his full\
      \ speed as a move action without penalty.\nQuick Healing (Ex): As a swift action,\
      \ the Ranger can make a Heal check to administer first aid on an adjacent dying\
      \ character. Alternatively, the Ranger can administer a potion to an unconscious\
      \ character as a move action.\nQuick Swim (Ex): The Ranger can swim at his full\
      \ speed as a move action without penalty.\nRanger's Counsel (Ex): As a swift\
      \ action, the Ranger can grant all allies within 30 feet that are within line\
      \ of sight and can hear him a +2 bonus on skill checks with a single skill of\
      \ his choice. The Ranger must have at least one rank in the chosen skill. This\
      \ bonus lasts for 1 round.\nRattling Strike (Ex): The Ranger can use this trick\
      \ as a free action before he makes a melee attack. If the attack hits, the target\
      \ is shaken for 1d4 rounds.\nSecond Chance Strike (Ex): When he misses with\
      \ a melee attack, the Ranger may reroll his attack at a –5 penalty. Using this\
      \ ability is an immediate action.\nSic ‘Em (Ex): The Ranger can use this trick\
      \ as a swift action. His animal companion makes one melee attack against an\
      \ adjacent creature. The animal companion must be able to see and hear the Ranger\
      \ to make this attack.\nSkill Sage (Ex): As a free action, the Ranger can roll\
      \ twice on any one skill check and take the better result. He must have at least\
      \ 1 rank in that skill to use this ability.\nStag's Leap (Ex): As a free action,\
      \ the Ranger can attempt a running jump without moving 10 feet before the jump.\n\
      Surprise Shift (Ex): The Ranger can move 5 feet as a swift action. This movement\
      \ does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count as a 5-foot step.\n\
      Tangling Attack (Ex): The Ranger can use this attack as a free action when he\
      \ makes an attack. If the attack hits, the target is entangled for 1 round.\n\
      Trick Shot (Ex): As a standard action, the Ranger can make a ranged attack that\
      \ ignores concealment (but not total concealment), soft cover, and partial cover.\n\
      Uncanny Senses (Ex): As an immediate action, the Ranger gains a +10 insight\
      \ bonus on Perception checks for 1 round.\nUpending Strike (Ex): The Ranger\
      \ can use this trick as a free action just before he makes a melee attack. If\
      \ the attack hits, he may make a free trip combat maneuver against the target.\n\
      Vengeance Strike (Ex): The Ranger can use this trick as an immediate action\
      \ when an enemy adjacent to him hits an ally with a melee or ranged attack.\
      \ The Ranger can make a single melee attack at his highest base attack bonus\
      \ against the creature who attacked his ally."

      \ but the attack roll exceeds his AC by no more than his bonus from the nimble\
      \ class feature, he can spend 1 grit point as an immediate action to take the\
      \ minimum amount of damage and move up to 10 feet directly away from the attacker.\
      \ This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.\nThe gunslinger can\
      \ perform this deed only while wearing medium or light armor and while carrying\
      \ no more than a light load.\nThis deed replaces the gunslinger's dodge deed.\n\
      Blatherskite's Initiative (Ex) At 3rd level, the blatherskite gains benefits\

      \ on initiative checks.\nFurthermore, if he is trained in Stealth (and as long\

      \ 1 grit point, he can move up to half his speed instead of taking only a 5-foot\
      \ step as part of the initiative check.\nThis deed replaces the gunslinger initiative\
      \ deed.\nCheap Shot (Ex) At 3rd level, if the blatherskite has at least 1 grit\
      \ point and makes a successful attack against an unarmed target with a firearm\
      \ that is not making a scattering shot, he deals 1d6 additional points of damage.\
      \ This is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.\nThis deed\

      \ when the blatherskite succeeds at a saving throw against a spell or an effect\
      \ that would cause him to be blinded, confused, dazed, fascinated, frightened,\
      \ nauseated, paralyzed, or stunned, he can allow the effect to affect him normally.\

      \ to AC for a number of rounds equal to half the duration of the effect (in\
      \ rounds) or half the gunslinger's level, whichever is lower (minimum 1 round).\

      \ to change the attunement of his grit pool to any alignment or element. This\
      \ new attunement remains for 1 minute, after which time the grit pool becomes\
      \ unattuned.\nThis deed replaces the dead shot deed.\nBreaching Shot (Su) At\

      \ and it is insufficiently stable to reveal details about the environment on\
      \ the other side.\nThis deed replaces the menacing shot deed.\nBanishing Shot\
      \ (Su) At 19th level, whenever a planar rifter confirms a critical hit against\
      \ an extraplanar target, he can spend 1 grit to deal normal damage, and the\
      \ target must succeed at a Will saving throw with a DC equal to 20 + the planar\

      \ types of maps. He cannot combine different map types in the same map, and\
      \ areas within range that would belong in the other categories are excluded.\n\
      Dungeon Map: While indoors, underground, or in any other type of environment\
      \ where visibility is limited by walls, the radius is 100 feet per level and\
      \ only areas that the cartographer has explored within the past 24 hours count\
      \ as studied terrain. Areas explored after drawing the map do not retroactively\
      \ become part of the studied terrain.\nOverland Map: In natural terrain, the\
      \ radius of the mapped area is equal to 1 mile per investigator level. If he\
      \ is unable to see the whole area, he extrapolates and uses his knowledge of\
      \ geography to fill in the blanks.\nTown Map: While in an urban area or ruins,\
      \ the radius is 1,000 feet per level or the entirety of the urban or ruined\
      \ area, whichever is smaller.\nMuch like alchemy, cartography requires materials,\
      \ but the cost of those materials is negligible. However, knowing an area so\
      \ well as to gain these benefits requires more than just paper and ink--a great\
      \ deal of memorization and a bit of inspiration are also required. For this\
      \ reason, a cartographer can maintain these benefits in only one area at a time.\
      \ The benefits remain in effect until the cartographer studies a new area or\
      \ refreshes his inspiration pool."

    description: "At 1st level, a hidden priest is able to disguise his cleric spellcasting,\
      \ presenting it as arcane magic of some kind. Typically, this is as alchemist,\
      \ bard, sorcerer, or wizard magic, and the cleric disguises the words and gestures\
      \ of the cleric spell with accoutrements appropriate to his apparent profession.\n\
      He must make a skill check (DC 10 + twice the level of the spell) to disguise\
      \ his casting and successfully cast the spell. The type of skill check depends\
      \ on the type of caster he pretends to be: Craft (alchemy) for alchemist, Perform\
      \ for bard, Knowledge (arcana) for sorcerer or wizard. Using Spellcraft to identify\
      \ the spell works normally, though unless the observer beats the DC by 10 or\
      \ more, she doesn't suspect the source of the magic is divine.\nFor example,\
      \ a hidden priest pretending to be an alchemist wants to cast cure light wounds\
      \ on a wounded townsperson. If he makes a DC 12 Craft (alchemy) check, he disguises\
      \ his spellcasting as the mixing of an alchemical extract or potion (perhaps\
      \ with the words disguised as reciting an obscure formula or talking herself\
      \ through the list of ingredients), which he gives to the target. An observer\
      \ making a DC 16 Spellcraft check can identify his spell as cure light wounds,\
      \ but doesn't realize his “alchemical\"methods are a sham unless her check\
      \ result is 26 or higher.\nWhen the hidden priest uses this ability, he must\
      \ still provide any divine focus components for the spells he casts. However,\
      \ the divine focus doesn't need to be an obvious symbol of his faith. It could\
      \ be a small coin, tattoo, or garment bearing the symbol, whether presented\
      \ openly, disguised, or hidden within a larger picture.\nFor example, a hidden\
      \ priest of a god of dawn or light could use a coin with an ankh or sunburst,\
      \ a complex tattoo or scar that has an ankh shape hidden within it, a glove\
      \ with an ankh stitched on the inside of the palm, and so on. He must use this\
      \ replacement divine focus just as he would his true one (for example, he couldn't\
      \ leave the coin in his shoe). If a spell requires a divine focus with a specific\
      \ or minimum cost, the replacement divine focus must be of similar value to\
      \ be used as the divine focus.\nA hidden priest adds half his class level (minimum\
      \ +1) on all Bluff skill checks to send secret messages about religious matters,\
      \ and on all Sense Motive checks to recognize similar messages. He also adds\
      \ this bonus on Perception and Sense Motive checks relating to agents of the\
      \ laws against his religion (including city guards in lands where these laws\
      \ are in effect)."

      \ archetype.\nThis ability replaces lore master.\nIncite Violence (Ex): At 6th\
      \ level, the demagogue can use his performance to fan the fury of a crowd of\
      \ people he has fascinated. Using this ability does not disrupt the fascinate\
      \ effect, but does require a standard action to activate (in addition to the\
      \ free action to continue the fascinate effect). The bard selects a number of\
      \ targets equal to his level, who must make Will saves (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's\
      \ level + the bard's Charisma modifier) or be affected by rage for a number\
      \ of rounds equal to the bard's level. The bard indicates who is the intended\
      \ target of violence (either after using this ability or as part of the performance\
      \ leading to it) and the enraged members of the crowd immediately attack the\
      \ target if possible. The target does not need to be present (“kill the king\"\
      \ is a suitable choice) and can be an object instead of a person (“destroy the\
      \ prison!\"is likewise appropriate). Other members of the crowd may follow\
      \ suit, though they do not gain the benefits of rage. This is a sound-based\
      \ effect and is affected by countersong. If two or more bards are attempting\
      \ to direct the crowd against different targets, they must make opposed Charisma\
      \ checks, with the crowd following the directions of the winner.\nThis ability\

      \ lift a crowd's emotions and turn them toward a common purpose. First, he must\
      \ fascinate the crowd, and then use incite violence without designating a target,\
      \ at which point he can use righteous cause. Instead of driving the crowd with\
      \ anger, he fills them with purpose. Fascinated creatures must make Will saves\
      \ (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma modifier) to resist. Those\
      \ who fail are affected by mass suggestion of a plausible idea that lingers\
      \ with them for one day. Typical uses of this ability are to spark rebellion,\

      \ once a creature triggers the plan. A ringleader's cunning plans all expire\
      \ each time she regains her daily spell slots or after 24 hours (whichever comes\

      \ (Su): A sandman can use performance to steal spells from his foes and add\
      \ them to his list of spells known. Once the performance is started, the bard\
      \ can steal a prepared spell or a spell known from another creature with a touch\
      \ attack as a standard action. The target receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2\
      \ the bard's level + the bard's Cha bonus) to negate the effect. The sandman\
      \ may choose a spell to steal, but if the target does not possess the spell,\
      \ the bardic performance immediately ends. Otherwise the spell stolen is random,\
      \ but it is always of the highest level that the bard can cast, if possible.\
      \ The target loses the prepared spell or spell known and the sandman adds it\
      \ to his list of spells known for as long as the performance continues, after\
      \ which it reverts to the original recipient. While stolen, the bard can cast\
      \ the spell using his available spell slots. This use does not consume the stolen\
      \ spell. If the bard steals another spell while a spell is stolen, the previous\
      \ spell immediately reverts to its original owner. This ability requires visual\
      \ components.\nThis performance replaces inspire courage.\nSlumber Song (Sp):\
      \ At 6th level, a sandman can use his performance to cause a creature he has\
      \ already fascinated to fall asleep (as deep slumber, but with no HD limit).\
      \ Otherwise, this ability functions like suggestion.\nThis performance replaces\
      \ suggestion.\nDramatic Subtext (Su): At 9th level, a sandman can use bardic\
      \ performance to cast spells without obvious visual or audible components while\
      \ retaining the spell's normal effects. Observers must succeed at a Perception\
      \ check opposed by a sandman's Sleight of Hand check to notice that the sandman\
      \ is the source of the spellcasting (though spellcasting still provokes attacks\
      \ of opportunity). The bard must use this performance for at least 2 rounds\
      \ before casting a spell; otherwise he is automatically detected and the performance\
      \ ends.\nThis ability replaces inspire greatness.\nGreater Stealspell (Su):\
      \ A sandman's stealspell power improves at 15th level. When a target fails a\
      \ save against his stealspell performance, the sandman discovers its spell resistance\
      \ (if any) and all spells it has prepared or knows. He can then choose which\
      \ spell to steal. The sandman may forgo stealing a spell and instead reduce\
      \ the target's SR by an amount equal to half his bard level and gain that amount\
      \ of spell resistance for as long as he continues performing. If he steals additional\
      \ spell resistance, it stacks with previously stolen SR. If he steals a spell\
      \ or ceases performing, the spell resistance immediately reverts back to its\
      \ owner.\nThis performance replaces inspire heroics.\nMass Slumber Song (Sp):\
      \ At 18th level, a sandman can use slumber song to affect any number of fascinated\
      \ creatures within 30 feet. Otherwise, this ability functions like mass suggestion.\n\
      This performance replaces mass suggestion.\nSpell Catching (Su): At 20th level,\
      \ a sandman who saves against a spell or spell-like ability that targets only\
      \ him (not including area spells) may use bardic performance as an immediate\
      \ action. He must attempt a caster level check (DC 10 + the spell's original\
      \ caster level). If it succeeds, the sandman can absorb the spell effect without\
      \ harm and immediately recast that spell (using the original caster's level\
      \ and save DC) or any spell he knows of that level or lower. Using this ability\
      \ consumes a number of rounds of bardic performance equal to the spell's level,\
      \ even if the check fails."

      \ to which the runic focus is aligned. As long as a runic focus remains activated,\
      \ the runesage doesn't require material components for any spell she casts from\
      \ the runic focus's aligned arcane school, provided the component's cost never\
      \ exceeds 10 gp x the runesage's caster level. If the spell requires a material\

      \ at 6th level, even if he doesn't meet the prerequisites. All followers that\
      \ the daring general gains as a result of this version of the Leadership feat\
      \ can only have levels in the warrior class. All cohorts that the daring general\
      \ gains from this ability must have levels only in classes that grant a full\
      \ base attack bonus (such as barbarian, fighter, paladin, or ranger), and must\
      \ be at least 4 levels lower than the daring general himself. However, at 12th\
      \ level and 18th level, the daring general gains an additional cohort (up to\
      \ a maximum of three cohorts at 18th level) and a number of additional followers\
      \ equal to the number of followers he gained from the Leadership feat (up to\
      \ a maximum of triple his normal number of followers at 18th level). When determining\
      \ the kinds of cohorts the daring general can attract, he treats his Leadership\
      \ score as 3 lower for each subsequent cohort (effectively taking a –3 penalty\
      \ for the second cohort and a –6 penalty for the third cohort).\nAdditionally,\
      \ the daring general can grant special roles to his cohorts, as outlined below.\n\
      Unless otherwise stated, only one cohort can fill any given role at any given\
      \ time. Designating a cohort as filling a special role requires a 24-hour ceremonial\
      \ ritual.\nGroom: The groom cares for the daring general's mount. She does not\
      \ take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding the cavalier's mount.\
      \ Additionally, once per day, the groom can spend 10 minutes preparing the daring\
      \ general's mount for battle. If she does, the mount's speed increases by 10\
      \ feet and its Dexterity score increases by 2. These benefits last for 1 hour.\
      \ Squire: The squire's main task is to care for the daring general's arms and\
      \ armor. If the squire aids the daring general in donning his armor, it takes\
      \ half as much time to don as it would if someone else aided the daring general.\
      \ Additionally, when the squire is adjacent to the daring general, as a standard\
      \ action, she can grant a +2 bonus to the daring general's AC against the first\
      \ attack made against the daring general before the squire's next turn. This\
      \ counts as an application of the aid another action, but the squire does not\
      \ need to threaten the attacker in question. Standard Bearer: The daring general's\
      \ standard bearer can carry his banner in his stead, granting the benefits of\
      \ his banner ability (and later, his greater banner ability) to all allies within\
      \ 60 feet of the standard bearer. If the standard bearer becomes unconscious\
      \ or dead, she ceases to grant these benefits.\nBeyond the rules noted above,\
      \ if the daring general uses his followers to create an army using the mass\
      \ combat rules, that army starts with one extra tactic of the daring general's\
      \ choice and a +2 bonus to its morale score.\nThe daring general can assign\
      \ each of his followers individually to serve as either footmen or honor guards\
      \ (described below). He does not need to assign either role to a given follower,\
      \ if he prefers. He can change the role of a follower at any time, but it takes\
      \ 1 day per level for the follower to change her tactics to suit her new role.\n\
      Followers with a particular role must group together with other followers with\
      \ the same role to form an army in mass combat.\nFootman: Each follower gains\
      \ a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls, but takes a –2 penalty to her AC and\
      \ on saving throws. A footman unit gains a +2 bonus to its OM and takes a –\
      2 penalty to its DV in mass combat. Honor Guard: The follower gains a +2 bonus\
      \ to her AC and on saving throws, but takes a –2 penalty on attack and damage\
      \ rolls. An honor guard unit gains a +2 bonus to its DV and takes a –2 penalty\

      \ and if not fired within a number of rounds equal to the gun chemist's Intelligence\
      \ modifier (though no sooner than the end of his next turn), the alchemical\
      \ ordnance becomes inert and loses its additional effects; he can still fire\
      \ the firearm as normal. Each day, the gun chemist can infuse a number of pieces\
      \ of alchemical ordnance equal to his class level + his Intelligence modifier,\
      \ and he can fire no more than one piece per round.\nAlchemical ordnance deals\
      \ damage as normal, plus an amount of fire damage equal to 1d6 + the gun chemist's\
      \ Intelligence modifier. The damage of the gun chemist's alchemical ordnance\
      \ increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered class level (this bonus damage\
      \ is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike).\
      \ The explosive nature of alchemical ordnance causes the attack-- both the firearm's\
      \ base damage and the alchemical ordnance's additional damage--to deal full\
      \ damage to swarms of any size. If the gun chemist uses alchemical ordnance\
      \ to make a scattering shot with a weapon with the scatter quality, each creature\
      \ in the area instead takes additional fire damage equal to the alchemical ordnance's\
      \ minimum damage (so if the alchemical ordnance would deal 2d6+4 points of fire\
      \ damage normally, it deals only 6 points of fire damage with a scattering shot).\n\
      The gun chemist's alchemical ordnance functions safely only in weapons he wields.\
      \ If anyone but a gun chemist attempts to fire a firearm loaded with alchemical\
      \ ordnance that is not yet inert, the firearm's misfire value increases by 4.\n\
      If the firearm would explode as the result of such a misfire, the explosion\
      \ deals additional fire damage equal to that of the alchemical ordnance.\nAlchemical\
      \ ordnance is treated like an alchemist's bomb for the purpose of discoveries,\
      \ though such discoveries ignore any effects associated with a bomb's splash\
      \ damage or radius unless the gun chemist also applies the exploding bullet\
      \ discovery (see below). A scattering shot modified by a discovery applies additional\
      \ effects as though affected creatures were caught in the splash damage of a\
      \ bomb rather than subject to a direct hit. The DCs of saving throws associated\
      \ with alchemical ordnance are equal to 10 + half the gun chemist's alchemist\
      \ level + the gun chemist's Intelligence modifier."
