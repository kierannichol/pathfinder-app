  description: "This spell forms an invisible bubble that filters all speech coming\

    \ 1 round can attempt a DC 15 Sense Motive check to realize that the apparent\
    \ conversation doesn't actually make any sense. The bubble also obscures the verbal\
    \ components of spells cast within the area so it's impossible to identify spells\
    \ by their verbal components alone, and anyone outside the bubble attempting a\
    \ Spellcraft check to identify a spell cast within the bubble takes a –5 penalty\

    \ it quickly melts away. If the ice is destroyed before the target teleports,\

    \ move (including taking a 5-foot step if it can do so in difficult terrain),\
    \ roll 1d8 to see which direction it moves, in a similar manner to determining\

    \ around the creature's starting square in a clockwise direction. Only the creature's\
    \ first 5 feet of movement each round are affected in this way--it can move normally\
    \ for any remaining movement, either from the same action or from later actions,\
    \ as the creature acclimatizes to the distortion. An affected creature can attempt\
    \ a new Will save each round to end the disoriented effect. A creature that leaves\

    \ it always has a size approximately equal to that of your outstretched hand.\
    \ Once created, the solid noteresists all attempts to move it but instantly disappears\
    \ if enough force or weight is brought to bear against it. The note has an effective\
    \ Strength equal to 10 + your caster level. It cannot hold more weight than the\
    \ equivalent of a heavy load for its Strength without disappearing. Any creature\
    \ that wins an opposed Strength check against the note (by pushing open a door\
    \ which the note is holding shut for example) also causes it to disappear. The\
    \ note can never deal actual harm to a creature and disappears if successfully\

    \ such as bull rush (CMD 2 + your base attack bonus + your Charisma modifier).\

  description: "This spell generates what appears to be clear, pure water, but it\

    \ in all the same ways as unholy water (see curse water). In addition, any creature\
    \ that is anointed with or drinks this fluid must attempt a Fortitude save (drinking\
    \ the waters of Lamashtu is particularly effective--a creature that drinks the\
    \ liquid takes a –4 penalty on its save to resist its effects). Success causes\
    \ the creature to become violently ill, vomit up the fluid, and become sickened\
    \ for 1d4 rounds. Failure indicates the water takes root and wreaks havoc on the\
    \ victim's mind (dealing 1d6 points of Intelligence damage) and twists and deforms\
    \ its body (dealing 1d6 points of Dexterity damage). The subject's Dexterity and\
    \ Intelligence cannot drop below 1 as a result of this effect. Casting this spell\
    \ creates approximately 2 ounces of the waters of Lamashtu--enough for one dose\
    \ or, if bottled, one use as a thrown weapon."
